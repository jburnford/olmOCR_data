At that time there were about 40 children attending school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEncl.\n\nG. C.

You will note that these receipts are dated July 13th, 1946.\n\nYou will also note that the teacher states that only the starred items have been received. Please check the other items and, if they have been ordered, it would be advisable to have the shipment traced. The teacher states that she is in urgent need of these supplies, also the textbooks ordered on the special form attached to covering Requisition No. 27057.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nENG.\n\nMr. J. W. Driscoll,\nSupt. of Stationery,\nDept. Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa, Ont.\nHazelton, B.C.\nDecember 6th, 1946\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Stationery Department receipts Nos. 547551-2 and 547464-5 for school material for Hazelton Indian Day School, all dated July 13th 1946.\n\nNos 547551-2 can be regarded as complete as the present teacher, Mrs Massy, does not require the omitted six Patsy and Pat primers. However, 547464-5 is far from complete and she has indicated on these the missing supplies, signing for those marked with an asterisk *. She also advises that none of the articles requisitioned by her in October have been received.\n\nMrs Massy is considered by us to be an outstanding teacher in this Province and she assumed a heavy burden in taking over the Hazelton school. Without the supplies it is necessary for her to copy out a vast amount of material every evening. This coupled with the fact that she has received no salary cheque since her arrival is extremely discouraging.\n\nIt is, of course, possible that the cause for delay lies with this office which is chaotic with months of work piled up gathering dirt. Mr. Boys, the Agent, left here at the end of last month to be followed by the Agency clerk almost immediately; consequently matters of this kind can only be traced through with considerable search, no office help being available so far. We are doing what we can between the hours of 9 p.m. and midnight, consequently if this is the outcome of inefficiency at this end it would be appreciated if you would do what is possible to rectify the matter.\n\nIt is for reasons above stated that the receipts are being returned to the Stationery Branch through you rather than direct.\n\n(James Coleman)\nActing Indian Agent\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate: January 6, 1947\n\nFor Hazelton Indian Day School Babine Agency\n\nNOTE:\nTo avoid delay, teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\n\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\n\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well known firm should be given for each article required.\n\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of this requisition and no entry should be made under heading \"Number Authorized\".\n\n| ARTICLES | NUMBER ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | NUMBER REQUIRED | NUMBER AUTHORIZED | REMARKS |\n|----------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|\n| (Primer) Fun with Dick and Jane | 6 | Sept 1946 | 24 | | I have no readers for my Primer class not even Jerry and Jane |\n\nN.B.\u2014Explicit information regarding address must be furnished.\n\nName: Jane Massey\nSchool: Hazelton Indian Day\nPost Office (nearest): Hazelton\nExpress Office (nearest): New Hazelton\nProvince: B.C.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that I have examined this requisition, and that the articles asked for by the teacher are necessary and are such as are in use in the Provincial Schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

If you approve of the articles requisitioned it would be appreciated if they could be forwarded to her.\n\nI also enclose Blue Delivery Slips from which it will be observed that certain text books requisitioned were not supplied. Unfortunately these slips do not indicate whether the missing supplies are to be forwarded or merely dropped from the list completely with no immediate hope of supply which makes it difficult for her to plan her work.

It was not found possible to provide funds for the erection of a new school at this point in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40. However, you might give the matter further consideration during the coming summer and let us have full particulars regarding the type of building that you consider should be erected at this point and careful consideration will be given to this matter when preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nre - Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's letters of December 27th and January 3rd last regarding the above mentioned subject with an enclosure in the former letter from the Chief Secretary of the Salvation Army and an extract from School Inspector Barry's report of October 16th last, I wish to advise you that the number of children enrolled on this school's last return is made up as follows:\n\nAnglicans 16; Salvation Army 27; Roman Catholic 4.\n\nDealing with the proposal of the Chief Secretary of the Salvation Army I do not approve of two separate schools on the one reserve - if this is his idea - one conducted by the Anglican Missionary and one conducted by the Salvation Army Missionary. However, I may say the Salvation Army has done very good work amongst the Indians of Hazelton. The above proposal would cause endless trouble, dissatisfaction and disruption amongst the Indians of the one Band. I also do not approve of the location suggested by the Chief Secretary which is on another dangerous corner of the main road where two other roads meet.\n\nHowever, as per my letter of December 16th last, file S-18-211, I am strongly in favour of a new two-room, non-denominational day school for Hazelton, built and fully controlled by the Department. One of several suitable sites on the reserve for the school, away from main roads, would be available at a small rental.\n\nAs there are no building contractors in the vicinity could you send me specifications of the building most suitable for a school? Special consideration should be taken into account for sub-zero weather during winters. Indian labour could be provided under a competent White foreman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 3, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo in connection with the Hazelton day school. In connection with this school I would refer you to official letter of the 27th ultimo which was forwarded before your letter of the 16th ultimo was received.\n\nIn the third paragraph of your letter it is noted that children of Anglican, Salvation Army and Roman Catholic parents are attending this school. A similar statement was made in Inspector Barry's report. When replying to our last letter you should state the exact number of Anglican children enrolled, also the number of Salvation Army and Roman Catholic children.\n\nAt the same time you might let us have an estimate of the cost of erecting a school on the Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nRegarding Mr. Hoey's letter of December 8th may I call the attention of the Department to School Inspector Barry's reports of May 26th, 1937, and October 13th, 1938, regarding his inspection of the Hazelton Indian Day School with particular reference to the school building at Hazelton.\n\nThere is practically no playground adjoining this building, which faces the main road on two sides, and its position is really a danger to the lives of the children who have to walk on the road to and from school and sometimes play thereon. This school is not on the Indian Reserve.\n\nThe children of this school belong to various religious denominations, namely Anglican, Salvation Army and Roman Catholic. Yet the school is conducted as an Anglican Indian School.\n\nNow that a new teacher is to be placed here next September might I suggest that consideration be given to the establishment of an improved Indian Day School - with two rooms if possible - governed entirely by the Department and the teacher, or teachers, nominated by the Department's B.C. Inspectorate, the building to be erected on the Reserve.\n\nShould the Department favourably consider this matter an appropriation could be entered in the 1939-1940 Estimates when full details could be furnished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 27, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose copy of letter dated December 20 received from the Chief Secretary of the Salvation Army also an extract from Inspector Barry's report on his inspection of the Hazelton Indian day school on October 16. Please let me have a complete report from you with regard to the request of the Salvation Army for the erection of a new school. At the same time you should comment on the information contained in Inspector Barry's report with regard to the teacher of this school.\n\nThere are no funds available in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a new school at Hazelton nor has it been possible to specifically provide any funds for this purpose in the appropriation for 1939-40.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nOttawa,\nDecember 27, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant recommending the erection of a new school at Hazelton, B.

The proposal is to erect a school on the vacant lot at the front of The Salvation Army Hall on the Reserve at Hazelton.\n\nIt is reported to us that there is a considerable number of children in Hazelton of a school age who are not provided for, and these are children of parents who belong to The Salvation Army.\n\nYou will also recall I had with me a photograph showing the land where it is proposed to erect the school, and there appears to be plenty of room for such a building.\n\nWe will appreciate it if the Department can see its way clear to accept our suggestion and have the above mentioned school building provided at as reasonable early date as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Geo. W. Peacock)\nChief Secretary\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No.\n\nVice of the BABINE Indian Agency,\n\nDecember 14th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 318,\n\namounting to $48.00 in favour\n\nof The Bishop of Caledonia, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nfor Rent of Hazelton & Kitwanga School Buildings.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. 76-08-912 dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\n\nIndian Affairs.

Such a school will in my opinion be the only satisfactory solution of the situation here. With children from Anglican, Salvation Army, and Catholic homes, the teachers of such a two Division Day School should of course not be of necessity Anglicans. In any case the practice of having the Anglican Missionary the teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School has proved most unsatisfactory except in the case of the Rev. B. Shearman some years ago.\n\nThe present school is conducted in an Anglican Hall for which we are paying rent.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H.

The Fort Babine School is the property of Daniel Leon while the latter is owned by Casimel Emil Williams. My records also indicate that as far back as 1943 rentals were being paid to Mr. Williams and continued until my arrival here in August.\n\nI cannot fully understand why these rentals were charged against education as we have had no school at Old Fort since 1939 when the Fort Babine School was opened. After 1939 the Department did not release the building and it was kept as a dispensary and a place in which the Field Matron could stay when visiting the Reserve.\n\nFor the quarters ending 30th September 1951 and 31st December 1951 I have vouchered the rentals as a charge against Indian Health Services.\n\nIn view of the fact that the unnumbered voucher dated 31st March 1951 on your file has not been paid I would recommend that it be cancelled and a new voucher will be prepared at this office and forwarded to Indian Health Services.\n\nSgd.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No.: dated July 17/45.\n\nVoucher No.: 418\n\nMarch 5th, 1946\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am forwarding herewith Mr. Indian Agent Mallinson's letters of February 15th and March 1st, together with Babine Agency Voucher No. 475 in the amount of $34.70 covering materials and labour required for repairing the fences around the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nIt has not been definitely established that the Department should be responsible for maintaining the fences in this case as an adequate rental is paid to the Anglican Church for the building but, as the school is located on a corner of the main road of the village of Hazelton where there is considerable traffic and a very limited playground for the children, the fences are very necessary and, if the Department has funds available, I would recommend payment of the account.\n\nfor D. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nThe Hazelton Indian Day School is the property of, and adjacent to, the Anglican Church. In August last, the fences around the Church were renewed and the workman repaired the fences around the School also, which were greatly in need of same. As the Church of England had not allowed for this extra work around the School Building, I am asked by the Treasurer of the local Church, Mr. M. A. Myros, if the Department would assume the cost of same, being as follows:\n\n91 pc 1 x 4 x 8 232 ft.\n5 \" 1 x 12 x 16 80 ft.\n8 \" 2 x 4 x 16 128 ft.\n\n440 ft. @ $35.00 M $13.20\n\n10 Fence posts @ 35\u00a2 3.50\nLabour 18.00\n\n$34.70\n\nYour advice in the matter will be appreciated.\n\nS. Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\nIn reply to your letter of February 19th, answering mine of February 15th, I wish to advise that the Anglican Church receive $48.00 quarterly rental for Hazelton and Kitwanga Schools. Therefore, the Hazelton School rent would be $8.00 per month.\n\nAs the fences around the school were broken down, allowing horses and cattle to get into the very small playground, it really was necessary, in my opinion, to have them repaired, and I recommend that the Department assume this cost if possible.\n\nI may say that last year the Anglican Bishop gave the Department permission to alter windows and better lighting purposes, and the Department also undertook to making a new entrance walk, which, had stock been allowed to enter the grounds through broken fences, would have broken down the new walk.\n\nS.

(RG 10, Volume 6393, File 814-5, part 2)\nMemorandum\n\nFebruary 25, 1947.\n\nto Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nfrom Inspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nRe: Proposed Hazelton Day School\n\nIn accordance with your verbal request for a memorandum on the above subject I would advise as follows:\n\nSite At least two sites are immediately available on Hazelton Indian Reserve No. 1, the first being on Lot 67 owned by the Department, part being in use for the Agency office and residence; a single building that is in need of early replacement, the size of the office being less than half our requirements and the whole structure beyond economical repair. The area of the lot is 2\u00bd acres, about half an acre being in use for the Agency house and outbuildings. There is a fair water supply, a well being located near the house. It is in need of reconstruction.\n\nAs it is apparently the intention of the Dominion Dept. of Public Works to replace their telegraph office on the Reserve with a Federal Building that would no doubt provide for our office accommodation it is unlikely that we would rebuild our present office, and in this event the Indian Agent would no doubt be left to find his own residence, renting the present building until he could do so, after which time it could be torn down, leaving the entire lot available for school purposes. An advantage of this lot is that it is on no traffic lanes and is in easy reach of the entire Indian village.\n\nThe alternative site immediately available is about five acres practically adjoining the new class room opened in the Church Army Hall on the Village, now owned by Arthur Lowatt, being a sub-bench between that on which the school referred to is located and the flat, part of which is occupied by the Town of Hazelton, the south boundary being only about 150 yards distant. Mr. D. A. Webster of our staff states there is a running spring on this parcel. It is quite level and its twelve or fifteen feet elevation over the main flat precludes any possibility of flooding. It might perhaps be considered somewhat more central than Lot 67 so far as present Indian residences are concerned. As the owner is contemplating enfranchisement he might be prepared to consider an exchange of this parcel for Lot 67 and its improvements, in which case I would consider it as a first choice as it too has no traffic lanes adjoining.\nType of Building. As there is likely to be a housing shortage for some years in this locality I would recommend that any school include suitable teacher accommodation and be well insulated as fuel is expensive.\n\nThe present school population of 76 is somewhat beyond the ordinary capacity of two class rooms and if a third is included we should be able to accommodate the nearby Hagwilget children from the Reserve five miles distant, numbering about twenty, (with thirty pre-school age) providing transportation by a school bus service, which could perhaps be economically amalgamated with that for the proposed new Whites consolidated school for Hazelton. The present Hagwilget school is the worst in the Province and this consolidation would make its replacement unnecessary.\n\nHagwilget being Roman Catholic and Hazelton mostly Anglican and Salvationists with some Roman Catholics and United Church adherents I would recommend that any new school be strictly undenominational with provision for the employment of one Catholic teacher on the staff, who could handle the short morning religious exercises of the Catholic children.\n\nIf it is considered that the consolidated school is preferable to small units I would suggest that in addition to the inclusion of Hagwilget's twenty or so children, that the approximately twenty-five at Glen Vowell, (E.A.) six miles distant, be considered in the scheme as we will have to replace their school in the very early future. This brings us within two miles of Kispiox (U.C.) which has a two roomed school of the \"home-made\" variety, apparently built on United Church Mission property with no quarters except a gloomy manse, one of the teachers being expected by the Church to run a full time mission, as is the case at Glen Vowell.\n\nSuch an arrangement would give four rooms including Glen Vowell and almost a fully graded school of five or six rooms if Kispiox were taken in. Construction costs should not be higher as the only one of the group that could carry on for a short while without replacement would be Kispiox. Such consolidation should permit economy of class room staff as it should be possible to group them in larger numbers than is possible by the present system.\n\nThree class rooms would make possible a school similar to St. Catherines at Duncan, with a much better average attendance than experienced there. It would also\nhelp, perhaps, to take the edge off the clamour of these Northern Protestants for a residential school. Three or more class rooms would unquestionably make possible a standard of education much in advance of a two room division as well as opening the way for something worthwhile in manual and domestic arts.\n\nWinter road conditions should present no difficulty as the usual snowfall is probably about the same as at Salmon Arm and ploughed out after every fall.\n\nA factor that might be considered here is making it possible for the new school to be the center for young people's activities after school hours, using the facilities for manual training, domestic science and adult education, present recreational facilities being non-existent, the young people spending their evenings in the Chinese restaurants of Hazelton with the expected sequel, this being a subject in which I have repeatedly endeavoured to interest the local missionaries, without result.\n\nI would strongly recommend that no definite decision be arrived at until the Inspector of Schools has had an opportunity of visiting the area and making his report and recommendations. I attach a sketch showing location of the schools mentioned.\n\nJ. Coleman,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nIn the instance of non-denominational day schools, religious teaching shall take place only as hereinafter provided.\n\n(a) Such religious teaching shall take place only during the last half hour of the teaching day and shall be conducted by any Christian clergyman whose charge includes any portion of the reserve or by any person duly authorized by such clergyman, or by a teacher when so authorized.\n\n(b) Where so specified in such band resolutions, religious teaching during the prescribed period may take place only on certain specified days of the week instead of on every teaching day.\n\n(c) In any Indian day school where the average attendance of Roman Catholic children is 25 or upwards, the Minister shall, if required by a petition of parents or guardians of such number of Roman Catholic children, employ at least one certified Roman Catholic teacher in such school. In any day school where the average attendance of Protestant children is 25 or upwards, the Minister shall, if required by the petition of parents or guardians of such children, employ at least one duly certified Protestant teacher.\n\n(d) Where religious teaching is required to be carried on in any school in pursuance of the foregoing provisions and there are Roman Catholic and Protestant children attending the school and the school room accommodation does not permit of the pupils being placed in separate rooms for the purpose of religious teaching, provision shall be made by the regulations of the department whereby the time allotted for religious teaching shall be divided in such a way that the religious teaching of Roman Catholic children shall be carried on during the prescribed period of one-half of the teaching days in each month, and the religious teaching of the Protestant children shall be carried on during the prescribed period of one-half of the teaching days of each month.\n\n(e) No separation of pupils by religious denominations shall take place during the secular school work.\n\n(f) Where the school room accommodation permits, instead of allotting different days of the week to different denominations for the purpose of religious teaching the pupils may be separated when the hour for religious teaching arrives and placed in separate rooms.\n\n(g) No pupils shall be permitted to be present at any religious teaching unless the parents or guardians of such pupils desire it. If the parents or guardians do not desire the attendance of pupils during such religious teaching, then such pupils shall be dismissed before the religious teaching is begun, or shall remain in another room.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe - School Construction Program - 1947-48.\nHazelton Indian Day School.\n\nFurther to my letter of February 27th, and in particular to the proposed construction of a new Indian Day School in Hazelton Indian Reserve, School Inspector Davey, during his recent visit to the Babine Agency, conducted a school survey and inspected the alternative sites available. His memorandum dated June 30th is enclosed herewith, from which it will be noted that consolidation of the Rocher Deboule Indian Day School and the Hazelton School is quite feasible, but that it would not be desirable to consolidate either the Glen Vowell or Kispiox Schools with Hazelton. The School Inspector's Survey indicates that a 3-room school will be necessary, and although it is realized that the combined enrolment of the Rocher Deboule and Hazelton Schools last year would not warrant a 3-room school, it is believed that a number of the Hazelton Reserve Indians may have moved elsewhere temporarily because of the lack of adequate school facilities at their home Reserve for some time. It is anticipated that, with the provision of an up-to-date school establishment, a number of these will return to their Reserve.\n\nWith reference to the question of a suitable site for the building, Inspector Davey favors the site at present owned by Mr. Arthur Mowatt referred to in Inspector Coleman's\nMemorandum dated February 25th, a copy of which was forwarded to you under cover of my letter above referred to.\n\nIt is recommended that Mr. Indian Agent Boys be immediately instructed to secure the necessary confirmation of Mr. Arthur Mowatt's ownership of the area, and that he be authorized to negotiate with him for acquisition of the site for school purposes.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure.\n\n-ms.\nMemorandum\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner  \nFrom: The School Inspector  \n\nDuring my recent visit to Hazelton I investigated the possibility of consolidation of several of the schools in this district.\n\nConsolidation\n\nDue to the very poor road conditions during the greater part of the school year I consider that the only school which may be combined with Hazelton is that of Hagwilget. This school is a distance of about three miles from Hazelton and situated on a main road. This road is well maintained and ploughed throughout the winter.\n\nThe schools at Kispiox and Glen Vowell were also considered but the roads to these two are such that I do not consider that the transporting of the pupils from these two points to Hazelton would be successful. The distance from Hazelton to Kispiox by road is approximately 10 miles. Glen Vowell is about half way between the two and about \u00bd mile off the road joining them. The side road was in very poor condition when I visited the Glen Vowell school at the end of May and the possibility of regular transportation on either the Kispiox or Glen Vowell roads seems unlikely.\n\nSchool Population\n\nI have attached a tabulated summary of the survey conducted by Mr. Indian Agent Boys which shows that the school population of Hazelton will reach 93 by the school term for 1948-50, but will remain fairly constant for the three succeeding years. In this Province the Provincial Department of Education provides three teachers for a school with an enrolment between 70 and 111 and using this as a standard, a three room school at Hazelton would provide for both Hazelton and the nearby Hagwilget school.\n\nIt is to be noted that although the school population for the 1946-47 term for Hazelton is shown as 76 only 55 were enrolled. At Hagwilget the school population is 20, but\nthe actual school enrolment for the same period was only 10. This is apparently due to a number of families living off the reserves. As the same condition will probably exist in the coming year it should be possible for the two teachers at Hazelton to handle the school enrolment for the 1947-48 term. This would leave the Hagwilget teacher available for employment elsewhere. In addition the school at Hagwilget is in very poor condition and this arrangement would make its replacement unnecessary. Irrespective of whether or not a new school is built at Hazelton this year it seems that the consolidation of these two schools should be carried out for the coming term.\n\nSite\n\nThere are two possible sites for the new school, descriptions of which are contained in Mr. Coleman's memo dated February 25, 1947. I favour the site at present owned by Mr. Arthur Mowatt because it is more central, unencumbered by other buildings, and is able to provide more adequate playground space.\n\nThe regulation concerning non-denominational Indian Day Schools as contained in Mr. Hoey's letter of March 3, 1947 should apply to this school as the pupils at present attending the Hazelton school are chiefly Anglican or Salvationists with some Roman Catholics, while those at Hagwilget are entirely Roman Catholic.\n\nR.F.

I note that the Department considers the price of $400.00 per acre too high.\n\nI have discussed the matter with the Indian owner of the land, Arthur Mowatt, again today, and he has agreed to offer the land at $600.00 for the parcel. He states that unless he gets this amount he will sell to somebody else. I know that this man owes the sum of $500.00 on a house he recently purchased on the Hazelton Indian Reserve No. 1, and I am inclined to think that if a firm offer of this amount were made to him he might accept.\n\nThe matter of access to this property was discussed in the second paragraph of my letter of Jan. 26th. There is a steep bench on the West side of the Lot down to the townsite level and I consider that construction of a road here is less feasible than on the East, where it would be comparatively simple to link the land with a good road on the upper level of the Reserve.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nRe: Hazelton Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of March 6th regarding proposed school construction on the Hazelton Indian Reserve, I am enclosing a memorandum dated March 23rd from District School Inspector Davey having particular reference to the size of the school.\n\nA review of the available pupilage and anticipated pupilage in the next few years indicates without doubt that a two room school will not be large enough but that the possibility of our requiring a fourth classroom is very remote. It is apparent, therefore, that what we require is a three-room school but in view of the fact that the Department has no three room school plans available and that it might take some months to secure such a plan, I concur in the School Inspector's suggestion that it would be better to construct a school somewhat too large rather than to be confronted with overcrowded conditions immediately upon completion of construction. Under the circumstances it would appear that we should plan on the construction of a four room school at the earliest possible date. I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Boys regarding the question of access to the proposed school site and the valuation placed on the area.\n\n-W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nFrom: The District School Inspector.\n\nRe: Hazelton Indian Day School\n\nI refer to Mr. Neary's letter of March 6th concerning the above mentioned school in which he makes reference to proposals for bringing the children from Moricetown to Hazelton to the proposed consolidated school. The suggestion of consolidating the Moricetown School with Hazelton did not emanate from this office. Moricetown is situated approximately 30 miles from Hazelton and is on the main road between Prince George and Prince Rupert. Although this is a principal highway and is kept clear throughout the year it is seldom in first class condition. Aside from this the distance between the two schools is too great to make any such consolidation feasible and I strongly recommend that no attempt be made to do this. The Hagwilget school is the only one which I consider practical to combine with that of Hazelton. This school is in very poor condition and its immediate replacement would be required if it were not practical to transport the pupils to Hazelton. This proposal has been thoroughly covered in my previous memo of June 30, 1947. The Moricetown school is in poor condition also and should be replaced with a two room building as soon as possible.\n\nSize of School\n\nThe ideal size for the Hazelton school is three rooms and it did not appear from my survey that there would likely be any rapid increase in the school population after 1950. It will be noted from Mr. Neary's letter that he suggests that we undertake the construction of either a two or four room school, and in spite of the above note concerning the possible increase I suggest it would be better to construct a school somewhat too large rather than have overcrowded conditions immediately upon completion of the construction. Although I do not consider it feasible to bring pupils in from Glen Vowell at present due to the road conditions it is possible that the roads may be improved within the next few years to an extent which will permit the consolidation\nof this school with Hazelton and the fourth room at the consolidated school could then be put into operation. In his letter referred to above Mr. Neary gives as his reason for leaving out the possibility of a three room construction the fact that no plans are at present available in Ottawa for such a building and that considerable delay would result if plans for a three room school were to be drawn up.\n\nI hesitate to recommend the construction of a school larger than required because of the considerable need for construction throughout B.C. and I do not wish to delay any part of this work by reason of an unnecessary expenditure at one point. However if the increased size of the Hazelton school will not effect other projects I am prepared to recommend the construction of a four room school. The plan of the St. Catherine's school would be most suitable because of the arrangement which permits the use of two rooms as an auditorium.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDistrict School Inspector.\nAIR MAIL.\n\nOttawa, March 6, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nHAZELTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nReference 1-11-3 (151) of February 3.\n\nWe have recently received a letter from Bishop Jordan with regard to the proposals advanced for bringing the children from Moricetown into Hazelton to the proposed consolidated school. In his letter he states as follows:\n\n\"Frankly, I was hoping that some other solution than that of sending them to a non-denominational school would be found by your Department. It might not be appropriate for me to go into the most serious reason for disliking such a solution, namely, the lack of Catholic environment, but it seems to me that, if an effort in this direction has not already been made, you might instruct your Agent at Hazelton to have the children sent for the rest of this year to Lejac School. If there were some way of taking care of them in Moricetown, they could be sent there as an alternative, to the day school. But I realize that it would be difficult *at present to carry out such a plan*.\"\n\nSize of School:\n\nTherefore, it would seem that a decision will now have to be reached as to whether a 2 or 4 room school would be required at Hazelton. We have plans on hand for both of these types, of schools but do not have a 3 room school plan available. It will take some months to make such a plan and before proceeding with this step, I would appreciate hearing from you as to the exact size of school which will be required.\nProposed School Site:\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Arthur Mowatt of the Hazelton Band has asked $100.00 an acre for a two acre proposed site. In view of the fact that this land will be used for a school site and for Indian Education, it is felt that this price is decidedly high.\n\nElsewhere Indians have allowed the Branch a reduced rate when they realized that the property was going to become a school site to provide better education for all the Indians on the Reserve. The Department feels that when we are providing everything for the education of these Indians, the least that can be expected of them is to provide property for a school site at a reduced rate. As you are only too well aware white property owners have done this when Provincial Schools are being built. Would you please, therefore, have Mr. Indian Agent Boys approach Mr. Mowatt with regard to the obtaining of a reduced rate for this land.\n\nI would also refer you to Inspector Davey's report of January 30, 1947 and attached map as prepared by Inspector Coleman. It would be appreciated if we could be advised as to whether there is access from the road, west of the Arthur Mowatt site into the proposed school. It is felt that the children from the bottom of the bench should be provided with access to the new school without having to go in a round about way.\n\nBernard F.

You should then make the\nnecessary arrangements with the Band and Arthur Mowatt\nfor us to secure the property.\n\nThe price of $400.00 an acre appears\nhigh and possibly you could secure the quantity of\nland that we require for school purposes at a lower\nfigure.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

It is not known what progress Mr. Nash, B.C.E.S., has made with his preliminary subdivision survey on this Reserve but if the survey is uncompleted it might be as well to have him survey this proposed school site, following which, and providing the Band is prepared to recognize Arthur Nowatt as the owner of the property, I would recommend that he be compensated at the rate of $400.00 per acre.\n\n-EN\n\nEncl.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver,\nB.C.\n\nI am enclosing a rough sketch of a piece of ground, approximately 2 acres in area on the Hazelton Indian Reserve No. 1 which would make an excellent school-site. This is the property which we looked at on your visit to Hazelton in October. It has also been viewed by Mr. School Inspector Davey who agrees that it is very well suited for the purpose.\n\nThe owner, Arthur Mowatt of the Hazelton Band will not set any definite price for the lot but suggests that it should be worth $400 per acre. I recently had the provincial assessor look this lot over and he gave it as his opinion that it was of equivalent value to the town lots on the south side of Hazelton town site. These Lots are assessed at $100 per lot and are one fifth of an acre each, but have sold at prices far in excess of that. You will recollect that this school-site is quite level and completely cleared. This matter is submitted for Departmental consideration.\n\nJ.V.

Our actual need there for the immediate present is for a three-room day school and teachers' quarters. Eventually, however, we will require a four-room school at this point as it is one of the larger centres of Indian population in the area.\n\nTherefore a careful study has been made of the four-classroom Indian Day School plans (such as was constructed at Tuscani, Nova Scotia) and we have arrived at the following suggestions:\n\n(a) That a four-classroom school be erected at Hazelton, B.C.\n\n(b) That three of these classrooms be used for normal pupil use.\n\n(c) That the fourth classroom be converted for use as a teachers' apartment. It would be necessary to provide in this apartment for two small bedrooms, a living room and a kitchen. If this were placed in one of the classrooms near the chimney, the kitchen stove could be used as in a normal residence.\n\nWe have today sent an airmail letter to Mr. Indian Commissioner Arneil with regard to these suggestions. We will advise you as soon as we hear his reaction to these recommendations. In the meantime it was felt that we should present our views to your architects so that we could be advised as to the feasibility of\nthese suggestions. It is our intention to have this school constructed under the supervision of your Branch. As it is a large school we do not feel prepared to undertake the supervision of its building.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, April 30, 1948.\n\nCopy to be sent to Boys\n\nHazelton Indian Day School\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner, B.C.\n\nReference your l-ll-3 (151) of April 9 -\n\nThe Department is willing to pay a flat price of $500.00 for this property. A copy of this letter is being sent directly to Mr. Indian Agent Boys so that he can make the necessary offer to Mr. Arthur Rowatt. It would be appreciated if we could be advised by airmail as to his reaction so that the necessary order-in-Council can be prepared.\n\nBernard F.

C.\n\nHazelton Indian Day School\n\nReference your I-11-3 (151) of March 24\n\" \" O-11-3 of April 15\n\nIt is noted that in your latest letter you recommend the construction of a four classroom school at this point. You also recommend the addition of a five-room residence for the principal. Would it not be possible to convert one of the four classrooms into a teachers' or principal's apartment? You would then have three classrooms available for teaching purposes and the fourth classroom would be used temporarily as a principal's or teachers' residence. We intended to do this at one other place and I felt that a similar solution might be presented for your problem at Hazelton. We have only $4,000.00 in our Vote for this school and it is most unlikely that we could build both the four classroom block and a principal's residence for this amount.\n\nI would appreciate having your reaction to this suggestion so that I can approach Lands and Development Services Branch with regard to the preparation of the necessary changes on the first floor plan. It is my intention to also have them undertake to advertise for the contractor for the construction of this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Indian Agent Boys' letter of May 5th attached, regarding the proposed school site on Hazelton Indian Reserve No. 1, in my letters of February 3rd I suggested that Mr. Fred Nash, B.C.L.S., might survey this site during the course of his preliminary subdivision survey on the Reserve. If this was done and despite the fact that it is problematical whether we shall construct a school at Hazelton or provide educational facilities in co-operation with the Province it would, I believe, be advisable for Mr. Boys to secure a surrender of the school site which need not be submitted to Council for acceptance unless required. If survey of the school site was not made it is considered that Mr. Boys should secure from a majority of the voting members of the Band at the meeting to be held on May 20th, confirmation of Arthur Mowatt's ownership of the property and a resolution agreeing to surrender.\n\nW. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver,\nB.C.\n\nFurther in the matter of Surrender of a site for the Hazelton Indian Day School about which I wrote on April 5th, I wish to advise that a meeting of the Band has been called for May 20th to receive the Surrender of a portion of the Hazelton Indian Reserve. I earnestly hope that it may be possible to accept a surrender of this parcel of land for the school site at the same time and I would ask that every effort be made to have the surrender documents on hand at Hazelton by that time because it will be impossible to call another meeting until the Fall. This would mean that probably another year would go by without providing a new school for Hazelton.\n\nJ.W. Boys,\nIndian Agent\n\nJWB/1110\nHAZELTON\n\nConstruction at Hazelton was the subject of correspondence with you, reference my letter of March 24th, at which time I recommended construction of a four-classroom school for the reason that it would be better to construct a school somewhat too large than to be confronted with overcrowded conditions immediately upon completion of construction.\n\nWe will, in addition to the four classrooms at this point, require accommodation for teachers as it is doubtful if we can count on securing accommodation for them in the adjoining town of Hazelton. I do not feel, however, that the Department should proceed immediately to construct teacherages for three or four teachers, one or more of whom might be married. I feel it would be preferable this year to construct a five-room residence for the Principal and in the event that the Principal is unmarried the other teachers might be accommodated in the same building. Prefabricated Structures have a five-room home, plans of which are attached hereto, which would be most suitable.\n\nI would recommend that the Department call for tenders covering the construction of a four-room school with manual training room and domestic science room in the basement and that authority be secured for the purchase and erection of a five-room prefabricated house to accommodate the teachers.\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nI have received your personal and confidential letter of May 1st (file 1-1-5 E) relative to the Hazelton Indian Day School and have carefully noted your remarks relative to the desired co-operation between the Provincial Department of Education and our own Education Division.\n\nInspector Davey is on a somewhat extended inspection tour covering the Queen Charlotte and Skeena River agencies and is at present in the Naas River area. He will return to Vancouver towards the end of May. Immediately on his return arrangements will be made to have Mr. Davey visit the appropriate officials in Victoria and to fully carry out the suggestions contained in your letter. A report will be submitted in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. E. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMay 1, 1948.\n\nHazelton Indian Day School\n\nDear Mr. Arneil:\n\nReference your 1-11-3 of April 9, 1948,\n0-11-3 \" 15, 1948.\n\nYou will recall the letter forwarded to you recently with regard to co-operation with provincial Departments of Education insofar as it concerned the future educational plans for Indian children.\n\nA study of Inspector Davey's reports and the late Inspector Coleman's survey (February 25, 1947) indicates clearly that Hazelton is one of the places at which we could cooperate with local educational authorities. It would seem obvious that, if arrangements can be made for these Indian children to attend the new white school, this arrangement would certainly be better than constructing our own Indian school just across the road from their new school. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you could discuss this matter with Inspector Davey and have him visit educational officials in Victoria to ascertain if they are interested in such a proposal. The Parliamentary Committee feels that we should be generous in making these agreements and there is a possibility that we might even be able to get authority for a partial payment of capital cost. This latter point is a difficult thing to discuss with provincial authorities as we are not sure whether we have the necessary constitutional authority under the old Indian Act. However, Inspector Davey could discuss with provincial educational officials:\n\n(a) their reaction to the operation of such a school,\n\n(b) their ideas as to how the school could best be financed.\n\n....... It\nIt must be emphasized that we would not wish to have any control over the administration of the school, the hiring of the teachers, etc. We would be quite prepared to leave this in the hands of the local authorities and would pay them on a pro rata basis for the education of the Indian children of Hazelton.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I think the possibility of the proposal not materializing is very remote; in any case the request of the School Board is not unreasonable.\n\nMay I please have an indication by Army Signals as to whether or not it would be in order for me to give the Secretary-Treasurer the assurance required. Inquiries are being made as to whether or not the School Board can accept a firm figure as our share of the erection cost of the School.\n\nFor your information I might mention that we are still awaiting word from the Provincial Department of Public Works as to whether or not the sub-division plan will be accepted by them without development of the roads.

Alger, Esq.,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nTerrace School District No. 53,\nTerrace, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Alger:\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 30th to Mr. J.V. Boys, regarding the proposed combined white and Indian school at Hazelton, we have been awaiting word from our Department in Ottawa with regard to payment of our share of the cost of plans and specifications, should the proposal not materialize and I have today again written asking that they expedite such assurance.\n\nWith regard to our contributing towards the capital cost of the building, a memorandum was submitted by the Director of Indian Affairs to the Minister of our Department, on November 16th, 1948, outlining the proposal and suggesting as the basis of a contract the provision of funds by the Indian Affairs Branch in proportion to the number of Indian children in attendance. This proposal was approved by the Minister and you may rest assured that as soon as you are in a position to proceed with the construction, this Department's share of the cost will be made available.\n\nWith regard to the actual amount which we will be required to contribute, we have been requested to ascertain if it would be possible at this time to definitely settle on a firm amount. Our reason for endeavouring to establish a firm figure is that we must secure an Order in Council authorizing payment of the amount and you will appreciate that an Order in Council naming a specific amount is much more satisfactory than one which states \"nine-sixteenths of...\"\nan estimated amount of $95,000.00\" or some similar wording. In other words, can you now or later definitely fix an amount which will be acceptable to you as our contribution on a nine-sixteenths basis?\n\nFor your information I might mention that we are presently in communication with the Provincial Department of Public Works with regard to registration of our sub-division plan of the Hazelton Reserve which is a necessary preliminary to disposition of the school site, and we are hopeful that the Province will waive their requirements with regard to the development of roads within the sub-division prior to registration, as the development of the roads in this case is the principle reason for the delay at this time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines Resources,\nOttawa\n\nRe: Hazelton School\nYour file 814-5 (E)\n\nAttached is a self-explanatory letter from the Secretary-Treasurer of the Terrace School District No. 33. It will be noted that the School District is asking that some concrete evidence be given that our Department is prepared to bear its share of the capital cost of the construction of the joint school. I shall appreciate the Department giving this assurance as requested by the Terrace School Board.\n\nIt will be noted that the contract for the construction of this building has not as yet been let and it is impossible to give any definite figure as to the actual cost until this has been done. This office feels that it would be unwise to enter into an agreement with the School Board until the cost of the new school is definitely known.\n\nIt will be noted from the third paragraph of the letter from the Secretary-Treasurer that the Board is requesting assurance that should construction on the basis of joint operation of the school fall through the Department will assume a share of the cost of the preparation of plans and specifications. This request seems to be quite reasonable and it is felt that the Department should give this assurance.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs you are aware, an understanding exists between the Indian Department at Hazelton and the School Board of district No.53 that an arrangement will be entered into whereby the White and Indian schools at Hazelton will amalgamate and the financial end of the matter will be met by a student per capita ratio both to the cost of construction of the new school and the maintenance of it afterward.\n\nBut our Board have no word to that effect except of a verbal nature, and while we are not in doubt of the matter meeting a fulfillment yet when the Department of Education asks us how we are going to raise the difference between the amount of money allowed for a school at Hazelton in our by-law, which is an odd $45,000.00 we have no concrete evidence that we have any way of raising the money. We need a statement which will show at least that we have the assurance of the funds.\n\nAnother thing that is necessary too is some evidence that should this whole thing fall through and not be carried out for some unforeseen reason, that we will be compensated at least in part for the cost of getting out preliminary sketch plans for a six room school (plans now approved and ready for completion) instead of going ahead with our former idea of a three room school, plans and specifications of which are completed and now in our hands at a cost of about $800.00 and if not used will have to be abandoned.\n\nSome concrete statement from your Department should be in our hands before we proceed further with these plans.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEncl:\n\nBFN/HM\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nRe: Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nReference is made to your note drawing to our attention Commissioner Arnell's letter of April 28th with reference to the new school planned for Hazelton, B.C.\n\nQuite frankly, the Hazelton subdivision question has developed into a headache as far as this Service is concerned, for we have encountered one problem after another, the latest being that under Provincial regulations we must construct and gravel every street, lane and road in the subdivision before we can register our plan and proceed with the sale of the subdivision lots. As we had provided generously in our plan for streets and lanes and even exterior streets to allow for further expansion of the subdivision, the cost of building all these streets would be considerable, and we have no funds which could be used for this purpose nor have we any hope that the individual Indians who will benefit from the sale of the subdivision of their holdings would be prepared to pay the cost of opening the streets.\n\nThe School Board originally applied for a piece of ground which was surveyed as Block 10 in the proposed subdivision, but have since changed their mind and now wish to double the size of their property by acquiring Block 11 as well. As a street separated these Blocks,\nand as the School Board wish to combine the said Blocks, it is necessary to eliminate the street from our plan, and while this may seem a minor point, actually it may involve sending the surveyor back to Hazelton to do re-survey work, for under the Provincial Survey Regulations, it is extremely doubtful that we would be permitted to delete the road from the plan without performing additional survey work. This difficulty is presently being taken up by the Surveyor General with Mr. Nash who performed the survey on our behalf.\n\nAs to the general problem of opening streets, we sent a lengthy letter to Superintendent Boys on May 5th, copy of which was forwarded to Mr. Arnell, outlining the general difficulties and suggesting two possible ways out of our trouble. The first was to approach the Town of Hazelton and ascertain whether the Town authorities would be prepared to undertake the opening and graveling of the necessary streets. What their answer will be cannot tell, but our request is not unreasonable in that the entire subdivision scheme came into being through the desire of the Town to secure additional land for expansion. If the Town authorities are not prepared to open the streets at their expense, then we will have no alternative but to cut down our subdivision to a small portion of the area subdivided by Mr. Nash. The cut down area will include the school site and probably one row of lots lying between the proposed school site and the Town boundary, but if this solution is the one decided on, there will again be some delay in that Mr. Nash will have to prepare a complete new plan for registration purposes.\n\nIt is regretted that the School Board is being held up in this matter, but for the foregoing reasons we certainly cannot proceed with any sale to the Board at this time nor can we advise when we will be in a position to do so. It can be taken for granted that we are as anxious as the Board to conclude the sale, and will do our utmost to iron out our difficulties at the earliest possible date.\n\nD. J.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., P. O. Box 70, VANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nI have received requests for furniture for the primary rooms at both Hazelton and Kispiox Schools.\n\nThe enrolment in Mrs. Dodding's primary room, Hazelton, is now 33; she feels that she could handle the beginners much more easily at tables and chairs. So too does Mrs. Evans at Kispiox, who has approximately 26 children.\n\nIt is true that Hazelton school will probably not be in operation after this year, but this furniture, if bought now, can be passed along to either Moricetown or Fort Babine where our building programme contemplates construction of a two-room school in the near future.\n\nWoodbilt Products in Prince Rupert quote me $28.00 for a primary table accommodating six children; two such tables with twelve chairs at $2.80 each would be required at Hazelton and Kispiox. I would ask therefore that a Purchase Order in favour of this firm be issued for the following:\n\n| Item          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|---------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| Primary tables| 2        | $28.00     | $112.00 |\n| Primary chairs| 24       | $2.80      | $67.20  |\n\n$179.20\n\nThis firm informs us that they are commencing construction of an order for the Skeena River Agency next week and could promise us much earlier delivery if they could put our order in at the same time. Will you therefore kindly forward Purchase Order to this firm with the least possible delay.\n\nJ. W. BOYS\nIndian Superintendent\nAIR MAIL\n\nNovember 25th, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Hazelton Indian Day School\nKispiox Indian Day School\n\nReference your l-ll-4 (151) of November 13.\n\nThe Department approves an expenditure of approximately $180.00 for the purchase of primary tables and chairs for the above mentioned schools.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa\n\nRe: Hazelton School\n\nA.M. The attached draft agreement contains four alterations suggested at a meeting held in this office between Inspector Davey and Mr. H.C. Ferguson, Provincial Inspector of Schools. These alterations are contained in additional clauses numbered 4, 9 and 10 and in the re-wording of the cessation clause now numbered 8 which has been retained on the insistence of the Provincial authorities. The new clause 4 is primarily designed to guard against the segregation of Indian children. The lengthening of the period of termination notice was considered necessary and amended in clause 8. Clause 9 was inserted to protect the financial contribution of each party. Clause 10 has been inserted to guard against either party lightly terminating the agreement. For example, it would be undesirable to have the Board terminate the agreement because it wished to use the accommodation for a sudden influx of white pupils, rather than construct additional accommodation.\n\nAlso enclosed is a copy of Mr. Ferguson's letter to the Deputy Minister of Education. This letter was written following the first conference with Mr. Ferguson. Subsequent to this meeting Inspector Ferguson again called at this office at which time clause 10 was added.\n\nThe agreement is being presented to School District No. 53 (Terrace) and the Provincial Department of Education so that they may consider the intent of the alterations before having the agreement written in legal form. It would\nbe helpful if the Department would express its views on the alterations so that the School Board may have assurance that the intent of the agreement is acceptable before passing it to a lawyer for final wording.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nencls.\nDecember 14, 1949.\n\nDr. F.T. Fahey,\nDeputy Minister and\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Education,\nParliament Buildings,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Dr. Fahey:\n\nI have today contacted Inspector Davey of the Indian Affairs Branch in Vancouver with respect to the agreement between School District No. 53 (Terrace) and the Department of Mines & Resources. It was hoped that I would have an opportunity of seeing Mr. Arnell. However, he is out of town but I shall probably be able to contact him in Prince Rupert.\n\nThe Agreement has been altered in three respects:\nA new clause 4 has been added in accordance with the wish expressed to the Department in a letter by Mr. Arnell. The reason for including this clause is to prevent the segregation of white and Native children in the proposed amalgamated school. I believe there is much merit in this particular clause, as a segregation of the children would possibly defeat the purpose of the amalgamation. Clause 7 in the original agreement now becomes clause 8 in the revised copy. It was felt that a longer period of termination of notice should be given and consequently a two year period has been incorporated. Clause 9 is a new clause suggested by Inspector Davey and agreed to by myself. It is not very likely that this clause will ever be used. However, it is felt that both contracting parties should have their investment safeguarded.\n\nI shall take up the contents of this Agreement with the Terrace School Board at the earliest possible date. In the meantime I am sure that they would be pleased to hear of any suggestions which may be offered through the Department. When\nthe Terrace School Board has given sanction to this Agreement it will be passed into the hands of a lawyer for purposes of drafting it in legal form. A copy of the final draft will be submitted to the Department, as well as the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nAs it is urgent that the Terrace Board get an early start on the construction of this proposed school I shall give this my immediate attention when I return to the Comincoa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.C. Ferguson,\nInspector of Schools\nAGREEMENT made this Fifteenth Day of September, A.D., 1949\n\nBETWEEN\n\nHIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE THE SIXTH\nin right of Canada, represented herein\nby the Minister of Mines and Resources,\nhereinafter called the \"Minister\"\n\n-and-\n\nTHE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 53 (TERRACE)\nin the Province of British Columbia,\nhereinafter called the \"School District\nNo. 53 (Terrace)\"\n\nWHEREAS the Minister is obliged under the present circum-\nstances to build adequate school accommodation for the Indian children\nof the Hazelton Indian Reserve;\n\nAND WHEREAS the School District No. 53 (Terrace) are\npreparing to build adequate school accommodation for the White\nchildren of Hazelton;\n\nAND WHEREAS surveys made by the Minister and the School\nDistrict No. 53 (Terrace) would indicate the desirability of\namalgamating these two racial groups;\n\nAND WHEREAS the ratepayers in the Hazelton attendance area\nof School District No. 53 (Terrace) have approved by an affirmative\nvote such an amalgamation;\n\nAND WHEREAS the amalgamation of these two racial groups\nwould work for the benefit of both in making possible the provision\nof better facilities, staff and school accommodation;\n\nAND WHEREAS the financial assistance agreed upon in the\nterms herein mentioned is considered fair and reasonable;\n\nAND WHEREAS surveys indicate that the ratio of attendance\nwould be nine Indian children to seven White children;\n\nAND WHEREAS the School District No. 53 (Terrace) estimates\nthe cost of this structure will be approximately One Hundred and\nThirty Thousand Dollars ($130,000.00) including full furnishings;\n\nAND WHEREAS the Minister would be asked to provide nine-\nsixteenth of this amount, or an amount of Seventy-three Thousand\nDollars ($73,000.00) leaving an amount of Fifty-seven Thousand\nDollars ($57,000.00) to be provided by the School District No. 53\n(Terrace).\nAND WHEREAS the Department of Education will provide an amount of Twenty-eight Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($28,500.00);\n\nAND WHEREAS the School District No. 53 (Terrace) will provide an amount of Twenty-eight Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($28,500.00);\n\nNOW THIS AGREEMENT Witnesseth that the parties hereto mutually covenant and agree as follows:\n\n1.

The Minister shall pay the School District No. 53 (Terrace) tuition fees for the Indian children in attendance, in accordance with the provisions of Section 133 \"Public Schools Act\" of the Province of British Columbia.\n\n4. The School District No. 53 (Terrace) shall accept for enrolment in the Hazelton School children of Indian status who would normally attend the Hazelton Indian School, and shall provide the same educational opportunities to them during the period of their attendance at the School as are provided to white children.\n\n5. The School District No. 53 (Terrace) shall render each quarter to the Minister a statement of the tuition fees to be paid; this statement shall be in the form as prescribed by section 133, \"Public Schools Act\" of the Province of British Columbia.\n\n6. It is understood and agreed upon between the parties hereto that neither the execution of this agreement, nor anything contained herein, nor the expenditure of any funds hereunder by His Majesty in right of Canada shall be deemed to confer upon the Minister or any officer or Department of the Government of Canada any right of supervision or control over any school or educational institution.\noperated by the School District No. 58 (Terrace), with respect to which any funds are expended under this agreement, nor any supervision or control over the administrative or teaching personnel or the curriculum or the methods of instruction or the materials of instruction of any such school or educational institution.\n\n7. The Minister shall endeavor to maintain a standard of health, cleanliness and clothing among these Indian pupils such as would be comparable to that of White children attending the school.\n\n8. Either party may effect termination or cessation of this agreement on the Thirtieth day of June in any year by giving to the other party notice in writing by registered letter of intention to effect such termination or cessation; such notice to be good and to take effect as aforesaid only if received on or before the First day of September two years preceding the 30th day of June aforesaid.\n\n9. When notice has been given of termination or cessation of this agreement then the party taking such action shall have the capital investment in the combined project competently assessed as of the date of notice of intention to terminate or cease this agreement by an assessor or assessors acceptable to the second party. The assessed value of the capital investment at that time shall be shared by the contracting parties in the same ratio as the original agreement. The party terminating or ceasing the contract shall pay to the second party his share of the capital investment as aforesaid determined within three months of the termination or cessation of this contract.\n\n10. Clauses 8 and 9 will be invoked only after a five man Board shall have passed and agreed upon the sufficiency of the reason or reasons for taking terminatory cessation action. Such a Board shall be composed of:\n\n(1) A representative of the Provincial Department of Education (B.C.)\n(Continued)\n\n(3) A representative of the Board of School Trustees, District No. 55 (Terrace).\n\n(4) A representative of the Department of Mines and Resources, (Indian Affairs Branch)\n\n(5) The Superintendent of the Indian Agency from which a majority of Native children are drawn.\n\n(6) A disinterested member acceptable to both contracting parties.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have hereunto set their hand this day of 1949\n\nSigned, sealed and delivered in the presence of\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources\n\nas to the signature of the Minister of Mines and Resources\n\nSchool District No. 55 (Terrace)\n\nas to the signature of School District No. 55 (Terrace)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Mackay,\n\nRe - South Indian Lake Joint School.\n\nAttached hereto please find your memorandum of the 15th instant to the Deputy Minister, together with your memorandum of the 3rd item and attached copies of agreement. This agreement has been discussed with Mr. Jackson and has been revised in accordance with his observations - see sections 4, 7 and 8. It is suggested that this redraft be submitted to the Province for its approval and execution.\n\nLegal Adviser.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Henry,\n\nRe - Hazelton School.\n\nThe proposed agreement with the Province regarding the South Indian Lake Joint School has been redrafted and submitted to Mr. Mackay under cover of my memorandum of today's date; a copy of this memorandum is herewith for your information.\n\nAt the time this agreement was discussed the draft agreement between the Crown (Dom) and School District No. 53 (Terrace) in the Province of British Columbia, was also considered by Mr. Jackson and found unobjectionable as the points that he raised with regard to the South Indian Lake Agreement are covered in the draft agreement submitted by the British Columbia authorities. It would therefore appear to be in order to advise the School Board accordingly so that the agreement in question may be placed before the School Board Solicitors for final drafting. There has been added to this agreement a proviso to subsection (6) similar to the proviso in the South Indian Lake Joint School agreement.\n\nLegal Adviser.\n16 January, 1950.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.

Our Departmental Solicitor has checked this agreement and other officials at the Minister's office have agreed that it will be quite satisfactory.\n\nWe are particularly pleased with clauses 8, 9 and 10 and feel that these should deal with any contingency in a satisfactory manner.\n\nThe only change which has been made in the insertion of a proviso in clause No. 6. This is to permit the Indian Superintendent to visit the school and check with the Principal on such matters as cleanliness, attendance, punctuality and payment of family allowances, etc., to Indian children attending the school.\n\nI am sending this draft agreement to you in triplicate so that you may forward it to the Deputy Minister of Education for his necessary concurrence and forwarding to the Terrace School Board.\n\nAs you are aware by now, we are providing a sum for the erection of this school in our Estimates and an Order-in-Council will be obtained when the agreement is forwarded here.\n\nBernard F.

S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons, appointed to continue and complete the examination and consideration of the Indian Act, made the following recommendation, as recorded in the Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence, Vol. 5, April 13, to and including June 21, 1950, concerning the operation of Indian Schools:\n\n\"Your Committee recommends the revision of those sections of the Act which pertain to education, in order to prepare Indian children to take their place as citizens,\n\n\"Your Committee, therefore recommends that wherever and whenever possible Indian children should be educated in association with other children\".\n\nTHAT the Indian children of the Hazelton Indian Reserve live directly adjacent to the Village of Hazelton, British Columbia;\n\nTHAT both the local school and our Indian school were in need of immediate replacement;\n\nTHAT, in accordance with the recommendation of the Parliamentary Committee as mentioned above, negotiations have been carried out for the education of Indian children in association with white children in a proposed new joint school to be operated by the Terrace School District;\n\nTHAT the cost of this structure will be approximately $130,000.00 including full furnishings;\n\nTHAT an educational survey was carried out by the Provincial School Inspector and by our District Inspector of Indian Schools, which revealed that of 160 expected pupils, 70 would be white children and 90 would be Indian children;\n\nTHAT, in view of this fact, a grant of nine sixteenths (9/16) of $130,000.00 or an amount of $75,000.00 would be a fair and reasonable contribution and considerably less than would be required to build our own school;\nTHAT funds are available for this purpose in the Indian Education Vote of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, 1950-51 Main Estimates;\n\nTHAT the Terrace School District No. 53 is prepared to enter into an Agreement for the education of the Indian children at Hazelton, British Columbia;\n\nTHAT, as provided in a recent amendment to the \"Public Schools Act\" of the Province of British Columbia, the Council of Public Instruction of that Province is prepared to authorize the Terrace School District No. 53 to enter into such an Agreement.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that authority be given for a grant to be made to the Terrace School District No. 53 of the Province of British Columbia in the amount of Seventy-three Thousand Dollars ($73,000.00) for the purpose of providing a six-room joint school at Hazelton, British Columbia, for the education of Indian children.\n\nThe undersigned further recommends that approval be given to an Agreement to be entered into with the Terrace School District No. 53 for the education of Indian children at Hazelton, British Columbia.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration.\nOttawa, June 12, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nHazelton Joint School\n\nIncluded in our Main 1950-51 Estimates is a sum for the provision of joint school facilities at Hazelton, British Columbia. Under approval received from our former Minister, we have been negotiating with the Terrace School District No. 53 with regard to this project. All the Indian children concerned are of the Protestant faith and live on a reserve directly adjacent to the white village of Hazelton. The Catholic children live on the Tsitsik Indian Reserve a few miles away and we intend to provide a new one-room school for them this year.\n\nAt Hazelton, therefore, we have an ideal situation for joint education and an agreement was drawn up some months ago. Mr. Cory, the Departmental Solicitor, has already checked this proposed agreement and his re-draft was submitted to the Terrace School District. We have now received the signed document from the School District and have prepared the necessary Submission to Council for the Minister's signature. It has been further suggested that we make progress payments on this project, based on the amounts due to the contractor in relation to a percentage of the completed cost of the structure at various stages, as is ordinarily provided for in construction contracts.\n\nI would therefore recommend the following action:\n\n(1) Approval of the prepared Submission to Council,\n\n(2) Approval by the Minister of the attached Agreement after the passing of the Order-in-Council.\n\n(3) Approval by the Minister of progress payments to the Terrace School District as the project advances.\n\nEncl.\n\nDirector.\nAGREEMENT\n\nAGREEMENT made this 29th day of June, 1950\n\nPARTIES\n\nHIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE THE SIXTH\nin right of Canada, represented herein by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,\nhereinafter called the \"Minister\"\n\nAND\n\nTHE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 53 (Terrace)\nin the Province of British Columbia,\nhereinafter called the \"School District No. 53 (Terrace)\"\n\nWHEREAS the Minister is obliged under the present circumstances to build adequate school accommodation for the Indian children of the Ranch on Indian Reserve;\n\nAND WHEREAS the School District No. 53 (Terrace) are preparing to build adequate school accommodation for the White children of Hazelton;\n\nAND WHEREAS surveys made by the Minister and the School District No. 53 (Terrace) would indicate the desirability of amalgamating these two school groups;\n\nAND WHEREAS the residents in the Hazelton attendance area of School District No. 53 (Terrace) have approved by an affirmative vote such an amalgamation;\n\nAND WHEREAS the amalgamation of these two school groups would work for the benefit of both in making possible the provision of better facilities, staff and school accommodation;\n\nAND WHEREAS the Minister has agreed upon in the terms hereinafter contained to consider the said amalgamation;\n\nAND WHEREAS surveys indicate that the ratio of attendance would be nine Indian children to seven White children;\n\nAND WHEREAS the School District No. 53 (Terrace) estimates the cost of this amalgamation will be approximately One Hundred and Thirty Thousand Dollars ($130,000.00) including all furnishings;\n\nAND WHEREAS the Minister would be asked to provide nine-fifteenth of this amount, or an amount of Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00) leaving an amount of Fifty-seven Thousand Dollars ($57,000.00) to be provided by the School District No. 53 (Terrace).\n\nIndian Affairs.

Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nAugust 30, 1933.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my report on the Hazelton Indian Day School, Babine Agency, which I inspected on May 25th 1933.\n\nThe report will speak for itself, and I certainly very much regret that the children at this school should have been deprived of a year's work through the complete lack of teaching ability on the part of the missionary teacher in Hazelton.\n\nThe Rev. Mr Bannister has resigned, and is leaving the country. He did his best at Hazelton; but he was so poorly qualified that his life in the school appears to have been one of considerable disappointment and worry during the year. His wife's illness did not help matters.\n\nMay I draw your attention to the correspondence with regard to Mr. Bannister's appointment, and to the fact that the Department approved of his appointment in face of my telegraphed protest. The appointment of untrained teachers in our Indian Schools can lead to nothing but disappointment on the part of the teacher, and complete failure on the part of the Indian children, for whose education we are responsible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 814-6, part 1)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nHAZELTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\n(Babine Agency.)\n\nDate of Inspection May 25, 1933.\n\nNumber of Pupils present:\nBoys 8\nGirls 11\n\nNumber of Classrooms and number of desks in each: One; with 42 Single Desks.\n\nTHE TEACHER\n\nName Rev. L. F. Bannister Age 37\n\nSalary $850.00 per annum less 10% with $70.00 per annum less 10% for monitor work.\n\nQualifications L.Th. Saskatchewan University. Experience of a little substitute teaching work in the Prairie Provinces. Was overseas during the Great War with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force as chaplain. This is stated to be \"excellent\".\n\nHealth I understand that Mrs. Bannister has contracted T.B. and has been forced to leave Hazelton to obtain treatment at Tranquille.\n\nSuccess The juniors do not appear to have made much progress this year. The teacher has found some difficulty in control of the children. This is due to his lack of any training or qualification for the teaching of Indians. The appointment was sanctioned by the Department of Indian Affairs in opposition to my strong recommendation that only a trained teacher be appointed at Hazelton. The appointment of this local Anglican Minister to a position he so obviously could not fill has resulted in very poor progress during the past year, and the resignation of the teacher, who is giving up the school and the parish and is leaving for England.\n\nNo progress can be looked for till a well qualified teacher trained in a Normal School and holding extra certificates in Provincial Summer School is appointed here.\n\nI understand that approval has now been given for the appointment of a man from Kentville, Nova Scotia, who holds qualifications I have no knowledge. It is certainly to be regretted that one of our specially trained Anglican teachers has not been appointed.\n\nArithmetic Grade 1B are learning to read and write numbers to 10, and to recognize Groups to 10. Grade 1A are very slow in working the Combinations and Separations up to 20. Grades 2 are very poor in the working of the Extensions. The teacher did not of course understand the teaching of these, the children being permitted to go on with other more advanced work too soon. The result of the testing of these Grades with the B.C. Arithmetic Test was as follows:\n\nGrade 2 made a Mid Score of 23 the Norm for Grade 3.0\nGrade 3 made a Mid Score of 23 the Norm for Grade 3.0\nGrade 4 made a Mid Score of 28 the Norm for Grade 4.2\nGrade 5 made a Mid Score of 40 the Norm for Grade 4.2\n\nIt will be seen that for this time of the year the Arithmetic (over) is \"Very Poor\". I spent some time with the teacher in Demonstration Lessons; but this is not an insurmountable effort as he is leaving.\n\nNOTE\u2014This form to be used for Indian Day Schools only.\n\nGerald H.

This is mainly due to the fact that the teacher does not have the slightest idea of how to make the work interesting.\n\nThe average attendance during the past year is as follows:\n\n- Quarter ending September 1932 was 25.21\n- Quarter ending December 1932 was 28.53\n- Quarter ending March 1933 was 32.23\n\nClassification:\n- Grade 5: Boys - 2, Girls - 2, Total - 4\n- Grade 4: Boys - 2, Girls - 3, Total - 5\n- Grade 3: Boys - 2, Girls - 2, Total - 4\n- Grade 2: Boys - 7, Girls - 5, Total - 10\n- Grade 1A: Boys - 4, Girls - 6, Total - 10\n- Beginners or IB: Boys - 4, Girls - 3, Total - 7\n\nTotals: 21 Boys, 19 Girls, 40 Total\n\nHealth: There have not been any epidemics during the past year.

There are also a new guard around the heater, and a new water cooler.\n\nNew Equipment Required\u2014\nThe teacher has not had a Provincial Course of Study. He was instructed to write for once only. I do not know what he based his instruction without some such Programme of Studies.\n\nI consider that if teachers are to be appointed here without training in a R.C.W.M.S. School or Summer School, the provision of one Beacon Chart will be necessary, as these teachers never appear to know how to set about teaching Reading to Non English Speaking Children. With well trained teachers this chart is neither necessary or of use as the work is done otherwise.\nBUILDINGS AND PREMISES\n\nInspectors will please mention the number of buildings, indicate their ownership and comment on their condition.\n\nThe building consists of a schoolroom of about 36ft. by 25ft., lighted by eight windows, set two on each side. This of course gives the worst possible cross-lighting. The building is located at one corner of the Anglican Church lot. The Department pays rent to the Anglican Church for the use of the room. There is little or no playground, and the building is practically on the street. There is a certain amount of automobile traffic past the school. There are two toilets in fair condition. The ceiling and walls of the interior of the schoolroom should be repainted. The floor should either be repainted or better-scraped and oiled. This work should be done during the financial year starting in April 1934.\n\nI do not consider the building of sufficient value to warrant its removal to a better site.\n\nReport of School Work Continued.\n\nVocational: The Girls' Vocational Work reported on after my inspection of October 21st 1931 appears to have come to an end. This was a very important part of the work at this school, and its loss will not be to the advantage of the local Indians.\n\nWriting: The children have the manuals necessary for the work in the prescribed Writing Course; but as the teacher has no idea whatever of how to teach this writing, the children write largely with finger movement.\n\nSpelling: This is very good in Grades 3 to 5 inclusive.\n\nArt: I taught a Drawing Lesson and a Demonstration Lesson for the teacher's benefit. The Art work is not satisfactory.\n\nSinging: The children learn to sing Hymns, Rounds, Action Songs. The volume was good, the expression fair, and the tone poor.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nReading: Grade 1B are using the Work Book for Beginners. They know about 20 words. This is about the standard of Beginners in their second month at a good Indian Day School.\n\nGrade 1A are BACKWARD. They have read selections from the Primer part of the First Canadian Reader. They can read a little and know about 50 words. They have therefore lost at least six months standing so far.\n\nGrade 2 have finished the Second Canadian Reader. Grade 3 speak fairly well. They have a fair knowledge of the Third Canadian Reader, and are doing some work in the Reading Exercise Book for that Grade.\n\nGrade 4 speak well. Their reading is \"Good\" They are using the Fourth Canadian Reader and the Reading Exercise Book for their Grade.\n\nGrade 5 speak well. They have finished their course in the Fifth Canadian Reader, and are using the Reading Exercise Book for their Grade.\n\nIt is obvious that the failure in the reading of the Primary Grades is due entirely to the lack of any teaching ability in Primary Work.\n\nGeneral: The school is rapidly losing ground. If it were not that the teacher has resigned, I should have asked for his removal.\n\nMr. Bannister's ideas of control were as weak as his teaching. He had the children march in a ring off the school hall, and appeared to think that control consisted in some form of military drill movements.\n\nIt is of course unlikely that he will ever again attempt to teach a country-school\u2014a thing that he was never capable of doing, and which I believe he only undertook to please his Bishop. He looks utterly worn out, and I know very unhappy at the failure of the school this year, would draw the attention of the Department to the correspondence and my telegraphic protest when it was suggested to appoint him.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith letter dated August 30th, ultimo, received from Capt. G.H. Barry covering official report of his inspection on May 25th, last, of the Hazelton Indian Day School, B.C. As to the Inspector's observations concerning the need for a more suitable teacher for the above-mentioned school, I feel quite sure that His Lordship Bishop Rix of Prince Rupert would be willing to recommend a properly qualified teacher with a B.C. Normal certificate if he were asked to do so by the Department. I would recommend that he be so requested in view of the existing conditions mentioned by the Inspector.\n\nPerhaps the Department may wish to make representations through the Indian Agent to the Church authorities in regard to the desire for renovation of the building, which is rented for school purposes from the Church authorities. Should the Department wish to have any item placed in the estimates for 1934-35 in connection with this school, I shall be pleased to be so advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nO. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 16, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 15/30947 of the 7th instant, enclosing Inspector Barry's report on his visit to the Hazelton Indian Day School on May 25th, last.\n\nWith reference to the repairs required to the school building, I would point out that this building is owned by the Diocese of Caledonia and the Department pays a monthly rental. Mr. Agent Mortimer is being requested to bring the suggestions of the Inspector to the attention of His Lordship Bishop Riz, with a view to having him arrange for the necessary repairs.\n\nIn connection with the teacher for this school, I may say that Inspector Barry was advised on May 5th, last, that the Department had approved the appointment of Mr. M. H. Lawrence to succeed Rev. Mr. Bannister. Mr. Lawrence has a Second Class Alberta Certificate and has had six and a half years' teaching experience in white and Indian schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC.

He has made a very great change for the better in this school. He tells me that at first he had a very difficult time, as the school had been left in bad shape by the present teacher at Kitkatla, who was the previous teacher here. I am afraid that my report on Kitkatla will not be a very good one, and I can easily understand how hard it must have been for the Rev. Bert Shearman when he took over control of the Hazelton School.\n\nI should be glad if the Department could in some way express to the Rev. B. Shearman its satisfaction with the present state of things at the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON HAZELTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\nBabine Agency.\n\nDate of Inspection: September 13, 1935.\nNumber of pupils present: 7 Boys & 12 Girls. Total 19.\nNumber of classrooms: One.\nNumber of desks in each classroom: 42 Single Desks.\nName of teacher: Rev. Bert Shearman Age 59.\nHealth: Excellent.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nThis teacher has made a very great change for the better in the school. His work is so far quite a success. Mr. Shearman has taken the trouble to apply suggestions made during the last two inspections at his old school, Kitkatla, and is now finding that he can achieve success by such means.\n\nWhile this teacher is not in possession of any Canadian certificate, he did receive training in England, and has taught for some thirty-nine years. He was appointed to his present position in September 1934, having previously taught at the Kitkatla Indian Day School for six years.\n\nSince my first inspection of Mr. Sherman's work in October 1931 at Kitkatla, he has much modified his old fashioned methods of teaching discipline, etc. He is using quite satisfactory methods at present, his teaching of Reading and Arithmetic being particularly good.\n\nRemarks relative to the examination of pupils:\n\nReading: Grade 1C know about 12 Sight Words. Their work for the first few days of the school-year is very good. Grade 1A have finished Two Little Indians, and have started Highroads Book 1. Grade 2 has finished the Highroads Reader Book 2. They speak out fairly well and can read well. They are ready for Grade 3. The present Grade 3 are half way through Highroads Book 3. Grade 5 and Grade 6 are working in Highroads Books 5 and 6. From Grade 3 up the reading in this school is \"Very Good\".\n\nReading Exercise Work Books are badly needed for Grades 3, 4, 5, and 6. These will be asked for by the teacher.\n\nArithmetic: Grade 1C are doing good work in the reading and writing of the numbers to 9, and the recognition of groups to 9. Grade 1A are rather slow in the Combinations and Separations. Grade 2 are quite good in Combinations and Separations and are working formal Addition and Subtraction. Grade 3 have finished the Multiplication Tables and are working Short Multiplication and Short Division with success. Grade 5 are on Fractions, and Grade 6 are working Decimals. The whole of the above work is well up to the average, and the work of Grade 3 is above average as was proved by the results obtained from a testing programme. In the All Canada Test, Grade 2 made a Mid Score of 8 which is much above average. Grade 3 made a Mid Score of 22, the Norm being 15. Grade 5 made a Mid Score of 28, which is the Norm for the Grade and Grade 6 made a Mid Score of 34, the Norm being 32.\n\nSinging: The teacher plays the organ. The children sang Hymns, National Songs, etc., with success.\n\nWriting: On the whole this is Very Good. Pencil is used in Grades 1 and 2 as it should be. The rest use ink. Spelling is Satisfactory. Art Work is being started. The work of the children is on the whole \"Very Satisfactory\".\nAttendance problem: remedies suggested, etc.\n\nThe Register is now being properly kept. The last teacher here kept the Register so badly that I was unable to arrive at any average attendance. Since the present teacher took charge this state of things has been changed. The Quarterly averages have been:\n\nQuarter ending September 1934 21.5\nQuarter ending December 1934 34\nQuarter ending March 1935 31\nQuarter ending June 1935 26\n\nThe parents are delighted with their new teacher I am led to believe. A number of residents of the village expressed to me how much they thought of this teacher. While he is in charge of the school I am certain all possible children will attend regularly. He has made the schoolroom attractive.\n\nClassification:\nGrade: Boys: Girls: Total:\n6 0 5 5\n5 4 2 6\n4 1 2 3\n3 1 6 7\n2 1 6 7\n1A 4 2 6\n1C 0 1 1\n\nTotals: 10 16 26\n\nThe above are the old Grades. A number of the pupils will now be promoted. Some of the children have not returned to the village at the time of inspection.\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nIt will hardly be necessary to add to what has been reported above. It is quite obvious to me that Mr. Shearman is making a great success of the school. I never inspected the last teacher's work here. I have since seen him at Kitkatle, and shall report on the work being done there in the course of a few days. The last teacher, The Rev. M. Lawrence was here for one year. His work does not appear to have been a success. His transfer from here to Kitkatle, and the Rev. R. Shearman's transfer to this school from Kitkatle, were, I understand, recommended by the Right Rev. Bishop Rix and later approved by the Department. Mr. Shearman has certainly worked wonders here, and has so advanced the children in one year that I can now classify this school as having a general standing of \"Very Good\". The whole of the school is clean and neat. The children are well dressed and perfectly clean. The teacher's control is \"Very Good\".\n\nVictoria, B.C.\nOctober 14, 1935.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., September 25, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith letter of the 20th instant, received from Capt. G.H. Barry, District Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C., covering his report of inspection on the 17th instant of the Hazelton Indian Day, Babine Agency, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry.\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTerrace, B.C.\n\nSeptember 20, 1936.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my report on the Hazelton Indian Day School, Babine Agency, which I inspected on September 17th last.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Mortimer was with me for a large part of the inspection.\n\nIt is a pleasure to inspect schools which are as well conducted as this. The Rev. B. Shearman has done very good work here, and his control of the children is very good indeed. Corporal punishment has been very greatly reduced during the past year. The children are bright and answer well. They speak up and are alert, which is not the case when there has been much punishment. These facts are brought out here in view of my past reports on the work of Mr. Shearman.\n\nI understand that Mr. Shearman is seeking the nomination of the Right Rev. Bishop Rix to the position of teacher at Kitwanga, which will become vacant due to the resignation of Rev. H. Flores. I may say that I have no objection to such an appointment as that of the Rev. B. Shearman to Kitwanga. I would however ask the Department in the event of such transfer of the present teacher from Hazelton to Kitwanga to insist that only a trained man with some Canadian teaching certificate be appointed at Hazelton. This Hazelton school has been working during the past couple of years and is now in quite a good condition, and it would be a very great pity to let it return to the dreadful condition existing previous to the appointment of the Rev. Bert Shearman here.\n\nThere are many things reported with regard to Mr. Shearman, such as excessive drinking, many debts, etc., of which the Department may or may not be aware. These have not been touched upon by me as I have no evidence of any of them in my possession. I have never seen him the worse for drink myself, and he certainly conducts his school well. While it is quite likely that such reports are quite true, I should not like to see this teacher removed from the staff of the Indian Day Schools at the present time. A move to Kitwanga might be very satisfactory from many points of view.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON HAZELTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\nBabine Agency.\n\nDate of Inspection: September 17, 1936.\n\nNumber of pupils present:\nBoys: 10\nGirls: 15\nTotal: 25\n\nNumber of classrooms: One.\n\nNumber of desks in each classroom: 42 single desks.\n\nName of teacher: Rev. Bert Shearman Age 60.\n\nHealth: Very Good. Mr. Shearman is still quite active.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nThe work of this teacher has been very successful here. I could not say that he is very modern in many of his methods as he has spent a life time in education along lines which are now considered rather old fashioned. No change could be made at his age, but Mr. Shearman has modified his methods a little to fall into line with my suggestions.\n\nThis teacher is not in possession of any Canadian teaching qualifications other than his forty years experience. He was a pupil teacher in England. His appointment to his present position in September 1934 followed a teaching experience of some six years at Kitkatla Indian Day School.\n\nHe is quite a good teacher of the \"Tool\" subjects, Arithmetic, Reading, Writing, Spelling, Etc.\n\nRemarks relative to the examination of pupils:\n\nReading: This is mainly taught in Grade 1C by an old fashioned spelling method, though pictures are also used. Oral composition and language is taught at the same time. The children know a few words. Grade 1B have finished Two Little Indians and Friends, the latter from the Blackboard as the teacher appears to only have one copy. I do not think that these Grade 1B children are ready for Highroads Book 1. I have asked the teacher to requisition sufficient copies of Friends for the Grade 1B pupils to read previous to promotion to Grade 1A and the Highroads Series. Grade 2 have finished Highroads Book 2. They are a most uneven class, only a few being ready for Grade 3. Their reading on the whole is not good. Grade 3 were all absent. They are said to have finished Highroads Book 3. Three children were present from Grade 4 and read Highroads Reader Book 4 fairly well. The three children present from Grade 5 read Highroads Reader Book 5 quite well. Grade 6 are said to have finished Highroads Book 6, but all were absent. The general standard of the Reading was certainly not as good as that achieved last year.\n\nSinging: The teacher plays a portable organ. The children sing National Songs, Hymns, Etc. This work has been improved since the last inspection.\n\nLanguage: The Work Books in English Usage and Composition are used as are the Work Books in Nature and the former I have asked that at least one exercise from be done daily and two per week from the latter. Writing: This is quite satisfactory on the whole.\n\nArt Work: Some elementary work is being done.\nSpelling: The Canadian Spellers are used. I tested the work done with the dictation of twenty words from Columns \"N\", \"M\" & \"N\" of the Buckingham Ayres Scale. The norms are for June 1937.\n\nGrade 2 made a Mid Score of 50% Norm 42% Satisfactory\nGrade 4 made a Mid Score of 70% Norm 84% Fair\nGrade 5 made a Mid Score of 95% Norm 92% Good\n\nArithmetic: Grade 1C can read and write the numbers to 9. They are learning to recognize Groupsto 9. Grade 1B are \"Fair\" in their knowledge of the working Combinations and Separations to 9. They are going on with those from 10 up. Grade 2 can Add and Subtract quite well to 99. They are starting the Multiplication Tables. Grade 3 who were absent are said to be working Short Multiplication and Short Division to times 9. Grade 4 are working Long Multiplication and Long Division while Grade 5 is at Fractions. Grade 6 were absent but were said to be doing Decimals.\n\nIn the All Canada Test in the Fundamentals the following quite satisfactory scores were made. Norms are for November.\n\nGrade 2 Mid Score 8 Norm 7 (Grade 3)\nGrade 4 Mid Score 12 Norm 18\nGrade 5 Mid Score 25 Norm 24\n\nI received a very good response from Grades 2 to 5 during a Demonstration Lesson given to help the teacher. Grade 6 is ready for Grade 3 in Arithmetic; as soon as they finish the necessary Reading course they might be promoted.\n\nGeneral: Very satisfactory progress is being made. The uneven state of the work in several Grades is due to the absence of the children, but this is being checked up by the teacher, who knows just where each child is now and why he is not in school.\n\nAttendance problem: remedies suggested, Etc.\n\nThe teacher is working hard to have every available child attend regularly. The average attendance since Mr. Shearman took charge of the school is as below:\n\nAverage Attendance for Quarter ending:\n\n| Month    | Year | Average Attendance |\n|----------|------|--------------------|\n| September| 1933 | 21.5               |\n| December | 1934 | 34                 |\n| March    | 1935 | 31                 |\n| June     | 1935 | 26                 |\n| September| 1935 | 23                 |\n| December | 1935 | 41                 |\n| March    | 1936 | 32                 |\n| June     | 1936 | 23                 |\n\nThe attendance is increasing a little.\n\nClassification of Children at this time.\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| 6     | 0    | 4     | 4     |\n| 5     | 4    | 2     | 6     |\n| 4     | 2    | 5     | 7     |\n| 3     | 3    | 8     | 11    |\n| 2     | 1    | 8     | 9     |\n| 1B    | 1    | 2     | 3     |\n| 1C    | 3    | 14    | 17    |\n| Totals| 14   | 43    | 57    |\n\nGeneral Remarks: The progress in this school is quite satisfactory. The children answer well and speak out splendidly. The response in a Demonstration Geography Lesson from Grade 5 was very good. The control of the children is \"Excellent\". The general standing of the school is \"Good\".\n\nTerrace, B.C.\nSeptember 20, 1936.\n\nGerald H.

B.C.\nJune 1, 1937.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Hazelton Indian Day School, Babine Agency, which I inspected on May 26th last.\n\nSince the departure of the Rev. B. Shearman the general standing of this school has declined. The present teacher, Mr. Noel Stewart, was appointed in January.\n\nIt was owing to the fact that there was a new teacher here that I decided to visit the Babine Agency a second time during the same school year. Some other important work was completed during the visit, as the Indian Affairs Branch wished me to carry out an Educational Survey at Moricetown. I was also able to visit Kitwanga Indian Day School, to which the Rev. B. Shearman has been moved since my last visit to the Babine Agency in September 1936.\n\nI understand that Mr. Noel Stewart will probably be leaving Hazelton at the end of June. I have not been officially informed of this fact, but I know that this young man is seeking the nomination to the Shulus Indian Day School in the Nicola Agency, and will call upon the Right Reverend the Bishop of the Cariboo when passing through Kamloops on his way to Victoria.\n\nIt is very necessary that Mr. Stewart attend the next session of the Provincial Summer School in Victoria in July. He must take some training in Primary Work if he is to be a success in an Indian Day School.\n\nI would ask the Indian Affairs Branch to write to Mr. Stewart with regard to Summer School, the necessity for the preservation of control in the schoolroom without the present excessive use of corporal punishment, and the advisability of following the suggestions of the Inspector in regard to teaching methods and Grade limitations in the various classes. With continued help this young man may train into a good practical teacher.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON HAZELTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nAnglican Church Babine Agency.\n\nDate of inspection: May 26, 1937.\n\nNumber of pupils present:\nBoys 20\nGirls 28\nTotal 48\n\nWhere were in addition of under school age and down to about three years of age:\nBoys 2\nGirls 5\nTotal 7\n\nThe above seven children helped to make any worthwhile teaching quite impossible, as the room was overcrowded with the forty-eight children of school age above six years of age, before the seven visitors came.\n\nNumber of classrooms: One.\nNumber of desks in each classroom: 42 single desks.\n\nName of teacher: Mr. Noel Stewart Age 26.\n\nHealth: Very Good.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nMr. Noel Stewart was trained in the Edmonton Normal School 1929-30 and holds a Permanent First Class Certificate in Alberta. He attended the Summer School in Edmonton in 1933, 1934, and 1935, and obtained the special Intermediate Grade Certificate. During the years 1926-29 he attended the Ohio State University and obtained his B.Com., Sc. degree. Mr. Stewart is a member of the Anglican Church and taught Grades 6 to 12 in the St. Paul's Indian Residential School at Cardston for the past five years.\n\nThis teacher was appointed on the nomination of the Anglican Church Authorities in January 1937. He had no previous experience in B.C. and till the date of my inspection was doing his best to learn our special programme of studies and to adapt himself to the vastly different conditions. He made a number of mistakes which I have pointed out to him. He has been instructed very clearly as to how to proceed in the teaching of the B.C. Course as far as we follow it here. His almost constant use of corporal punishment must cease, as he has been so informed. He has driven children away from school by his daily use of the strap, and then tried to get the R.C.M.P. to bring the children back to school. I have dealt with this whole situation, and would only suggest that the Indian Affairs Branch write to Mr. Stewart and inform him that he will be expected to follow as well as he can the professional instructions of the Indian School Inspector while in B.C.\n\nI have explained to him how he is to keep the School Register, and I have instructed him to requisition certain Work Books of which he has none.\n\nThis teacher is a very active young man. He has very little idea of actual teaching technique. He tells me that although he has had five years experience and regular inspection, he has never been told what to do and where he is failing. He seemed to be very glad to have my advice and critical evaluation of his work, and he promised me that he would change his somewhat harsh methods at once. He was advised to attend the Provincial Summer School in Victoria this year and to qualify in Primary Work of which he is rather ignorant at present. He may turn out a good teacher LATER.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 814-6, part 1)\nRemarks relative to the examination of the pupils:\n\nReading: Grade 1C know some 25 Sight Words. They are now to start Two Little Indians.\n\nGrade 1B are at Page 20 of Two Little Indians. They are one half year behind but they will be well for a 1B.\n\nGrade 1A are at Page 54 of Friends. Their work is \"Excellent\" but they are half a year behind the standard and should be reading Highroads Reader Book 1. Grade 2 are about two thirds of the way through the Highroads Reader Book 1. They should of course be in Book 2. They are slow.\n\nGrades 3, 4, 5, and 6, are over half way through their Readers and their work is \"Very Good\". Grade 8 is reading Book 6.\n\nI have explained limits of Grade work and given the teacher Courses of Reading for the children. The teacher will now reorganize the Reading as far as he can.\n\nArithmetic: Grade 1C can read and write the numbers to 9. They can recognize Groups to 6, and are to go on with the Addition Facts to 5 followed by the Subtraction Facts to 5 in June. Grade 1B are working the Combinations and Separations to 6 and Grade 1A the same to 9. The work is \"Satisfactory\". Grade 2 can Add and Subtract with a Change of Tens. Work is very good. Grade 3 is a backward slow grade but can work Short Multiplication and Short Division to times 6. Grade 4 are working Long Multiplication and Long Division. Grade 5 is still on Long Division, but should be working Fractions. Grade 6 is working Fractions and Decimals. I have settled a mistake about Texts as the Grade 5 and 6 children were attempting to use Canadian Problem and Practice Arithmetics Book THREE in place of Book TWO.\n\nWriting: Ink should be started at latest in Grade 3, but was only being used in Grade 5 and above that point.\n\nGeography: I outlined a course and methods in this subject. Grade 6 and Grade 8 were working on Canada and South America with some success.\n\nElementary Science: This has not been attempted as yet.\n\nI explained methods which the teacher could use without expense to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nLanguage: I explained with very great care just how to make use of the Work Books which the teacher will now requisition. HE HAS NO READING EXERCISE WORK BOOKS and the Language work has suffered as he HAS NO ENGLISH USAGE AND COMPOSITION BOOKS. These will be asked for also.\n\nArt: Nothing done so far.\n\nGeneral: Owing to change in teachers and other factors, the General Achievement of the pupils in school has suffered greatly. Tested with the B.C.Achievement Tests the following very poor results were recorded. The children with the exception of one in Grade 6 and possibly some Sub Grade pupils in Grade 1 MUST NOT BE PROMOTED TILL THE SCHOOL IS AGAIN INSPECTED probably in the Spring of 1938.\n\nB.C.Achievement Test Juniors 1934\n\n| Grade | Mid Score | Norm |\n|-------|-----------|------|\n| Grade 3 | 3.8       | 13.3 |\n| Grade 4 | 7.0       | 29.2 |\n| Grade 5 | 21.0      | 35.2 |\n\nB.C.Achievement Test 1933\n\n| Grade | Mid Score | Norm |\n|-------|-----------|------|\n| Grade 6 | 30.0     | 50.4 |\n| Grade 8 | 46.0     | 74.8 |\n\nThe children are at least a year and nearer two years below the proper standard for their present Grades due to too rapid promotion without Inspector's sanction.\nLetter from Indian Chiefs:\n\nThe Hazelton Indian Chiefs and people handed me the below mentioned letter addressed to\n\nThe Indian Education Officer\nfor British Columbia\n\nIt is copied here for the information of the Indian Affairs Branch. I may say that I agree with the viewpoint put forward by the Indians. The whole question of the establishment of an Improved Indian Day in or near Hazelton requires consideration.\n\nI do not consider that anything would be gained by making any sort of recommendation at the present time. I wish to talk this matter over with the Indian Commissioner in Victoria on my return there. It should be remembered that Roman Catholic and Salvation Army children attend the present Hazelton Indian Day School which is conducted on Anglican lines.\n\nHazelton B.C.\nMay 25th 1937.\n\nThe Education Officer\nof Indian Schools.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWe the undersigned Chiefs of the Kitanmax (?) Indian Reserve desire to ask you to consider a new school for our Children.\n\nWe would like a two-roomed Gov't school, where our girls and boys could receive a higher education.\n\nSome of the reasons are:-\n\n(1) Position of present school building is much too dangerous on road corner.\n(2) No playground space for games.\n(3) We want higher education, as white school will not take our children in their High School in Hazelton.\n(4) Present school is much too crowded none of the small ones have a seat to themselves.\n(5) We want the school on the reserve away from a road.\n\nTruly Yours,\n\nChief James White, Chief Frank Clark, Chief Frank Wilson,\nChief Charlie Clifford, Chief Donal Mowatt, Chief David Mouatt,\nChief William Wale, Chief Tom Campbell, Chief Philip Wilson,\nChief John Smith, Chief Alfred Danes, Chief Ernest Harris,\nMr. Austin Mathews, Mr. Frank Harris, Mr. Ben Wale,\nMr. Philip Johnson, Mr. Sam Jones.\nThe Education Officer\nof Indian Schools.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe, the undersigned Chiefs of the Kitamaab Indian Reserve, desire to ask you to consider a new school for our children.\n\nWe would like a two-roomed Forest School where our girls and boys could receive a higher education.\n\nSome of the reasons are:\n(1) Position of present school building is much too dangerous on road corner.\n(2) No playground space for games.\n(3) We want higher education, so white school will not take our children in their High School in Hazeltine.\n(4) Present school is much too crowded; none of the small ones have a seat to themselves.\n(5) We want the school on the reserve away from a road.\n\nTruly Yours,\n\nChief James White.\nChief Frank Clark.\nAttendance problem: remedies suggested, Etc.\n\nThe children are not attending well owing to the fact that the teacher straps far too much, and fails to visit the parents when children are away. He has relied on the R.C.M.P. and ruined the tone of the school so well built up by the previous teacher. I have instructed the present teacher to visit the parents of all his pupils and not only those who may happen to be Anglicans.\n\nIt should be noted that many pupils of the Salvation Army and a few who are Roman Catholic attend this school.\n\nThe average attendance has been as follows:\n\n| Average Attendance for Quarter ending |\n|---------------------------------------|\n| September 1936 | 26 |\n| December 1936 | 44.1 |\n| March 1937 | 42.7 |\n| June 1937 | ? |\n\nClassification: Grade: Boys: Girls: Total:\n8 1 2 3\n6 2 4 6\n5 1 0 1\n4 3 4 7\n3 1 5 6\n2 5 6 11\n1A 6 1 7\n1B 2 10 12\n1C 5 4 9\n\nTotal 26 36 62\n\nThere is not sufficient desk accommodation and I have instructed the teacher to send home the little visitors of from three to six years of age.\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nThe progress has not been quite so good this last few months as the teacher is new to our Indian Day Schools.\n\nHe has been given much help. I remained two hours after the last child had gone home at 4 P.M. and did all I possibly could for Mr. Stewart.\n\nWhile he knows very little of teaching as yet I do believe that if he follows advice this young man may train into every successful teacher. He is likely to leave here at the end of the present school year and to seek a nomination to another school, probably Shulus in the Nicola Agency. I shall watch his future with interest and help him where I can.\n\nBella Coola, B.C.\nJune 1, 1937.\n\nGerald H.

The teacher has established several centres of interest, such as the library corner and bulletin board. The pupils have made a small bookcase for reference material. The teacher's blackboard work is neatly arranged. However, greater use could be made of the blackboard by the pupils. The teacher's methods could be improved by greater pupil participation. Some attention has been given to the problem of enriching the pupils' vocabulary and to the development of fluency in oral and written language. The children are courteous and their behaviour indicates that attention has been given to the development of desirable habits and attitudes. The teacher has organized a Red Cross club and is using this to give instruction in democratic practises. I believe Mr. Leighton has made a good beginning after his year of normal training and should become a very successful teacher.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n(Use reverse if necessary\u2014This end to be the top)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nI am forwarding herewith copies of School Inspector Davey's reports covering his inspection of the Hazelton Indian Day School on October 7th.\n\nI am writing Supt.

In spite of her age (61 years) she has an enthusiastic class-room manner. The weakest part of her work is the teaching of reading. The more glaring mistakes have been put right by her and she has been referred to sources which will give her material on current practice in the teaching of this subject. Her teaching of number work is good and she has made good use of the guide book which accompany the Jolly Number Series.\n\nMrs. Dunbar is making a conscientious effort to develop good health habits among her pupils and is having some success. Improved washing facilities should be provided and a supply of individual cups.\n\nThe singing of the class and the participation of the pupils in singing and language games is particularly worthy of note.\n\nThere are several minor repairs required about the school but it is understood that the Superintendent has already made arrangements for these to be carried out. Additional blackboard space would be of considerable assistance to the teacher. This should be placed so that the bottom of the board is not more than twenty-eight inches from the floor.\n\nInspector of schools\n\nN.B.

The time-table posted appeared to be the same as the one used last year and questioning disclosed that no adjustment had been made in spite of the fact that the grades enrolled in this class are not the same as those for the past year. It is obvious that little time has been spent on preparation and organization. The teacher does not keep a daily preparation book.\n\nThe teaching of reading is rather poorly done. Little effort is made to correct even the most obvious poor habits, as for example, pointing to the words as they are called. The value and technique of teaching silent reading is apparently not understood. The importance of comprehension has been overlooked.\n\nMore emphasis should be placed on language work and aside from the use of the workbooks supplied by the Department little other work has been done.\n\nThe class seemed to be proficient in the fundamental operations of arithmetic but had been taught very little of the application of these to the solution of problems.\n\nThe pupils were fairly clean. In general the discipline in the class is good and the pupils apply themselves with a minimum of outside direction.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B. - ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n\nIndian Affairs.

There appears to be no attempt on the part of the teacher to discover pupil difficulties or to give remedial work. Some of the pupils do addition by counting on their fingers and no attempt has been made to overcome this difficulty. The reading of the class is poor. The work in arithmetic seems to be almost entirely devoted to the fundamentals and little time spent on the solution of simple problems. The progress of the pupils is poor in all subjects.\n\nThe chief difficulty with Mr. Rendell's work appears to be lack of interest.\n\nR.F.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Hazelton Indian Day School, Anglican Church, Babine Agency, which I inspected on September 22nd.\n\nYou will remember that this school was given an unsatisfactory report last October and that there was considerable correspondence with regard to the teacher, Mr. Burling, as a result.\n\nWhile I am certain that the Department will be glad to learn that there has been some slight improvement in the teaching at Hazelton, and a considerable improvement in the cleanliness of the schoolroom, the fact remains that the teacher is not well adapted for the work of an Indian school.\n\nThere are Salvation Army pupils as well as Roman Catholics at this school, and the numbers are rather too great for one man. I have recommended a new two or three room Indian day school on the local Indian Reserve, in place of this old rented hall located on Anglican property.\n\nMr. Burling is of course the Anglican Missionary at Hazelton. Some of the local people and of course the Right Rev G.A. Fix, Bishop of the Diocese, are anxious to have him retained as teacher. Though I do not look for any great success while Mr. Burling is in charge of the school, I do consider that it might be well to allow him to continue as teacher till a new school is erected at Hazelton, when a properly qualified British Columbia teacher should be appointed.\n\nOwing to the fact that there are Salvation Army and Roman Catholic children here in addition to the Anglican I consider it my duty to suggest that the appointment of any teachers of a new Indian day school at Hazelton should be selected by the Departmental officials and not by the Anglican Bishop.\n\nMy present report on this school read in continuation of my report of October 18th 1938 will I believe give a fairly good general review of the situation. My own letters to you dated February 20th 1939 relative to a report from the Indian Agent of February 21st 1939 relative to Department letter 151-9-1 of February 16th 1939, and of March 1st 1939 relative to Departmental letter 151-9-1 of February 18th, draw attention to various phases of the work in Hazelton. As suggested above the present would not appear to be a particularly good time to make a change of teachers at Hazelton. Well qualified male teachers are very difficult to find owing to war conditions and a previous shortage in B.C.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nHazelton (Day) Indian School Date of visit September 20, 1939\n\nPost Office address of school Hazelton Indian Day School, Hazelton, B.C.\n\nGrades 1 to 6 I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX\nBoys 24 1 5 4 3 3 4 (42 single desks)\nGirls 16 21 5 4 3 3 4\n\nPresent Boys 16 Girls 10\n\nTeacher Mr. Frank Burling Age 51\nLicence (or certificate) Second Class Saskatchewan\nValid to Permanent 19\nTaught last term in in this school\nTotal teaching experience about fourteen years\nService in Indian school two years\nConventions attended\n\nMr. Burling was a pupil teacher in England and later taught there for some six years. He was in the ASC during the War of 1914-18. In 1921-22 he trained at the Regina Normal and later taught in Saskatchewan for about ten years. Later he taught in Alberta and in B.C. for two years on some sort of Permits.\n\nGeneral comment:\n\nThe poor results obtained at this school were described in detail in my report of October 13th 1938 and there has been much subsequent correspondence about the teacher.\n\nSchool work has improved a little since my last inspection. A new janitor manages to keep the school very much cleaner than was the case formerly.\n\nReading in general is good, though that of the Primary Grades is rather \"word for word\".\n\nArithmetic is \"Fair\" Definite oral teaching needed.\n\nMuch more Oral Language is needed and the teacher was informed that more time should be given to this subject.\n\nOlder children were found to be just doing sums out of their text books in place of the proper seat work in Reading, Language, Nature etc., suggested to the teacher last year. School is still in need of a proper door lock, for children have to stop work to unlock yale latch whenever anyone wishes to enter.\n\nMethods in general are old-fashioned and interior of schoolroom is not attractive.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on Hazelton Indian Day School, Babine Agency, which I inspected on October 15th.\n\nI have informed Mr. Indian Agent Mortimer that I am not satisfied with the condition of the school.\n\nWith regard to the janitor service the Indian Agent informed me that he would see that this was properly done. He appeared to me anxious to retain the services of the present janitor, possibly on compassionate grounds. I know nothing more of Mrs Allen than is stated in my report.\n\nAs you will see from my report I do not consider that Mr. Burling is a success here. He does not have the respect of the Indian parents who consider the Indian Agent states that their children are just wasting their time in school. They give this as a reason for not sending the children regularly.\n\nAs Mr. Burling only holds a temporary appointment and does not have a B.C. Teacher's Certificate, I see no reason why I should recommend that he be retained here.\n\nWe require a well qualified B.C. teacher with experience. The practice of appointing the local Missionary of the Anglican Church is a poor one, though I have little hope that the Department will wish to change this till the Two Room Indian Day School which I have recommended is erected.\n\nI do consider that the Right Reverend Bishop Rix should be asked to nominate a properly qualified B.C. trained teacher to succeed Mr. Burling at the end of the present academic year, if not sooner.\n\nI am very sorry that I have to report in this unsatisfactory way on Mr. Burling's work. In my last report on this school, very soon after his appointment, I expressed the hope that with an experienced teacher the children would make rapid progress. It is however my duty to point out that the present condition of the Hazelton Indian Day School is highly unsatisfactory. The Indian Agent is, I believe, well aware of this, though owing to his illness, he has only been able to visit the school once since my last inspection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON HAZELTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nAnglican Church Babine Agency\n\nDate of inspection: October 13th 1938.\n\nNumber of pupils present:\nBoys 11\nGirls 16\nTotal 27\n\nNumber of classrooms: One. This is a school building rented from the Anglican Church.\n\nNumber of desks in each classroom: 42 single desks.\n\nName of teacher: Mr. Frank Burling Age 50.\n\nHealth: Appears good.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nMr. Burling was appointed on the nomination of the Anglican Church authorities, The Right Reverend Bishop Rix of Prince Rupert, and took up his duties in September 1927. The appointment was of a temporary nature as we knew nothing of his ability.\n\nIt appears that Mr. Burling was for some four years a pupil teacher in England and later taught in England for about six years. In the War of 1914-16 he was in the A.S.C. Trained in the Regina Normal School in 1921-22 he holds a Second Class Certificate in Saskatchewan in which Province he taught for some ten years. He also states that he taught for one year in Alberta and for one year in B.C. on some sort of temporary permits. Mrs Burling is also a teacher.\n\nMr. Burling is a man with a rather negative teaching manner, and appears to lack the power to organize his work. Much of the children's time would appear to be wasted, at least this is one of the complaints made by parents and I can quite understand the reason.\n\nMr. Burling is I believe kind to the pupils and has done his best for them, but the results have not been satisfactory. He states that he is not himself satisfied with the progress of the children; but claims that the failure so clearly marked is due to the constant absence of pupils on account of illness. It appears that there have been many cases of bad colds and coughs, possibly whooping cough.\n\nIn general the teaching and organization of classes has been below the standard of the Indian Day School of this Province.\n\nRemarks relative to the examination of the pupils:\n\nIn general the pupils are very greatly retarded, many having been more than a year in their respective Grades. The Primary children in particular are terribly backward. The Primary Reading is very poor and the Number Work much worse. They do not appear to have any proper seat work assigned. In fact the teacher appears to me to have very little idea how to go about the teaching of the young children in Grade 1, regardless of the fact that when I was here last I explained the whole matter in great detail.\nRemarks relative to the examination of the pupils continued:\n\nIt was most difficult to discover what had been taught since my last visit. Great care was taken however to be fair with the teacher and I found that:\nGrade 1D Beginners were average in Number Work and knew little if anything in Reading.\nGrade 1C had been in this Sub Grade since September 1887 for the most part, and were even now very backward in Reading and in Number Work.\nGrade 1B read very slowly and in a word for word manner and count all their Combinations.\nGrade 1A Read fairly well for such a Grade, but still count all Combinations and Separations.\n\nI regraded most of the older children for the teacher, but could not possibly promote those in Grades 1B and 1C.\n\nGrade 5 children after a year in the Grade were fairly good in Arithmetic and average in Reading.\nI suggested that the following be promoted to Grade 6 NOW.\nMary Muldoe Age 14 Howard Wale Age 11 a very bright boy.\nElla Mowatt Age 13 Louise Wale Age 14\n\nIn Grade 4 I suggested tha promotion of\nW. Wale Age 13 and Bob Simpson Age 13 to Grade 5\nI suggested the promotion of Norma Robinson Age 10 from Grade 2 where she has been over a year to Grade 3\nand of Richard Lattie Age 9 to Grade 3, but consider that Kenneth Lattie Age 11 must remain in Grade 3.\n\nThe promotion of Walter Wilson Age over 10 and Clarence Wale Age 10 to Grade 2 was also suggested.\n\nThese children are named here so that the Indian Agent may be able to keep a check on their progress, and in order that they may have a record when I next inspect here.\n\nHOWARD WALE WOULD BE BETTER OFF AT A RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL PARTICULARLY ST. MICHAEL'S ALBERT BAY. He is very bright and might with proper teaching be a success. He will not learn much here I am afraid.\n\nKathleen Bush Age 9 in Grade 3 and William Bush Age 11 in Grade 5 are the children of a Dutch father and an Indian mother. The father is dead I understand. He had been married to the Indian woman.\n\nThe two children mentioned have been attending the Provincial Day School at Hazelton, but are now registered in this school.\nI inquired into this case and am told by the undersigned that the two children have been accepted into the local Band. As Indians there would of course be no difficulty in allowing them to transfer from the Provincial School where they are not wanted to the Indian Day School. They are being shown in my classification lists below.\n\nWilfred Wale Age 8 Grade 1A and Fred Wale Age 7 Grade 1D have been taken out of this school as their father and mother have moved to Kissegas, where the father William Wale has been appointed teacher of an Indian Day School. The remaining Wale children mentioned above are living in Hazelton with relatives.\n\nArithmetic and Reading in Grades 2 to 5 are about average. I asked that the children now promoted be given the proper Work Books in Language, Reading, Nature etc., so that they could do some worth while school work while the teacher was working with the various subdivisions of Grade 1.\n\nThese Intermediate Grade pupils from Grades 3 to 5 inclusive are in general quite bright, and with good teaching would make rapid progress. They responded well to my own teaching. I asked that Health be taught for 15 minutes daily and suggested the use of a new Health Work Book published by J.M.Dent and Sons.\n\nIn conclusion I regret to say that the work done since my last visit is below the average of the Indian schools in this Province.\nAttendance problem: remedies suggested, etc.\n\nI am not satisfied that all the available children attend regularly. There are notes in the Register that the R.C.M.P. have on a number of occasions been asked to visit homes and see that children attended school. In some of these cases there are notes that the children were found to be ill.\n\nIt appears to me that the teacher does not himself visit the homes of the Indians enough.\n\nIt should be remembered that Mr. Burling is the Anglican Missionary here and that children attend his school who are members of the Salvation Army and others who are Roman Catholics.\n\nThe question of the establishment of an improved Indian Day School at Hazelton requires consideration. I do not believe that an Anglican Indian Day School where the teacher is Missionary, and not well qualified as a teacher from B.C. standards, is a satisfactory solution. Had Bishop Rix nominated a very well qualified B.C. teacher for this school, the fact that he had also to look after the Missionary work for the Anglican Church might have been overlooked, but when unsatisfactory teachers are nominated as in the present case, I would ask the Department to take action.\n\nAttention is drawn to the letter received from the Hazelton Indian Chiefs and people previously forwarded to the Department and copied on Page 2A of my report on this school dated June 1, 1937.\n\nThe table below gives the classification of the children now on the school roll. I am however of the opinion that not all the available children are shown on the Register.\n\n| Classification | Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|----------------|-------|------|-------|-------|\n|                | 6     | 2    | 3     | 5     |\n|                | 5     | 2    | 0     | 2     |\n|                | 4     | 0    | 1     | 1     |\n|                | 3     | 2    | 2     | 4     |\n|                | 2     | 2    | 2     | 4     |\n|                | 1B    | 0    | 7     | 7     |\n|                | 1C    | 8    | 1     | 9     |\n|                | 1D    | 0    | 4     | 4     |\n|                | Total | 16   | 20    | 36    |\n\nThe promotions suggested during this inspection have been made in the above Classification Table.\n\nThe average Quarterly Attendance has been:\n\nAverage Quarterly Attendance\n\n| School Year | 1936-37 | 1937-38 | 1938-39 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| September   | 28      | 25.4    | 20.7    |\n| December    | 44.1    | 33.8    |         |\n| March       | 42.7    | 28.7    |         |\n| June        | 39.1    | 19.7    |         |\n\nThe average attendance is falling.\n\nThe school is not attractive. The lock on the door is broken and there is a yale lock operated by a child near the door. It is impossible to open the door from outside. Throughout the inspection little children were \"Leaving the room\" and this child near the door was spending much of her time readmitting them or opening the door for them to go out. I spoke about this constant \"Leaving the room\" which as all teachers know is a sign of very faulty teaching and organization.\nGeneral Remarks\n\nI found the schoolroom in a untidy and dusty state. The janitor work has been very poorly attended to for some time. Blackboard ledges were deep in chalk dust, and window ledges dirty also.\n\nI am informed by the teacher that a Mrs Allen is the janitor, but that as this woman is a partial invalid, and that her daughters do the necessary work.\n\nIt is very difficult to understand why a \"white\" woman, and a partial invalid at that, should be employed to do the janitor work in an Indian Day School. I understand that this same woman is the nominal janitor of the Provincial School also. I would recommend that regardless of any compassionate reasons this arrangement be put an end to at once and a proper janitor appointed, an Indian woman for preference, and the teacher held responsible that the work is properly done before such a janitor is paid.\n\nI am not satisfied with the progress being made by the children here. Many are dirty and poorly dressed.\n\nThe Indian Agent has been very ill and not able to exercise a constant supervision of this school during the past year or I am certain he would not have permitted the present state of things to continue.\n\nI consider that the fault lies with the Anglican authority, the Right Rev. Bishop Rix, in nominating Missionary teachers without B.C. qualifications, who are in fact quite unable to teach the school, whatever they may or may not be able to do as Missionaries.\n\nAs Mr. Frank Burling's appointment was temporary in the first place so that we could see how well he got on here, I would recommend strongly that the Department arrange with Bishop Rix for a properly qualified teacher to be placed here as from September 1939 at latest.\n\nI am aware that the Department may not have the funds available to erect a suitable two room Indian Day School away from the \"White\" village and on the Indian Reserve as requested by the Indian Chiefs. Such a school will in my opinion be the only satisfactory solution of the situation here. With children from Anglican, Salvation Army, and Catholic homes, the teachers of such a two Division Day School should of course not be of necessity Anglicans. In any case the practice of having the Anglican Missionary the teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School has proved most unsatisfactory except in the case of the Rev. B. Shearman some years ago.\n\nThe present school is conducted in an Anglican Hall for which we are paying rent.\n\nThe present standing of this school is \"Unsatisfactory\"\n\nHazelton, B.C.\nOctober 16, 1938.\n\nGerald H.

M. MacKey,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKey:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Hazelton Indian Day School, Babine Agency, which I inspected on October 22nd.\n\nThe present teacher at Hazelton was appointed on the nomination of the Right Reverend Bishop Fix. His appointment is at present of a temporary nature, and I do not believe that this should be changed till I have had an opportunity to again inspect this school, probably in May 1938.\n\nI consider that Mr. Burling is likely to prove a success here. He has had considerable experience in many different kinds of schools, and has a good manner with the children. He saw service in the Great War with the A.S.C.\n\nThe response from the children to my own teaching at the Hazelton Indian Day School was quite good. I am inclined to think that after my inspection here last May, the previous teacher, Mr Noel Stewart, changed his methods and made a great change in the school. This change for the better is being extended by the present teacher Mr. Burling.\n\nMr. Burling is also the local Anglican Missionary though he is not in Holy Orders.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON HAZELTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nAnglican Church Babine Agency\n\nDate of inspection: October 22, 1937.\n\nNumber of pupils present:\nBoys 16\nGirls 17\nTotal 33\n\nNumber of classrooms: One.\n\nNumber of desks in each classroom: There are 36 single desks 6 rear sections and 5 front sections, giving seating for 41 children.\n\nName of teacher: Mr. Frank Burling Age 49.\n\nHealth: Very Good.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nMr. Frank Burling was appointed on the nomination of the Anglican Church as teacher here in September 1937. His appointment is temporary as little was known of either his qualifications or his ability.\n\nMr. Burling was for some four years a pupil teacher in England, after which he served as teacher in England for some six years. During the war of 1914-18 he served with the A.S.C.\n\nThis teacher was trained at the Regina Normal School in 1921-22 and obtained a Second Class Certificate in Saskatchewan where he taught for some ten years. In addition he has had about one year in B.C. and one year in Alberta on Temporary Certificates previous to 1931.\n\nMr. Burling will have been here only a very short time and it is too early to say much about success in the school work. His manner with the children is good. He is an experienced teacher, and appeared to be very glad to have the help I was able to give him in the organization of the work. My visit was of course made to help him to get a good start. No special tests were given to the children. My estimation of their ability was gained through their response to my own teaching during a number of short lessons on key subjects.\n\nThe children like this teacher and I feel that he will make a success of the work here.\n\nI hope to have an opportunity next May to again visit the school. It will then be possible to report on the actual results of Mr. Burling's work here.\n\nMr. Burling is married and I may say that Mrs. Burling is also a teacher.\n\nRemarks relative to the examination of the pupils:\n\nSinging: This was quite good. The little children are taught Action Songs.\n\nWriting: Pencil is used in all Grades as there are no ink exercise books available. I may say that there is a great shortage of necessary exercise books and other school material at the present time. I understand that the teacher will requisition for what is urgently required.\n\nReading: While this is satisfactory in general, Grade 2 are very backward and are only working in Highroads Reader Book 1.\n\nArithmetic: The proper texts are now in use. The work is satisfactory for this time of the year.\nReport on Hazelton Indian Day School:\n\n**Biography:** Suitable courses were outlined for the teacher.\n\n**Elementary Science:** The necessary work was outlined and a demonstration lesson on Air given to the children. I had brought with me the required chemicals and was able to give a lesson which proved of interest to the pupils. The response was very good.\n\n**Language:** The use of the various Work Books was explained and demonstrated with some care. The teacher is now in a position to make the best use of the books without any actual writing in the Work Books supplied. These will therefore last much longer. The oral work best adapted to the Grade 1 and 2 classes was also demonstrated.\n\n**General:** The teacher's control was good. I spoke to the children on the danger of throwing stones. This was done as I had seen two or three boys throwing stones at one of the Hazelton houses the previous day. I believe that the advice taken in speaking quietly to the children on the danger of using sling shots with stones coupled with the previous police action in gathering in the sling shots from Indian and \"white\" children will lessen the habit of throwing stones at houses in this village.\n\nI have recommended that the present Grade 3 be divided into a Grade 1A and Grade 2B only one boy and two girls being ready for this latter Sub Grade.\n\nI have also recommended that the Girl at present in Grade 3 be put with the rest of her class in Grade 7 where she belongs.\n\nThe whole of the above suggestions will be carried out by the teacher at once without further instructions from officials of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nOn the whole the children are in Grades for which they are not ready. With good teaching they may be able to make up the lost ground by the time of my next inspection.\n\n**Attendance problems, remedies suggested, etc.**\n\nThe average quarterly attendance has been:\n\n| Attendance for Quarter ending | September 1936 | December 1936 | March 1937 | June 1937 |\n|------------------------------|---------------|--------------|------------|-----------|\n| September 1937               | 22.44         |              |            |           |\n\nThe frequent resort to corporal punishment noted in my last report was curtailed after my last inspection. There has been very little since the appointment of the present teacher, and there is a much better tone in the school.\n\nThere are not quite as many children on the register this year. I do not believe that all are boys in the village.\n\nMay I point out for record that although this school is administered under the Anglican Church and that the school building is rented from that Church, there are in fact a considerable number of Salvation Army and Roman Catholic pupils attending here.\n\n**Classification:**\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| 5     | 1    | 1     | 2     |\n| 7     | 1    | 1     | 2     |\n| 6     | 0    | 1     | 1     |\n| 5     | 1    | 2     | 3     |\n| 4     | 0    | 0     | 0     |\n| 3     | 4    | 6     | 10    |\n| 2     | 6    | 8     | 14    |\n| 1B    | 2    | 10    | 12    |\n| 1C    | 4    | 1     | 5     |\n| Totals| 20   | 25    | 45    |\n\nIndian Affairs.

The children were much cleaner.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that I am well pleased with the progress of this school, the general standing of which is at present \"Good\".\n\nHazelton, B.C.\nOctober 23, 1937.\n\nGerald H.

Becher to fill the positions of teacher and field matron, respectively, at the Homalco Indian Day School, recently vacated by Mr. and Mrs. A. H. Garland. The application of Mr. and Mrs. Becher, together with the testimonials which you enclosed in your letter, was also received. It is noted that their appointment meets with the approval of Rev. John Welch, O.M.I., also Mr. Inspector Cairns and yourself. While Mr. Becher has no professional qualifications, the Department will, in view of the recommendations mentioned, approve of his temporary appointment as teacher, also that of Mrs. Becher as field matron, from the 1st of September, next, their continuance in the work to depend upon the success which they achieve.\n\nMr. Becher will be allowed salary as teacher at the rate of $95 per teaching month, payable quarterly. The salary allowed in the case of Mrs. Becher, who is to perform field matron's duties, will be at the rate of $450 per annum. This will be payable monthly upon receipt of your monthly pay list.\n\nPlease inform Mr. and Mrs. Becher of the approval granted for their temporary appointment, and arrange with them to take up duties on the date above mentioned. It is hoped that they will meet with every success in their work at Homalco. Should they not be able to make satisfactory progress after a period of six months' trial, the Department would then consider the question of the closing of the school and sending the children to residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Deputy and Secretary.\nVancouver Agency,\n416 Winch Building,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nJuly 13th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that Very Reverend Father John Welch, O.M.I., of New Westminster, B.C., called on Mr. R.H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia and myself by arrangement, and recommended the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur N. Becher, of Vancouver, to fill the vacant positions of Indian day school teacher and field matron, respectively, at the Homalco Indian village of Church House, B.C., recently left by Mr. and Mrs. H. Garland.\n\nMr. Becher called later and interviewed Mr. Cairns and me. We requested him to make formal application for the positions stating his references and qualifications. This was done. The application is herewith enclosed, together with letters (2) of reference, the first from the Municipal Engineer at Point Grey, Vancouver, and the second from the Medical Health Officer of the same Municipality\u2014R.B. Blackwood.\n\nMr. Becher states that he has never taught school, but he feels quite capable of teaching what is usually described as \"the three Rs\"\u2014reading, writing and arithmetic. He thinks also that he would be able to increase in competence with a little experience.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Becher states that Mrs. Becher was trained as a nurse at the Heath Hospital, Dublin. Mrs. Becher, however, was not able to furnish a certificate in time to make this appointment possible on such reference by September 1st when the school should re-open.\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns thinks that it would be advisable to give these people a trial by engaging them on probation for a period of six months, at a salary the same as paid to Mr. and Mrs. Garland, in view of which, and in view of the fact that Mr. and Mrs. Becher have been recommended by Very Reverend Father Welch, I would concur therein subject to Departmental approval.

(RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nFather Welch stated to Mr. Crims and me that if these people are not able to make satisfactory progress with the Church House (Komalo) Indians, he will recommend the permanent closing of this school and the sending of the children to the boarding schools.\n\nThe Indians of this village have always been very troublesome, but a man of the proper type can do a great deal with them. Such a man is hard to find, because of the isolation and other conditions. We must do the best possible under the circumstances and hope for better results with the education of the young.\n\nWere it not that this reserve is remotely situated and it is desirable that a white representative of the departmental service should be stationed here if only to keep a watchful eye over the Indians, I might have recommended earlier action along the line of closing the school\u2014at least temporarily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCharles C.

I am sending same to Francis Louie by this steamer. The skin I intend to bring up with me on my next trip north, unless I can sell it in the meantime.\n\nI expect to visit Squirrel Cove some time next week, and, if the opportunity offers, will make a trip to Church House, where, no doubt, I will be able to explain everything in connection with the matter in question.\n\nKindest regards to Mrs. Garland and family,\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

It is ages since I received such a letter and for a while I had visions of the Penitentiary staring me in the face.\n\nYou really should get a job writing scareheads for the newspapers.\n\nNow about the cougar skin. On October 14th, at Redonda Cannery, Francis Louie through William Mitchell asked me if I would take a cougar skin down to Vancouver with me when I went down and collect the bounty ($40.00) on same for him. I asked him why the skin was not taken to the Prov. Police at Cowell River, and was informed that the Provincial Police would not accept it. I did not want to bother with the skin as I have had lots of experience in collecting moneys for Indians in this manner and apart from the time it takes running from one office to another, I am usually out of pocket over the business.\n\nI did not return to Vancouver until Oct. 26th, and left right away for another trip. Since then I have been travelling around and had not the time or opportunity to attend to the skin until recently.\n\nI have already taken the skin to the Government Agent here who punched the ear, and I have also presented the application for the bounty. I am now awaiting the arrival of the cheque and as soon as this arrives, I will forward same to him together with the skin.\n\nRe the last paragraph of your letter re the Prov. Police, I may say that Constable Boyt was with me at the Prov. Game Office yesterday when I went to make enquiries about the bounty. He did not mention anything about those mysterious \"steps\" which are to be taken against me. I may add that I saw Francis Louie at Squirrel Cove the week before Christmas, and told him the difficulty I had in obtaining the bounty. Francis Louie said it was all right no hurry.\n\nI am sending you some copies of the forms of application for bounties which you will be able to make use of in future cases of this nature in your official capacity as Stipendiary Magistrate.\n\nKindest regards to everyone.\n\nA.

Bartlett, Esq.,\nDominion Constable,\n2nd Floor, Winch Bldg.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSir,\n\nFrancis Louie, an Indian of the Squirrel Cove Band has come to me in my official capacity as Stipendiary Magistrate, and has made the following statement - That some time during the early part of October he killed a cougar on Cortes Island - that as you were in the vicinity at the time, he gave you the cougar skin and that you told him you would obtain for him the bounty allowed by the Provincial Government. He tells me that he has seen you several times since, but that he has not yet received either the skin back or the bounty.\n\nHe now desires to take what legal steps may be necessary to obtain this bounty or the return of the skin.\n\nI might add that the matter is known to the Provincial Police Dept., at Powell River, and one of the Provincial Constables was here yesterday and spoke to me concerning the matter. In other words, he was making enquiries so as to take some steps - what these steps are, I do not know, but, to clear up the matter, I do wish you would write to me by return mail, giving me the full history of this affair as far as it concerns you.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nStipendiary Magistrate.\n\nCOPY.\nHomalo Indian Reserve,\nChurch House, B.C.,\nFeb. 19th, 1927.\n\nG. G. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWinn Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Perry\u2014\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter which I have addressed to Constable Bartlett and I do wish you would exert your influence to prevent this officer from spreading false rumours on his journeys up and down the coast. From what I hear I am of the opinion that he is just a mischief and trouble maker.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAHG\u2014\nEnc.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of February 19th, which reached this office on March 15th, and must confess that I am at a loss to understand what it is all about. It is years since I read such wretched drivel, and then the letter, which compared very favourably with yours, was written by an inmate of the Provincial Mental Home at Essondale.\n\nFrom the general wording of your letter, it would appear that you had swallowed a dictionary, and I would suggest that you take a good dose of castor oil. If that doesn't relieve you, try a good stiff dose of carbolic acid which would be better still.\n\nI am afraid you are getting to be like other people who, for some reason best known to themselves, live in out-of-the-way places where every bit of gossip (which you condemn so severely in your letter) is seized upon with the result that a mountain is made out of a mole hill.\n\nI have a pretty good idea as to the identity of the Party who started this controversy, in fact, I heard that someone had been blabbing, so your letter was not unexpected. You quoted quite a lot of legal drivel in your letter but you evidently forgot the old saying that a person is innocent until proved guilty. You heard one side of the story, and without hearing the other have already passed judgment, such as it is. Is it not possible that I was misquoted?\n\nI have always had the greatest respect for Mrs. Garland and Ribby, and admit that I did not encourage the boys as they were constantly \"butting in\" making private conversations impossible, and have made no secret of this.\n\nWhilst the letter itself was, to say the least, very insulting, parts of it were very humorous, especially lines 22 and 23 of the first paragraph. What on earth are you today that any sane person would \"seeth with jealousy\" at your success. It is to laugh.\n\nIt would be quite interesting to know whether your letter was written (to use a favourite phrase of yours) in your capacity as Stipendiary Magistrate, or in your capacity as third class teacher of an Indian School, and a Day School at that.\nIn conclusion I would suggest that when you arise in the morning, look first at the cliff back of the village and then at your own reflection in the looking glass, and repeat to yourself, \"There's another 'BIG BLUFF'.\"\n\nAs to my opinion of yourself and your domineering manner, the less said the better. I hope this letter will be of some benefit to you and, if I were you, I would make a few enquiries or at least hear both sides of a question before writing insulting letters to people who have tried to help you out as well as they were able, without as much as a \"THANK YOU.\"\n\nYours etc.,\n\nT.T.Bartlett.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCOPY.\nSir\u2014\n\nWere anyone to ask me what were the two greatest hidden menaces to Society at the present day, I would at once answer blackmail and calumny. In a recent denunciation of the crime of blackmail, the Chief Justice of B.C. put it on the same footing as assassination, while another very prominent Judge called it one of the cancers of civilization. Calumny, the cousin-german of blackmail, is a more insidious and treacherous form of mental debauchery. In blackmail there is generally good ground and often evidence for the allegations, but in calumny in nearly all cases there is no ground at all for the insinuations and cruel innuendoes. The blackmailer is generally run to earth and receives his just and deserved punishment, the false calumniator generally runs scot-free while his victims suffer terribly. Just now in Church House we are awaiting with some nervous apprehension the return of the mosquito - that stinging, ubiquitous nuisance which drives people frantic with uneasiness and discontent. But we thank God that the insect is moribund and inert for the greater part of the year. The mosquito plies his mischievous trade while the sun shines and the swamps emit their putrescent miasma. On the other hand the calumniator flourishes in the dark throughout the year. He thrives on the garbage of his own ill-functioned and diseased mind. He is usually an ill-bred fellow and seethes with jealousy at the other fellow's success. He is the personification of the dog in the manger. His usual method is to fasten on to some idle gossip, which he enlarges, magnifies and paints in lurid colors, and then disseminates secretly and maliciously. He is the poison gas expert of society, and the fumes from his devilishly slung bombs are as murderous and the effects as far-reaching as ever were those of the Germans on the battlefields of Flanders.\n\nThe burglar, the hold-up man, and the brigand are gentlemen to him. The highwayman of old came out in the open, the victims' loss was merely temporal and remediable; the criminals generosity and fame were sung in ballads and praised in folklore. What can we say of the calumniator? He works in the dark and the wounds he inflicts are deadly. He rarely over-steps the barbed wire entanglements of criminal libel. When trapped or confronted with his victim he utters pallid excuses, cringes like a leprous hound and falters.\n\nWe all despise the female gossip who hangs over the neighbors' walls; we should doubly condemn and treat as a pestilence the male gossip who ruins his fellow man with his over-ready tongue. Proverbs of all countries tell us \"beware of the man who goes amongst his fellows with a loose tongue\". Countless suicides, impoverished and unhappy homes, stunted and distorted lives are some of the results of the calumniators' trade. His stings are as fatal to man as those of the tee-tee fly to animals.\nAnnias and Saphira were calumniators when God struck them dead. It would be a happier world today if these two had been the last of their vile species.\n\nDuring the Winter a quaint little trio of figures representing three monkeys sitting in similar poses were on sale in the fifteen cent stores of the City of Vancouver. Every calumniator amongst us should have purchased one of these made idols and bowed down to these figures in repentance and deep reverence. The figures exemplify in the monkey what should be the cardinal virtues in every uprighteous man, \"Speak no evil, see no evil, hear no evil.\"\n\nAnd, as in society and amongst larger congregations of the human species, so it is in smaller communities and organizations. We know that a worm will sink a ship or destroy a costly edifice if given time enough. In like fashion will the canker of the calumniator spread through and putrefy the foundations of good fellowship, and comradeship, upon which all friendly groups, societies and associations are built. The plagues of suspicion and discontent, the fires of jealousy and greed, fanned by the foul breath of the liar and malignant - have at every stage of history been the chief destroying factors in the lives of the nations, communities, organizations and associations. Let us always remember the immortal words of the great Shakespeare \"He who steals my purse steals trash, but he who filches from me my good name, steals that which not enriches him, but leaves me poor indeed.\"\n\nIn conclusion I hope that this letter will be of some benefit to you. At the same time I must request that in your peregrinations up and down the Coast, you will refrain from using my name, or that of my wife, or any member of my family in the manner that you have done, or I regret that I shall be compelled to take some steps to prevent you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Garland, who is leaving the Homalo Indian Day School on the 30th instant. The contents have been noted and I wish to suggest that, if any difficulty arises, you make a full report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nG. G. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n415 Winch Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nWith reference to Departmental letter No. 167-33-1, dated March 22nd last, in which I was informed that the Department considered it in the best interests of the work to have Mr. and Mrs. A. H. Garland, Indian Day School Teacher and Matron, respectively vacate their positions at the Indian village of Church House on June 30th., I beg to transmit herewith a report dated May 28th. in regard to Mr. Garland signed by Mr. T. T. Bartlett, Dominion Constable of the Vancouver Agency, which will be self-explanatory. Accompanying this report is also a photograph of Mr. and Mrs. Garland and their three children. These are being sent to the Department as it is thought the Department may wish to have the Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirm the same upon investigation. If this record is substantiated by further inquiries it has occurred to me to suggest that the report of Inspector Cairns and myself on the results of our investigation at Church House may prove to have been quite lenient.\n\nMr. Garland has been writing to me in a very objectionable manner since Mr. Cairns and I made our investigation of his alleged misconduct with Indian women. I also understand he is opening a small store a short distance from the Reserve as soon as he vacates the Indian village school and there is reason to expect further difficulties as time goes on with this man being so near the Indians. For the foregoing reasons I have deemed it advisable to inform the Department of these developments.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n(C.C.

C.\n\nMay 26th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nOn May 26th, 1928, I received the following information re Arthur Ladsey Garland, the Indian Day School teacher at Church house, B. C., in this Agency, and, as Garland is an employee of this Department, I think this information should be placed in your possession.\n\nMy informant told me that he knew Garland intimately, having lived next door to him in Winnipeg for a considerable period, and informed me that \"Captain\" Garland formerly held a responsible position at the Manitoba Provincial Income Tax Office, but lost this position on account of dabbling in politics.\n\nAt one time Garland and Mayor (or Major Webb) were partners in the Garrick Hotel, Garry Street, Winnipeg, where considerable bootlegging took place.\n\nI was also informed that Garland went in for smuggling liquor into the United States, using airplanes for transporting the liquor across the border. Garland usually made the trip on the plane to collect for the shipment of liquor.\n\nMy informant told me that Garland \"got in bad\" with the Winnipeg Police and had to get out of town and that is the reason he came to the coast. He also informed me that Garland was a magistrate in Winnipeg and in this capacity tried other bootleggers who usually were given the limit so as to stop opposition.\n\nGarland at one time lived at Sadler Avenue W. St. Vital, and the parents of my informant lived at 128 Berriydale Avenue, St. Vital, Winnipeg.\n\nI was also informed that Garland was born at Bray, Ireland, and was educated at Trinity College, Dublin. He lived in England for several years. Garland told my informant that the reason he left the Old Country and came to Canada was because he got mixed up in a \"scrape\" in which someone had been killed.\n\nMy informant readily identified Garland in the attached photograph and mentioned the names of the children. My informant's name is Leslie Preece, son of Samuel Preece, Winnipeg, and, as the above information was given to me confidentially, I would not care to have his name brought into this matter.\n\n(T.T.

I can only regard his actions as being with the intent to injure me, if possible.\n\nMy Magistracy and Petty Debts Court have nothing whatever to do with Mr. Perry or the Department, and if Mr. Perry should write or cause to be written letters to the Attorney General pointing out my resignation from the position of Teacher of the Indian Day School, it can only be regarded as an unwarranted interference in my private affairs. I am perfectly capable of writing to the Attorney General if it is necessary to do so, and if I were leaving the district, without any assistance from Mr. Perry.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnc.\n\nThese are his tricks on his part to taunt and send me, aggravate and annoy me.\nChurch House, B.C.,\nMay 14th, 1928.\n\nC.

My position as Magistrate is my own private affair; you have nothing to do with it, neither you, nor the Dept., have any control over it, and I can only deduce that your object in writing to the Attorney General was to try and injure me, if possible.\n\nI am quite capable of writing to the Attorney-General resigning my Magistracy should I leave this district, but I have no intention of leaving the district. I have taken a ranch contiguous to the reserve, where I intend to open a store and set up a first aid station; in addition to which I hope to take over a school for white children.

Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria,\nB.C.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that it was necessary for me, on the 5th ultimo, to hold an investigation into a complaint made by Mr. Indian Agent Perry that Mr. Garland, schoolteacher at Church House, in a communication dated the 13th January, 1928, had made accusations against him in his administration of the Vancouver Agency, alleging that in a letter which he had written to Mr. Garland on the 11th December last, in reply to one from the school teacher dated the 11th December, contained untruths, showed bias and pre-judiced against him and insinuated that Mr. Garland was a liar. This case was the outcome of considerable correspondence which had passed between the teacher and the Indian Agent regarding alleged misconduct on the part of Constable Hartnett.\n\nCopies of Agent Perry's letter of the 22nd of December to Mr. Garland, and Mr. Garland's communication dated the 13th January, are attached hereto for your information and perusal. They are marked \"A\" and \"B\".\n\nAs I was aware of the fact that instructions had been issued by the Department to Agent Perry to make investigations into the charges of misconduct on the part of Mr. Garland himself, I considered it essential to hold my investigation first to see whether the Agent was a fit and proper person to hold the investigation into the complaints made with regard to the teacher.\n\nUpon the conclusion of the hearing, I reached the decision that Mr. Garland had no foundation whatever to make the statement about Mr. Indian Agent Perry as contained in his letter of the 13th January.\n\nThe letter of Mr. Garland dated the 11th December to Agent Perry, above spoken of, had reference to some Indian cases which he had been trying as magistrate at Church House about the 1st of December and he wrote to Agent Perry stating that he was convinced that some of the Indians had injured themselves and he proposed laying the matter before the Attorney-General which, of course, Mr. Garland felt would be for him to pursue. After a perusal of Agent Perry's letter of the 22nd December, I think you will agree a loss to see anything in it wherein Mr. Garland could base his allegations of lying, bias or prejudice on the part of Agent Perry. It was indeed difficult for me to determine why Mr. Garland had written in this manner, but as the investigation proceeded, Mr. Garland brought out a very fine line of distinction in that, when writing to Mr. Agent Perry on the 11th December, he\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (Ri 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nstated that he proposed laying the injury matter before the Attorney-General, and Mr. Perry, in his reply of the kind of December, you will observe, stated he had brought the matter to the attention of the Attorney-General. I consider this was a point of hair-splitting and that the Agent was justified in assuming that Mr. Garland had laid the matter before the Attorney-General. Furthermore I think you will come to the conclusion that Mr. Agent Perry's letter of the 23rd was written in a very suspicious tone, as indeed were all letters that he had written to Mr. Garland on various subjects.\n\nI deemed it important also to hear the complaints Mr. Garland had against Constable Burdett; the main one, however, was the charge that Constable Burdett had made an unwarranted report with regard to Mr. Garland and that he and Mrs. Garland were not man and wife but father and daughter. Mr. Garland stated that Constable Burdett came out in 1846 living in incest with his daughter. Investigation of this particular point did not turn up Mr. Garland's allegation that he did not bring any proof to bear that Mr. Garland and wife were not man and wife in this matter. Burdett's explanation of the matter, however, is that he and Mr. Garland discussed the matter at church house one day and Mr. Garland told him the facts so that he could tell him and everybody else that the agent is very serious about him. The Constable thought Mr. Garland ought to have known something about the fact that he was married to Mr. and Mrs. Garland, who were not man and wife, at that time, and his daughter. Burdett gave sworn testimony to the fact that he knew nothing about the situation. In short, the humour was that there were Indians and this was the first time that Mr. Garland heard anything in the matter. A show stated, in view of the fact that Mr. Garland could not prove that Mr. Burdett had spread this report, the Constable said once not really would have as much leverage in law as that of Mr. Garland. I am not of all opinion that Mr. Burdett was becoming current for I never did in the course of my life see two people where there is such an apparent dissimilarity in their ages, whereas, in reality, there are only slight differences. On rising up Mr. Burdett said the investigation, I believe, was completed and that no more of a report was desired or necessary. Mr. Garland, however, insisted that Mr. Burdett be informed so that he be removed from his position. Mr. Garland stated that he is fifty-six, although in fact he is about forty-five years old, and that he is only fifteen years younger than the agent. It was also stated by Mr. Burdett that he had no idea of the agent's age, but the agent was thirty-three and Mr. Burdett was seventy-three and had been married and had children. Mr. Burdett stated that he had not seen anything that was said, but there is\n\nI am attaching hereto a copy of the evidence taken in this investigation by Miss Corcoran, the stenographer in Agent Perry's office, but in view of the fact that Miss Corcoran is not used to taking down evidence verbatim, she could not get down everything that was said, but there is\nSufficient to give you a fairly full understanding of what transpired. This transcript of evidence was only recently submitted to me and, therefore, I was not in a position to report on an earlier date.\n\nSince my investigation... Agent Perry and his friends have looked into the matter and the conduct in the part of Mr. Gerlach, and their conclusions have been that while there is no guilt in Mr. Gerlach, it has been found that Mr. Gerlach is not fit for any position of any charge of the education. A child's education has been neglected because he should be removed from his studies at the end of June, and I think that would be the best thing to do, as he is one of the most peculiar men I have ever had anything to do with in the course of my career.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nDear Mr. Garland:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters, three in number, dated December 8th, 11th, and 12th with regard to the police prosecutions which recently took place at Church House. In reply to yours of the 8th inst., I would inform you that Mr. Rosenberg gave me verbally the details, as anticipated by your letter.\n\nIn your letter of the 11th you have informed me that you have brought to the attention of the Hon. Attorney General the matter of certain Indians perjuring themselves and in this connection I feel that this is not a matter for my interference since the case was prosecuted by the Provincial police before you, as Stipendiary Magistrate. It is noted that you observe that you leave the matter in my hands but I regret not being in a position to interfere in this matter, and more particularly since it is understood that you have been in communication with the Indian Commissioner at Victoria in connection with the case. No doubt Mr. Ditchburn will give the matter his most careful consideration.\n\nWith regard to your statement that Moses Wilson offered you $100.00 if you would try the case in Church House instead of sending it to Powell River, I am informed that this Indian told the Dominion constable that he had asked you what the fine would likely be, as he had only $100.00 in his possession. This also, however, is not a matter for my interference. If a bribe\n\nA.H. Garland, Esq.,\nChurch House, B.C.\nDecember 22, 1927.\n\nwas offered or if the Indians injured themselves at the time, you had all the machinery available for settling it there and then. Under the circumstances, it is my opinion that these Indians will have learned their lesson by now as a result of the fines imposed upon them and I do not think any good purpose would be served now by further prosecuting the Indians on the grounds named. Should the Attorney General or Mr. Ditchburn think otherwise, they will act no doubt upon their convictions in the matter.\n\nIt has been reported to me that you allowed Indians to sign informations and incur expenditure in connection with these prosecutions but that upon arrival of the Provincial police the latter were allowed to inform and no provision was made whereby the informing Indians might receive their moities or launch expenses incurred by them. I would be interested to have the facts of the case. No doubt you will be applying to the Attorney General with a view to an adjustment of any legitimate expenses incurred, although the Indian Act gives the presiding magistrate the right to charge the costs of prosecution against the convicted party. Since it is understood that the matter is in the hands of the Indian Commissioner I do not wish to interfere in this phase of the matter but simply wish to advise you of information which has reached me. I must also advise you that I did not receive a telegram from you asking me to meet you at Powell River on the 10th inst.\n\nAs anticipated in your letter of December 11th, complaints of a very serious nature have been received both by myself and Mr. Inspector Cairns, and we have been discussing them pro and con. This matter will be dealt with in due course and in the meantime, since you have asked for permission to come to Vancouver this permission is granted, but I can not state that the Department will incur any expense in this connection. Perhaps you will advise me when you expect to be in Vancouver and I would point out that it is important that the conduct of the classroom work should not be discontinued during your absence.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(C.C.Ferry)\nIndian Agent.\nHomalco Indian Reservation,\nChurch House, B.C.\nJan.14th, 1928.\n\nC.C.Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWinch Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nThe more I read your letter of the 22nd of December, 1927, on matters relating to recent proceedings at Church House, the more am I compelled to remain from replying to it. Your letter is so pregnant with inaccuracies and omissions that I shudder at it. Your letter is an overflowing (read in conjunction with others that have been received from you lately) with bias and prejudice, that I am not forced to request you, on my behalf, to demand from Ottawa a thorough and complete investigation into the administration of the Vancouver Agency, and more especially into the Machiavellian activities and deviltries of Constable Bartlett.\n\nMy life has been a little hell, caused by this man's calumny. Well-known as he is, and (I understand) with your connivance, among the filth and garbage of idle Indian gossip, suggesting to them the things that he wants them to say, and conveys them to you as reports made to him, and these are apparently (by your letter) accepted by you as truths. Why, even you in your letter tell untruths; even you in your letter insinuate that I am a liar.\n\nI resent it, Mr. Perry, with all the emphasis and force at my command, and I hold the infamous, factually and cowardly lies told you, (that is more or less responsible for your insinuations and innuendoes) back again into the stock of the lying scoundrel who conveyed it to you.\n\nAs for the complaints of a \"very serious nature\" - let me say Mr. Perry, that being strong in the strength of my innocence of having done anything when, I have not had hands for my enemies or their deviltries. They may prevail for awhile in the minds of biased and prejudiced persons, and I may suffer as many others have done through calumny. Many a good man's career has been damned, and many a happy home broken up by these filthy human scoundrels.\n\nAnd who are my enemies - C.H., a perjurer,\n\nCHIEF GEORGE HARRY - the man whom you tell a story about having given a threatening to. SECHINN, Mrs. Thompson and Arthur Freerdyngton, the people whom you have so often warned me against, and the culprits that these people were capable of doing and enacting. A letter from you in front of me as I am dictating this \"Stick to it, Mr. Cartier,\" is backed by it, and we'll show those birds a few things yet. And another enemy, Constable Bartlett, who, instead of helping you, and I, and the Department generally in our work, does nothing but paddle up and down these waters, disseminating Calumny about every one in connection with the Department, (in fact, let me say, but after myself, too, yourself, are the most maligned member by this very man) sowing seeds of discord, humiliating by his contemptible little-tittle and blather, every member of the agency other than himself. This is no idle talk on my part - no exaggeration - I'll prove every word I utter, and am prepared for and beg a complete showdown. I'll produce witnesses from Church\n\nHouse.\nHouse, Squirrel Cove, Slilnmon, Powell River, Sechelt, Vancouver New Westminster, North Vancouver, and Kamloops.\n\nIn conclusion, I earnestly ask and pray for a committee of investigation, with power to compel witnesses to attend, and evidence to be taken on oath.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) A. Hedley Gerland.\n\nP.S. I am enclosing a copy of a letter which I have this day forwarded to Mr. W.E. Ditchburn, the Indian Commissioner, for his consideration. Permit me to add, that no other communication has ever emanated from me to Mr. Ditchburn, and whatever your informant might be, is a cowardly and dastardly liar, if he says that I had done so, or even said that I had any intention of doing so.\nMR. DITCHBURN: This investigation is opened to hear Mr. Garland's complaint with regard to a letter written to him by Mr. Indian Agent Perry dated the 22nd December 1927. In order to put these matters in the records properly I shall read the Indian Agent's letter dated December 1927 and Mr. Garland's letter of complaint with regard to same dated the 14th day of January, 1928. As there are no Counsel present as there would be in the case of a regular Court I shall read these different documents over. I will now read Mr. Perry's letter:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Garland:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters, three in number, dated December 6th, 11th, and 12th., with regard to the police prosecutions which recently took place at Church House. In reply to your letter of the 8th inst. I would inform you that Mr. Rosenberg gave me verbally the details, as anticipated by your letter.\n\nIn your letter of the 11th, you have informed me that you have brought to the attention of the Hon. Attorney General the matter of certain Indians perjuring themselves and in this connection I feel that this is not a matter for my interference since the case was prosecuted by the Provincial police before you, the Stipendiary Magistrate. It is noted that you prefer that you leave the matter in my hands but I regret being in a position to interfere in this matter, and more particularly since it is understood that you have been in communication with the Indian Commissioner at Victoria in connection with the case. No doubt Mr. Ditchburn will give the matter his most careful consideration.\n\nWith regard to your statement that Moses Wilson offered you $100.00 if you would try the case in Church House instead of sending it to Powell River, I am informed that this Indian told the Deputy Constable that he had asked you what the fine would likely be, as he had only $100.00 in his possession. This also, however, is not a matter for my interference. If a bribe was offered or if the Indians perjured themselves at this time, you had all the machinery available for settling it there and then. Under the circumstances it is my opinion that these Indians will have learned their lesson by now as a result of the fines imposed upon them and I do not think any good purpose would be served now by further prosecuting the Indians on the grounds named. Should the Attorney General or Mr. Ditchburn think otherwise, they will act no doubt according to their convictions in the matter.\n\nIt has been reported to me that you have allowed Indians to sign informations and incur surety in connection with these prosecutions but...\"\narrival of the Provincial police the latter were allowed to inform and no provision was made whereby the informing Indians might receive their notices or launch expenses incurred. I should be interested to have the facts of the case. No doubt you will be applying to the Attorney General with a view to an adjustment of any legitimate expenses incurred, although the Indian Act gives the presiding magistrate the right to charge the costs of the prosecution against the convicted party. Since it is understood that the matter is in the hands of the Indian Commissioner I do not wish to interfere in this phase of the matter but simply wish to advise you of the information which has reached me. I must also advise you that I did not receive a telegram from you asking me to meet you at Powell River on the 10th inst.\n\nAs anticipated in your letter of December 11th, complaints of a very serious nature have been received both by myself and Mr. Inspector Cairns, and we have been discussing them pro and con. This matter will be dealt with in due course and in the meantime, since you have asked for permission to come to Vancouver this permission is granted, but I can not state that the Department will incur any expense in this connection. Perhaps you will advise me when you expect to be in Vancouver and I would point out that it is important that the conduct of the classroom work should not be discontinued during your absence.\n\nYours sincerely,\nC.C.Perry,Indian Agent.\"\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Do you find the reading of that letter correct, Mr. Garland?\n\nMR. GARLAND: Quite correct, sir.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: This is the reply of Mr. Garland dated January 14th, and reads as follows:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Perry:\n\nThe more I read your letter of the 22nd of December 1927 on matters relating to recent prosecutions at Church House, the more am I compelled to refrain from replying to it. Your letter is so pregnant with inaccuracies and untruths that I shudder at it. Your letter is so overflowing (read in conjunction with others that have been received from you lately) with bias and prejudice that I feel forced to write to you on my behalf, to demand from Ottawa a thorough and complete investigation into the administration of the Vancouver Agency, and more especially into the Machiavellian activities and deviltries of Constable Bartlett.\n\nMy life has been a little hell, caused by this man's calumny. Wallowing as he does, and (I understand with your connivance) amongst the filth and garbage of idle Indian gossip, suggesting to them the things that he wants them to say, and conveys them to you as reports made to him, and these are apparently (by your letter) accepted by you as truths. Why, even you in your letter...\"\nI resent it, Mr. Perry, with all the emphasis and force at my command, and I hurl the infamous, dastardly and cowardly lies told you, (that is more or less responsible for your insinuations and innuendoes) back again into the teeth of the lying scoundrel who conveyed it to you.\n\nAs for the complaints of a \"very serious nature\" - let me say Mr. Perry, that being strong in the strength of my innocence of having done anything wrong, I care not two hoots for my enemies or their deviltries. They may prevail for awhile in the minds of biased and prejudiced persons, and I may suffer as many others have done through calumny. Many a good man's career has been damned, and many a happy home broken up by these filthy human cowards.\n\nAnd who are my enemies - ONE, a perjurer, CHIEF GEORGE HARRY - the man whom you tell a story about having given a thrashing to. SECONDLY, Mrs. Thompson and Arthur Premergant, the people whom I have so often warned me against, and the evils that these people were capable of doing and emoting. A letter from you in front of me as I am dictating this \"Stick to it, Mr. Garland, stick to it, and we'll show these birds a few things yet? And my other enemy, Constable Bartlett, who, instead of helping you, and I, and the Department generally in our work does nothing but parade up and down these waters, disseminating Calumny about every one in connection with the Department, (in fact, let me say, that after myself, YOU, yourself are the most maligned member by this very man) sowing seeds of discord, humiliating by his contemptible tittle-tattle and blather, every member of the agency other than himself. This is no idle talk on my part - no exaggeration - I'll prove every word I utter, and am prepared for and beg a complete show-down. I will produce testimonies from Church House, Squirrel Cove, Slismoon, Powell River, Sechelt, Vancouver, New Westminster, North Vancouver, and Kamloops.\n\nIn conclusion, I earnestly ask and pray for a committee of investigation, with power to compel witnesses to attend, and evidence to be taken on oath.\n\nYours truly,\nA. Hedley-Garland.\n\nP.S. I am enclosing a copy of a letter which I have this day forwarded to Mr. W. E. Ditchburn, the Indian Commissioner for his consideration. Permit me to add, that no communication has ever emanated from me to Mr. Ditchburn, and whoever your informant might be is a cowardly and dastardly liar, if he says that I had done so, or even said that I had any intention of doing so.\"\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Do you find the reading of that letter correct, Mr. Garland?\n\nMR. GARLAND: Quite correct, sir.\n\nCopy of\nFebruary 6th, 1928.\n\nCopy of letter sent by Mr. Garland to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn, dated January 14th, 1928:\n\n\"Sir:\n\nI am regretfully forced to address this letter to you on account of the Machiavellian activities and deviltries exercised by Dominion Constable T. T. Bartlett, against me, and my family; disseminating lying reports and calumnies in his parading up and down the Coast in these waters, so that my existence has been made a perfect hell, through the intrigues of this officer.\n\nThe latest infamous and scurrilous report, emanating from the lips of this man, is to the effect that I and my wife are not married - that my WIFE is really my DAUGHTER - that our children are grand-children, and that I and my wife are living in a condition and state of \"incest\".\n\nMay I ask you, Sir, to name a day upon which I can meet you in Vancouver, and there thresh this man's conduct out?\n\nI earnestly beg of you to give the matter your most earnest and serious consideration, as I cannot put up with this man's infamous conduct any longer.\n\nAHG\u2014\n4 copies\n1 Mr. Perry,\n1 to Counsel.\n\nI have the honour, to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Redley-Garland.\n\nPrincipal Homalco Indian Day School.\"\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: This is the scope of this investigation, and any evidence taken must be taken on oath.\n\nOath taken by Mr. Garland.\n\nMR. GARLAND: I ask you, sir, to give me a patient hearing, to give me an impartial hearing, both of which I believe I shall obtain from you. It is necessary for me to go back again to approximately the 8th January, 1927 to tell you just what leads up to this investigation. I took over my position as an Indian Day School teacher on the 26th of April, 1926, and from that time up to October of the same year Mr. Bartlett had visited us on two or three occasions, may it not be four or three, I just forget now the number of times he visited us. Being a member of the Department we treated him with respect and courtesy. He used to come to our quarters. We made him welcome and he did one or two little things for us, such as to mend an engine for the children. He was good enough to take this engine away to repair it. He kept it for a long time, for three or four months, and we had to ask him to bring it back. He brought it back.\n\nWhenever Mr. Bartlett came to our quarters and sat down for a while he spoke in a most detrimental manner of everybody in connection with the Department, so much so that in talking with my wife afterwards we decided not to encourage Mr. Bartlett to come to our quarters so often as we did not want to get mixed up in the sayings that he was making detrimental, and we know as you would know, sir, and as others would deduce that he was maligning or little tattle other people, no doubt we in our turn would get a certain share of this...\"\nthis that at that time unknown to us.\n\nOn the 8th January I wrote to Mr. Bartlett:\n\n\"Francis Louie an Indian of the Squirrel Cove Band has come to me in my official capacity as Stipendiary Magistrate and has made the following statement. That sometime during the early part of October he killed a cougar on Cortes Island; that as you were in the vicinity at the time, he gave you this cougar skin and that you told him you would obtain for him the bounty offered by the Provincial Government. He tells me that he has seen you several times since but that he has not yet received either the skin back or the bounty. He now desires to take what legal steps may be necessary to obtain this bounty or the return of the skin. I might add that the matter is known to the Provincial Police Department at Powell River and one of the Provincial Constables was here yesterday and spoke to me concerning the matter. In other words he was making enquiries so as to take more steps, what these steps are I do not know but to clear up the matter I do wish that you would write to me by return mail giving me the full history of this affair as far as it concerns you. With kind regards, Yours truly.\"\n\nOn the 11th January I received Mr. Bartlett's reply:\n\n\"Sir,- Your letter of January 8th re Francis Louie's Cougar skin to hand and contents noted. It is ages since I received such a letter and for a while I had visions of the Penitentiary staring me in the face.\n\nYou really should get a job writing scareheads for the newspapers.\n\nNow about the cougar skin. On October 14th at Redonda Cannery, Francis Louie through William Mitchell asked me if I would take a cougar skin down to Vancouver with me when I went down and collect the bounty ($40.00) on same for him. I asked him why the skin was not taken to the Provincial Police at Powell River and was informed that the Provincial Police would not accept it. I did not want to bother with the skin as I have had lots of experience in collecting moneys for Indians in this manner and apart from the time it takes running from one office to another, I am usually out of pocket over the business.\n\nI did not return to Vancouver until Oct. 26th, and left right away for another trip. Since then I have been travelling around and had not the time or opportunity to attend to the skin until recently.\n\nI have already taken the skin to the Government Agent here who punched the ear, and I have also presented the application for the bounty. I am now awaiting the arrival of the cheque together with the skin.\n\nRe the last paragraph of your letter re the Prov. Police, I may say that Constable Boyt was with me at the Prov. Game Office yesterday when I went to make enquiries about the bounty. He did not mention anything about those mysterious \"traps\" which are to be taken against me. I may add that I saw Francis Louie at Squirrel Cove the week before Christmas, and told him the difficulty I had in obtaining the bounty. Francis Louie said it was all right no hurry.\n\nI am sending you some copies of the forms of application for bounties which you will be able to make use of future cases of this nature in your official capacity as Stipendiary Magistrate.\n\nKindest regards to everyone, Yours truly,\n\nT.T.Bartlett\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 315-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nI wrote to Mr. Bartlett on the 22nd. of January 1927 in reply to his of the 11th.:\n\n\"Sir-\n\nI have for acknowledgment the receipt of your letter dated the 11th inst., in reply to mine on the above subject.\n\nDuring my many years of service with different Governments I have never before been the recipient of such a vulgar and indecent letter. I am convinced that the Dept. of Indian Affairs would look with extreme disfavor on any of its servants no matter how menial the position that that servant held, who would suggest, write or dictate such an impudent letter, especially when addressed as official correspondence to a Stipendiary Magistrate. I shall look for an apology by next mail.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAHG-B\n\nStipendiary Magistrate.\"\n\nOn January 27th. I received another letter from Mr. Bartlett:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Garland:\n\nOn reading over my letter of January 11th. in reply to yours of January 8th. re Francis Louie's Panther skin, I have come to the conclusion that I was somewhat hasty and abrupt in the manner in which I replied.\n\nWhen reading your letter the first time it seemed to imply that I had already received the bounty for the skin and was holding out on Francis Louie, who had enlisted the services of the Provincial Police, but on looking over your letter again after mailing the one you received, I find that I was mistaken and hereby tender apologies.\n\nThe cheque for $40.00 arrived in the mail today, dated January 21st, and made payable to myself. I am sending same to Francis Louie by this steamer. The skin I intend to bring up with me on my next trip north, unless I can sell it in the meantime.\n\nI expect to visit Squirrel Cove some time next week, and if the opportunity offers, will make a trip to Church House, when, no doubt, I will be able to explain everything in connection with the matter in question.\n\nKindest regards to Mrs. Garland and family.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.F. Bartlett.\"\n\nThis was my first break with Mr. Bartlett. He apologized and I accepted his apology and thought the matter would then rest at that.\n\nThen came the Prendergast affair, which I think you know something about. Mr. Prendergast struck an Indian Constable. It happened in the early part of February 1927.\n\nMr. Nicholson\nMr. Garland stated that he had taken a trip to Powell River and there met Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson and described their conversation as follows:\n\nMR. GARLAND: Mr. Nicholson, who is teacher at Sliammon, said \"Mr. Garland I have a bone to pick with you.\" I said \"I am sorry to hear that Mr. Nicholson, what is the honest I have not met you before Nicholson,\" and he replied \"Bartlett tells me that you have had a whole mouthful to say about me that I am a drunkard, never open my school till late, that you are going to apply for my position down here and get me kicked out. What business is it of yours, Garland, if I do drink?\" I repudiated the whole thing, telling him the truth as to what Mr. Bartlett told me concerning Nicholson. \"Are you not Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson, sir, I did not know of such people being in Sliammon until Mr. Bartlett informed me.\" They then told me that Bartlett had said some bad things about me and my wife mentioning that we were now giving the children cocoa, collecting a lot of junk in the shape of tin cups, bringing on a lot of work for him and Mr. Perry and no doubt Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson would now be caused to give their Indian children cocoa too. Never, sir, did such words emanate from my lips, but Mr. Bartlett prior to the 6th of January, 1927, when he visited our quarters and when we found that he was so apt and prone to talk about others, he told me that Mr. Nicholson was a drunkard, his wife the same, was no better than she ought to be, opened the school any time from 10 to 12 a.m., locks the pupils in, if any, and goes home. Locked them in once and went home and forgot about them, the pupils got out of the window to get home. That Mr. Nicholson had suffered from delirium tremens, that Bartlett had nursed him out of the delirium tremens. That he had been absent ten days and was found at the Mission recovering from a drunken bout. Again for a week he was found wandering in Vancouver. That Nicholson padded his attendance register. That Nicholson's school was just a farce. That Mr. Perry knew about it and so did Mr. Cairns. That he, Bartlett, had given the Nicholsons armfuls of stores because they were hard up and hungry. That Nicholson was irresponsible and most undependable. That Nicholson was always more or less in a semi state of drunkenness. That he, Bartlett, gets what he calls a square at Nicholson's and repays the Nicholsons by giving them canned goods supplied to him by the Government at his own expense. Then asked me why I did not rely on Nicholson's position in the face of Nicholson's drinking but perhaps it was no use my doing so as Mr. Perry and Cairns between them would vote it. They had gone too far with Nicholson and could not go back on him now as it would lead to trouble for them.\n\nMrs. Nicholson said to me \"Mr. Garland, from what Mr. Bartlett told us about you we never wanted to meet you as we were given to understand you were a cad and not a gentleman, but to my surprise and satisfaction I find I have met a thorough gentleman.\" Mr. Nicholson made mention of several other things that I did not take any notice of at the time, because he always qualified his statement with the remark \"not quite me Garland, old man, do not quote me.\" It is within my knowledge, sir, that Constable Bartlett left Church House at 4.30 p.m. on the 15th February 1927 Sunday. He arrived at Sliammon from what Mr. Nicholson said at about 9.30 or 10 p.m. and anchored off Sliammon. That he was\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nboarded by an Indian woman named Aggie Harry, that Aggie Harry stayed on board the night with him. That Bartlett rowed ashore in the early morning and in doing so he was confronted by an Indian named Sandy Timothy. That Bartlett had told Sandy to keep his mouth shut. Nicholson said that within an hour Sandy had come to his quarters and told him all about it. Asked Mr. Nicholson if he thought Mr. Perry was a witness of Bartlett's doings and he replied \"Surely, I then said 'Why does he not take some steps to curb Bartlett then?' Mr. Nicholson said 'I will tell you why.' Mr. Garland, Mr. Perry has something on Bartlett and Bartlett something on Perry and they are both frightened of one another, they are each waiting for someone else to take the initiative so that neither one can accuse the other of giving him away. So that is why Mr. Perry took no action on the verbal complaint of Provincial Constable Sutton and Sutton did not put his complaint in writing so Perry could not show the written complaint to Constable Bartlett to clear himself from the onus.\n\nSeveral times during this recital Mr. Ditchburn asked Mr. Garland what these charges against Mr. Bartlett had to do with his complaint of \"bias and prejudice\" against Mr. Perry. Mr. Garland replied that it all led up to that and he was trying to explain why Mr. Bartlett had behaved so to him since then. Mr. Ditchburn also asked for direct evidence instead of hearsay evidence, which Mr. Garland was giving. Mr. Garland also stated he could tell things that Mr. Bartlett had said about Mr. Perry and Mr. Garland.\n\nMR. GARLAND: After that, sir, I went back again to Church House and the matter so troubled me that I wrote to Mr. Bartlett on February 19th, 1927:\n\n\"Sir:\n\nWere anyone to ask me what were the two greatest hidden menaces to Society at the present day, I would at once answer 'Blackmail and Calumny.' In a recent denunciation of the crime of blackmail, the Chief Justice of B.C. put it on the same footing as assassination, while another very prominent Judge called it one of the cancers of civilization. Calumny, the cousin-german of Blackmail, is a mere insidious and treacherous form of mental debauchery. In blackmail there is generally good ground and often evidence for the allegations, but in calumny in nearly all cases there is no ground at all for the insinuations and cruel imbecilities. The blackmailer generally runs to earth and receives heavy and deserved punishment, the foxy calumniator generally runs into effect while his victims suffer terribly. Just now in Church House we are awaiting with some anxious apprehension the return of the mosquito - that stinging, ubiquitous nuisance - which drives people frantic with uneasiness and discontent. But we thank God that the insect is moribund and inert for the greater part of the year. The mosquito plies his mischievous trade while the sun shines and the swamps exude their putrescent miasma. On the other hand the calumniator flourishes in the dark throughout the year. He thrives on the garbage of his own ill-functioned and diseased mind. He is usually an ill-bred fellow and seethes with jealousy at the other fellow's success. He is the personification of the dog in the manger. His usual method is to rest on to tell idle gossip, with the object of magnifies and plaintively in lurid colours and then disseminates secretly and maliciously. He is the poison gas expert of society, and the fumes from his devilishly sling bombs are as murderous and the effects as far-reaching as ever were those of the Germans on the battlefields of Flanders.\"\nThe burglar, the hold-up man, and the brigand are gentlemen to him. The highwayman of old came out in the open, the victims' loss was merely temporal and remediable; the criminals generosity and fame were sung in ballads and praised in folk lore. What can we say of the calumniator? He works in the dark and the wounds he inflicts are deadly. He rarely over-steps the barbed wire entanglements of criminal libel. When trapped or confronted with his victim he utters pallid excuses, cringes like a leprous hound and falters.\n\nWe all despise the female gossip who hangs over the neighbors' wall; we should doubly condemn and treat as a pestilence the male gossip who ruins his fellow man with his ever-ready tongue. Proverbs of all countries tell us \"beware of the man who goes amongst his fellows with a loose tongue.\" Countless suicides, impoverished and unhappy homes, stunted and distorted lives are some of the results of the calumniators' trade. His stings are as fatal to man as those of the tse-tse fly to animals.\n\nAnanias and Sapphira were calumniators when God struck them dead. It would be a happier world today if these two had been the last of their vile species.\n\nDuring the Winter a quaint little trio of figures representing three monkeys sitting in similar poses were on sale in the fifteen cent stores of the City of Vancouver. Every calumniator amongst us should have purchased one of these made idols and bowed down to these figures in repentance and deep reverence. The figures exemplify in the monkey what should be the cardinal virtues in every uprighteous man, \"Speak no evil, see no evil, hear no evil.\"\n\nAnd, as in society and amongst larger congregations of the human species, so it is in smaller communities and organizations. We know that a worm will sink a ship or destroy a castle sufficed if given time enough. In like fashion will the cancer of the calumniator spread through and putrefy the foundations of good fellowship, and comradeship, upon which all friendly groups, societies and associations are built. The plagues of suspicion and discontent, the fires of jealousy and greed, fanned by the foul breath of the liar and malignant - have at every stage of history been the chief destroying factors in the lives of the nations, communities, organizations and associations. Let us always remember the immortal words of the great Shakespeare \"He who steals my purse steals trash; but he who filches from me my good name, steals that which not enriches him, but leaves me poor indeed.\"\n\nIn conclusion I hope that this letter will be of some benefit to you. At the same time I must request that in your peregrinations up and down the Coast, you will refrain from using my name, or that of my wife, or any member of my family, in the manner that you have done, or I regret that I shall be compelled to take some steps to prevent you.\n\nAHG\u2014Yours truly,\n\nA.H.-Garland.\"\n\nI wrote to Mr. Perry, sir, and I sent that letter to Mr. Bartlett but for some reason which my wife will explain to you, she held that back and wrote to Mr. Perry giving, I believe, some reason for holding it back. I do not know the reason, sir, today. However, I came in to Vancouver to see the Crown Prosecutor and on the evening of my arrival here I saw Mr. Perry. Mr. Perry brought\nbrought up this letter and asked me what it was that Bartlett had been doing. I told Mr. Perry, I recited to Mr. Perry what Mr. Nicholson had conveyed to me. Mr. Perry, if I remember rightly, told me that he knew Bartlett's weakness; that Mr. Bartlett was skating on thin ice; that Mr. Bartlett had been brought up on an charge before but that at the last moment the charge had fallen through, through some Indians not appearing; or it was I think that it was New Year's time and they said let the thing pass, it was Happy New Year, and we will drop the affair against Mr. Bartlett. However, Mr. Perry said to me \"Mr. Garland, you send that letter to Mr. Bartlett. It will do him good.\" So that I sent the letter some little time afterwards to Mr. Bartlett. This is Mr. Bartlett's reply, sir, I can not read it out:\n\n\"March 16th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of February 15th, which reached this office on March 15th, and must confess that am at a loss to understand what it is all about. It is years since I read such wretched drivel, and then the letter, which compared very favourably with yours, was written by an inmate of the Provincial Mental Home at Essondale.\n\nFrom the general wording of your letter, it would appear that you had swallowed a dictionary, and I would suggest that you take a good dose of castor oil. If that doesn't relieve you, try a good stiff dose of carbolic acid which would be better still.\n\nI am afraid you are getting to be like other people who, for some reason best known to themselves, live in out-of-the-way places where every bit of gossip (which you condemn so severely in your letter) is seized upon with the result that a mountain is made out of a mole hill.\n\nI have a pretty good idea as to the identity of the Party who started this controversy, in fact I heard that someone had been blabbing, so your letter was not unexpected. You quoted quite a lot of legal drivel in your letter but you evidently forgot the old saying that person is innocent until proven guilty. You heard one side of the story, and without hearing the other have already passed judgment, such as it is. Is it not possible that I was misquoted? I have always had the greatest respect for Mrs. Garland and Bibby, and admit that I did not encourage the boys as they were constantly \"butting in\" making private conversations impossible, and have made no secret of this.\n\nWhilst the letter itself was, to say the least, very insulting, parts of it were very humorous, especially lines 22 and 23 of the first paragraph. What on earth are you today that any sane person would \"seeth with jealousy\" at your success. It is to laugh.\n\nIt would be quite interesting to know whether your letter was written (to use a favourite phrase of yours) in your capacity as Stipendiary Magistrate, or in your capacity as third class teacher of an Indian School, and a Day School at that.\n\nIn conclusion I would suggest that when you arise in the morning, look first at the cliff back of the village and then at your own reflection in the looking glass, and repeat to yourself, \"There's another 'BIG BLUFF'\".\n\nAs to my...\"\nAs to my opinion of yourself and your domineering manner, the less said the better. I hope this letter will be of some benefit to you and, if I were you, I would make a few enquiries or at least hear both sides of a question before writing insulting letters to people who have tried to help you out as well as they were able, without as much as a \"THANK YOU.\"\n\nYours etc.,\nT.T.Bartlett.\n\nWell, sir, I do not wish to make any recriminations but I would like to just tell you the things which Mr. Bartlett has said in my presence, frequently in the presence of my wife and frequently in the presence of my children who are aged 11, 12 and 13 and if it was possible for me to bring those little children here I would have brought them. They understand what an oath is. Many are the things they can corroborate that I will relate to you that he has told us about Mr. Perry; that Mr. Perry was a fourflusher and a liar.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Mr. Garland, I wrote to you on the 27th, with regard to your letter about Mr. Bartlett making a statement about yourself and your wife and I stated I read these over carefully and that I understood that Mr. Bartlett had given you an apology for making a statement which was no correct.\n\nMr. Garland asked if he could publish this apology. Mr. Ditchburn replied he believed so. Mr. Garland stated he was not satisfied with the letter and was not through with this matter yet.\n\nMr. Ditchburn again requested Mr. Garland to leave his charges against Mr. Bartlett till later, and state his complaint against Mr. Perry.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: I want you to point out to me wherein Mr. Perry in his letter of the 22nd December 1927 has shown bias and prejudice and told untruths that he is accepting information given to him by a third party and taking them as truths.\n\nMR. GARLAND: I want to know what is Mr. Perry's definition of a fact.\n\nMR. PERRY: I should say a fact was the embodiment of the truth.\n\nMR. GARLAND: The embodiment of the truth, an event, a reality. Then may I ask you to turn to my letter of the 11th December paragraph 4.\n\nA considerable period of time was taken up by Mr. Garland in explaining that his statement in his letter of the 11th December \"I am bringing to the attention of the Attorney General, etc.\" did not mean as stated in Mr. Perry's letter of December 22nd, \"You have informed me that you have brought to the attention, etc.\" This, Mr. Garland maintained was an untruth on Mr. Perry's part.\n\nMr. Garland also stated he could not understand how the pros and cons could be discussed between Mr. Perry and Mr. Caissie as they had only one side of the matter to discuss, viz: the charges which the Indians had made and that they had not heard his side of it.\nMR. DITCHBURN: Mr. Perry has stated to you in that letter of information brought to his attention. Just as you have told me that information was brought to you by Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson. Simply says \"It has been reported....\" Now wherein has Mr. Perry lied in this respect.\n\nI want definite information on a statement made by yourself in which you complain of a portion of Mr. Perry's letter. A definite statement of information made to him.\n\nWith regard to the perjury matter, his assumption that you have brought the attention of the Attorney General - and the statement in your letter of the 14th, that you said you were drawing to the attention ....\n\nMR. GARLAND: Mr. Rosenberg gave Mr. Perry the full details in connection with this and Mr. Perry after receiving the first hand details of the affair wrote to me \"Mr. Rosenberg has given me an account of the trouble between ..........\". Now Mr. Bartlett comes down, he was not present at the cases, who although he was sent for to come did not come, and conveys something to Mr. Perry, which Mr. Perry apparently by his letter believes. He writes to me in this way \"I am informed ....$100........\"\n\nMr. Garland read the following from his book of notes:\n\n\"4:15 p.m., Monday, 5th December 1927, Moses Wilson, the defendant in two cases to be tried before me tomorrow, the 6th instant, has come to me in the school room and asked me to try the cases here in Church House and not to send them to Powell River to be tried. He asked me to help him and not to send him to prison and he will give me $100.00 when he gets his cheque for his boom. I told him to get out of the school room at once and not to come near me again.\"\n\nThis was written down within one minute of the time when the Indian said this. The door of the room was wide open and my wife was standing there at the time.\n\nMoses Wilson in the presence of his son Albert Wilson who speaks and reads English well has made this affidavit.\n\nA copy of this affidavit not left by Mr. Garland.\n\nMr. Ditchburn: What has this to do with Mr. Perry? Mr. Perry is simply referring to this charge of bribery. The information he has ..... and simply came to ask if the fine would cost more than $100.00.\n\nMR. GARLAND: Why should Mr. Perry write in that manner. He accepts Mr. Bartlett's reports as being true, sometimes a verbal report and written report, and either way Mr. Perry must accept.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: I have been well on to 20 years with the Indians we never take it as truth from an Indian without corroboration. It is supposed to be a statement by an Indian to Mr. Bartlett and conveyed to the Indian Agent by Mr. Bartlett.\nMR. GARLAND: \"And these are apparently by your letter accepted as truths.\"\nHe writes me a letter of commendation on my report and then he writes me another letter. Mr. Perry must have accepted both reports, as being true, by Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Bartlett.\n\nMR. PERRY: In this letter I invite you to give me the facts of this case.\nIn that letter I was simply seeking to know the facts of the case.\n\nMR. GARLAND: You just say you invite me but in no other portion of your letter could I read an invitation to report.\nOtherwise he would never have written me a letter of commendation.\n\nMR. PERRY: I wrote you a letter upon the report of the cases from the Provincial Police, and then I received the other information and I wrote you with regard to other details.\n\nMR. GARLAND: \"It is understood that you have been in communication with the Indian Commissioner.\" Where does Mr. Perry get this information? Does that not bear out my statement that Mr. Perry accepts these reports as truths.\nIt is a link in the chain.\n\nMr. Ditchburn: Is there anything very serious\n\nMR. GARLAND: There is nothing very serious. It is not a correct statement\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: I may say how this came to Mr. Perry's knowledge was through a visit I made on the 15th December, in which I took up with Mr. Garland his making a demand on behalf of Indians for moieties and with regard to the use of a boat, through a report received by the Provincial Police submitted by yourself. He told me that he did not make any application for these moieties in his own behalf but on behalf of the Indians as he had been told the Indians had first of all made this information and that this Indian Willie Francis conveyed the information down to Squirrel Cove. Mr. Bartlett then wrote me his report on the matter, and he never did claim moieties on behalf of himself but he did speak of it on behalf of the Indians.\nThat is how Mr. Perry understood it was in my hands.\nI took it up because the Indian was entitled to expenses for his boat; and the question as to who really laid informations will be gone into later.\n\nMR. GARLAND: How can Mr. Perry write this to me.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: I asked you if that was very serious.\n\nMR. GARLAND: It is an incorrect statement conveyed to Mr. Perry by whom.\nMR. GARLAND: It is in obscurity. I am in the dark, and whoever it is, it is an untruth.\n\na message sent to Mr. Ewart on December 3rd, at 11.30.\n\n\"Mr. Ewart will you please send the following message, you receive it to Constable Sutton, Provincial Police, Powell River. Will you please send your police boat with two constables to Church House immediately upon receipt of this message. Serious disturbance here, Saturday. Heavy drinking. Better perhaps you wire Dawson. Urgent. Signed Garland, S.M., Church House.\" Should Constable Bartlett be at Squirrel Cove instruct him to proceed here immediately.\"\n\nThat was part of my letter to Mr. Ewart.\n\nI have an affidavit from Willie Francis before Mr. Bartlett left Church House on 28th or 29th of November. This happened on the 3rd.\n\nThat if Mr. Bartlett was at Squirrel Cove to bring him back again on his boat.\n\nCopy of this affidavit not left by Mr. Garland.\n\nMR. PERRY: I have accepted as truths I have no reason to think he was telling me things that were not true.\n\nMR. GARLAND: I have an affidavit here signed by Marian Harry and Bernadette Paul:\n\n\"We, Marian Harry, wife of Peter Harry, and Bernadette Paul, wife of Temmy Paul, and daughter of Peter Harry, Indians of Church House, do solemnly declare,\n\nThat during the month of December when Constable Bartlett was here, that he traded with us an old overcoat and two pairs of old cloth boots for one large basket tray that we made. This basket tray if we sold it at Powell River to white people, we would get not less than eight dollars, perhaps ten or eleven. Constable Bartlett tell us that he come up again soon and he bring some more clothes and boots, and that we must make plenty of big baskets, trays, and other things, when he will give us clothes for them.\n\nAnd we make this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing it to be true, and knowing that it is of the same force and effect, as if made under oath, and by virtue of the \"Canada Evidence Act.\"\n\nBernadette Paul\n\nDeclared before me at Church House this Third day of January A.D. 1928.\n\nA. Hadley Garland. Stipendiary Magistrate.\n\nAlex Paul. Witness.\"\n\nMR. GARLAND: I ask you, sir, with a knowledge of these things if I have not been goaded in take the steps which I have taken.\n\nMr. Perry's attitude towards me has altered greatly since June 1927; prior to June 1927, Mr. Perry has always supplied me with stamps, and very kind of him to do so, he has always sent that if I needed stamps at any time.\nMR. GARLAND: and he had sent me several, in all I cannot tell you but in all three or four dollars worth.\n\nWhen I came back from my vacation and I wrote him and asked the courtesy be extended to me as in the past and that he would be good enough to send me some stamps, but I was turned down.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Any other complaint?\n\nMR. GARLAND: I wrote to Mr. Perry again, sir, on September 17th, rather a long letter in connection with the estimates. I said that \"the time has in my opinion arrived when the Government should ......,\" and asked the building of new quarters for the school teacher, that during the recent rains the roof on the western side of the house leaked badly, we had to use receptacles of all kinds to catch the water and prevent the toilet at the back of the house collapsed entirely, fell backwards. I do not know how long since it was erected we are not getting\n\nI also drew his attention to the repair of a pipe which I had been trying to get repaired and only practically twelve months, and destroyed some of our medical comforts.\n\nI got a reply dated September 20th, from Mr. Perry: \"With regard to the closet to which you refer it is considered that you are making too much of a very little ....\"\n\nThere was nothing more painful and I felt there must be something\n\nI said again \"Once again I would draw your attention to the water ......,\" which I thought really could be done and that I had been trying since some time in that year, Nine months had passed away and could not get this pipe and that Mr. Perry's attitude had turned against me.\n\n\"In view of your position in this and other matters .....\" Reading that letter as a whole, sir, is very painful to me I felt that Mr. Perry had turned against me.\n\nwhere a lady and little children are concerned.\n\nYet to this day I have never received what these charges, are, who made them, and I cannot understand how the pros and cons can be I have never known who made the charges officially or what the charges are.\n\nCopy of letter dated September 17th, not left here by Mr. Garland nor copy of Mr. Perry's reply.\nMR. GARLAND: I would like to make myself somewhat understood, sir; I have no desire and I do not wish to speak in a spirit of vindictiveness, nothing is more remote from my mind than to be offensive; all I ask is truth and fair play; those things being understood there should be no matters crop up which would create any difficulties in this present investigation.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: I am here for the purpose of holding an investigation of these charges you make. You are a party to this and shall have absolute fair play from myself. It is not the first investigation I have held. I know the usual Court procedure is the insistence of fair play to all parties concerned.\n\nMR. GARLAND: I think, sir, up to as far as we have gone I have proved that Mr. Perry when he wrote to me on December 22nd; The letter of December 11th. \"I am drawing the attention of the Attorney-General\" and Mr. Perry's letter of 22nd. of December, in which he states \"you have informed me that you have brought to the attention ... etc.\", that I have proved was not said in my letter of January 14th. Why even you in your letter say untruths. I maintain that what I said in my letter of January 14th. is true; that Mr. Perry did tell an untruth in his letter. It may be recorded as a technical untruth but nevertheless the fact remains on Mr. Perry's own definition of a fact that a fact was an established truth. Neither did I convey in my letter that I had brought to the attention of the Attorney General. Mr. Perry admitted yesterday the he had taken statements verbal or written from Mr. Bartlett as being true. I said that in my letter \"and I hurl the infamous ......... .....to you.\"\n\nMr. Perry admitted that he believed these things which Mr. Bartlett had told him. I maintain that I have shown bias and prejudice in the letter written to me by Mr. Perry on the 22nd. of December. I said in my letter: \"Your letter is so overflowing (read in conjunction with others that have been received from you lately) with bias and prejudice.\" I maintain, sir, that that letter is biased and prejudiced. I maintain, sir, that bias and prejudice has been exhibited when Mr. Perry wrote to me and said that he and Mr. Cairns had been discussing the pros and cons of a very serious nature that had been made against me. I have never to this day received any information what those charges are, who they were made by and what support there is or has been obtained to give them credit.\n\nRelying on Mr. Bartlett's reports as being true, Mr. Perry wrote and said that I had allowed Indians to sign informations and incur expenditure in connection with these prosecutions. I did allow the Indian to sign and never permitted anybody to incur expenditure. Neither the Criminal Code nor the Summary Conviction Act of British Columbia permit me to allow anybody to incur expenditure. The fees in which costs are permitted are stated in the Summary Conviction Act and in the Criminal Code, and I am not permitted to exceed those. They allow witness fees, they allow constable fees, and they allow magistrates, and those are the only fees which I am permitted to allow.\nam permitted to incur. I have a police constable, an Indian police constable who is placed on the reserve for a specific purpose of keeping order. My nearest white constable is 40 miles away from me. I have no telegraph office, the mail comes in and leaves again but once a week. Am I not permitted to use that constable when it is necessary to use him in the interest of peace and justice, to send him down and solicit aid from the Dominion constable or from the Provincial police whomever is the nearest, whenever I can get hold of.\n\nCosts are not payable to the magistrate who is trying the case neither does he dare put on any form that the costs are due to him. The costs of the case are due to the informants. He makes out the costs and hands them to the magistrate and they are placed in that man's name, not in the magistrate's name. I was duty bound to use the Indian constable. Murder might have been committed that night. They were howling and yelling until 2:30 in the morning. I had no other alternative. We will leave that case alone for a few minutes, sir, and I will refer to a letter written to me dated June 2nd.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Mr. Perry had stated \"you allowed Indians ..........by them.\" You have dealt with the question of launch expenses but you have not given us any information for record with regard to what took place.\n\nMR. GARLAND: I was in bed and fast asleep; my wife was still up. There was a knocking at the door, somewhere about 11 o'clock. My wife went to the door and before opening the door she called out \"Who is there?\" He said \"Chief Harry.\" Chief Harry came to report to me that the men were drinking and he mentioned Peter Harry. I said \"Are you sure he is drinking Chief?\" knowing the man is a liar. \"You are quite sure he is drunk?\" \"Come here Chief.\" I made out the information. I put him on his oath that Peter Harry was drunk and he gave me the names of his witnesses. I wrote them down at the corner of the information, who he would verify his statement that Peter Harry was drinking - himself, Noel George, his son, Theresa, his daughter, and Annie Wilson, another daughter.\n\nImmediately after that Willie Francis and George Francis, father and son, came reported that Moses Wilson was drunk, that he had been fighting with Mr. Rosenberg, the painter man, he was up there at the time, that windows and doors were being broken, a quantity of paint had been upset and things were getting serious. I then said to Willie Francis: \"Get your boat. Take this letter down to Mr. Ewart.\" The letter in which I sent a telegram to the Provincial Police at the same time telling Mr. Ewart if Mr. Boutilier was in Squirrel Cove to come up at once. I sent for Mr. Rosenberg. They told me that in the scuffle he ran out of the room and they did not know where he was. I sent for Mr. Rosenberg and after a little while they found him and he came up to my quarters in a very excited condition, which was justified. He told me that Moses Wilson had threatened to blinder his eyes. I looked up the Criminal Code for assault. I wrote out what I thought would be correct, Mr. Rosenberg signed the two. Afterwards in reading it over the second time came to the conclusion that my wording was not full enough and perhaps might be technically incorrect if the case was appealed. I sat down and wrote what I thought was the clearer definition of the assault, and the next morning on reading it over again I found then that perhaps I was not exactly correct of the charge as laid and with the assistance\nassistance of Constable Boyt I wrote again another charge of assault which was signed by Mr. Rosenberg, that is the one upon which Hose Wilson was charged; the other two were destroyed.\n\nMr. Garland then referred to the Provincial Police.\n\nMR. GARLAND: They came in in the night unknown to me and made their own investigation and laid the information next morning. There is a letter on record by which Provincial Constables should lay the information themselves and so prevent the granting of moieties, or it is worded something like that and issued by the Attorney-General's Department or some Department.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: You have given us a good explanation. Your explanation confirms what Mr. Perry has stated; \"It has been reported to me that you allowed Indians to sign informations and incur expenditures in connection with these prosecutions but that upon arrival of the Provincial police the latter were allowed to inform and no provision was made whereby the informing Indians might receive their moieties or launch expenses incurred by them.\"\n\nIn your letter you took exception to Mr. Perry's statement, now the information you just gave us with regard to this matter \"and no provision was made whereby the informing Indians.......\"\n\nThe information you have given bears it out very fully. You allowed Chief Harry to lay information and Willie Francis to go from Church House to Squirrel Cove to carry a message to the Provincial police.\n\nMR. GARLAND: No provision was made, no provision was permitted me, no application was made for moietry. It is not my duty as a presiding magistrate to apply for a moietry.\n\nChief Harry was a party to one case and when brought up denied that Peter Harry was drunk, all witnesses denied everything. In open Court I dressed them down, thereby incurring his anger.\n\nI was going to refer, sir, to a letter which was addressed to me by Mr. Perry, dated June 2, 1927, in which Mr. Perry said \"I am going up to Squirrel Cove by Saturday's boat on the 4th inst., the 4th day of June and I shall come to Church House probably Monday. I would like to meet the people before they go fishing and expect to be in the neighborhood several days.\" Mr. Perry actually came up on the 5th of May. Mr. Cairns called on Sunday May 8th. I was rather surprised that Mr. Perry should write and say he expected to be in the neighborhood for several days. Mr. Perry had called on the reserve once before that during my stay in Church House. Mr. Perry arrived around about lunch time and came up to the school house for a few minutes talk, saying he was going back to the boat to have his dinner and arranged that a meeting with the Indians should be held in the school room about 2. The meeting was held and the purport of the meeting was in connection with the painting of the houses and prospective electric light plant.\n\nThe meeting was adjourned until 7 o'clock that night. We met again, the Indians came up to the schoolroom. Half-past seven, Mr. Perry did not come. Eight o'clock came, the Indians were getting fidgety. We went down to get Mr. Perry, and he came up. The meeting was carried on, finished, and the Indians went away. Mr. Perry asked me to take a walk with him which I did we walked down a little piece when he told me that an coming\nup to the meeting at seven o'clock he had been waylaid by the Chief and taken into his house and there an affidavit had been sworn to by the Chief's daughter to the effect that I had given the Chief's daughter some rum in a medicine bottle. Mr. Perry knew all about this from long before he came up to Church House yet no intimation nor word had been written to me by Mr. Perry about what the Chief had said. From what Mr. Perry had told me afterwards, the day that Mr. Cairns visited the school house on his inspection when Chief Harry was rowing him out in his boat to board the steamer, the Chief told Mr. Cairns that I had given his daughter some rum in a bottle and said \"Do not say anything about it.\"\n\nSo that Mr. Perry was cognizant of these things yet never wrote a letter to me about it.\n\nIt is surprising that Mr. Perry should write and say that he expected to be in the neighborhood for several days for there was nothing of great import to keep Mr. Perry in the vicinity of Church House for several days.\n\nThe affidavit of Annie Wilson was taken by Mr. Perry without asking me to come down and be present and I was not a 100 yards away and I was not given an opportunity to know anything that might have been said particularly in private. I can not look upon Mr. Perry's conduct as other than being biased and prejudiced. I spoke to him when he got down to the approach near the wharf.\n\nI offered to resign \"You can accept my resignation immediately and then give me another opportunity to clear myself in full of this matter or other matters.\n\nPermit the affair to remain in abeyance as I had heard something of this and I came to the conclusion that this was a little conspiracy that was going on at the present time between the Thompson-Prendergast and Chief Harry combination. The most disgusting incident occurred while we were standing outside of Chief Harry's son's door, if you remember. We walked back to my quarters and Mr. Perry said \"Here is the affidavit, I believe you.\" Mr. Bartlett, you grab hand that rum over to Mr. Garland.\" and Mr. Bartlett handed me over the rum.\n\nMr. Perry was justified in taking the action that he did because since Annie Wilson came to me in the presence of my wife and made the following declaration.\n\n(The affidavit or copy not left here by Mr. Garland)\n\nShe came to me voluntarily and stated it had worried and agitated her.\n\nIn the absence of Mr. Perry not giving me any information as to the charges made apparently some time before through the intermediary of Mr. Cairns, I can not help but look upon Mr. Perry's actions, and his letters read in conjunction, can come to no other conclusion but there is some prejudice.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN would want to find out first whether information supplied to me by a second person was correct. After I had received sufficient information to assume that the information was correct I would then notify you of the complaint against you and have the whole matter investigated.\n\nAs a Magistrate the case comes up before you, no magistrate will take hearsay evidence.\n\nMR. GARLAND: To take an affidavit of a man who is only 100 yards.\n\nI do not think it is good procedure.\nMR. GARLAND: Is it good procedure to discuss the pros and cons without giving the facts? How can they be in possession of the facts of the case.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: They were discussed between two departmental officials, your superior officers. The Department's officials have a perfect right to discuss any matters.\n\nThe fact that they have not taken any action yet\n\nMR. GARLAND: I know that a recent complaint has been made against the school teacher in Sliammon, on a letter written by the Chief and Willie John and Mr. Perry went to Sliammon on January 5th. If Mr. Perry deals with the case so rapidly ...... and two months passed by without my having any notice of the charges and who brought the charges does there not appear to be discrimination. Does it not appear to be prejudice.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: It might have been better had the charges been dealt with soon after they were received, although the Department is sure of its ground before it proceeds.\n\nMR. GARLAND: In my talks on one occasion in which Mr. Perry visited our reservation he was explaining to me the best method in which to handle Indians at a meeting. That he knew before hand the subject matter which they intended to bring up, that before they had the opportunity of bringing the matter up he took the bull by the horns. If that is right in that case why should it not be right in this case. Why was not the bull taken by the horns at once and threshed out.\n\nI think, sir, by the letter I have read to you and the explanation I have made that I was justified in writing in my letter \"Read in conjunction with other correspondence\" that I had received from Mr. Perry that bias and prejudice was being shown against me for some reason unknown to me but which I can only conclude as Mr. Perry admitted that he has taken verbal reports and written reports from Mr. Bartlett as being the truth and that he became biased and prejudiced.\n\nI will refer to some correspondence in connection with relief that is being supplied to our indigent Indians by Mr. Gerrard the storekeeper of Stuart Island. Under date of December 22nd, Mr. Perry thanks me for receiving the account of Mr. Gerrard, and that he would advise me that a complaint was made to Constable Bartlett when at Church House by Chief Harry and others.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Chief Harry tried to make out that the goods supplied by Mr. Gerrard were not good, and Mr. Perry took it up with you. You made an investigation and found that the fleur was the same as used by yourself and the goods supplied by Mr. Gerrard up to standard.\n\nThis letter\nMR. GARLAND: This letter was written on December 22nd, and I take it was written on a verbal report made by Constable Bartlett to Mr. Perry.\n\nMR. PERRY: That is correct.\n\nMR. GARLAND: So that you accept Mr. Bartlett's reports as being true. Nearly a month after that he writes \"I may add that as none of the Indians receiving relief made such complaint I was under the impression that the Chief was making a complaint for them ....... He makes a verbal report and .... Mr. Perry writes to me and says........ And yet almost a month afterwards on January 18th. \"None of the Indians receiving relief made such a complaint.\" Who are the others, he either exaggerated in his report or he told an untruth.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: I do not get the connection.\n\nMR. GARLAND: I am proving that he accepted reports from Mr. Bartlett as being the truth when they turn out to be absolutely false.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Was there no merit in the question whatever? In the statement given to the Agent by the Constable that the Chief claimed the goods supplied by Mr. Garland were not up to standard. You are trying to tell me that Mr. Bartlett had no right to.....\n\nMR. GARLAND: The verbal report and the written report is more or less contradictory.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: How does that affect you?\n\nMR. GARLAND: I am trying to prove, sir, that Mr. Perry has been rather impulsive instead of writing to find out whether they were facts, sir, or not.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Did not Mr. Perry write and ask you to report.\n\nMR. GARLAND: He did write and ask me for a report.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: If you are taking the stand that the Indian Agent has no business to take any cognisance of a verbal statement of information conveyed to him by one of the Indians.....\n\nMR. GARLAND: I did not say that, sir, he has the right to believe me or the constable or disbelieve, but I am drawing your attention to the difference of the matter contained in both these letters, one written a month after the other, which is quite clear.\n\n(Mr. Garland, reading from a letter of Jany. 21st)\n\"I am quite satisfied that the goods ......... must simply be taken for what.......\"\nSo that Chief Harry is in Mr. Perry's estimation a liar.\n\nIf that\nMR. GARLAND: If that is the case why should we go to the trouble of listening to what Chief Harry says detrimental about anything or anybody.\n\nIn summing up, sir, I think I have upheld my letter. I think I have proved anything I have said in my letter to Mr. Perry. One might regard it as a technical untruth. If it is not true, then it is untrue. I think that Mr. Perry for some reason or other has become biased and prejudiced.\n\nI think I have shown that perhaps Mr. Perry was too prone to listen to statements with regard to myself which were detrimental, which if he had given more consideration he would not have written to me in the manner in which he has done. It has caused this little trouble.\n\nI know that men are built and constituted differently. Some are able to keep quiet and smooth, others have an impulsive and hasty nature, and sit down on the spur of the moment and write things which if they had given the subject matter a little more consideration they would never have penned those lines. That, I think, sir, has really been the cause of my trouble.\n\nSince I have been at Church House I have done my duty as conscientiously as God would permit me to do. If I take up anything I have to do it with the whole of the energy I have. I can not sit idle. Our medical work has been a success and a great success. I have not to call in qualified aid at all to look after any of our cases. I wrote to Mr. Perry on one occasion and asked him for our own safety .... as Dr. Henderson had never visited the reserve to see what we were capable of doing. Dr. Henderson did so and on leaving he said \"Why do they send me up here, Mr. Garland, you are doing fine.\" No persons have died.\n\nIn the early part of November when Mr. Bartlett was with Mr. Rosenberg, we spoke to Mr. Bartlett about some toys for the school children and what Mr. Perry was doing in connection with the matter. He said he did not know. I asked him as he was going back to Vancouver if he would draw it to the attention of Mr. Perry. We were speaking to a responsible employee of the Department, naturally concluded he would convey as he promised to do our desires in the matter to Mr. Perry. He told us he did not think we would get the usual ten dollars, in fact he did not think we would get anything at all. True, we got nothing at all, but by dint of hard work on the part of my wife I am most happy to say that at the last moment we were in the position to obtain 72 toys which were given to us by friends of ours in Winnipeg, in Vancouver and by some of the merchants whom the Indians were in the habit of dealing with. We had a little Christmas tree and gave them their toys. It will give you some idea of the respect in which we are held by the Indians in spite of these charges of a serious nature, that we were the recipients of many baskets brought up to us by women, in many instances by the little children who are attending our school. That on New Year's night we were asked if we would go down to their Community Hall and be present at a little show the\n\nIndians\nMR. GARLAND: Indians were giving at 8 o'clock at night. The place was covered with snow and I said \"No, I have no desire to break my collarbone.\" Within ten minutes every man in the village was up with shovels, picks, etc., and cleared a pathway to the Community Hall, and sprinkled the way with ashes to insure the presence of my wife and children. On coming away, even on Saturday and they thought we were not coming back again they cried, one man saying \"You stay! I worry you do not stay, which way you not go I hang.\"\n\nI have always received commendation from Mr. Perry for my work, from our Priests who have visited the reservation. I believe that I have given the School Inspector satisfaction in the duties which I have had to perform. My trouble has been brought about entirely by one man, that is another phase of the trouble, Mr. Bartlett.......\n\nthere are some pictures as having drawn them in my quarters, I wonder does he remember the circumstances under which he drew them on the evening of September 1926 in our quarters, caricaturing Mr. Perry, ridiculing him and Mr. Cairns, Miss Delaney and Constable Sutton of the Provincial Police, in the presence of my children and the presence of my wife.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: That is an allegation against Mr. Bartlett and has nothing to do with the charges you laid against the Indian Agent.\n\nENQUIRY ADJOURNED TO THE AFTERNOON OF FEBRUARY 7th. 1928.\n\n------------------------\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Mr. Perry will kindly give an explanation of the reasons for his writing this letter to you of the 22nd. of December and the reason why he took exception to the statements made in Mr. Garland's letter of the 14th. January to him.\n\nMr. Garland's letter states that Mr. Perry's letter is so pregnant with inaccuracies and untruths that he shudders at it, and so overflowing with bias and prejudice, and also that Mr. Perry states untruths, further that in Mr. Perry's letter of 22nd. December he insinuates that Mr. Garland is a liar.\n\nMR. PERRY: This year, Mr. Commissioner is my twentieth year in the Service and this is the first time that I have been involved in an investigation of this nature, and I am exceedingly sorry that this unpleasant matter is coming up now.\n\nI received from the Provincial Police at Powell River a letter dated December 7th. relating to prosecutions of Indians at Church House following a drunken brawl and fracas on the Komaloo Reserve at Church House on or about the 3rd. of December last.\n\nI acknowledged this letter, thanking the Provincial Police.\n\nI received\nI received a letter from Mr. Garland dated December 8th, 1927:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Perry:-\n\nMr. Rosenberg will no doubt have arrived in Vancouver, and have interviewed you before you receive this letter. You will therefore now be in possession of the details of the disgraceful affair that happened on this reservation on Saturday, in which Mr. Rosenberg would appear to have been the butt. There is no necessity for me to record the occurrence, as Mr. Rosenberg will have related the whole affair to you, at least he said that he would do so.\n\nYours truly.\"\n\nI received a letter from Mr. Garland dated December 11th, 1927:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Perry:-\n\nAt the recent trial of Moses Wilson et al for drunkenness and assault, Chief George Harry very badly perjured himself.\n\nOn the Saturday night, December 3rd, when the affair happened, he came to me and reported that Peter Harry was drunk. Knowing the infamous liar that he is I warned him, in the presence of witnesses and asked him three different times if Peter Harry was drunk. He replied \"Yes!\" I took out the information and complaint and he swore to it, taking his oath on the Bible that Peter Harry was drunk and that the witnesses to this information were Noel George, Charlie Harry, Theresa Hansen and Annie Wilson, everyone of whom you will note are members of his own family. At the trial of Peter Harry for drunkenness, the Chief, who was put on his oath, declared in his evidence that Peter Harry was NOT drunk. His witnesses also stated the same, with the result that I dismissed the case against Peter Harry.\n\nI was bound to give Chief Harry a good talking to, and did not mince matters with him and his lying propensities. This has upset him and I am given to understand that he has, in conjunction with Mrs. Thompson, concocted a letter making some terrible accusations against me, and that this letter has been forwarded direct to Ottawa. You will no doubt hear something from Ottawa, if you have not already done so.\n\nIn the meantime, I am drawing the attention of the Attorney-General to the elasticity of manner in which Indians take an oath, perjuring themselves to suit their own ends and purposes, damning another persons' reputation with as much ease as eating their meals. Some example should be made, as it is very easy to create a bad impression, and terribly hard to eradicate that impression once created. I leave the matter in your hands.\n\nI may also inform you that on Monday morning the 5th inst., the Chief came to the school house and asked me to let Moses Wilson off, or to let him off lightly, or he would stir up the village against me. On the same Monday but in the afternoon, Moses Wilson himself, came up to the school-room and offered me One hundred dollars if I would try the case here instead of sending it to...\"\nit to Powell River, as they feared I would do.\n\nYours truly.\"\n\nMR. PERRY: I received a letter addressed to me on the 12th December by Mr. Garland:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Perry:-\n\nAt the same time that I sent a telegraph message to the Provincial Police to come to Church House I also sent a telegram to you asking you if you could see your way clear to meet me at the Hotel at Powell River on Saturday the 10th inst., as well as asking you to reply to my message care of the Provincial Police at Powell River. Apparently the message was not sent, as I went to Powell River leaving here at quarter to four on Friday, the 9th inst., by Mr. Bartlett's boat and on arriving at Powell River found no message for me, and that you were not present.\n\nIn the near future I hope to be able to come to Vancouver, with your permission.\n\nYours truly,\"\n\nMR. PERRY took the oath.\n\nMR. PERRY: In connection with the letter just read Mr. Commissioner I wish to say that I did not receive a telegram from Mr. Garland, and I have received information that such a telegram was never sent to me. This information has come from the man in charge of the telegraph office at Squirrel Cove.\n\nI wish to point out that in the letter of December 11th, Mr. Garland himself opens up the question of the terrible accusations made against him, in other words Mr. Garland took the initiative officially, and I may say, sir, that up to that time I had heard nothing whatever of the accusations made against Mr. Garland.\n\nOn December 10th, Chief George Harry, of Church House, addressed a letter to me:-\n\n\"Dear Sir:-\n\nI have another trouble between Mr. Garland School teacher again. Between him and Mrs. Johnnie Hackett and Mrs. Moses Wilson and Mrs. Geo Bassett. He has been wrong altogether.\n\nMr. Garland has asked Mrs. Wilson to kiss him for drink of whiskey but Mrs. Wilson did not want too So she came and told me.\n\nAnd Mrs. Hackett has been telling me all about what Mr. Garland been doing to her, that he took her in the Catholic Church twice and also has taken Mrs. Basset in the Priest's house for the same reason.\n\nSo Mr. Perry how's that sound to you I cannot stand to have Mr. Garland to be teacher at Church House as its a shame for the Band.\n\nOtherwise there be trouble between him and the husbands.\n\nSo you look up the matter. Since Mr. Garland been Church House the people been getting very bad any little thing that happens in the Village they run up the School house and make the trouble twice as bigger.\n\nNow these...\"\nNow these people are getting to be bad friends, because they always like to even between each other. So this has to be stopped before it gets too strong. Answer if you're coming.\n\nYours truly.\"\n\nMR. GARLAND: May I see the handwriting of this please. In two different handwritings. Chief George Harry can not write.\n\nMR. PERRY: I am well aware of that. And signed by somebody on behalf of Chief George Harry, and signature not witnessed by anybody.\n\nBy the same mail Mr. Inspector Cairns received a greasy looking letter something similar to this one, only more greasy than this, setting out practically the same information. Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, and I got together and discussed this matter between us as officials. We reviewed a previous inquiry made by me at Church House on or about the 1st of June.\n\nPrevious to my going to Church House Mr. Inspector Cairns had visited Church House and on his return had reported to me that just as he was leaving Church House Chief George Harry had told him that Mr. Garland was too familiar with the Indian women and was giving them whiskey. I told Mr. Cairns that on my visit to Church House should any complaint of this nature arise I would look into the matter before\n\nMR. GARLAND: If I remember rightly that you said to me that you had asked Mr. Cairns he being on the spot why didn't he investigate it.\n\nMR. PERRY: I will deal with that presently.\n\nMr. Cairns seemed to think that was all right, although I will be honest and say that when I went to Church House I never expected that the complaint made to Mr. Cairns would be repeated to me but that the rumour, if one might so classify it, would by the time of my visit have died away as so many similar rumours amongst the Indians have done.\n\nI went to Church before going notifying Mr. Garland that I expressed to be in Church House.\n\nIn Mr. Garland's evidence he produces a letter written by me on the 2nd. of June telling him I was coming and he wondered why the letter was dated June 2nd. while as a matter of fact my visit to Church House preceded the receipt by him of my letter and also the date of the letter. I think, sir, that can be explained in this way. When I go on a trip, as my stenographer can testify, I usually dictate letters cleaning up a lot of mail. It is quite possible, although I have no clear recollection of the incident, that this letter was written with a lot of others, also that I saw an opportunity to go to Church House and went, and this may account for the fact that I reached Church House before the letter in question reached Mr. Garland and even before it was written by the stenographer. I have every reason to believe that the date on that letter is correct. Whatever may have been the facts of this incident I can give most solemn assurance to Mr. Garland that there was no design against Mr. Garland or disposition to thwart him in any way in that incident.\n\nOn reaching\nOn reaching Church House I held a meeting with the Indians, Mr. Garland and Mr. Bartlett being present at this meeting. The Chief, George Harry, was addressing me in the presence of the Indians and referred to Mr. Garland as a good man, a good teacher, and that the people liked him.\n\nWe adjourned, as Mr. Garland stated in his evidence this morning, for a little refreshment in the form of lunch. The meeting was adjourned to the evening and to resume at the call of the Chief, not the call of Mr. Garland, nor of the Indian Agent, but of Chief George Harry himself.\n\nI left the boat at the wharf at the appointed time to attend the meeting, leaving Mr. Bartlett on the boat who said he wanted to clean up before he came up to the meeting. I went along the flat's alone toward the village and saw Chief George Harry coming toward me. He addressed me with whispering voice in these words: \"Mr. Perry, that teacher Mr. Garland bad man. Don't you say anything to him. That man is fooling with the Indian women all the time and gives them whiskey.\" I responded somewhat angrily to the Chief and said to him: \"In the meeting this afternoon you told me what a good man Mr. Garland was, now you tell me a different story, it is the same story that you told Mr. Cairns when he was here but you have told the wrong man this time, I am going to find out about this.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" he said, \"It is true. You come up to my house right now.\" I said: \"How about the meeting?\" The Chief replied: \"The meeting all right. I am the boss for the meeting.\" He said: \"I have bottle of rum that Mr. Garland gave my daughter Mrs. Moses Wilson. She drink it in my house, my wife had some, they both say it is rum.\"\n\nBefore going to the Chief's house I went back to the boat and mentioned to Constable Bartlett what the Chief had said and suggested, in order that there be no misunderstanding, and that the incident would be properly witnessed, that Mr. Bartlett should come with me to the Chief's house. This he did, where a bottle was produced containing rum. It was a medicine bottle. I asked the Chief where he got it. He said that Mr. Garland had given it to his daughter, Mrs. Wilson. I sent Constable Bartlett to Mrs. Wilson's house to bring her to the Chief's house, and presently she came. The statements that were made both by the Chief and his daughter, and wife, were thought by me to be sufficiently important to warrant the taking of an affidavit and taking possession of the bottle with the intoxicant in it.\n\nNow, although Mr. Garland was not more than 100 yards or so away at the Mission House, it did not occur to me for a moment to send for Mr. Garland or make any undue stir or excitement. As a matter of fact, I did not believe the story and told Mr. Bartlett so, knowing the character of the principals of the story. In any event I would not involve Mr. Garland on a simple rumour. If I were to take serious action upon each and every rumour which I hear on every hand from Indians, both I and the Department would be in hot water all the time; the teachers, officials and the Indians would have to put up with a very unpleasant atmosphere without any good results.\n\nAfter taking the affidavit I told the Chief I would look into the matter and I went up to Mr. Garland's residence with Mr. Bartlett; showed the affidavit and bottle to Mr. Garland asking him to give me his observations on the matter. Mr. Garland emphatically denied with the gesture of an oath to Almighty God that he had not been guilty of supplying this Indian woman with liquor nor any other Indian woman, nor had he been guilty of any other immoral offense toward Indian women. It was a rather delicate situation for me particularly as I regard with great respect Mr. Garland and his family, also taking\ntaking into respectful consideration Mr. Garland's seniority of years. I did not believe the story.\n\nMr. Garland stated yesterday he thought I was impulsive, probably we are both impulsive. I felt that if I were to bring this affidavit and bottle back to Vancouver and keep on record here against him it might give Mr. Garland a feeling that I as Indian Agent was holding something in the form of evidence against him so be used conveniently by me on some possible but not probable future occasion. So I thought I would play the game with Mr. Garland, be fair with him, so I handed him the affidavit and bottle, partly to let him see that there was no ill-feeling and that I was anxious to support him if he was innocent, as I believed him to be. Some perhaps may think that I was indiscreet for doing that but I will take the responsibility for it.\n\nWe held our meeting with the Indians, finished up our business took a walk with Mr. Garland through the village end next morning left Church House.\n\nNow the Inspector, Mr. Cairns, and I were reviewing that incident and reviewing the letter of the 10th December received from Chief Harry. The pros and cons referred to in my letter to Mr. Garland of December 22nd, 1927 were on the one hand - the pros constituted the written statements of the Indians and the cons would be what we believed to be the good reputation of Mr. Garland - Mr. Garland with his wife and children - a responsible Magistrate. These constituted the pros and cons as we can officially interpret them.\n\nWe also decided in our discussion of the matter that we would not give Chief George Harry or any low bred Indian of his type the satisfaction of our rushing up to Church House simply because they choose to take an action against Mr. Garland's accusations and which would put them in a position at any time to say to Mr. Garland: \"We write down and tell, Mr. Parry, Indian Agent, and School Inspector about you, very quick we fix you.\" We have known this happen before, so that if Mr. Garland thinks that the investigation should have been made promptly, I want to say that this explanation, that it was to his advantage and for his sake alone and his family that we did not rush up there. Mr. Garland stated this morning regarding certain complaints against Mr. Nicholson and in that matter I may say that it also was discussed between Mr. Cairns and myself and it was decided that instead of rushing at things that the Inspector of Schools would in due course be making his regular trip of inspection and if at that time the complaints against the teachers had not died down, the fullest investigation would be made into all the circumstances. Since that time I have been to Sliammon and at a meeting of the Sliammon Indians an Indian woman stood up in the person of Mrs. Frank Paul, castigated the man for hesitating to speak and she said the women would do the speaking. They demanded the removal of Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson, saying they were no good, and when I asked this woman who said Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson were no good, the woman said Mr. and Garland of Church House had told a certain Indian of Sliammon that Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson were no good and that if the Indians would ask the Department to remove them they, Mr. and Mrs. Garland would come down to Sliammon and give them some service. I asked the woman the name of the Indian who circulated this report and she gave me the name of Willie Bob. Constable Bartlett and Mr. Nicholson were both present at the meeting. I did not further investigate this matter because Mr. Inspector Cairns had told me he had written to the Chief stating he would be making an official trip of inspection.\n\nIn the\nMR. PERRY: in the usual way some time in the near future. This Mr. Cairns had done because complaint had reached him of which he himself is able to give particulars if he wishes.\n\nI now come, Mr. Commissioner, to\n\nMR. GARLAND: Would you permit me at this point to say that whoever the Indian was that conveyed to you that I or my wife had told anybody that we were anxious to go down to Mr. Nicholson's place was a dastardly liar, on the other hand this is a letter which I received in the early part of January of this year from Chief Tom.\n\nMR. PERRY: I now come, sir, to my letter addressed to Mr. Garland of December 22nd, 1927, to which exception was taken in strong terms by Mr. Garland in his letter to me of January 14th.\n\nI may say that in the meantime the Agency launch had returned from Northern points and Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Rosenberg were in the City. I had before me the three letters of Mr. Garland already referred to of December 6th, 11th, and 12th, for reply. There is only a weekly service to Church House, which accounts for the fact that these three letters were answered at one and the same time. Mr. Rosenberg gave me the particulars of the mix-up at Church House. I had sent him there to supervise the renovation of the interior of the Indian houses. He reported to me that whilst sitting in his cabin on the Reserve on the Saturday evening in question Moses Wilson and his son Albert, Indians of Church House, came into the Reserve in a state of intoxication on their way to his cabin and had told him that they could easily black his eyes if they wanted to. There appears to be no particular reason for these threats beyond that these men were drinking. Mr. Rosenberg explained that he saw Wilson about to leap on him when he ducked and the Indian Wilson came into contact with a Church House Indian named Tommy Paul. A fight began and the door flew open and there was an inrush of men and women, a general m\u00eal\u00e9e or free for all fight in which some of the Indians were injured. Mr. Rosenberg is a Danish physicist and could easily have cleaned up the lot of them but refrained from doing so because I had warned him before going to Church House on no account or at any time to have any trouble whatever with the Indians. That in short is what he reported.\n\nMR. GARLAND: Those details related to me are entirely new to me. I insisted upon his staying in our quarters because he was afraid to go down.\n\nMR. PERRY: In regard to this letter, Mr. Commissioner, I will take it out of my clause as far as I can. I notified Mr. Garland that Mr. Rosenberg had given me the details verbally. In addition to Mr. Rosenberg's information however, Dominion Constable Bartlett had returned to Vancouver and had discussed with me the various phases of the cases at Church House. He told me certain Indians had complained that they had incurred expenses in aiding Mr. Garland in the prosecution of the cases against the defendant Indians, also had given certain information, but that although the Indians had done this and had incurred the expense or using gasoline and their time going from Church House to Squirrel Cove, they had not been paid anything for their services and they felt they should receive compensation. As far as I am able to recollect Mr. Bartlett gave me to understand that he had Investigated\nMR. PERRY: investigated the circumstances and found that the Provincial Police had laid the information. I could then readily understand how unless provision had been made for it by the Magistrate, the Indians might not receive either the moieties of the fine or any expenses incidental to the costs of prosecution.\n\nMr. Garland said in his letter that he was calling the attention of the Hon. Attorney General to the matter of certain Indians perjuring themselves and when I read his letter I naturally concluded he had done so. I could not interpret this letter any other way except on a strictly technical analysis, and I wish here to say that if it were necessary for any official handling the amount of correspondence which we handle in this office to split hairs as it were over the technical interpretation of every word we would never be able to get through our work with the present staff. In fact, one would need almost a scholastic professor to satisfy Mr. Garland, if one can judge the evidence he gave yesterday on this point. I say this with great respect to Mr. Garland. Here I feel that I should give you an idea of a portion of the correspondence that has had to do with Mr. Garland and the Indians in the few months he has been there.\n\nHere the Indian Agent showed the Commissioner two extraordinary files of Mr. Garland's correspondence.\n\nMR. PERRY: Now, sir, it is for you to judge on that point. I may not have been strictly technically correct but if you will take the contents of the letter itself, you will not see therein any offence to Mr. Garland.\n\nI maintain there was no indication of a lie and I say there was no lie in except that it may be said to be a technical one.\n\nI felt it was not a matter of my interference. I never interfere with the course of correspondence between the Stipendiary Magistrate and Attorney General, although I am a Justice of the Peace ex officio it is not within my province to interfere with cases where Indians perjure themselves.\n\nYou quite properly put it before the Attorney General and I had no jurisdiction to interfere.\n\nMy position, Mr. Commissioner, will have to be judged by you on that point. I acted as I thought fit at that time.\n\n\"It is understood that you have been in communication with the Indian Commissioner.\"\n\nThis, sir, is that in connection with your enquiry on your visit, in which you informed Mr. Bartlett that you had received certain communications with regard to these cases and I assumed, and take responsibility for assuming, that the cases had been communicated by Mr. Garland. It was my understanding. I did not say that Mr. Garland had communicated with the Indian Commissioner.\n\n\"With regard to your statement that Moses Wilson offered you $100.00 .........\"\n\nIn this matter, Mr. Bartlett reported this incident to me verbally, and before this letter was sent to Mr. Garland I read this communication to Mr. Bartlett to be sure it was correct.\n\nThis letter\nThis letter was not written with any intention to complain but to show you how far I could go in this matter, and get the details with which I was not familiar.\n\n\"This, also, however, ...............\"\n\nBy machinery, Mr. Commissioner, I mean the machinery of the law, where you have a Magistrate with power to deal with the cases and Provincial Police to deal with it. The perjury complained of by Mr. Garland took place, I presume, at the cases in Court.\n\n\"Under the circumstances........\"\n\nThere is no need for further comment on that, sir; I have already said that when anything is in the hands of the Commissioner, it would be quite improper for me to interfere.\n\n\"It has been reported to me .......\"\n\nThat was my information from Mr. Bartlett.\n\n\"that you allowed Indians to incur expenditure...\"\n\nYou sent Willie Francis down from Church House to Squirrel Cove.\n\nIn this letter I say \"It has been reported to me...\"\n\nThat report to me, as I have already said, was by Constable Bartlett in the course of his duty and accepted by me, and I wrote to you to get your confirmation and seek further light. The very fact that I wrote this letter to you shows that I wanted to get your view.\n\nNo reflection on you in writing this letter.\n\nNow, in regard to the complaints of a very serious nature I again repeat that Mr. Garland himself opened up the first official communication in regard to complaints made against him of a very serious nature.\n\nRegarding complaints of a serious nature I stated in my letter that Inspector Cairns and I had been discussing them pro and con. By pro I meant the review of the incident at Church House when Chief Harry made complaint against Mr. Garland to Inspector Cairns, and the examining of the recent complaints of the Indians which had been received. By con in this letter I referred to the attitude which I took officially at Church House in June when complaints were made to me against Mr. Garland, and also our own personal feeling and goodwill toward Mr. and Mrs. Garland and their family.\n\nWe decided instead of rushing up to Church House immediately to satisfy a few disgruntled and ill bred Indians it would be better to make a quiet enquiry in the ordinary pursuit of official business. Had we rushed up to Church House immediately on hearing of these complaints, it would give any Indians ill-disposed towards the teacher an opportunity to confront the teacher with the threat of sending for the officials, if they, the Indians, thought that by so doing they would have a train of officials rushing up to investigate their scandal.\n\nI feel that the course taken by Inspector Cairns and myself was most manifestly fair toward Mr. and Mrs. Garland.\n\nNow we come to complaints of a very serious nature received from Church House Indians:\n\nLetter dated\nLetter dated January 3rd, 1927, read:\n\n\"Dear Sir:\n\nI wrote to you about Mr. Garland middle last month. But had no reply. I'm writing again. Mr. Garland got after Sofie Wilson didn't I told you he is getting worse.\n\nHere's the copy of what Sofie told me the old woman\n\n(Copy)\n\nI went the school house last summer about the month of August Mr. Garland was alone then his wife was at Campbell River. I ask for medicine and he get busy looking up his doors and afterwards came in front of me taking out $5.00 for me. I said I cannot do that at all Mr. Garland you know you got a wife.\n\nBut he jumped at me and grab me and pushed me down I tried to stand up but you knew he's strong for me Oh he a bad man I ever saw for all the teachers that ever came to Church House.\n\nAND told me not to tell the Chief.\n\nSofie Wilson.

Harry.\n\nChief Geo Harry.\n\nOn January\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nMR. PERRY: On January 3rd, a letter was addressed to me from Ottawa as follows:\n\nSir:\nThe Department has received a communication from an Indian at Church House, B.C., who signs the name \"Chief Geo. Harry\", in which he makes certain statements regarding the personal conduct of Mr. A. H. Garland, teacher in the Homalco Indian Day School. I shall be pleased if you will state whether any notice should be taken of his letter and also, if you have any information regarding the associations of Mr. Garland with the Indian women on the Reserve, if you will furnish a full report regarding same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nA. F. MacKenzie.\"\n\nIn answer to the Department's letter I sent this letter dated January 17th, 1928:\n\n\"Sir:\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No. 167-83-1, dated January 3rd, instant, relative to complaints reaching the Department as to the alleged misconduct of Mr. A. H. Garland, Homalco Indian Day School teacher with Indian women in the Homalco reserve at Church House, B.C.\n\nIn reply I beg to say I would suggest for the present acknowledge the letter saying the matter is being investigated by the Indian Agent. I propose going to Church House at the earliest moment when I will fully investigate the complaints and make a complete report to the Department. I say that I have received complaints before about similar alleged conduct on the part of Mr. Garland, but the complaints have come from the members and relatives of Chief George Harry, while mention has reached me from practically the balance of the band members referring to the Chief as a bad man and a \"mink\" and asking that the teacher be kept in his position. Mr. Garland is a Stipendiary Magistrate and in this capacity has taken very drastic action recently amongst the members of Chief Harry's family for drunkenness in the Homalco village, fining them heavily.\n\nThe Department will probably remember that formerly the Homalco Band were in two divisions - the Homalco and Orford Bay, respectively. These two factions have never been well disposed towards each other and I have repeatedly endeavored to keep them united in one big family which is always best for the Indians in every way. Unfortunately these Indians are of a very inferior status and it is not to be wondered at if they, upon the least provocation, revert to antipathies and quarrelling especially where intoxicants are introduced.\n\nThe Department will probably remember that some time ago I was complained against by the same Chief to the Department because I threw him out of my office in Vancouver. The Chief is inclined to the use of intoxicants and I have received several complaints against him.\n\nApart from this I have received rather disquieting report from responsible white sources as to Mr. Garland's conduct with a certain Indian woman, but unfortunately I cannot get the matter of complaint in writing although I have tried to do so. If I could obtain proof of this report\n\nI would...\"\nI would immediately recommend action by the Department. Until this report is cleared up I am naturally suspicious that there may be something in the rumours going around about Mr. Garland's conduct; although it is hard to believe them as Mr. Garland has his wife and three children residing with him in the house and village.\n\nAnother matter is that of an affidavit which I took from Chief Harry's daughter, Mrs. Moses Wilson, on a visit to Church House to the effect that Mr. Garland had given her a medicine bottle full of rum and that she had taken it to the Chief's house and made her mother drunk with it. The bottle, half full of rum, was handed to me by Chief Harry. Upon presenting the affidavit to Mr. Garland and showing him the bottle, he denied it on oath and squared himself as a Roman Catholic saying he believed that the occurrences were machination of certain white residents in the locality, who had been dealt with by Mr. Garland as a Magistrate, in concert with a few disgruntled Indians. Mr. Garland swore he would try to get at the bottom of the matter but so far he has failed to do so and the recent complaints are apparently a recrudescence of the old feud between these particular Indians and Mr. Garland.\n\nWhile I feel it is a good thing to have a representative of law and order in the person of a Magistrate in the vicinity of Church House, which is the most remote settlement in Vancouver Agency, and Mr. Garland's removal may not be the best thing, yet the charges made against him alike it imperative, in the interests of the Department as well as the Indians, that the fullest possible investigation be held and I intend going carefully and without fear or favor into the matter of these complaints.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMR. PERRY:\n\nMr. Garland addressed a letter to me on January 6th., as follows:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Perry:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of Dec. 22nd. relating to the prosecutions which recently took place at Church House. I have been so full of work this last week, that, I find it an impossibility to reply to it in the manner that I desire to do but you may rest assured that you will have my reply by the next mail from Church House.\n\nYours very truly.\"\n\nOn the 6th. of January a petition was addressed to me from Church House:\n\n\"Dear Sir:\n\nThis letter we want you to have and also the School Inspector and if one wanted for Ottawa we send one there too. It is signed by the chief of the church, by the Council and by all of the men who are in the Village now. We know what George Harry try to do to the teacher and also Mrs. Thompson and Arthur Prendergast help Geo Harry. We know Geo Harry tell lies to everybody for the teacher we all the peoples love our teacher and his wife and family. All the children loves him and all the women tell he is a good man and helps everybody. We cannot lose our teacher for our hearts will be very sore. He is a good teacher only George Harry and his family dont want him because Geo Harry he drinks and he makes drink and he scared for the teacher. Our teacher must stay right here.\"\nright here with us, all his living and not go away we all love him, and we all want him, men, women and childrens. See Harry and his family tell lies he same as mink. We know. We want to find out if See Harry says all the peoples sign that letter that he sends to you about the teacher, if he does, then he is a mink and a liar.\n\nTenny Paul, Willie Francis, Johnny Blaney X, Henry Blaney, Simon Paul, Francis Paul X, Joseph Charlie X, Jack Lee X, Moses Wilson X, Alex Pierre, Jasper Joseph, Joe Wilson, See Joseph, Jimmie Wilson X, Dave Paul, August Lee, Frank George, Johnman Wilson, Jimmy Francis, Peter Harry, See Francis, Noel Harry, Isaac Francis, Johnny Hackett.\"\n\nMR. PERRY: Now, sir, I wish to call your attention to the fact that this petition contains names which were on the original accusation against Mr. Garland, and that is also why no haste was made in rushing up to Church House to deal with the matter. Neither of these is witnessed properly.\n\nI can say emphatically, Mr. Commissioner, that since the day Mr. Garland applied for the position I have exercised every reasonable thought and action to make Mr. Garland's work successful and to make living conditions as happy as possible for him and his family. I am quite sure that the Inspector of Indian Schools can testify that in comparison with other Indian Day schools the Department's treatment of Mr. Garland's Indian Day School has been magnanimous in every way. To show my estimation and my kindness of heart towards Mr. and Mrs. Garland I met Mrs. Garland at the C. P. R. train with my car and drove her and the children around Stanley Park and showed the children the Zoo, and then drove them around the City. I went down to see them off on their departure for Church House and wished them godspeed. I did it to show goodwill, and respect for a lady. I want there to be no reflection on my general conduct toward the lady.\n\nSince Mr. Garland went to Church House we have recommended to the Department the furnishing of his home. We have supplied for the use of the Field Matron\n\nThe expenses for drugs as Mr. Ditchburn will know has been quite considerable and generous in comparison to what other schools have received.\n\nWe have put in for the benefit of the Indians at Church House a water supply system. We have repaired the bridges and roads. We put an addition on Mr. Garland's home with bath room equipment.\n\nI am not saying these things because we have done anything wonderful but to show that Mr. Garland will have no suggestion of bias or prejudice or official ill-will. Considerably more has been done for the Hemaleo School and more elasticity given that the usages of the Department have allowed for many other schools.\n\nHe has asked for a new building to accommodate the teacher and his family at Church House. This fact has been quoted by Mr. Garland as indicative of bias and prejudice. When that application came in I discussed all phases of it with Mr. Inspector Cairns. We decided that the building up there by expending $500. would be comfortable for a few years to\nMR. PERRY: years to come\n\nMr. Garland asked for tools to be sent up for cutting the thread pipe to take care of a little job there. These tools were purchased from Messrs. McLennan & Macsely Ltd., and sent up but unfortunately Mr. Garland is not expert in the use of tools. I doubt if you could classify him as a handy man as far as doing odd jobs is concerned.\n\nWhen the request came for certain plumbing work to be done you, Mr. Commissioner, will know that the Department was asked by me through yourself to have the engineers of the Water Power Branch prepare a report, to go fully into the water supply for the convenience of the residents at Church House. Owing to the amount of business on the shoulders of the Water Power engineers in the Interior and elsewhere they were not able to give immediate attention to the Church House requirements. After many months the report was sent me from Mr. Ditchburn, he having received it from the engineers. It was sent to me with instructions to obtain from the Church House Indians in a meeting a resolution authorizing the expenditure based on this report, of Band funds. This all was done and in due course the water system as recommended by the engineers was completed. I trust to the satisfaction of Mr. Garland. While these negotiations were pending Mr. Garland asked me to send a plumber up from Vancouver to repair a pipe which appeared to be in a leaky condition causing dripping which seemed to annoy Mr. Garland and family very much. I sent Mr. Garland's recommendation to Ottawa. Mr. Bartlett helped me prepare an estimate of the cost of sending a man up, and we figured his time and expenses would be not less than $50.00,\n\nand in order to cover this contingency I recommended that the Department send a man up to do this work unless it was the intention of the Department to have the whole thing covered at an early date by the engineers of the Water Power Branch. The Department replied that they would wait for the resolution of the Church House Indians.\n\nThis is the reason, sir, that Mr. Garland's request for immediate attention to his water pipe was not concurred in to his satisfaction.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Garland's complaint about the leaky roof I forwarded Mr. Garland's report to Mr. Ditchburn. I also placed in my estimates in September last numerous items covering the Church House services including repairs to the School building, etc., and sent a copy of my recommendation to Mr. Garland for his information. Now since those estimates have been sent in no word has been received from the Department as to whether these estimates are allowed or not and I presume that is because the estimates have to be presented during the present session of Parliament.\n\nAlso during the course of negotiations of services at Church House with Mr. Garland I received instructions from the Commissioner that no expenses were to be incurred of any nature whatever without Departmental authority as the appropriations made last year were running very low and the strictest economy had to be exercised.\n\nIt was a letter bearing on that subject as written by me to which exception was taken yesterday by Mr. Garland in his evidence by which he endeavored to show that the letter contained some evidence of bias and prejudice.\nMR. PERRY: In Mr. Garland's evidence yesterday he mentioned the fact that for some time I had provided him with postage stamps in connection with his official correspondence with this office, and that is quite true. I did send to Mr. Garland from my own stamp supply occasionally One Dollar worth of so of stamps because I felt that he was taking an interest in the welfare of the Indians and wrote a good many letters in behalf of the Indians and the local services. One day, however, I received a request from Mr. Garland for the sum of $6.00 to cover the cost of postage incurred by him in writing letters to me. I replied asking Mr. Garland to send me a receipt because I knew that the Department would not pass the Voucher without it. Mr. Garland was not able to furnish me with the receipt, and I have never received it.\n\nMR. GARLAND: I had spent $6.00 during my period of service up to the time I had written the letter. I had bought these stamps from time to time and had not obtained a receipt, and let the matter drop.\n\nMR. PERRY: I wrote Mr. Garland suggesting that he put an item for postage stamps to the Indian Agent in his next requisition for supplies. Mr. Garland did not do so, however, and when his requisition came in I incorporated this item for $6.00 together with other items. The requisition was dealt with by the Department and I was informed by the Department that the Department did not provide postage stamps for teachers. I felt, sir, that I could not draw on my local postage stamp supply any further than I had done without receiving the disapprobation of the Department.\n\nNow, Mr. Commissioner, if there is any point I have failed to cover, I wish, if you have any note of it, that you would let me know.\n\nIn regard to the matter of relief I think that matter has been made to your satisfaction - the Gerrard case.\n\nIn conclusion, sir, I wish to say that I have nothing but the greatest respect for Mr. and Mrs. Garland. I do not claim that they are in my opinion the best qualified people for handling the Indian situation but I will say I believe they have been conscientious in their work and straight and above board in their correspondence and associations in general. The reason for this observation is this, that it will be apparent from the nature of the correspondence now put in as exhibits that Mr. Garland is inclined to be too severe in his analysis of activities - either Indian or official.\n\nIf Mr. Garland would spend the same amount of energy in seeking the things that are attainable and accomplishing the things that can be accomplished that he expends in voluminous correspondence which makes a great deal out of trifling things, I believe he would have better results, and a kinder feeling would exist both between him and the officials and the Indians.\n\nMr. Garland states that he thinks I am impulsive, and in this I might say that I have found often my impulsive disposition to lead to good results where hesitation might have utterly failed me.\n\nJust one\nMR. PERRY: Just one observation in conclusion. I leave it to you, Mr. Commissioner, to judge whether or not it is becoming for any man holding a position for only something short of 16 months to so seriously reflect upon the administration of an Agency handled by a man who has twenty years of active work as a responsible Agent of the Government amongst the Indians. I do not claim that I am perfect, I have my faults like other men, but it hurts very much when the man of Mr. Garland's intelligence and status uses such language as he used in his letter to me in referring to my work in which I am quite as deeply interested, and have always been, as he himself contends that he is. I say that you, sir, and the Department will judge as to my efficiency, and I repeat now most seriously the representations that I made to you, sir, in writing that in view of the nature of this investigation, someone must be relieved of his position in the interests of the service. We cannot allow this contentious spirit to continue in this Agency. The issues are too important and the work of too serious a nature for us to allow conditions like this to go on unchecked in a very decisive manner.\n\nThat is all, sir.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: I think that both of you have had a very fair opportunity to express your views with regard to this investigation. I have all the evidence in connection with it, and my report will be submitted to my superior officers.\n\nBut I will tell you candidly I cannot concur in your remark that Mr. Perry as Indian Agent has acted in a manner of bias and prejudice toward you, nor did he say an untruth in his letter of December 22nd, of which you complain.\n\nYou have drawn a very fine line with regard to the statement made by Mr. Perry that you had taken up the matter of perjury with the Attorney General. In your letter to Mr. Perry you state you are taking it up and Mr. Perry in his letter of the 22nd December states that you have brought the matter to the attention of the Attorney General.\n\nIt was quite a slight misstatement on the part of Mr. Perry and I take it it was done intentionally, but the natural assumption that after a person had written he was taking up the matter on the 11th of December the other party receiving the letter 11 days later would be perfectly within his rights in concluding that the matter had been taken up. Therefore, I do not think you can accuse Mr. Perry of lying in this particular instance.\n\nI feel satisfied after Mr. Perry's explanation to you that he has not been prejudiced or biased in any way.\n\nAll these Departmental matters are dealt with by officials in a confidential manner before they can become public property.\n\nRegarding charges made against Mr. Garland Mr. Perry said that he and Mr. Cairns had discussed that matter previously and what to my mind was a perfectly proper thing for two officials to do. Mr. Perry is the senior officer in this Agency, Mr. Cairns is Inspector of Schools for the Province of British Columbia. These were statements made to Agent Perry and Inspector Cairns alleging improper conduct on your part; Mr. Perry and Mr. Cairns discussed this matter between themselves to determine, as explained.\nas explained by Mr. Perry as to whether or not the allegations were worth probing in which knowing the situation at Church House as I know it myself, I take it that had these statements come from a more responsible character than Chief George Harry, the matter would have been sifted to the ground right away. However, I do not think, Mr. Garland, that you have any real complaint against Mr. Perry in any of your allegations against him. I think I agree with you in the remarks you made early in the day which were to the effect that had the matter been given more mature consideration, it is possible that your letter would never have been written.\n\nIn my report to the Department, I feel that the letter was entirely unjustified, but should the Department say that I have made an error in my judgment I am quite willing to abide by the ruling.\n\nI am sorry this matter has come up because between officials of the Department we expect co-operation. We are not always right in everything we do but there must be a spirit of fairness, even if sometimes a person does willfully wrong all the time we must give them credit for trying to do the best they can under all circumstances. I do not think, Mr. Garland, that this Department could have dealt more kindly with you in any shape or form.\n\nI may say candidly you have been criticized by myself in your items for drug supplies. The orders you placed are not exceeded by any that are put in by any doctor in the Province. Your position as teacher does not warrant you the disposition of medicines, nevertheless I realize that you have some knowledge of medicines.\n\nWe have spent a very great amount of money in Medical supplies for the Homalco Indians, supplies that are not often given to Field Matrons but only to doctors. Field Matrons can only be supplied with simple remedies for the alleviation of distress on the part of the Indians for the time being until they can be attended by the Doctor of the District. I must now say we have dealt with you very liberally.\n\nMr. Perry has never taken it upon himself to criticize your requisitions in any way, shape or form. He has passed them along without any comment whatever and which is proof that he was not biased or prejudiced against you.\nMr. Ditchburn referred to the enquiry held on the 6th & 7th February.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: The complaints made against Mr. Perry are not well founded, and that settles that phase of the question.\n\nWe will, therefore, now follow up by dealing with any complaints Mr. Garland may have against Constable Bartlett, as that seems to be the underlying source of the grievance.\n\nThe only thing that I have on my file in this regard is a letter from Mr. Garland dated 14th January, 1928:\n\n\"SIR:\n\nI am regretfully forced to address this letter to you on account of the Machiavellian activities and deviltries exercised by Dominion Constable T.T. Bartlett, against me, and my family; disseminating lying reports and calumnies in his parading up and down the Coast in these waters, so that my existence has been made a perfect hell through the intrigues of this officer.\n\nThe latest infamous and scurrilous report, emanating from the lips of this man, is to the effect that I and my wife are not married - that my WIFE is really my DAUGHTER - that our children are grand-children, and that I and my wife are living in a condition and state of \"incest\".\n\nMay I ask you, Sir, to name a day upon which I can meet you in Vancouver, and there thresh this man's conduct out?\n\nI earnestly beg of you to give the matter your most earnest and serious consideration, as I cannot put up with this man's infamous conduct any longer.\"\n\nNow in connection with this particular complaint against Mr. Bartlett I have learned that he has written an apology to Mr. Garland, dated 20th January 1928.\n\n(Copy of this letter not left by Mr. Garland)\n\nNow Mr. Garland you have intimated in your remarks the other day that you had other complaints against Mr. Bartlett.\n\nMR. GARLAND: I have already at the commencement of the investigation that has been conducted the past two days mentioned some of the idiosyncrasies of Mr. Bartlett. As you have taken up the case which was commenced this morning, sir, of the scurrilous report made by Mr. Bartlett in connection with my wife and I not being married, I would like to tell you just what happened at the time this statement was made.\n\nThe afternoon of the 8th December, Thursday, 1927, Mr. Bartlett came to my quarters and wanted to know something about why the Indians should not be granted moieties. I told him as much as I was able to tell him at the time. He was not present at the time of the trial. I just told him the facts in short. I then told him that I desired to go to Powell River very urgently and I expected to meet Mr. Perry in Powell River and asked him as he was leaving the following day...\nMR. GARLAND:\n\nday, if he would take me to Powell River on his boat.\n\nHe acquiesced, and went away. On the morning of Friday, the 9th of December, I went to his boat, which was lying against the wharf at the Reserve, at about 9, bidding him good morning when I got to his boat and asking him what time he intended pulling out so that I could have my grip on board. His back was turned to me at the time. He turned round in savagery and a temper. Said that he would not take me. I said: \"What is the matter, Bartlett?\" and he turned around to me and said \"What did you go and tell Mr. Perry that I had given a sweater to Constable Boyt fort?\" I said \"Because it was my duty to do so.\" These sweaters had been given the Department I understood from Mr. Perry from some charitable for distribution amongst the Indians. I was already in possession of one of these sweaters. Chief Harry had been given two. He took one of them off me. I did not know at that time the source from which they were obtained other than that they came from Mr. Bartlett. He asked me one dollar for one of them. I gave him a dollar. I turned around to Mr. Bartlett and said \"Bartlett, I have had enough of this. Every time you come here you are trying to create a quarrel. I will go in to Vancouver and maybe on to Victoria, but I have had enough of your surliness for many months now, and we will have a showdown.\" He then started about things in connection with Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson. He admitted, as Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson had told me, that he had been in the habit of going to their quarters and asking for what they termed a square. I suggest that it was a mean act that he had not had a square since he had left Vancouver and that it was time he got his square, and he said \"I suppose they did not tell you that I recompense them for it, they did not tell you I had taken armfuls of stuff up for them from the beat\", and said \"I suppose they, Mr. Nicholson, did not tell that I had nursed him cur of D. T. 's.\" I said \"No, they did not.\" \"Well, I have.\" He asked me if Nicholson had a drink at that time. I said I believed he had. He said \"Nicholson is an irresponsible chap, irresponsible. You cannot believe anything he says when he has had a drink of liquor.\" I said: \"Bartlett that does not affect me. The only thing that affects me is your surliness and the underhand things you say to me when you come on this Reserve.\" He said \"I do not want a showdown, Mr. Garland, I want to be friends. Do not go to Nicholson because I have made friends with him. You must forgive me for being cranky this morning. I had a rough night, been blowing hard, and my boat beating up against the wall, and I have had scarcely any sleep. So let us drop the matter and I will take you down to Powell River. I will let you know what time I am pulling out. I will send somebody up.\"\n\nAs I was coming away something must have seized him for he turned around again in a temper and said that he had been told that I was not married, that my wife ..........\n\nI turned on him then rather savagely. First of all before he made this statement he said \"I will tell you something that you do not know. Promise me that you will not tell your wife.\"\n\nI said \"Bartlett, do you know the seriousness of what you are saying. You will tell me who told you this, Bartlett.\" He then said he had been told it by an Indian from Sechelt.\n\nI said\nMR. GARLAND: I said to him \"Bartlett, that is no Indian yarn. An Indian does not know the meaning of incest. No Indian could have told you this yarn. This is an emanation from your own mind done to give me pain.\" And I came away in somewhat of an anger. He turned again and said that he would not take me down on his boat. Told me that if I wanted to go to Powell River I could hire a boat.\n\nI went straight up to my quarters and told my wife just what had occurred and the statement Mr. Bartlett had made concerning her. I said to my wife \"I am going on that boat to Powell River more now than ever before. I will insist on Mr. Bartlett taking me to Powell River. I have as much right to go down on that boat as three workmen from another Department. There is ample room to take me, and why Bartlett should act in this manner I do not know.\"\n\nI went back again to the boat. Mr. Bartlett was still on board and I said to him \"Bartlett you are going to take me down on this boat. I am here now on your boat, and I am prepared to stay here until you pull out.\" He showed me that he was in charge of the boat and he could please himself who he took. I said \"I do not care, Bartlett, I am here on this boat and you will take me to Powell River. I will not budge from the boat.\" After a few minutes he said alright he would take me.\n\nGoing down on the boat he was very kind, offered me something to eat on board, was particularly anxious to know whether I was going to stay at the hotel or some friends. If I was going to the hotel I could expect him shortly after and that he would come up to my room. I went up to the hotel with the full expectation of meeting Mr. Perry there in response to a wire which I had sent him an hour ago to Mr. Ewart for transmission to Mr. Perry, but I found Mr. Perry was not there. I went to police quarters then to see if a telegram had been sent by Mr. Perry to me care of the Provincial police as requested in the telegram. It was sent on the night of the 2nd of December. There was no telegram for me. Before leaving the boat that night Mr. Bartlett asked me again what I proposed doing. I said \"I do not know, Mr. Bartlett, but it is quite possible that after I have done what business I have to do here in Powell River, I will go on to Vancouver and to Victoria if necessity warrants.\"\n\nMrs. Garland took the oath in order to corroborate Mr. Garland's evidence.\n\nMR. GARLAND: I have related to you before on the early part of Monday some things which Mr. Bartlett did. He described Mr. Perry to us as being a liar and to emphasize the fact that Mr. Perry was a liar to tell us this tale, my wife and I both sitting in our quarters while Mr. Bartlett related this tale. That on one occasion when the Assistant Secretary of the Department, Mr. McLean, had come to Vancouver on business in connection with Indian Affairs he was staying at the Vancouver Hotel; that Mr. McLean had rung up the office about 9.30 asking for Mr. Perry, if he was in and if not in to give him the message that Mr. Perry was to go to the Vancouver Hotel immediately; that at 10.0 o'clock Mr. Perry had not arrived and that Mr. McLean had rung up again urgently that at 10.30 Mr. Perry came in and made some apology as to being late that morning, and as an excuse said that he had been on other business with Mr. McLean ever since 9 o'clock; and that Mr. Bartlett then turned around and said \"That is strange, Mr. Perry, Mr. McLean has already rung up here twice for you at 9.30 and 10 o'clock and wanted to know where you were, to tell you to go to the Vancouver Hotel.\"\nMR. GARLAND: Hotel. Mr. Perry said \"I suppose I had better go on.\" Without offering any excuse for the falsehood he was supposed to have told.\n\nI will ask my wife, sir, if the statement I have made is not in fact and substance true, as she was present at the time when Mr. Bartlett related this.\n\nIs this statement that I have made both in fact and substance true?\n\nMRS. GARLAND: Yes, quite true.\n\nMR. GARLAND: Mr. Bartlett has on many occasions in the presence of my wife and myself and my children, has also in the presence of myself, my wife and Indians stated \"Mr. Perry too much automobile. That is why you do not get things done.\" So that today it is quite a byword amongst the Indians - Mr. Perry too much automobile.\n\nIs that statement true both in fact and substance?\n\nMRS. GARLAND: Yes.\n\nMR. GARLAND: He ridiculed Mr. Perry in the presence of my wife and children by saying that Mr. Perry acted a yachtsman. That when he came on a trip on the boat he bedecked himself with a yachtsman's cap, uniform cap, white trousers and would insist on taking the steering wheel, and if you only looked out of the back window to see how the boat was going (gesture).\n\nDidn't Mr. Bartlett say that in your presence?\n\nMRS. GARLAND: Yes.\n\nMR. GARLAND: Said that Mr. Perry would quote fictitious numbers and dates of letters purporting to come from Ottawa saying that your applications or requisitions had been turned down.\n\nImpressed us strongly with the fact that not one-eighth of our requisitions had ever been sent to Ottawa. Advised me to write to Mr. Perry asking him to quote the number and date of some letters that Mr. Perry had written to us about things to come from Ottawa and then to write to Ottawa and find out if such was the case. I was so strongly impressed with this that I said \"Mr. Bartlett, Mr. Perry would never do a thing like that.\" I got the reply \"You don't know Mr. Perry as well as I know him.\"\n\nIs that not true in substance and fact.\n\nMRS. GARLAND: I remember Mr. Bartlett walking around the room and saying it.\n\nMR. GARLAND: Mr. Bartlett informed me on a trip that I took with him from Church House to Powell River - he took me down to get my oath of allegiance and oath of office subscribed to a form at the time I was made a Stipendiary Magistrate - and he was discussing Mr. Perry. His statement was that Mr. Perry was a broken-down Methodist parson, who had been chased out of Alert Bay or the people would have killed him. Whether Mr. Perry is a Methodist I know not, sir, whether he was a parson I know not, whether he was ever in Alert Bay I know not.\n\nDuring the Dominion elections when the result of the elections were known Mr. Bartlett was in our waters and came to our quarters. He said that he knew that if the Conservative party got into power, that Mr. Perry would have his head chopped off and that he, Bartlett, stood a good chance.\nMR. GARLAND: chance of getting his job. Is that not true?\n\nMRS. GARLAND: Yes.\n\nMR. GARLAND: In connection with the troubles at Sliammon, I do not know whether they are true or not; all I know is what Mr. Bartlett has told me; but Mr. Bartlett told me that at a jamboree or some sort of a party which was held at Nicholson's house that Nicholson and Perry got so drunk that they found themselves next morning in the same bed with their boots and clothes on.\n\nHe said in the presence of my wife that if it was not for him, Bartlett, that Perry could not hold down his job for five minutes; that Bartlett and Miss Delaney did all the work while Mr. Perry flew about in an automobile and smoked cigars. Is that not true in fact and substance?\n\nMRS. GARLAND: Yes, it is true.\n\nMR. GARLAND: With regard to Mr. Cairns, in the presence of my wife and myself he stated that Mr. Cairns could not hold his job as Inspector of Schools in the Provincial Government for five minutes. Is that not true?\n\nMRS. GARLAND: That is true.\n\nMR. GARLAND: Mr. Perry in his letter to me of January 21st, states I would like to know what reports have been made by the Constable that are not in accordance with the truth. I will state them. Shortly after my going to Church House, you will remember, sir, because I got one letter from you, I reported very strongly on sanitary conditions of the village and to me who came from a clean city, Winnipeg, and then Vancouver, the conditions were, as stated in my letter, appalling. I understand that Dr. Henderson had just a short while previous had also made a report on the sanitary condition of the village. However, it would appear that the reports made by Dr. Henderson and myself were not satisfactory to Mr. Perry, who sent Constable Bartlett up to make an independent report. Bartlett came up for that specific purpose and he and I went around to the different beauty spots and came back again. He was then satisfied that my report was true. He said he would back my report in every way and that he would send me a copy of his report. Mr. Perry I think will tell you as he has told me that Mr. Bartlett's report was, to make it short, that the village was no different to any other village. I might add that I never got a copy of Mr. Bartlett's report, promised me by him.\n\nOn Monday the 27th September, 1927 Mr. Bartlett was lying at the Government Wharf and I believe around about midnight an Indian boat pulled in with two girls on it, one named Jessie Louise aged 17, married, and the other Catherine Louise aged about 14, single, and on board was Arthur Prendergast when the two girls got off the boat, walked up the float to the reservation and store, that Mr. Bartlett told the girls afterwards that they were not to go away, leave the reservation, in a boat because he wanted them to come up to the school house. In the morning knowing that Mr. Bartlett was in I was going down to the wharf to see him when I met him coming from the wharf with two Indian girls in front. He then told me what had occurred the night before and that he was bringing these two girls up to the school house for the purpose of my taking an affidavit from these girls as to what they had been doing on board the boat with Arthur Prendergast. The girls demurred.\nMR. GARLAND: demurred about coming up and one, Jessie Louie, said that she would not come. Bartlett got hold of her by the scruff of the neck and threw her to her knees at the same time giving her a kick from behind. I remonstrated with him for his conduct towards a woman, even though she was an Indian and got the reply: \"It is all right for these.\" Jessie Louie will corroborate that statement today or any time you send a responsible official up there.\n\nThe affidavit was taken, the Indian girls came up. And I considered that there was something in the affidavit made by these girls by which a charge could have been laid against Prendergast, observing that one of the girls was 14 or 15 years of age. I gave the affidavit to Mr. Bartlett saying \"Send this to Mr. Perry and ask Mr. Perry to refer it to Departmental counsel for advice as to whether there is anything in this affidavit that would warrant a charge being laid against Prendergast.\" I understand from Mr. Perry that the affidavit was sent to him or taken to him by Mr. Bartlett and that Mr. Bartlett reported that he and I had discussed that affidavit and had come to the conclusion that there was nothing in it to warrant any further action. It was not true.\n\nRecently I wrote to Mr. Perry in regard to a request made by an Indian named Jimmie Wilson for some extra relief. His smoke house had been burned down and he had lost all his summer's catch of fish that he had put by for use during the winter as well as a lot of shingles that he had salvaged. He was hard up. I referred the matter to Mr. Perry and asked Mr. Perry that as Mr. Bartlett was in the vicinity of these waters would he instruct Mr. Bartlett to make the investigation. Mr. Perry wrote me and told me that he had done so and that Mr. Bartlett would make these investigations. During Mr. Bartlett's recent sojourn, on Friday the 25th November, 1927 Mr. Bartlett came up to our quarters about this matter; asked me to tell him what I knew about it. I told him what I had told Mr. Perry. Jimmie Wilson said that he was in a state of distress; his smoke house had been burned down; and had no blankets; and children without boots, stockings and clothes.\n\nMr. Bartlett remarked that if Jimmie Wilson depended on him to get any relief he had another think coming. Mr. Bartlett went over to Old Church House and took Mr. Rosenberg away from his work of supervising the painting on Saturday the 26th November.\n\nHe states that he was informed by Chief Harry that the number of shingles destroyed was only 60 bundles. What would Chief Harry know how many bundles were in the house.\n\nI know that Jimmie Wilson is a sick man, has been sick for a long time. You can have him medically examined by any medical man you wish. He is suffering from kidney disease and dropsy. The man is not able to work. He did work on the damage when the engineers were up there, but he did not appear to be working as well as any of the others, as Mr. Bartlett states. He worked because his smoke house had been burned down. He had no money. He lost all his fish. He was in dire distress, and he worked so as to get some money to keep himself, wife and children. During the time he was working he was in agony and on several occasions when he came up to get relief.\n\nWhat was the object in taking Mr. Rosenberg over to examine a small Indian smoke house made of cedar\n\nThe that Mr. Bartlett had in mind was this, a declaration made by Jimmie Wilson, made in the presence of Alec Paul. (Copy of this declaration not left by Mr. Garland)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nMR. GARLAND:\n\nThe measurements of the house for paint; when the houses were measured for paint it was raining hard, Mr. Bartlett asked me if I would come down and place measurements, as he measured them on a piece of paper. I took a scrap of paper and piece of cardboard and pencil down with me. It was just to be a rough estimate, so Mr. Bartlett informed me; and it was a rough one too, the way the measurements were taken. A piece of stick, a thin branch of a plumtree about as thick as my middle finger, at the corner of Sophie Wilson's house, it was somewhat arched in shape. This was picked up, held out and a piece broken off the end. This was about 6 ft., and with the aid of stick the houses were measured. The windows were never measured. They were never counted; and arriving at an estimate of paint which is required for a house it is necessary to take no only the height but length and breadth of window which should be deducted from the superficial area as a whole leaving you then the superficial area to be estimated. If you will today bring up a and measure Francis Paul's house, you will find that the measurements as given by Mr. Bartlett will vary greatly with the actual measurements.\n\nENQUIRY ADJOURNED TO AFTERNOON OF FEBRUARY 8th. 1928.\n\nMR. GARLAND:\n\nIn this matter, sir, I wish to report Mr. Bartlett does not carry out his duties in the manner in which he should do so. He is careless.\n\nso that the quantity estimated for the quantity of paint to be obtained. If the house is not measured properly you have either too much or too little paint, and as Mr. Perry had on occasion drawn attention to the necessity for the use of economy in all matters pertaining to the reserve I thought that all due care should be taken.\n\nI think there are 24 or 25 houses either on the long side or the short side, so as to spread over 24 or 25 houses, would amount to a very great amount.\n\nDuring the month of June when Mr. McConnell came to repair the church he had nowhere to stay. Mrs. Thompson refused to put him up at the store, he had no accommodation, or equipment to put up a building, and I obtained from Mrs. Pallen, an Indian woman, permission for Mr. McConnell to stay in her house. She agreed to do, and a few days afterwards she sent a child to me asking me if I would go down and see the house as she cleaned it up and if in my opinion it would be agreeable for Mr. McConnell to stay and sleep there. In my doing so I walked into the kitchen and there were two sacks of flour inside of a brown sack, 2 - 49 lb., marked M. Gerrard, Storekeeper, Stuart Island, then in brackets Indian Department. I could not understand how Mrs. Pallen got hold of this flour, as she was not on the indigent list, and I enquired from her where she obtained the flour. She said she had bought it from Arthur Prendergast. I then wondered how could Prendergast get hold of this flour as the outside sack was marked Gerrard. I enquired from Mr. Gerrard if he had sold any flour to Mrs. Thompson or Arthur Prendergast, and he said \"No.\" I then came to the conclusion that there was a leakage somewhere and some flour being supplied to our Indians was finding its way for purposes other than it was intended for.\nMr. Bartlett came in on the night of the 23rd. of June about a leak on our door, and I mentioned the matter to him as important, and told him that there was a good chance for him to exercise his detective abilities. I wanted to clear the matter up to see what Indian drawing relief was giving away supplies. He told me he had too much to do, and what was the good anyhow. I later heard through the intermediary of old Sam Timothy that Sophie Wilson was the culprit and was in the habit of exchanging and bartering her flour to others.\n\nThere were very few Indians in Church House at that time only about three families. Mr. Bartlett went away the next morning without taking any steps, and I have never heard of any steps being taken and the matter attended to.\n\nOn Sunday the 13th. February, 1927, at about 3 p.m., Mr. Bartlett reached Church House. Isaac Francis had just arrived from Old Church House and reported that a white man named Secord was on the Old Church House Reserve when no one was in the village and that he had lost some boom chains and had every reason to believe that Secord had the chains in his boat. The affair was red hot, Mr. Bartlett was there on the spot, the Indians had just come in town. I reported the same to Mr. Bartlett and asked him to go at once and take some steps to investigate. He refused to go. Said that he had had enough of chains in the past. He left Church House at around about 6 o'clock and went to Shiammen without taking any steps.\n\nWhat seems to me to be the base of the recent troubles in Church House. Mr. Bartlett left Church House at 4 p.m. on the 1st. December, 1927, and I asked Mr. Rosenberg where Mr. Bartlett had gone. Mr. Rosenberg told me he had gone to Malaspina. Some of the Indians told me that Mr. Bartlett had gone to Malaspina. Chief Harry came up to me that evening and asked me the following question \"Is it true that Mr. Bartlett has kicked you out as Magistrate?\" I asked him why he should ask me such a question. He said \"Jack Bartlett told me\" that I was no longer a Magistrate. The tale ran all around the village that I was no longer a Magistrate. The Indians took it for granted that they were free lances. Strange to say that Mr. Rosenberg came to me within a day or two after and told me that the Chief had asked him if it was true that I was no longer a Magistrate. On the third of December we had all this drunken riot.\n\nFrancis Paul, the Indian policeman makes the following declaration:\n\n\"I, Francis Paul, Indian Policeman of Church House, do solemnly declare that -\n\nTwo or three days before the drunken trouble on December 3rd. between Indians of Church House, I spoke to Dominion Constable T.T. Bartlett and told him that a lot of drinking was going on in the Village. I asked him to go away and come back on the Friday night, when it was dark, to leave his boat at Thompson's wharf, and to row over to the reserve in his row boat when I would meet him, and we would then clear up the people who were drinking. I told him who the people were who were making the drunk. Jack Bartlett he don't want to do it, and tell me he don't care. I asked him two or three times to do this, so we can make the Village better and stop the drinking but Jack he won't do it. I know Jack Bartlett he trade old clothes for baskets.\n\nI make\nI make this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath, and by virtue of the \"Canada Evidence Act.\"\n\nMR. GARLAND: Saturday night I had all the trouble. I spoke to Mr. Bartlett about this and told Mr. Bartlett what the Chief had said when he returned after the trial, and Mr. Bartlett denied that he had told the Chief this but he told me, Mr. Bartlett told me that the Chief had been down to his boat and told him this, that I had lost my magistracy, thereby turning the little tale upside down; that instead of Mr. Bartlett telling the Chief, the Chief told Mr. Bartlett.\n\nAnd there is no doubt in my mind that the spreading of this rumour amongst the Indians, whether Mr. Bartlett is responsible for it or the Chief is responsible for it, was the cause of all the trouble and drunken riot which we had on the Reserve, on the 4th December.\n\nSome time in November Chief Harry reported to me that Dave Paul's house was broken into and said that he had got two witnesses, viz., Mrs. Pallen and Mrs. Jasper Joseph; that Mrs. Hackett and Mrs. Bassett were the two culprits. Mr. Bartlett arrived with Mr. Rosenberg at about 4 p.m. Tuesday the 8th of November, the day after Thanksgiving Day, and in the evening he came to our quarters and I told him about this matter in our quarters and asked him to make an investigation. \"It served them right\" the Constable said. I have never heard that Mr. Bartlett took any steps in the matter, nor did he.\n\nI am a Magistrate and the Indians report these things to me and expect me to do what I can and I do what I can. I can not always be sending for the Provincial Police to do this work, as they frequently grumble at having to do work which they consider should be done by the Dominion Constable.\n\nThe trading of clothes and old boots for baskets with Indians seems to me a most pernicious thing. I would like to draw your attention to this because I think it is a most pernicious thing to do, to be trading and bartering clothes for baskets and baskets. I do not know from what source these old clothes are obtained, other than I have been told by Mr. Perry that charitable institutions and persons are in the habit of contributing wearing apparel for indigent Indians.\n\nOne was an old lady's overcoat of a fawn color. It was shown to me by the Indians. The boots were cloth boots.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: I wish to ask you whether I have given you a patient hearing, whether you have had every opportunity to lay your case before me.\n\nMR. GARLAND: Yes. There is nothing more I have to say, sir.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Mr. Bartlett, you have heard these charges made against you by Mr. Garland to the effect that you have not been carrying out your duty as constable and that you have been making statements with regard to other officials of the Department who are your superiors as far as office is concerned. I wish to have a full statement in that regard.\n\nMr. Bartlett took the oath.\nMR. DITCHBURN: The first matter dealt with is this report referred to by Mr. Garland in his letter of the 14th January dealing with the statement that you make of himself with regard to his household situation in that you told him that you received information to the effect that ........\n\nMR. BARTLETT: except to say how I heard it. On November 19th, I was at the float at Egmont. I had just returned from a trip up Jervis Inlet in which I struck a log, and ran into Egmont to make temporary repairs to the boat. While I was in the rowboat standing at the bow of the launch, a white man, fisherman came along and started to talk to me. He asked me where I come from. I told him I had come from Church House. He then asked me what the trouble was with the schoolmaster who lives at Church House. I asked him what trouble and he told me that he had heard from the Indians that Mr. Garland was Mrs. Garland's father and that the children were his grandchildren. I told him I knew nothing at all about it. When I returned to Church House I was having an argument with Mr. Garland on the float on the 9th of December. Mr. Garland was telling me things he had heard about me and I told him that I had heard this but would him first of all not to tell Mrs. Garland, but just to let him know what people were saying about him. I said nothing at all about living in a state of incest. Simply what I stated here.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Did you ever repeat this story to anybody else?\n\nMR. BARTLETT: Yes. Just Father Bellot before he went up to Church House on the Christmas trip.\n\nMR. BARTLETT: I remember the incident but it has been distorted quite a lot. I remember talking to Mr. Garland about it up in the schoolhouse. When Mr. McLean was here from Ottawa he had an appointment with Mr. Perry one morning and got phoning the office and asking if Mr. Perry was there yet, and about 10 o'clock Mr. Perry came in and he told Miss Delaney and myself that he had been up to see Mr. McLean. I told him that Mr. McLean had been phoning him all the morning. Mr. Perry said he had been up but could not find a place to park his car so he came to the office, and went back to the Vancouver Hotel. There was nothing related about being a liar.\n\nMR. PERRY: I had an appointment to drive Mr. McLean out to Haney and I was in touch with him over night. I told him I would be fixing the car and when I was ready I would communicate with him at the Hotel. In the morning I was fixing my car. I could find no suitable place to park my car and arrived at the office to get my mail. I went back and picked up Mr. McLean and drove him out to Haney.\n\nMR. BARTLETT: When I went up first of all to Church House with the Indian Agent, we went up on Mr. Halliday's boat from Alert Bay, Mr. Halliday himself and the Engineer. All wore Royal Vancouver Yacht Club caps, which Mr. Halliday supplied. I think this is what Mr. Garland refers to. I have never mentioned Mr. Perry dressed up in yachtsman's clothes, but I mentioned Mr. Halliday in Alert Bay.\n\nMR GARLAND: I again repeat that Mr. Bartlett ridiculed Mr. Perry dressed up as a yachtsman and then pointed out that he aped a yachtsman. I have never heard Mr. Halliday's name mentioned. So help me, God.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 315-1, part 1)\nMR. DITCHBURN: Mr. Garland stated that you have referred to Mr. Perry as a broken down Methodist minister.\n\nMR. BARTLETT: I may have mentioned to Mr. Garland that Mr. Perry may have been a minister at one time.\n\nMR. GARLAND: Again I affirm that Mr. Bartlett .........that Mr. Perry.... who was chased out of Alert Bay or the people would have killed him.\n\nMr. Perry stated that he had never lived in Alert Bay; that he had spent one day there as guest of a clergyman; that he had been in Prince Rupert prior to coming to Vancouver.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Mr. Garland has also stated that you informed him that Mr. Perry was drunk on the Sliammon Reserve and ............\n\nMR. BARTLETT: I deny that Mr. Ditchburn. It is some Indian yarn that he is trying to frame on me. I know of no time when Mr. Perry has been drunk on the Sliammon or any other reserve. In fact I can say that I have never seen Mr. Perry under the influence of liquor at any time.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: .......that you informed Mr. Garland and his wife that the Indian Agent, Mr. Perry, could not hold his job but for yourself and Miss Delaney, because Mr. Perry was flying about in an automobile.\n\nMR. BARTLETT: I deny that Mr. Ditchburn. I may have mentioned something about Mr. Perry going out in an automobile.\n\nMR. PERRY: I would like to ask Mr. Bartlett if he has not seen me sick in this office from the work and if I have not taken work home and attended to it at night Mr. Cairns up to ten o'clock in the morning has his work done by the stenographer, while I am attending to outside calls and getting letters ready.\n\nMR. CAIRNS: (Speaking of an arrangement he had made with Mr. Perry to have his work done by the Indian Agent's stenographer) I was to have my work done from 9 to 10 o'clock, and then I am through, and the stenographer takes charge of Mr. Perry's work.\n\nMR. PERRY: .....and my night work more than makes up for that.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Mr. Garland also states that you alluded to Inspector Cairns in a very incredible way in that you state...........\n\nMR. BARTLETT: I remember saying something about Mr. Cairns when we were going up to Bute Inlet and of the number of schools he had to look after and this took him all his time, but if he had to look after all the schools in the Province he would not last five minutes.\n\nMR. CAIRNS: There are 15 or 16 Provincial School Inspectors covering the same territory that I do. I have lasted more than five minutes. I have lasted fifty years in the public service.\n\nReferring\nMR. BARLETT: (Referring to the incident of advising Mr. Garland to write to Ottawa about requisitions) I do not remember that incident at all. He had a pile of envelopes so that he could compare the dates and that if Mr. Perry did not answer his letters he would write direct to Mr. Ditchburn.\n\nMR. GARLAND: Some of my letters in the early part of my service there were not answered for six weeks, but it was due to Mr. Bartlett talking with us that led me to write to say that in my Government service I had always been taught that no matter how trivial the contents might appear to the recipient, it deserved the courtesy of a reply. My answer was a courteous and satisfactory reply, and I know that the letters had all received a reply, I am satisfied, afterwards.\n\nMR. BARTLETT: (re the Dominion elections) I have never told that to anybody and I know I am not qualified to be an Indian Agent. But I remember Mr. Garland saying to me that if there was a change in elections, Mr. Perry would be the first to go.\n\nMR. BARTLETT: (re sanitary conditions at Church House) I made a report on that, Mr. Ditchburn, and I stated that the\n\nMR. PERRY: That the report led up to the Commissioner's recommendation that the sanitary conditions be improved, and as explained in my evidence yesterday it was handled by the Water Power Branch, and the sanitary conditions that were complained of then are now in good condition.\n\nThe habits of the Indians were the same, that is the sanitary conditions.\n\nMR. GARLAND: His conversations with me and his reports vary greatly. \"and I will support you in every way and I will send you a copy of this report.\" And when I spoke to Mr. Perry about this afterwards, I forget when, Mr. Perry told me the report Mr. Bartlett made was that the village was no worse than any other village.\n\nMR. PERRY: I will say that what we have done for the improvement of the sanitary conditions is as satisfactory as it can humanly be done. These Indians will let any officials take off their coats and do their work, if they will do it.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Mr. Garland states that on one occasion when a boat came into Church House with two Indian girls and Prendergast on board and the girls were to make an affidavit ............\n\nMR. BARTLETT: I have already turned in a report to Mr. Perry on the whole matter and have it on file.\n\nThe launch came in to Church House and was tied up at the wharf. I asked them what they were doing there and they said they brought Prendergast home from Redonda Bay. I made them put their launch inside the float and told them not to go away. In the morning I took them up to Mr. Garland to make a statement as to what they were doing at Church House. At the end\nMR. BARTLETT: of the float one of the girls refused to go along so I gave her a boost with my knee. I did not knock her down or kick her as stated by Mr. Garland.\n\nJessie Louie, 17, is married to a white man and does not come under the Indian Act, and Catherine Louie is only 14\u00bd, and there is no institution to which we could send this girl even if she was brought up and convicted, as Indian girls are not permitted in the Industrial Home.\n\nWe had nothing on Prendergast at all, and the charge could not be laid as the girls denied everything about it and we had nothing to go on.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: Mr. Garland has stated that Mr. Bartlett does not carry out his duties in the manner in which he should do, that he is careless as for instance the manner in which he measured up the houses to be painted.\n\nMR. BARTLETT: I can tell you how the measurements were taken. It was raining hard at the time. I got a stick and measured it, six feet. I had a ruler and measured the stick. Measured the front and sides of the house, along the base and from that I was able to estimate the height of the walls. The windows I did not bother about because I had all kinds of photographs I could get the windows from. It was only approximate and when I made out the report for the painter I put in the average number of windows in the house.\n\nMR. PERRY: I have always found Constable Bartlett when asked for data along this line to be correct and right. He is a first class engineer, as you know. I have found the constable exceedingly careful and thorough if I had asked him for a definite estimate.\n\nI did not know he measured with an ashbed stick. He has made the approximate estimate only.\n\nMR. GARLAND: I made no remark about this measurement at that time, but I wrote to Mr. Perry about the measurement if there was anything wrong I wished to disassociate myself with the onus.\n\nMR. BARTLETT: (referring to the charge that he had taken no steps to find out about the flour from Mr. Gerrard's store found at Mrs. Pallen's house.) I remember the time on June 23rd, that Mr. Garland talks about. I left Mr. Perry at Sliammon and went on up to Church House to put a lock on the school house door and also to enquire about Freddie Blaney, a sick Indian boy with a view to taking him down to Powell River. I put the lock on the door which any ten year old kid could have done without me going up. I went with Mr. Garland to see Freddie Blaney. He was too sick to move and I understand he died two days afterwards.\n\nMr. Perry was waiting for me at Powell River. I had no time to attend to the flour business at the time. Indians receiving relief, if they have a little flour on hand will sometimes trade it for other food which they have got amongst themselves, such as deer meat, possibly that is now Mrs. Pallen got it from the other Indian. I have been up there two or three times since, but have heard nothing more about it. I did not refuse to look into it. I had to leave then so as to get back to Sliammon.\n\nI can not say whether I did or not. I don't think I did. It happened as I pulled out, otherwise I would have reported it to Mr. Perry.\n\nSophia Wilson wanted her relief changed to Powell River from Church House. I told her that I had nothing to do with that but to go back and clean up her house. I said nothing to\nMR. BARTLETT: I said nothing to her about the four sacks.\n\n(Mr. Garland had stated that Sophie Wilson had come to him and said that Mr. Bartlett on meeting her at Powell River had told her to go up to Church House and get four sacks of flour which, as part of her relief supplies, were at Mr. Garland's place for her.)\n\nMR. BARTLETT: (Re the charge that he refused to look into the matter of the boom chains for Isaac Fran\u00e7ois)\nI arrived at Church House about 3 p.m. the 13th February taking from Powell River the $25.00 from Prendergast to hand to the Magistrate. I saw Mr. Garland and he is quite right what he told you about that, but boom chains are very hard to identify and the Indian had no identification marks on them at all, no way of telling they were his.\n\nWhen I was at Powell River I received a telegram from the Indian Agent about trouble at Jervis Inlet, and made a special trip to Church House with the money for the fine and I left Church House at 4.25 p.m., not 6 p.m. as stated by Mr. Garland.\n\nI stopped at Squirrel Cove at 7 p.m. and left at 8.45 a.m. and arrived at Sliammon at 11.40 a.m. I had to get up to Jervis Inlet.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: There is an Indian report through Mr. Garland that the Indian's boom chains had apparently been stolen and he believed that Mr. Secord had them in his boat three miles away at Mushkin.\n\nMR. BARTLETT: There was nothing to identify them.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: I consider you should have looked into it. It was not as if you had to go many miles. The matter was important enough to warrant an investigation at the time, and I think that as Mr. Bartlett did not give this attention he was remiss in his duty.\n\nMR. BARTLETT: (Re Chief Harry's statement that Mr. Bartlett had told him Mr. Garland was no longer a Magistrate.)\nI left Church House on December 1st, intending to go to Malaspina Arm, but the boat was leaking badly so I went to Squirrel Cove.\nI did not make this statement. The Chief came down to my boat and asked me about the matter. I told him I did not know anything about it.\nShortly afterwards I saw Mr. Garland and denied it to Mr. Garland. There were the two of us in the village and if Mr. Garland had wanted to he could have got us together. I have not the slightest information where Chief Harry got it.\n\nMR. BARTLETT: (Re affidavit of Francis Paul) I remember making some arrangement with Francis Paul to go away and come back again on some night, but no definite date made at this time when I was up there. We just talked it over, as doing it some time. If Francis said there was a date, he is wrong.\nAbout the Indians who were making home brew, Mr. Garland knows them all there and in fact he had them up before him and got the home brew and everything, and instead of charging him or being in possession of home brew, he let him go on a light fine of being drunk.\n\nDon't\nDon't you think as Constable in this Agency that when a matter is brought to your attention of that kind it is important to make some arrangement to cope with it.\n\nMR. BARTLETT: The only way to do this is to sneak up on them, as long as I am in the village there is no trouble at all.\n\nMR. DITCHBURN: As to the question of your disposing of old clothes to Indians for baskets, the assumption taken from the charge in the first place was to the effect that these old clothes disposed of to Indians were those supplied by the Department for distribution to indigent Indians.\n\nMR. BARTLETT: When I went up to Church House on my last trip, I took up one lady's coat, some old silk stockings and about two dozen pairs of new shoes which I purchased myself here in Vancouver. They were old style shoes but brand new and I got them very cheap and thought I would give them to the Indians for Christmas. I gave away shoes at Squirrel Cove and Church House, receiving nothing in exchange for them, and the coat I offered to Mrs. Francois Paul for a basket but she had no good baskets and I did not trade.\n\nMrs. Peter Harry came voluntarily to the boat and offered me trade for the coat, which I accepted and gave her girl two pairs of shoes. I can give you the name and address of the lady that sent up the coat if you wish. Mrs. Harry appeared to be quite satisfied. It was a good coat.\n\nAfter we moved from the Holden Building to the Winch Building Mr. Perry was putting away some sweaters in the safe of the office which had been received from Mr. Ditchburn for distribution to indigent Indians. Two of the packages had been torn open and the moths had got into two sweaters. Mr. Perry told me to burn them, take them away and destroy them or something for fear the moths would get into the other sweaters. I told Mr. Perry if he did not mind I could use those old sweaters down on the boat for doing the dirty work, and Mr. Perry said it was all right. I took the sweaters into my office and just then Provincial Constable Boyne came into the office. I asked him where I could find sweaters and he told me telling me he could have one if he wished for something in his boat. Sometime later I went under Mr. Perry's instructions two sweaters up to Chief George Harry at Church House. These are all the sweaters I have handled as the others are locked up in Mr. Perry's safe, of which I have not the combination and no means of getting at.\n\nWhen at Church House on my last visit I noticed Mr. Garland wearing one of these issued sweaters. I asked him where he got it and he replied that he bought it from the Chief for $1.00.\n\n---\n\n(Regarding Jimmie Wilson's case it was explained that Mr. Bartlett took Mr. Rosenberg, who is an experienced contractor, over with him to estimate the size of the house that had been burned down. Mr. Rosenberg measured the base of the building and it was found that the building was not capable of holding 100 bundles.)\nOttawa, March 24, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nSince writing my letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to the conduct of the Homalco Indian Day School, I have received the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Hedley-Garland. They feel that their period of usefulness has expired and it would be better if a change were made during the summer. I have replied to Mr. Garland, stating that this is in harmony with the Department's wishes. When you write to the Rev. Father Welsh, you might indicate that Mr. and Mrs. Garland have agreed with the Department that a change is in the best interests of the work at the Homalco Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. C. Ferry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n415 Winch Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, March 24, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, which is pursuant to an investigation recently held by Mr. Inspector Cairns and Mr. Indian Agent Perry. I note that you are desirous of remaining at the school until the end of the June quarter and that you suggest a new teacher be secured as from the first of September, next. This is in harmony with the Department's wishes, as it was decided upon receipt of our officers' report, it would be better in the interests of the work at the Homalco Indian Day School if a change was made during the summer. For your satisfaction, I am pleased to state that the Department believes there has been a deliberate effort on the part of a certain clique of Indians to injure your reputation. I am asking Mr. Indian Agent Perry to have the Very Rev. J. Welsh, C. M. I., nominate suitable successors for the positions of teacher and matron.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. Hedley-Garland, Esq.,\nHomalco Indian Reserve,\nChurch House,\nB. C.\nand thereby suppressing any chance of ill-feeling or outbreak between the two factions, viz., the Chief's family and the remainder of the Village, as I am convinced that my successor will find the position difficult enough at any time, without being handicapped right at the beginning.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nOttawa, March 22nd, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, reporting on the investigation conducted by yourself and Mr. Inspector Cairns into certain charges of alleged misconduct on the part of Mr. A. H. Garland, teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, after fully considering this report, the Department has decided that it would be in the best interests of the work to dispense with the services of Mr. and Mrs. Garland at the end of the present academic year, viz., June 30th, next. The Department has noted the finding of Mr. Cairns and yourself that a spirit of hostility and unrest exists at Church House between certain factions and Mr. and Mrs. Garland. You should give them due notice before the 1st of June, next, that their services will not be required after the date above mentioned.\n\nMr. Garland should prepare and forward to you returns of attendance and days taught covering the period of his services, and this you should forward to the Department in order that payment of salary due him can be made.\n\nThe appointment of a teacher and matron to begin duties when the school reopens after the summer holidays next should receive your attention in due time, and you should take this matter up with Very Rev. John Welch, O.M.I., 59 Blackwood St., New Westminster, who was interested in the appointment of the Garlands, with view to having him nominate suitable persons for the positions of teacher and matron, respectively. In this connection I would refer you to your letter of March 30th, 1925, relative to the appointment of the Garlands. The names, qualifications and experience of the parties nominated by Rev. Father Welch should be forwarded in due time for the approval of the Department.\n\nThe enclosures which you forwarded in connection with the above mentioned matter have also been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n415 Winch Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to Departmental letter No. 167-33-1, dated January 25th last, in which instructions were sent to me to proceed to Church House Reserve No. 6, of the Homalco Band and investigate certain charges of alleged misconduct on the part of Mr. A. H. Garland, Indian School teacher, towards certain Indian women as complained of by certain Homalco Indians to the Department.\n\nI desire to report that, after issuing forms of summons to all parties concerned, and upon request made by me to the Indian Commissioner that Mr. R. H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, should be invited to accompany me and assist in the investigation of the complaints, the Inspector and I visited Church House by steamer on March 3rd, and made arrangements for the inquiry to commence at 10 a.m. Monday, March 5th. On the latter date we opened the inquiry with all parties concerned present at the Indian Day School building.\n\nWilliam Mitchell, Indian Constable of Squirrel Cove acted as a special and independent interpreter, and he and all witnesses were placed on oath.\n\nDuring three days of very careful examination, twenty-one witnesses were heard, pro and con. We made a thorough effort to get at the very bottom of the complaints, and are of the opinion that a plot had been most\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, ONT.\nMarch 13, 1928.\n\ncunningly laid and executed by about ten Indians, mostly relatives and tribal associates of Chief George Harry, headed by him, these Indians, both male and female, being mostly of undoubted questionable character. This was supported by a volume of sworn evidence, of insufficient depth however to justify either the plot itself or even the suggestion of actual immoral conduct on the part of Mr. Garland.\n\nThree women accused Mr. Garland of immoral relations with them, and a fourth, in addition to one of the three mentioned claimed that Mr. Garland had given them intoxicants as an inducement to the misconduct. The husband of one of the three first named supported the testimony of his wife.\n\nMr. Garland submitted the witnesses to a most gruelling cross-examination in his defence against the charges, as a result of which we were impressed with the belief that the charges were false and the characters making them were perjuring themselves.\n\nIn summing up the evidence taken at the inquiry it is believed that the motive of the Indians who made the charges were:\n\n1. Jealousy of Chief Harry against Alex Paul, Chief chosen by the Priest to represent the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n2. The activity of Mr. Garland as Indian Day School teacher in having Chief Harry's son Jimmy compelled to attend school.\n\n3. The search of Chief Harry's house for intoxicants under warrant issued by Mr. Garland acting as Stipendiary Magistrate.\n\n4. The conviction in Court by Mr. Garland of relatives of Chief Harry following a drunken brawl in the reserve on December 3rd last.\n\nThe woman\nMarch 13, 1928.\n\n5. The women used by Chief Harry to further the charges against Mr. Garland were of bad character and Chief Harry believed he could get them to swear falsely on grounds of immorality.\n\n6. Those who witnessed the documents setting forth the charges were also relatives and friends of Chief Harry and these were of apparent necessity to the combination.\n\nWhile we are decidedly of the belief that Mr. Garland is not guilty of the offences alleged against him, we feel however that the following portions of Mr. Garland's evidence should be commented upon: viz-\n\n1. When charged by Indian woman Sophie Wilson with having kissed her at Sliammon Reserve in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson, teacher and matron, respectively, Mr. Garland said:\n\n\"I deny the Sliammon incident emphatically.\"\n\nIn this matter a letter (Exhibit No.1.) is sent herewith signed by Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson which confirms the evidence of the Indian woman Sophie Wilson.\n\n2. In his evidence of defence Mr. Garland further stated:\n\n\"I have never had a liquor permit, nor liquor in these quarters.\"\n\nIn this matter a letter (Exhibit No.2.) is sent herewith signed by Mr. Garland soon after he took over the position of teacher asking Constable Bartlett to send him a bottle of rum and a bottle of brandy. The Constable refused to do as Mr. Garland asked. Later Mr. Garland entered a bottle of brandy in an official requisition for drug supplies, and this item was deleted at the Vancouver office.\n\nIt should be stated that on our arrival at Church House we found the Indians of the reserve in a high state of excitement, two rival factions appearing as a mine ready to explode.\nMarch 13, 1928.\n\nto explode on the slightest provocation, one of these factions being in sympathy with Mr. Garland and the other strongly against him.\n\nDuring the course of the inquiry we observed that both Mr. and Mrs. Garland displayed a conspicuous lack of self control and their hostile attitude and vociferous language coupled with the observable movements of the eldest daughter (age 14) of Mr. and Mrs. Garland who was very active in the matter of her father's defence, gave rise to the belief that these people are not suitable persons to maintain the peace and goodwill desired in this village, and we feel that if they are allowed to remain there there will be further trouble between them and the Indians; as it is clear that Mr. and Mrs. Garland's tendency is to foment trouble through partisanship and favoritism.\n\nWe are able to state without hesitation that improvement is seen in the discipline and school work in the classroom at Homalco Indian Day School under Mr. Garland, but the work of the Field Matron is undoubtedly hampered through the admitted dispositions of Mr. and Mrs. Garland not to leave their school quarters after sunset because of their fear of the Indians, although generally her work is otherwise seemingly satisfactory.\n\nMention should be made also of a statement made by Mrs. Garland to the Commissioner at Vancouver that she was obliged to give her young daughter (age 14) a stick to carry in order that she may ward off, if necessary, bands of Indian lads bent on mischief towards her.\n\nWe feel that these three young children should no longer remain amongst the Indians at Church House it being brought to my attention also that they foment considerable trouble amongst the Indian children.\n\nWhen Mr. Garland was appointed it was pointed out to the Department that it had been our policy up to that time not to have a teacher and matron with a young family at this village, and the acceptance of the Garlands to fill these vacancies and our allowing them to go with their three children\n\nto this\nMarch 13, 1928.\n\nto this village, was a digression from this policy owing to the difficulty of obtaining incumbents without children.\n\nWe are satisfied that a decided spirit of hostility and unrest exists at Church House partly between two factions and partly between one of these factions and Mr. Garland. This being the case, and also as we are of opinion that Mr. and Mrs. Garland are not sufficiently well balanced either in their experience with Indians or in their disposition towards things and persons in general, we recommend that the Department request Reverend Father Bellot, district priest at Squamish Mission Reserve, North Vancouver, B.C., to ask the responsible Church Authorities to call for the early resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Garland and to recommend suitable persons to fill the positions of teacher and matron thus to be vacated at the Indian Village of Homalco Band at Church House, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[C.C.Perry]\nIndian Agent.\n\nI, R.

Garland, Homalo Indian Day School teacher with Indian women in the Homalo reserve at Church House, B.C.\n\nIn reply I beg to say I would suggest for the present acknowledgment of the letter saying the matter is being investigated by the Indian Agent. I propose going to Church House at the earliest moment when I will fully investigate the complaints and make a complete report to the Department. I may say that I have received complaints before about similar alleged conduct on the part of Mr. Garland, but the complaints have come from the members and relatives of Chief George Larry, while a petition has reached me from practically the balance of the band members referring to the Chief as a bad man and a \"think\" and asking that the teacher be kept in his position. Mr. Garland is a Stipendiary Magistrate and in this capacity has taken very drastic action recently amongst the members of Chief Larry's family for drunkenness in the Homalo village, finding them heavily.\n\nThe department will probably remember that formerly the Homalo Band were in two divisions - the Homalo and Orford Bay, respectively. These two\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJanuary 17, 1926.\n\nbelieved that the occurrence was a machination of certain white residents in the locality, who had been dealt with by Mr. Garland as a magistrate, in concert with a few disgruntled Indians. Mr. Garland swore he would try to get at the bottom of the matter but so far he has failed to do so and the recent complaints are apparently a recurrence of the old feud between these particular Indians and Mr. Garland.\n\nWhile I feel it is a good thing to have a representative of law and order in the person of a magistrate in the vicinity of Church House, which is the most remote settlement in Vancouver agency, and Mr. Garland's removal may not be the best thing, yet the charges made against him make it imperative, in the interests of the Department as well as the Indians, that the fullest possible investigation be held and I intend going carefully and without fear or favor into the matter of these complaints.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(U.S. Perry)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 3rd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from an Indian at Church House, B.C., who signs the name \"Chief Geo. Harry\", in which he makes certain statements regarding the personal conduct of Mr. A. H. Garland, teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School. I shall be pleased if you will state whether any notice should be taken of his letter and also, if you have any information regarding the associating of Mr. Garland with the Indian women on the Reserve, if you will furnish a full report regarding same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nFor you know of Mr. Garland, School Teacher Church, I am of what he's doing.\n\nLast spring he asked Mrs. Wilson to kiss him for a drink of rum. And this was done, and gave her a small bottle, and do some bad business, and Mrs. Wilson run away and came to my wife and give her drink. Didn't have.\n\nI got home I saw the rum and the two women drunk, and took the rum about three inches left in it, and I asked them where they got it. And say its from Mr. Garland.\n\nAnd I went to Mr. Perry and gave him the rest of the little bottle, so he know it too.\n\nAnd this summer he's starting again to another woman, to Mrs. Wilson.\nMemorandum:\n\nThe annual report submitted by Mr. A.H. Garland, Teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School, apparently shows that he has been doing very good work at this school and has met with considerable success. He has very excellent professional certificates and qualifications.\n\n[Signature]\n\n1/5/27\nOttawa, October 12th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing the September quarter return of the Homalco Indian Day School, together with a communication from the teacher in which he outlines certain arrangements which he suggests be carried out in order that the children can remain on the Reserve and attend school while their parents are away at the fisheries. Consideration has been given to Mr. Garland's suggestion that the priest's house be fitted up and used as a dining room for the children, to be conducted under the charge of Indian women. The Department is not prepared to carry out this arrangement and agree with Mr. Inspector Cairns and yourself that it would not be practicable.\n\nIt is noted that the parents, with their children, are away from the Reserve during September and October, after the usual holiday period in July and August, and that, consequently, the school attendance is reduced to almost nil. To overcome this condition, it might be advisable to make a change in the annual holiday period - the school to be kept open during the two summer months and closed during September and October. If you consider that this change in the holiday period would overcome the present difficulty as regards attendance, I shall be pleased to have your recommendation as to whether you would advise that the change mentioned be made in the holiday period or not. The only other solution would be the placing of these children in residential schools.\n\nPlease advise the teacher that the Department is not prepared to approve of the scheme outlined by him for the care of the Indian children while their parents are absent from the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith the quarterly returns of the Homileo Indian Day School, for the quarter ending Sept. 30th ultimo.\n\nWith reference to the remarks of Mr. A. H. Garland in the remarks column, I beg to say I am attaching to the returns a lengthy letter received from Mr. Garland which will throw further light upon the remarks contained in this report. This letter has been discussed with Mr. R. M. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, who states that it is his opinion the suggestions offered by Mr. Garland while being good in theory, would not be likely to work out in practice, as a similar arrangement was made as an experiment at Church House several years ago without success.\n\nI have advised Mr. Garland that the Roman Catholic Boarding Schools at Sechelt and elsewhere are open to receive pupils whose parents find it necessary to leave their villages in pursuit of their avocations and leave their children for others to take care of.\n\nI would like the Department to kindly peruse carefully this correspondence and advise me whether it is proposed by the Department to accede to Mr. Garland's request. I may say that the experiment referred to by Mr. Cairns was made previous to my taking office in Vancouver and I am not familiar with the circumstances thereof.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nChurch House No. 10th Sept 1926\n\nDear Mr. Percy,\n\nYour No. 49 of 26 Aug 1926\n\nRe Priest's House at Church House\n\nDuring church it must have been some time (the latter end of June or beginning of July) that I wrote to you on the subject of the Priest's House being used as a sort of feeding place or restaurant for the children. Understanding that the parents of the children would be going away fishing in September and probably not returning until November it meant that no body would be in the village and I should be minus my children during Sept., Oct. and part of November. They would have already had July & August as holidays and the absence from school of many of them was to me an important and serious problem to solve.\n\nThe Priest's house was and is vacant and I am convinced will never be again used by the Priest, at least, not whilst I am here. It is an up-to-date heat conditioned house in the Village and, cared easily and inexpensively converted into the house for which I should have desired. As no doubt you are fully aware, there is apparently no love lost...\nbetween the different families and our family\nresorts the looking after another family's child.\nHowever they do do so, in some cases, but, with\nreluctance and even resentment, but, do not\nseem to openly exhibit that reluctance or\nresentment. The reason why the children\nare taken away is because there is no one to\nfeed them and give them general attention.\nNow then, there are one or two comfortless\n(family so) women in the village who are\nmore or less incapable of hard work and\naccompanying their husbands, whom I\nthought could be utilized. For instance\nMrs. Johnson Blaney, Annie Blaney,\nSophie Wilson or Jack Lee's wife, all of\nwhom are on the independent or relief\nlist.\n\nLet me get away from the subject for a\nmoment or two. Then, and you must be\nconscious of it - a deep rooted objection\nto sending their children to be chief - and\nthe reason for it appears to me to be the\nfood. The children apparently complain\nabout the food and the death of more than\none child by the Indians proved at the\nfood they get at Sechelt. Of course you\nknow, as I know, as everyone knows\nthe food supplied to them at Sechelt is\ngood and sound, but, does it meet\nwith what they have been accustomed\nto. You feed a dog on fish all his\nlife and then suddenly do away with\nhis fish and place him on a diet\nand he turns sick, it upsets him.\nthe stomach rejects its creations and the animal eventually dies for want of proper nourishment. So with us all\u2014a child should not be forced to eat what it does not like or what it has not been accustomed to.\n\nLet me return to the Subject matter. The downstairs part of the Private House could be converted into a Dining Hall\u2014a large cook stove (2nd hand one could be picked up cheaply) there is already a well with running water\u2014two long tables and chairs made out of lumber\u2014some cooking utensils\u2014white and blue enamelled plates cups & saucers, bacon together with knives, forks, spoons, pepper and salt castors, all of which could be purchased economically. So much for the equipment. One room upstairs to be used as a Store Room. Only children going to School to be fed here\u2014and then only during that long period when their Parents are away, say from Sept to November, and any other period in which their Parents are away for a long time. Also, tea, sugar and rice with any vegetable they may feel disposed to add\u2014will be supplied by the parents of children attending School or feeding at the Institution. The boys, all of whom are fairly husky looking and can manage a boat well, can fish and an evening time after School and replenish the Larder by their haul or catch. The cooking and serving of the\nfood, together with the cleaning, washing of - \nand general keeping of the place in a \nhealthy sanitary condition to be done by \nthe two women (whom they may be) under \nwhite supervision. The building to be used \nfor feeding only - no sleeping for anyone in \nit - The children to go to their own homes or houses \nfor sleeping, and, in this, supervision to be exercised \nby the 2 Indian women who will see that the \nchildren are in by a certain hour. The houses \nare so close together that 2 women could \neasily attend to this - Thus the children are \nhelped by their own people; the food is what \nthey are accustomed to and cooked according \nto their own methods and likes. On our side \n(that is the Government side) we have the children \ncoming to School, instead of being exposed to \nwet, damp, hard and unhealthy living, from \ngetting everything they may have wanted to \nhave - and on its pleasant side, they are \nrelieved of any anxiety (if there maybe any) in \nits knowledge that they are earning their \nliving. That their children are being educated \nand are being fed with no trouble to them \nOf course there is the question of cleanliness \nwashing of clothes and general body \nhygiene. We taken into consideration \nI cannot say that this scheme would \nbe workable in its present embryonic \ncondition - but I think something could \nbe evolved by an earnest discussion \nof its pros & cons.\n\nCuriously enough, without any \none having said anything to the Indians\nabout this, here we have Mr. Bartlett's family in the village with his children coming to school (3 children) and he is the only family in the village, but she is feeding and housing all other children who are coming to school, under what it seems to me, the same plan. Of course I am against his having these children, as the house is, I should imagine more or less overcrowded, and cannot be in a healthy or sanitary condition, so I am afraid that Mr. Bartlett is one of the laziest and dirtiest women in the village, but, of course I cannot interfere as the arrangement seems agreed to be private and mutual on the part of those concerned but Mr. Bartlett may be able to help in with his authority as a constable whose I cannot use, and I am not like him to do this as I would dislike an outbreak of smallpox fever or any other smallpox or some such loathsome disease, this is the family that spread the rumors as well as Mr. Davis.\n\nKindest regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Two of these were taken away after 3 days and one after 5 days. Three were taken away to Sechelt on the 29th, Sept., 1926. It is to be deplored that some plan could not be evolved by which all the children could not return to Day school on the 1st of the month and remain permanently. I am of the opinion it could be successfully done. Those that have come to school are bright and eager to learn and desire no more holidays. Those whom have not yet returned, but, whom I have seen, have expressed a keen desire to return, but cannot do so until their parents return or till their parents can get someone to look after them, parents having to be away earning a living. Of the few who came to school on the 1st Sept., I have practically a full attendance.\n\nA. Hadley Garland.\n\nTeacher.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter of April 16th, 1926, with reference to the appointments of Mr. and Mrs. Durand to the positions of teacher and field worker respectively at Homalo.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that a flight letter of the 14th instant, refer to therein as having been sent to me was not received by me. Your letter telegram of 16th April, however, duly reached me following which arrangements were made with Mr. Durand for the purchase of the necessary furnishings and also for the commencement of his duty at the Homalo village church house. Mrs. Durand is in the East, but is expected to arrive at the Coast shortly and will join Mr. Durand in due course.\n\nThe Department seems to be under the impression that the estimate of the cost of furnishings appears too high but I would state in this connection that before the matter was submitted to the Department inquiries were made from three firms in Vancouver and the contract sent to the Department was based upon prices given. It may be possible to cut down a little the cost of equipping the premises by purchasing furnishings instead of having to have this matter under consideration and we will look into the details out as economically as possible.\n\nWith regard to the inquiry in their last move mentioned telegram as to the children of Mr. and Mrs. Durand I wish to inform you that the difficulties of having children accompanying our employees to Church House were fully explained to Mr. Durand, upon which he decided to go to Church House and look into the situation for himself, before deciding as to the taking of his children there. There are three children in this family. It has been our policy for some time not to engage officers for these positions who might find it necessary to take children to this village, but our experiences, as well as those of others, have been such as to suggest a departure from this practice, particularly as we now consider that a family man with more responsibilities and considerations might be a more stabilizing influence amongst the Indians and moreover an excellent educational status of the Durands will lead us to believe these people better able to take care of the education of their children than in many other cases. In any event these appointments can be tried out and we must be guided to a large extent by our experience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nI have your 4/46 of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the application of Mr. and Mrs. Garland for the positions of teacher and field matron, respectively, at Homalco. I have to confirm my night letter of the 8th instant, as follows:\n\n\"Reference your letter thirtieth, concerning application of Mr. and Mrs. Garland for Homalco, how old is he and how many, if any, of their children will accompany them? Is not your estimate of cost of furnishings and cleaning, etc., too high?\"\n\nI have also your telegram in this connection of yesterday's date and I wish to confirm my answering night letter of today's date as follows:\n\n\"Reference application of Garlands for Homalco, my telegram to you eighth instant evidently went astray. You may telegraph Homalco engaging Garlands at salaries of nine hundred and fifty dollars for ten teaching months and four hundred and eighty dollars per annum, respectively - no allowances for fuel. Authority granted expenditure reasonable amount for furnishing and renovating teacher's residence.\"\n\nIn view of your recommendation and that of Mr. Inspector Cairns, the Department has given very favourable consideration to the application of Mr. and Mrs. Garland. I offered no allowance for janitor service or for fuel, but made the teacher's salary $950 for the ten teaching months. I cannot agree to a monthly payment of the teacher's salary; but, if he will write to you and you to the Department during each quarter, a part payment will be made. In practice, this would amount to payments every six weeks for the ten teaching months on the basis of $95 per month. The salary offered in the case of the field matron is $480 per annum and this will be payable monthly, upon receipt of your monthly pay list.\n\nThe Department considers that your estimate of the cost of furnishing and cleaning the teacher's residence is too high and you were authorized in my night letter to purchase what was absolutely necessary and have the renovating required undertaken.

D. McLEAN.\nSir,\n\nThe Department will be aware that the offices of Indian Day School Teacher and Field Patron, respectively, at Church House - the Hope No.6 reserve of the Nokolos band of Indians have been vacant for the past couple of months owing to the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Alex Burke.\n\nThe Rev. Father Welch, Vicar of Roman Catholic Missions, has sent three applicants for these positions, two of whom after ascertaining the various phases of information surrounding the appointment and local conditions have not made a formal application.\n\nThe third applicant, Mr. A. Hedley Garland, formerly Superintendent of Education of the Provincial Government of Manitoba came upon making application to see Mr. Mitchell and his wife for the vacant positions, advised to visit Church House, look over the premises, and make a personal observation of the life of the Indians, as it was felt that he appeared to be a man of very superior tastes, and that he may not be satisfied to take up residence at Church House under the same conditions as previous incumbents have done. Mr. Garland went to Church House, and upon his return he wrote a letter of application, a copy of which is sent herewith, for the Department's perusal and consideration.\n\nAfter interviewing Mr. Garland, with Mr. Ann Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, we have decided to forward the letter of Mr. Garland with our recommendation that if possible, this application be given favourable consideration. For some time we have felt that more could be done by our officers at Church House, but on account of the lack of experience of applicants and the more or less crude standards of living of the Indians we have not experienced more than a casual improvement notwithstanding the appointees of the Department have done their best to give satisfaction in their work.\n\nOn the other hand, in view of the present application I feel it my duty to point out to the Department that notwithstanding the efforts which have been made by previous employees filling the positions mentioned in a formal way, there have been some personal troubles of discipline attached to previous employees which have given this office some embarrassment such as having tended to affect the morale of the officers in question. One of them was the case of Miss Davis Boyle, who became ill through a nervous condition named Albert Wilson, the circumstances which culminated in the resignation of Miss Boyle, as teacher, and her mother, as patron, notwithstanding the services of Mrs. Boyle and her daughter so far as their specific work was concerned.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nThe other case is that of Mr. and Mrs. Alex. Burke, who have just resigned from these appointments. While Mr. Burke's services as Teacher were regarded by Mr. Inspector Cairns and myself as being most satisfactory, and the services of Mrs. Burke, as Matron, equally so, nevertheless the Nomad Indians at a public meeting informed me recently that there had been evidences of domestic infidelity at the home of teacher and matron; and the premises were left in an unsatisfactory condition from a sanitary point of view. Moreover, guests were instructed by these offenders which have not been discharged. On my recent visit to Church House I found the premises in a worse condition than I had expected to see them, although there is a possibility that the Indians themselves may be to some extent responsible for the condition of the rooms, as it has often been to be an inevitable practice of the Indians upon the vacation of these premises by our employees to break into the premises and to steal drugs and school materials and to generally ransack the premises. On each occasion I have sent the Dominion Constable to Church House to investigate but he has been unable to obtain any clues that would bring the offenders to justice.\n\nIn view of the foregoing it is anticipated and expected that in the event of Mr. and Mrs. Garland being appointed to fill these positions, a more satisfactory service and regime will be inaugurated and a better tone and morale will be established in the Reserve.\n\nThe Department will probably consider the requisition of Mr. Garland for furniture rather large, but if it is the intention of the Department to furnish the quarters for the use of these incumbents, it is thought that in view of the fact that the furnishings at present in the building herein described constitute, the place will have to be made more attractive by the installation of better furnishings if we are to induce people of the desired calibre to accept the vacant positions. Mr. Garland states that he considers the requisition he has made to be very moderate, and Mr. Cairns and I, after considering the same very carefully, are inclined to agree with him, with the exception perhaps that we are of opinion that one or two couches instead of two may be sufficient. Mr. Garland, however, wishes to leave the final decision in this matter best left with the Department.\n\nThe monthly payment of a teacher's salary is a departure from the practice of the Department, but if this could be arranged we would recommend it. We would also recommend the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Garland, and would be glad if the Department would send a wire advising us of its decision at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe probable cost of the furnishings asked for, and of the cleansing and renovation of the school and maternity quarters is approximately $600.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nHaving, at your suggestion, visited Church House and seeing the actual conditions prevailing, I am now making formal application on behalf of my wife and myself to fill the vacancies as School Teacher and Field Matron, subject to the condition hereinafter mentioned.\n\nIt seems to me that continuity of service in such work is imperative, but I am afraid that you will experience a great difficulty in securing the continuous services of anyone unless the position is made more attractive than at present. The schoolhouse is in very bad condition indeed, requiring fumigating, cleansing, calicoining or painting, scrubbing etc., so generally put into a tolerable habitable condition. I would suggest that this be done immediately as any married couple going to Church House would find it hard to look the conditions over and turn down a fit place. The house to be occupied by the teacher and field matron should be furnished by the Department to the extent of the following articles:\n\n- 2 beds, mattresses, pillows complete,\n- 2 Toronto couches,\n- 1 good (6 hole) cooking range with pipes etc. complete,\n- 1 large table (extension) to 6 ft.,\n- 1 small table & 4 ft.,\n- 6 stout wooden chairs,\n- 2 ladder covered (morris) or lounge chairs,\n- 2 good lamps (1 hanging)\n- 1 bureau (secretary)\n- 1 -area (sitting room)\n- Sufficient linoleum to cover sitting room and bedroom.\n\nSchool Teacher $900.00 per annum from the Government supplemented by \u00a3100.00 per annum from J.C.Funds.\n\nTotal... $1000.00\n\nField Matron... $400.00\n\nTotal... $1400.00\n\nJanitor's allowance... $50.00\n\nGrand Total... $1450.00 per annum, with an allowance of at least one cord of wood per month and fifteen gallons of coal oil per annum. Salary to be paid monthly.\n\nIt must not be lost sight of that the position carries with it that of administration, in which the welfare of the whole community is in the hands of the combined posts, consequently should be appreciated and recognized by the Department. If the caring for and the general educating and uplifting of the Indian community at Church House is a good thing and for the ultimate benefit not only of the State and Church but of the Indians themselves, then it also to be done properly and the position made sufficiently attractive to make it worth while keeping as a life long means.\nThe general condition of the village is far from being good. Sanitation and hygiene has been entirely lost sight of for some time, and I would suggest immediate attention to the pits at the backs of the houses for the disposal of human excreta, refuse, etc. These have apparently been in use for years. They require filling in and new ones dug and in many instances new privy buildings. I say this with all earnestness as although sunshine and fresh air are very fine deodorizers, yet there is always the fear of an epidemic of scarlet fever, diphtheria and other contagious diseases due to neglect of this, to me, most important matter. The water service should be given some attention, and perhaps the water analysed occasionally for ammonia. The electric service and repair of bridges, etc., should also stand under consideration at the present moment. It would be my utmost endeavour to encourage the community to keep themselves and to teach them how to help themselves; but this can only be done by process of evolution. Time has gone conscientiously and thoroughly. The last months six years of hard work staring the teacher and the field worker in the face and with that, then Church House and the community can be made into a health spot instead of a plague spot and would do credit to the teacher, nation and the Government.\n\nMy wife is an educated woman with long banking and legal experience, the mother of three children, and is perfectly capable of handling any condition that may arise or that the exigencies of the post may call for.\n\nThe drugs I would suggest for the village are set out on the requisition for drugs, enclosed herewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I may add that I was educated at Macquarie (M.C.) College, graduating from Trinity College, Dublin University, and that during my military service assisted in my regimental school, in teaching not only the children of the regiment but also the uneducated men of the regiment for a period of approximately ten years.\n\n[Signature] A.M.G.\nOttawa, January 19th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, informing the Department that Mr. and Mrs. Alex Burke resigned as teacher and field matron, respectively, at the Homalco Indian Day School at the end of December, last. In reply I beg to say that the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Burke is accepted.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will take up with the Church authorities, under whose auspices this school is conducted, the matter of obtaining the services of a qualified teacher - preferably a married man - to succeed Mr. and Mrs. Burke as teacher and field matron, respectively. The names, qualifications and experience of the persons nominated for these positions should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. It is hoped that the Church authorities will be able to nominate suitable successors to Mr. and Mrs. Burke at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform the Department that Mr. and Mrs. Allen Burke, Indian Day School Teacher and Field Mission, respectively, at the Homalo Indian Reserve, Hope No.6, at Church House, B.C., have resigned from their positions at the end of December, 1925.\n\nMr. H. McCairns, Inspector of Indian Schools and I have discussed the resignations which are very definite and we have concurred in their acceptance.\n\nI would inform the Department that these offices have given satisfaction in the positions in which they have been engaged and their reasons for resigning are of a personal nature. I would recommend the acceptance of these resignations by the Department and the appointment in due course of successors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 20th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the appointment of Mr. Burke as teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that he will not continue duties during the months of July and August, the regular summer holiday period. His salary is based on ten teaching months in the year, and it is satisfactory to the Department for him to close the school during the months mentioned, for summer holidays. We further noted that the Indians appear to be pleased with the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Burke. We hope that they will meet with every success in the work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAast. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Percy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 14th, No.167-33-1, with reference to the appointment of Mr. Burke as teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School and asking whether in view of the fact that this school has been closed for some time it is intended that Mr. Burke will continue teaching during the months of July and August, the regular summer holiday period.\n\nIn reply I beg to say I have conferred with Mr. Cairns in this matter and we wish to inform the Department that when Mr. Burke was appointed it was understood his salary would be based upon ten teaching months and as it is probable there will be no children at this village during the months of July and August, it is supposed that Mr. Burke will take advantage of the usual summer vacation period.\n\nFor myself, I would state that it is understood that Mr. and Mrs. Burke's appointment is on probation for a term of six months and should their services prove unsatisfactory at the end of that period, it is not likely that they would continue working there, in which event the Department would have to decide whether or not Mr. Burke should receive payment for the two holiday months. Both Mr. Cairns and I are assuming, however, that the services of Mr. and Mrs. Burke in office at Homalco will be beyond the period of their probation and with this in anticipation we feel there will be no question as to salary adjustments since it is understood that the salary is based upon ten teaching months in the year, as is the case with teachers throughout the Province.\n\nI may also inform the Department that I was at Church House (Homalco) just over week ago, where I held a meeting with the Indians, who appeared to be very much pleased with the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Burke and in their addresses they expressed their gratitude and wished me to extend their thanks to the Department for sending these officers to them.\n\nMy impression is that Mr. and Mrs. Burke will settle down satisfactorily to their work among these Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nIndian Affairs.

The particulars which you furnish regarding the Christian names and experience of Mr. and Mrs. Burke have been noted for our records.

A. Smith, the Inspector General, as requested by the Department.\n\nAs to the information stated by the Department concerning the Christian names of Mr. and Mrs. Burke and their qualification, I beg to say that Mr. Burke's Christian name is Alexander, and his wife's Florence. Mr. Burke is twenty-eight years of age and received his preliminary education entirely in England and Scotland and in 1924 received his teaching certificate at the Dominion College, Montreal, Canada. He also has a university certificate which he received at Queen's College, Kingston, Ontario. Mr. Burke was a teacher in Prince Albert, and has considerable experience in a women's mission and has given considerable attention to the work among the Indians. Mr. Burke is a member of the Methodist Church, Victoria, B.C., and has been connected with the church since 1896. He is now the pastor of the Methodist Church, Ponemah, Ont., and has been engaged in the work there for many years.\n\nThe above information with respect to Mr. and Mrs. Burke has been accepted by the Rev. Father Welsh, O.M.I., Mr. Inspector General and myself and we are in accord in sending Mr. and Mrs. Burke to Ponemah on promotion as recommended by the Department. Mr. Smith stated that he would have to send to England for his certificates and if we had waited for the examination of these, considerable further delay would be occasioned in the filling up of the position at Ponemah, and in view of the fact that it is with great difficulty that we are able to secure the services of a man and his wife in so isolated a place as Ponemah, it was deemed advisable to be send Mr. and Mrs. Burke to that village and attend to the matter of certificates after, if the Department require this.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have noted that the Rev. Father Welch and yourself have been unable to secure suitable applications.\n\nI regret that I cannot authorize you to advertise these positions. That of field matron comes under the Civil Service Commission, while teachers are appointed without reference to that organization. Our practice has been to secure suitable workers and then to ask the Civil Service Commission to approve the appointment of field matron without advertising it or arranging for a competition. I might inform you that the Department is endeavouring to have the position of field matron at this and other schools exempted from the operations of the Civil Service Act in so far as the principle of competition in the matter of appointment is concerned.\n\nPlease explain to Father Welch, whose letter I am returning to you, and ask him and Mr. Inspector Cairns to continue their search for a teacher whose wife could be appointed field matron, after reference to the Commission. It is the Department's opinion that further delay in the matter of filling these positions will have a salutary effect upon the members of the Band and when the school is again in operation the attendance will be better.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of Oct. 13th, No. 167-33-1, touching upon the matter of the proposed re-opening of the Board's Indian Day School and Entrance at Church House,... I should inform you that on the day following my letter to the Department of Nov. 14th, the Rev. Father Welsh, Vicar of Roman Catholic Missions, called at the Office and we further discussed the matter. I wrote to him the Department that a few months ago he had given me the address of a man in his diocese who would be likely to fill these positions satisfactorily, but upon Mr. Inspector Carman and myself endeavouring to get into touch with these people, he found that they had left the diocese.\n\nRev. Father Welsh has stated that he will give immediate attention to an effort to furnish nominations for the vacant positions and as soon as the Reverend Father is again heard from, I will be instructed by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nINFORMATION OFFICE\n\nAt [signature]\n\nNov. 19, 19\u2014\n\nSir:\n\nIn acknowledging receipt of your letter of October No. 167-33-1, with reference to the proposed reopening of the Roman Catholic School, I would inform you that I communicated with the Rev. Father Colin, Vicar of Roman Catholic Missions at New Westminster, B.C., regarding him if he was prepared to recommend suitable persons to fill the positions of teacher and matron at that place.\n\nUp to the present no reply has been received from Rev. Father Colin, and I have written him again today in this connection. As soon as I receive a reply I will again communicate with the Department. I would inform you that the Indians at Church House have sent a petition to me requesting that the school be reopened as soon as possible and this fact is being communicated to Rev. Father Colin.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 25th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of March 20th, last, and the Department's reply thereto of the 25th of the same month, regarding the re-opening of the Homalco Indian Day School. At that time you recommended that this school remain closed until the present fall, when an effort would be made to obtain the services of a married couple - the husband to perform the duties of teacher and his wife the duties of field matron.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state whether any action has been taken to secure the services of a teacher and matron for this school. If not, and you consider it would be advisable to re-open the school, you should take this matter up with the Church authorities interested with a view to obtaining incumbents for the above positions. If possible, the services of a man and his wife should be obtained. I shall be pleased if you will give this matter your early attention and inform the Department as to the results of any action taken. The name, qualifications and experience of the persons secured should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. Salary could be allowed at the same rate as was previously paid for these services. The salary allowed the teacher, however, would depend entirely upon the qualifications which he possesses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Ass't. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRoom 403, Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, February 21st, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, informing the Department of the resignation of Miss Doris Boyle as teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School and of Mrs. Boyle as field matron. In reply I beg to say that the resignation of both Miss Boyle and her mother is accepted.\n\nIt is noted that the Rev. Father Welch, Mr. Inspector Cairns and yourself are of the opinion that it would be advisable to further discuss the question as to the appointment of a teacher and matron for this school. This action is approved, and the Department will await the joint recommendation, which will receive favourable consideration. It is noted that this school has not been in operation since the Christmas holidays, and it may remain closed pending the question of its continuance and the appointment of another teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRoom 402, Holden Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nSchool should not reopen until full but that Malin's fortune is needed to attract officials.\nSir,\n\nI beg to transmit to you herewith the resignation of Miss Doris Boyle, as Indian Day School Teacher at Church House, B.C. I would inform you that Miss Boyle has not returned to Church House since the Christmas holidays. I would remind you that Miss Boyle's mother, who was acting as Field Matron at Church House, has also resigned, and the school and matrons at Church House are now vacant. I would recommend that this resignation be accepted.\n\nI would inform you that I have discussed this matter with Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Schools, and Rev. Father Welch, Vicar of Roman Catholic Missions, and it has been decided that pending the outcome of inquiries into school attendance at Tecumseh Residential School, in connection with which it may be advisable to admit to the latter Institution children who were formerly attending the Day School at Church House, also in view of the sympathy of the Church House Indians, a recommendation as to filling these vacancies should not be hastily made. It is our intention to further discuss this matter, and a joint recommendation will be forwarded in due course for the Department's consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n20th March 1876\n\nSeattle, Wash.\n\nC. C. Perry Co.,\nIndian Agent,\nColumbia, U.S.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nOn account of sickness I will not be able to go back to Chicago to teach the school and hereby send you my resignation as teacher of the Homalco Day School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nFebruary 7, 1964.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMISS O'LOCHROA,\n\nI have noted that Mrs. Boyle, field matron at Homalco, B.C., has resigned, and as this officer is the mother of the teacher of the Indian day school at this point, it would be futile to try to secure a field matron as long as the present teacher retains her position.\nOTTAWA, January 30th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, signed by Mr. Inspector Cairns and yourself, regarding the appointment of a teacher and field matron to succeed Mr. and Mrs. Marsden at Homalco.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that with the approval of Rev. Father Welch, Miss Doris Boyle has been appointed as teacher, at a salary of $700 per annum, and Mrs. L. H. Boyle as field matron, at a salary of $40 per month, from the last instant, to succeed Mr. and Mrs. Marsden.\n\nRegarding the appointment of a teacher, I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Doris Boyle, with salary at the rate of $700 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law. We also note that Miss Boyle has two years standing in high school, which is equal to a third class British Columbia certificate. While we would prefer the services of a teacher with better qualifications, she will, no doubt, fulfill the position satisfactorily. Her retention in the position, however, will depend upon the success with which she meets in the work.\n\nRegarding the appointment of Mrs. L. H. Boyle as field matron, I beg to say that you will be further advised. I may say that this position has been classified by the Civil Service Commission, and the appointment should have been made by them. This matter will be taken up with the Commission with a view to obtaining a certificate for her appointment.\n\nRegarding the payment of transportation expenses, amounting to approximately $16.00, from Vancouver to Charon House, I may say that we do not, unless in very exceptional circumstances, pay the transportation of teachers or field matrons. Homalco, such as Homalco is a remote point, and it is difficult to obtain officers to fill positions in cases of this kind, we will pay the transportation expenses of approximately $16.00 upon receipt of properly certified vouchers.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform Mr. Inspector Cairns of the contents of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. William Marsden, teacher of the Komalco Indian Day School, resigned his position, taking effect December 31st.\n\nHe has accepted the position of teacher of the Indian School in the Okanagan Agency, near Vernon, B.C. He will commence work about Feb. 1st in his new position.\n\nMiss Doris Boyle who holds a third class non-professional teacher's certificate, and who has training as a stenographer, has succeeded Mr. Marsden in the Day School at Komalco and I am sure will do her best to produce results. She is only eighteen years of age but is bright and efficient.\n\nMiss Shore who had charge of the Kindergarten and Junior work at St. George's School at Lytton, has taken charge of the Indian Day School at Hazelton. Miss Shore has had training and will do especially good work in this new position. In her letter to me she says that so far she has had only twenty pupils. She finds the pupils very far behind, and except for reading are only in the kindergarten state. She is confident that she can get results.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nSir,\n\nOwing to the resignation of Mr. William Macdonald, teacher of the Indian Day School at Komalco, B.C., together with that of Mrs. Macdonald, who has been acting as Field-Matron at Komalco, in conjunction with the work of her husband, which resignation took effect at the end of December, ultimo, it became necessary, in order that there should be no break in the work of such officers in the Reserve to make an appointment of their successors accordingly.\n\nIn conjunction with Father Wilson, Vicar of Roman Catholic Missions, at New Westminster we have appointed, subject to the Department's approval, to fill these vacancies Mrs. L.H. Boyle as Field-Matron and Doris Boyle, (Miss) her daughter, Indian Day School teacher, the former at a salary of $40.00 per month and the latter at a salary of $700.00 per year and bonus.\n\nOwing to the difficulties of securing competent officers to fill positions in remote settlements, such as Komalco, it was deemed advisable to recommend that the transportation of Mrs. Boyle and her daughter from Vancouver to Komalco (Church House, B.C.), approximately $16.00, receipts for which will be furnished by these officers, be paid by the Department.\n\nMrs. Boyle has the qualifications of a trained nurse, while Miss Boyle has two years standing in High School, which is equal to a third class British Columbia Certificate. In addition to this course, Miss Boyle stated she had also taken a course in typewriting and stenography.\n\nWe would, therefore, recommend that the Department confirm these appointments, which will be operative from the 1st of January, 1923.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\nR.H.

This will make his salary from that date at the rate of $800 per annum, and he will also be entitled to any bonus provided by law.\n\nI have to request that you will inform Mr. Marsden accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Marsden, Teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School, forwards, through the office of the Acting Indian Agent at New Westminster, a request for increase in his salary, of $150 per annum. Mr. Marsden is at present receiving $700 per annum and bonus of $150 - a total of $850. His wife acts as field matron and is paid salary at the rate of $480 per annum. There are living quarters provided in the school building.\n\nMr. Marsden has been teaching for 7 years\u20143 years of which have been at this school. He has no professional qualifications. He was educated at the Jesuit College, Stonyhurst, England and passed the Entrance Examination, Royal Institute, British Architects, and has been elected a Fellow of the Royal Institute Architects, Canada. Mr. Inspector Cairns speaks very highly of the work being performed by Mr. Marsden.\n\nWe are paying teachers with professional qualifications in British Columbia as high as $1000. Homalco is a very isolated place and the cost of the necessaries of life is high.\n\nI would beg to recommend that Mr. Marsden be granted an increase of $100 per annum from the first of September, next, and would be pleased to have your approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Through an oversight it is regretted that you were only paid for the September quarter at the rate of $600.00 per annum and a cheque for $25.00, being the balance due for that quarter, is being sent you in care of Mr. Agent Byrne.\n\nI may say that a cheque for the bonus due for the same quarter has been sent you in care of the agent and it is hoped that you have received it before this date.\n\nThe bonus to teachers is being continued during the present fiscal year, namely, to March 31st, next, at the rate of $150.00 per annum, payable quarterly.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nWilliam Marsden, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nHomalco Indian Day School,\nChurch House,\nB.

You can take charge of Homalco School forthwith. One Thousand per year, joint salary.\"\n\nReferring to my letter to you of the 12th ult., and also the above telegram, would say that the Department has decided to reinstate Mr. Nicholson, who has recently returned from overseas service as teacher of the Sliammon Indian Day School, to take charge of this work, as soon as you can reasonably remove your effects.\n\nThe position of teacher at Homalco School is vacant, and I would be pleased if you would take charge there, the salary is $700.00 per annum for the teacher, and $375.00 for the Matron, this is $100.00 more than the salary paid at Sliammon. The location of the Homalco School occupies a very attractive position, overlooking Lewis Channel, and the Hole in the Wall, and were it not for the fact that Mr. Nicholson has some young children which he wishes to attend school at Powell River, he would no doubt accept the position of teacher at Homalco, instead of Sliammon.\n\nKindly advise me by return mail if you accept the transfer to Homalco, and oblige,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Peter Byrne,\nIndian Agent.\n\nWilliam Marsden Esq.,\nSliammon Indian Day School, Powell River, B.C.\nI beg to forward, herewith, a communication received by me from Mr. William Marsden, in which he consents to take charge of the Homalco Indian Day School, after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n1152 Sexton Street\nVancouver, B.C.\nAug 18th, 1919.\n\nPeter Byrne Esq.,\nIndian Affairs,\nNew Westminster.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of yesterday date, I beg to say it is my intention to take charge of the School at Homalco after the summer holidays, as previously arranged.\n\nI am,\n\nYour faithfully,\n\nWilliam Maclean.\nOttawa, May 14, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo asking that a teacher be sent to re-open the Homalco Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is trying to make arrangements for a teacher for this school, and it is expected that one will take charge there by the first of next month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The Department would be pleased if you would use your best endeavours to obtain the services of a competent man and his wife to re-open the school there at as early a date as possible.\n\nAs you are aware, there are teacher's quarters attached to the school, and the Department will be prepared to pay the sum of $1,000.00 a year, $700.00 for the man as teacher and $300.00 for his wife as field matron.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe school referred to in the attached letter is the one at Homalco, which was closed on the first of January, 1913, the former teacher, Mr. George Bruce, having resigned, and it has not been in operation since.\n\nMr. Agent Byrne was instructed to consult with the Roman Catholic Church authorities with a view to obtaining a suitable teacher and matron for this school, but up to the present no applications have been received.\n\nThere are thirty-one children of school age, but, as their parents are engaged in logging and fishing operations at various other reserves belonging to the band, the attendance was irregular.\n\nMr. Byrne stated that it would be a difficult matter to obtain the services of a teacher for the small salary which was paid, $600.00 per annum, and $300.00 for the teacher's wife as matron. In August, last, the Department informed Mr. Byrne that we would pay at the rate of $700.00 per annum for a qualified teacher.\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in his last report on this school, stated that it is difficult to get a teacher for this isolated place and that the Indians are chronic fault finders. A school is urgently needed there, as no children are sent away to boarding schools.\n\nThe Department has done all it can to re-open this school and the only thing to do would be to have the matter brought to the attention of the church authorities again.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nDear Sir:\n\nWe want to talk to you another thing.\n\nI am very sorry that our schoolhouse is closed.\n\nWe want you to help us to send a teacher and open our schoolhouse.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChief George Harry,\nChurch House,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nReferring to Departmental Letter dated the 6th inst., No. 318400-1, enclosing copy of a communication received from Chief George Harry of the Homalco Tribe of Indians.\n\nI beg to state that I enquired into these charges, as made by the Chief against the teacher, some time ago, and as the result of my investigation I came to the conclusion that it was more a matter of jealousy on the part of the Indian than any other cause.\n\nAbout a year ago a consignment of freight which was unloaded from a Steam Boat on a wharf, which is situated close to the Reserve, was tampered with by the Indians, and a box containing liquor was broken open and the liquor stolen, and as a result of this a number of the Indians became intoxicated, and a free fight followed. The matter was duly reported to me, and I mutually arranged with the teacher, that in future all freight consigned to that wharf should be put into the shed, the door locked and him to hold the key. Since that time no further trouble has been reported in regard to freight left on this dock, for distribution amongst the various logging camps in the vicinity. I may say that the Dominion Department of Public Works, under whose supervision the wharf was erected, were very pleased when they heard that Mr. Bruce was willing to care for freight left there, and see that none was stolen. The school in which the teacher lives is situated about 150 Yards from the wharf and overlooking same. I am satisfied that any work done by Mr. Bruce in this connection, does not in anyway interfere with his duties as teacher.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nAs to the other charges, would say that I do not think that the interests of the school are in any way neglected by Mr. Bruce going out in his boat with his wife and children in the evenings, and picking up a log if he finds same floating in the Straits.\n\nAs to the teacher buying fish, I am not aware that he has ever made a practice of so doing, but he might have stored fish in the wharf referred to, pending the arrival of the regular boat to transport same to Vancouver.\n\nI believe that Mr. Bruce is kind to all the children, and I am sure that his wife is very economical, and would not waste any groceries which might have been left there for the use of the pupils. She told me that about a year ago the Indians left some rice which was damaged from getting damp, and unfit for food, so she told the Indians that she had thrown it out.\n\nTrusting this explanation is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 6, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, a copy of a letter which the Department received from Chief George Harry, of the Homalco Band, regarding the teacher at that point.\n\nThe Department would like you to furnish a full report upon the complaint made by the Chief. It is not necessary that you make a special trip to Homalco for this purpose, but, upon the occasion of your next visit, you should make full enquiries into the manner in which this school is being conducted and furnish a full report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB.

The time will come when many of our Indian pupils will want to take the entrance to a High school examination. Then they will of necessity have to use the provincial course of study.\n\n(Sgd.) R.H.

Mr. Petznick will be expected to assist his wife in teaching while she is attending to her duties as field matron and also to give instruction in gardening to pupils of this school.

She should have been paid for the eighteen days the sum of $54.00, instead of $36.00. A cheque for the balance, $18.00, is being sent you.\n\nA cheque is also being sent for Miss Catherine Hurry, assistant matron, for the sum of $27.00 for the same period of time.\n\nKindly advise the Department whether Miss Richards' sister has yet arrived to take up the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

E. Richards who is a Roman Catholic, has accepted the position of teacher at the Homalo Indian Day School. Her sister has agreed to undertake the work formerly done by Mrs. Thompson, at the salary stated.\n\nI accompanied Miss Richards to the school on the first boat leaving Vancouver for that place after receiving the Department's approval of her appointment. We arrived at the reserve on the evening of the 4th inst. I held a meeting of the Indians and introduced the new teacher to them and their children. The following morning we formally opened the school with an attendance of ten pupils. This small attendance is accounted for by the fact that, a great number of the children were absent from the reserve with their parents, and did not know when the new teacher would arrive.\n\nAt my request the Acting Chief George Harry sent a messenger to notify the parents and children that the school was again opened, but owing to the great distance those people were away from the reserve, the messenger had not returned before I left, although I remained four days assisting the Chief in cleaning up, repairing the water system, and putting the school and dormitories in a fairly habitable condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 24, 1912.\n\nRev.

Ditchburn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 19th ultimo, file No. 216400-1 referring to certain statements alleged to have been made by the Indian missionary to the effect that the Homalco day school would not be re-opened until the Indians would build a new and larger church, I may state that at the time of my visit to Mission City on the 26th ultimo, in company with Dr. McKenna, Rev. Father Chirouse, O.M.I., the missionary of that Aupe reserve, spoke to me about this story, and gave me his denial.\n\nUpon my return to Victoria I received your letter and I immediately wrote to the reverend Father, asking him to give me a statement in writing, at the same time asking him to state what they were doing about the appointment of a teacher.\n\nI herewith inclose for your information Father Chirouse's letter, which is self explanatory.\n\nOn the 4th instant I called at the Indian Office at New Westminster on my way to Chilliwack, and found that Indian Agent Byrne had left a letter for me stating that he had gone to Churchhouse to install the new teacher at the Homalco school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.E.

On my visit up to the Coast, I found that story spread amongst the Indians and I denied it.\n\nChief Harry of Church House told me that he first heard it at Vancouver, in Mr. Green's office, by a letter from the Department that he read to him. As I was saying that he misunderstood Mr. Green, the school inspector; he assured me that there were six Indians to listen to the reading and that they knew well the meaning of it.\n\nOn my return to Vancouver I had an interview with Mr. Green to inquire about this statement; but at my great surprise this Gentleman denied that he ever read anything the kind to those Indians but only read few lines of an official letter inquiring about the Kamloops School teacher, within the church authority, who did send out.\n\nSoon I will have occasion to meet these Indians, I hope to have more information and discover who are invented the above statement.\n\nIndian Affairs.

BOX 188\n\nMission City, B.C.\n\nThe result of that regrettable story is that the Indians have turned against me, thinking that I am opposed to the education of their children. God knows all what I have done during the past year to find a good teacher for Nermalko school. I met several parties, but the isolation of the place and the semi-boarding school would scare them. At least I found Miss Richards, who was formerly teacher of the Curtis Hill school. She is there at the present time with her sister as an assistant work. I hope that they will both give satisfaction to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. C. Chiroux\n\nP.O. Box 9.\n\nMr. W. E.

If Miss Richards is a Roman Catholic the Department will be pleased to accept her services at the rate of $600 per annum.\n\nAs her sister is going to live with her, the Department would like to know if she would undertake the work formerly done by Mrs. Thompson. If so, a salary of $300 would be allowed for this work. If Miss Richards accepts the position please advise the Department and also Mr. Inspector Ditchburn at once.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, August 21, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of yesterday's date in regard to the Hemalco school, I beg to say that the Department desires to continue, if practicable, the semi-boarding system.

Thompson resigned as teacher. The Indians are very strongly in favor of the school being opened, and fail to understand the difficulty in finding a suitable teacher. They are quite willing to assist a teacher all they can.\n\nI looked over the school building and dwelling house. It is in fair repair, with the exception of a bad leakage near the chimney. The Chief promised to have this fixed the day after inspection. The stoves and cooking utensils were in good shape, likewise school books, slates, etc. But I noticed that the hand cart belonging to the Department (and nearly new) was missing. The Indians say Mr. Thompson removed it with his own furniture. He is now living close by the graveyard on the land which has been added to the reserve, and from his actions and words seeks to provoke the Indians to violence. I advised and warned them to take no notice of him.\n\nI have not been able to find a Catholic teacher and the priests tell me they cannot find a suitable one.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nRivers Inlet Cannery\nRivers Inlet B.C.\n10th Feb. 1912.\n\nJ.D.

The Homalco school is conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church and it is necessary that the teacher should be a member of that Church. Mr. Hagan presumably is a Protestant, but of this fact the Department is not aware.

He is a married man, and would be the right man I think for the Homalo Indian School.

A. F. Green,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n1076 Pender St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nDecember 15, 1911.\n\nSir:\n\nOn the 25th ultimo Mr. William Thompson, teacher of the Komakoo Indian Day School, situated on the Aupe Reserve, visited this office and informed me that Acting Chief George Harry had taken the supplies which were sent by me to the school, into his own house and refused to deliver them to the teacher.\n\nOn the 26th ultimo Mr. Thompson again visited this office; Acting Chief George Harry also paid me a visit on the same day. In conversation with George Harry, he informed me that he had placed the goods in his house for safe-keeping, as he understood from Inspector Green, that Mr. Thompson was going to leave, and that he, (the Inspector) would be able to supply them with another teacher about the beginning of new year.\n\nOn the 2nd inst. I started for Church House (Aupe Reserve), but owing to the fact that a B.C.R. car had left the track, thereby blocking the traffic for some three hours; I did not arrive in Vancouver in time to catch the boat.\n\nOn the 6th inst., I visited the reserve which is situated about 120 miles north from here. I held a meeting of the Indians, and I found that they were very much dissatisfied with Mr. Thompson's actions, in regard to the way in which he had been conducting the school; but the greatest trouble seemed to be in connection with the fact that Mr. Thompson, the teacher, had preempted 160 acres of land adjoining the reserve, on which preemption the school is erected; and the Indians had laid out their cemetery.\nAs this has been reported on fully by my predecessor, I do not think it is necessary for me to dwell upon it further than to say, that I understand, and so informed them, that the Department of Indian Affairs have arranged with the provincial Department of Lands and Works to secure for the Indians, all that portion of Mr. Thompson's preemption on which the Indians had made improvements, or to which they laid claim. I further informed the Indians, that I understood that a provincial land surveyor, named Mr. Rhodes, B.C.L.S., had been instructed to make the necessary survey; Mr. Rhodes having arranged to accompany me up on the boat for that purpose, but for some reason, then unknown to me, he or his representative did not come. I found out afterwards that he had missed the boat.\n\nMy reason for wishing to be present with the surveyor was in order that I might use my influence with the Indians, and also with Mr. Thompson, as to where the boundary line of the new survey should be run, as Mr. Thompson claims, that while he is willing to let the Indians have all the land to which in his opinion they have any claim, he is of the opinion that they are asking for more than they are in justice entitled to. The Indians have a tracing of a suggested boundary to this new survey, furnished to them by the Provincial Department of Lands and Works, which no doubt will be a guide to the surveyor when he goes on to the ground to do the work.\n\nIn regard to the school, the Indians informed me that they had closed it some ten days previous to my arrival. I pointed out to them, that they had made a mistake in doing so, and that the best thing they could do was to send their children to school, as Mr. Thompson was going to remain and teach until the\nSist of March next. This they all agreed to do, and I am in hopes that there will be no more trouble between the teacher and the Indians, for some time.\n\nI had the school supplies taken from the Chief's house and delivered at the school, and checked them over to see that everything was in order before I left.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nReceived from Dept.

If the Department cannot approve of granting the full amount as stated, Mrs. Thompson is quite willing to accept such portion as she can get.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 17, 1911.\n\nMr. Bray,\n\nWill you please state whether from the information already on file the Department is in a position to inform Mr. Thompson, the teacher of the Homalco School, that he will have to vacate the school building by the 31st of March, next, as it has no desire to retain his services as teacher of that school after that date.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nWe have the promise from the Provincial Surveyor that the land on which the school building and the grave-yard is situated will be exempted from the Crown Rent and we were requested to have the said land defined by survey.\n\nThe Surveyor has not been able to do the work so yet, but it is expected the whole matter will be adjusted before the 31st March next. I think the action above indicated may be safely taken.\n\n[Signature]\nChief Surveyor.\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to my report on the Hemalce School Westminster Agency, dated Oct. 28th., I have the honor to report that the teacher Mr. Wm. Thompson is doing more harm than good; he is continually quarreling with the Indians. The store and post office which he runs in the school building take up a great part of his time. He also has a chicken house under the school building where he keeps quite a number of chickens.\n\nMr. Thompson is trying to sell his \"pre-emption record\" (which includes the ground on which the school building stands, and on which the two Indian graveyards are situated), to other white men, notwithstanding the fact that the Land and Works Department of the Provincial Government at Victoria, have notified him that the ground on which school house and grave yards are, would be taken out of his pre-emption.\n\nThe Chief George Harry holds a sketch map given him by the Deputy Commissioner of Lands and Works, Victoria, showing how the survey could be made, so as to add to the Indian Reserve, the land on which the graveyards and school house stand. The Indians would be perfectly satisfied with this.\n\nI beg to respectfully recommend that the Department cause a survey to be made as soon as possible according to the plan purposed as shown in the sketch map given to the Chief.\n\nI had Mr. Thompson and the Indians together. They charged him with drunkenness, which he denied, but admitted drinking, but as his house (the school building) is not at present reserved, he says he can do what he likes on his own pre-emption. One evening near midnight he fired a rifle off fifteen times. He declared he was not drunk, but mad.\n\nIt is urgent for the success of the school and the good of the Indians that a survey be made, and that Mr. Thompson be released from the school.\nI informed him the school could not continue as at present and that I should recommend to the Department that his services be dispensed with at Christmas. It would be better to close the school than to let things go on as at present, but it would be well for the survey to be made before he quits the school.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to address you a personal letter, as to the only one, I think, who is able to settle the matter. I appeal to you as a mother for her children, as a missionary for her flock of Indians. Leaving aside all other considerations, I'll bring two points the school and the land, which is the only one that came question with me.\n\nThe land: You know by the Indians through their agents and lawyer, one side of the situation. They take honor to show you my side of the version.\n\nOn my arrival here, I took a fancy to these children and not being a worldly woman, I devoted myself, heart and soul to their welfare. Thus, I spoke upon Mr. Thompson, my husband, to preempt 160 acres of land adjoining the Indian Reserve (which land we knew by a letter from the land office had been refused to them) with the intention of setting apart 15 or 20 acres for the use of the school. We figured on finishing the building, fence it, make garden, playground, house, chickens, cows, in fact, everything in the way of...\nImproving the surroundings for the instruction & comfort of the children, such as we have in every other school\u2014thus making it a permanent school for a time, many years\u2014which if left to Indians, will never be anything but a dilapidated concern, such as it is today.\n\nJust about the time I was to start the new building, we received a notification from the land office, that the Indian Department had made a protest against us having the land, thus we were stopped in building the school, my future dreams scattered to the wind.\n\nThus far was my letter when Mr. Green, the School Inspector came to examine the school.\n\nAt the meeting after school, the Indians brought such a lot of accusation against Mr. Thompson that Mr. Green thought it best to close the school at the end of the quarter. On the moment of the exultation, the heat being in sight and Mr. Green having to leave in a hurry, it was impossible to argue the matter, thus I suppose he will in his report suggest the closing of the school, with the remark that the system on which it is based is not a success.\n\nBut talking the matter over, I decided to ask privately a further investigation, now, they for the sake of the children, who are well worth not to close the school at all. That will be the use of so much money spent if the school is closed, think of the future of these intelligent children, with such parents who instead of helping them to improve, are in every way to hinder their progress.\n\nThe system\u2014What other system could we have here...\nThe Indians, having no way of living around here, are obliged to go in different logging camps, thus being away for three or four weeks at a time, thus making impossible to send their children to school.\n\nI think this experience is good and worth very well under the circumstances. It is true we have applied to the Govt. to help with food, etc., now refuse and everything was settled.\n\nFalse accusations! Who knows the Indians know that they are made of complaint, falsehood, that only those who live with them, know how to put up with their foolishness. All these accusations brought before Mr. Owen were all settled by Mr. K.S., the Ind. Agent five years ago, which you will see by yourself at the time\u2014 all the old yarn over again was brought up.\n\nMr. Thompson has been wanting a length of time and turn over to me the teaching of the school, owing to being advanced in age, it is a little too much worry for him, but, being unable to secure a good woman helper, has been impossible to do so.\n\nBefore finishing, permit me to add a few words in favor of Mr. Thompson, might I not you think it is outrageous to turn out in the midst of winter an old man who has served faithfully the Department for so long and who has seen better days. He was grateful to you for his offer, where he looked upon suspension, a gratuity for which he was very grateful. Trusting you will give this a favorable consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMrs. Emma Thompson\nAct. Mdm.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nOctober 24, 1911.\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from Chief George Harry, in regard to some trouble which appears to exist between himself, and the teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School. The Chief was in this office a few days ago, and he complained very bitterly in regard to the treatment which he alleged was dealt out to the pupils.\n\nWould the Department be good enough to advise me what is best for me to do in regard to this matter, and oblige?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nChurch House, Oct 29th 1871.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nI have just received your letter of the 25th inst.,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg pardon for taking up your valuable time in complaining to you of our school condition. I need not tell you once that we was not satisfied with our teacher, and it has been almost unbearable. I do Chief of this reserve try to do my duty and assist\nIt was one of my duties to visit the school, and in the discharge of such duties I have been forbidden to come into the schoolhouse any more. Now we have heating as well as white people, and you as agent of this reserve should be able to give us a little relief. I beg of you to take sincere notice in securing an exchange of teachers.\n\nI will not bore you with further details unless you wish.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief George Fry\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nOctober 24, 1911.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith a letter of Mr. William Thompson, teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School, Church House, B.C., in regard to dispensing with the services of Annie Moses, as Assistant to Mrs. M.

Thompson, from the 1st of November 1911. By the time the pupils return to board at the school, I hope to be able to procure a white woman to do the work, which I am sure will give better satisfaction.\n\nTrusting that you will approve of what I have done\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam Thompson, Teacher.\nOttawa, June 15, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo in further reference to the exemption of the school and graveyard of the Hornalzo Indians from pre-emption by Mr. William Thompson, the Teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is taking the necessary steps to have a survey made and it is not considered advisable to take any action with regard to dismissing Mr. Thompson until such time as this matter is settled. It would appear, however, that Mr. Thompson's usefulness as a teacher has ceased and it may be expedient to dispense with his services at a more opportune time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. E. Green,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n1076 Pender St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report for the information of the Department that Chief George Harry with two other Chiefs of Church House, Bute Inlet, came to see me on my return from the North on May 15th., regarding the school on \"Aupa\" Reserve, Westminster Agency. They state that the teacher, Mr. William Thompson, neglects the school, his time being so much taken up with the general store which he conducts in the school building. Also that he quarrels with the Indians and has excited them by telling them that his time on his preemption will be up in two months, and that he will then have his Crown Grant to the land on which the school stands, and on which their cemeteries are located. I advised them to see Mr. Inspector Ditchburn and they went to Victoria, but he was out of town. Then they went to the Provincial Office of Lands and Works, and stated their case. Chief George Harry has a letter dated May 17th., signed by the Deputy Commissioner of Lands and Works for B.C., stating that if the Department of Indian Affairs will have a survey made of the land on which the school and graveyards stand, and submit notes of the same, such lands will be exempted from Wm. Thompson's preemption record No. 2851.\n\nI have the honor to most respectfully and strongly recommend that the Department cause a survey to be made immediately, and so end the difficulty. Mr. Thompson is not wise, and says and does things to continually provoke the Indians. Should any of these excited and angry Indians get drunk, they might do some act of violence.\n\nThe school cannot prosper under these conditions, and I think that the store should be separated from the school, and it might be well to have a new teacher.\n\nSeveral deputies have come here complaining the pant\nsix months. I have continually urged them to continue sending their children to the school, and to please the Department they have done so, against their own wish. But I feel that Mr. Thomson's usefulness as a teacher at Church House is past.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nSir:\n\nIn reference to your letter of January 20th and the issuance of a Pre-emption Record to William Thompson of lands adjoining Indian Reserve No. 6 of the Nuxalk Band of Indians on the eastern shore of Bute Inlet, I have to advise that the matter dealt with in your letter is receiving the attention of this Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister of Lands.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nWith reference to the Church House matter, Agent M McDonald informed me early in January that the Department was endeavouring to stop the pre-emption of Mr Thompson, the school teacher, of the land adjoining the Nomalo Indian reserve, upon which the school house and the Indian Graveyard are situated. Has this been accomplished yet? Mr Inspector of schools A.R. Green spoke to me on this matter in Vancouver recently. If the pre-emption can be stopped it will no doubt have the effect of pacifying the Indians.\n\nW.F. Ditchburn,\nInspector.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.\nJanuary 31st, 1911\n\nSir:\n\nI found a good deal of friction existing between the Indians and Mr Thompson, the teacher. In fact they had previous to my arrival at the reserve requested him to resign. The main cause of the trouble appears to be on account of Mr Thompson pre-empting the land adjoining the reserve, on which their graveyard is. I assured the Indians that the Department has the matter in hand now, and would very likely be able to arrange the matter to their satisfaction. Before I left the reserve I succeeded in getting them all in good humor, and they agreed to allow Mr Thompson to continue teaching until July. If the land question could be settled in the meantime, I think they will be satisfied for Mr Thompson to continue teaching even after the 1st of July.\n\nR.C. McDonald\nIndian Agent\nExcerpt:\n\nB.

E. Green,\nInspector of B. C. Indian Schools.\nOttawa, May 6, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo in which you report very fully upon the complaints made by some of the Indians against Mr. Thompson, teacher of the Homalco Indian day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the facts as set forth in your report, the Department does not consider that any further notice should be taken of the complaints made by these Indians, and matters may continue as they have in the past. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson are evidently doing good work amongst these Indians and the Department does not wish to place any restrictions upon them unless warranted in doing so. It is hoped that your visit and the efforts made to restore harmonious relations will be entirely successful and that no further action will be necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. G. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nApril 25th, 1910.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn further reference to my letter of the 8th instant,\nNo. 247/14, concerning the report which reached the Depart-\nment that Mr. Thompson, teacher of the Homalco Day School,\nhas for some time past been neglecting his work, I have the\nhonor to state that I visited the school in question on the\n22nd instant and inquired fully into the case, and the only\nfault the Indians found with Mr. Thompson was that he did not\nopen the school, they said, before 11 a.m. Mr. and Mrs.\nThompson, on the other hand, emphatically stated that the\nschool is in session from 10 a.m. to 12 noon, and from 1 p.m.\nto 3 p.m.; and that the children residing in the school\nbuilding also receive instructions from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.;\nthat these hours are adhered to except on occasions when the\nparents are in the village and the children live at home,\nand it happens that some of the children are late in arriving\nat the school.\n\nMr. Thompson, who has had a good many years' experience\nin teaching Indian schools, does not think it advisable to\nkeep Indian children longer in school than the above mention-\ned hours.\n\nI reached the school at 7 a.m. on the 22nd instant, on\nthe S.S. Cowichan, and the mail was carried on the same boat,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\n\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nand was sorted in about ten minutes after arrival. It contained mail matter for Mr. and Mrs. Thompson and several of the Indians of the band, and also letters and papers for some white men working in a logging camp near the reserve, who came about 8 p.m. for their mail. This constituted the post Master's duties for the day, and as it only occurs once a week, I could not see that the fact of the post office being kept in the school, interfered in any way with the school duties of the teacher; and the Indians are as anxious to have it there as Mr. Thompson is.\n\nThe Indians used to bother Mrs. Thompson a good deal in writing letters to Vancouver for them for small supplies such as candy, fruit, pins, needles, thread, etc., and she decided that it would be more convenient for her to keep a small supply of such articles, more to accommodate and please the Indians, particularly the women and children, than for any profit she might make. She showed me the stock she had on hand, which might easily be packed in a suit-case. I asked the Indians if they had any objections to Mrs. Thompson keeping such articles for sale for their convenience, and they informed me that they wished her to continue doing so, as they all like candy, but they never went to the school during school hours.\n\nWhen I arrived at the school, Mr. Thompson informed me that he was out of fire wood, and I at once went to the Indians and requested them to get to work to provide wood for the school. They all got to work, and in a couple of hours, they had cut and carried out of the bush, enough wood to last for about four months.\n\nMr.\nMr. and Mrs. Thompson have worked hard since they took charge of the school, and Mrs. Thompson has acted like a good, kind mother to the children, and they have become very much attached to her.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Thompson were very much annoyed to think that after all they had done for these children, that the parents, who knew nothing about school work, should accuse them of neglecting their duties; in fact, they were so upset about the matter that they had, before my arrival, decided to leave the school, and this would certainly mean the closing of the school for an indefinite period, as it is almost an impossibility to secure the services of a person of any knowledge of teaching to go to such an out of the way place.\n\nFrom the progress made by the pupils, which I consider compares very favorably with that of other schools, it is evident that Mr. Thompson has not neglected his duties, and the complaint sent to the Department appears to have been got up by Billy Blainey and Alex Paul, who are not classed as the best members of the band.\n\nBefore I left the school, all the Indians shook hands with Mr. Thompson, and promised to assist him as much as possible in providing for the needs of the school if he would consent to stay, and he promised to do so.\n\nIn view of the fact that the small articles kept for sale by Mrs. Thompson does not interfere with the working of the school, and is a convenience to the Indians, who have no store within ten or twelve miles of the reserve, I recommend that a license be granted to Mrs. Thompson.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 18, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant enclosing a communication from Mr. Thompson in reference to the complaints as to his conducting a store upon the reserve and other matters.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will await the receipt of your report, which should be made as soon as convenient after your return from Church House.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nR. G. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nApril 9th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, No. 318400/1, in regard to the report which reached the Department that Mr. Thompson, Teacher of the Nomalco Day School, has for some time past been neglecting his work.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that before I can furnish the full report asked for by the Department, it will be necessary for me to visit the school and investigate the matter; and I have written to Mr. Thompson asking him to let me know when the principal members of the band will be at their village, as I desire to meet them as soon as possible.\n\nAbout the 1st ultimo, Billy Blainey, a member of the Nomalco band, called at my office and stated that Mr. Thompson had purchased the land adjoining their reserve, on which their grave-yard is situated, and that he (Thompson) said he was going to charge the Indians $5.00 for each grave they would require in future, that he objected to their cutting fire-wood for the school on this land, and also that he was late in opening the school. I at once wrote to Mr. Thompson for an explanation, and I enclose herewith his reply, dated the 12th ultimo.\n\nWhen I visited this school on the 14th of January last, I met all the Indians of the band, but they made no complaint whatever.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nwhatever at that time about Mr. Thompson.\n\nA post office was opened on the reserve last year, and Mr. Thompson was appointed post Master, as there was no one else there capable of filling the position. Owing to the fact that there was no post office within ten miles of the reserve, the new one opened at the school is a great convenience to the teacher, the Department, and also to the Indians themselves, who were most anxious to have it there. There is only one mail a week to this office, and as the mail boat arrives at the reserve early in the morning, usually at about 7 o'clock, I cannot see that the small amount of mail matter received there interferes with the working of the school.\n\nI am not aware that Mr. Thompson keeps a store in the school, as I saw no indications of such when I visited there; but there being no store within ten miles of the reserve, it may be possible that Mr. Thompson at times, to accommodate the Indians, has sold them provisions from his own supplies.\n\nHowever, I will report on this point after visiting the school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nHomalco School, Church House, B.C.\nMarch 12th 1910.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours dated March 2nd hand. In regard to the report made to you about me by Billy Blainey, you will see that it is all his own make up to cover his own faults, he knowing very well that he will be found out when you come to visit the school. In the first place I did not purchase the land about the grave yard and charging \u00a35.00. I never thought of such a thing, and the fire-wood. I am only glad for them to cut the wood where they please. I have not seen any wood that Billy Blainey ever cut for the school yet. The school hours are the same as when we first started the school. So you will see that I have nothing to smooth over to the satisfaction of the Indians here, what has been told you are nothing but a pack of lies, which makes me and Mr. Thompson feel very much discouraged, after doing all we can for them, and for the benefit of their children. After receiving your letter another boat came in and gave us a surprise which made Mr. Thompson very much pleased. I thank you for the iron pipe and fittings, and the best of all for the sink.\n\nR.C.M.

As a regular practise he gives no instruction on Fridays;\n\nThat this neglect of our children is a serious loss to them, and we wish them to get as good an education as they can receive:\n\nMAY IT THEREFORE please your Honor to make full enquiry into the whole matter through an independent medium, and to direct either that new Teacher be sent to us or that said William Thomson is made to do his duty, AND WE SHALL EVER PRAY\n\nChief A.X.

He refers to a petition from the Indians, but this has not as yet reached the Department.\n\nIf you will refer to Section 42, Chapter 81 of the Indian Act you will see that no school teacher on an Indian Reserve shall without the special license in writing of the Superintendent General trade with any Indian or sell to him directly or indirectly any goods or supplies. This license has never been granted in Mr. Thomson's case.\n\nAs you are aware a liberal salary is paid him as teacher of this school and $300.00 per annum is paid towards help for Mrs. Thomson in her work as matron. The Department must, therefore, insist upon Mr. Thomson giving his full time to the school work during school hours, if\n\nR. G. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nhe is not doing so now, as represented by the Indians.\n\nThese Indians were eager enough in their desire for a school to erect the building themselves and the Department wishes to see them get the fullest benefit possible from the teacher's services, and I have to ask you to be good enough to look carefully into this matter and make a full report. If there are, in your opinion, good reasons why a license ought to be granted you should so state, and, if granted, what provision can be made for carrying on the business so as not to interfere with the school work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, March 30th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in reference to the complaint of the Indians of the Homalco Band that the work of the school is being neglected by the teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to thank you for the interest you have taken in this matter and to say that the Indian Agent will be asked to make a full report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Y.

March 14th, 1910\n\nF. Pedley,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn my return home one of the first happenings I heard of was the death of Chief Joe Capilano, with whom we have always been on the best of terms, and I was much interested to learn that one of the last things he did was to assist in getting in shape a Petition to your Department from the Churchhouse Band of Indians in Bute Inlet. I understand that their appeal has reference to their school there. Over two years ago the Chief assisted this Band to petition your Department for a Teacher for a School they had built, and you sent a Mr. Thomson to teach. This Mr. Thomson for a year did excellent work, and they were greatly pleased to see their children being well taught, but about a year ago, through the influence of the Indian Agent and a priest, he opened a store and at a post office in the school building and now his school work is neglected. It is closed all day every Friday and frequently on other days, and they seldom have more than three or four hours instruction. This is a great disappointment to these people, hence they are petitioning you about the matter.\n\nChief Joe was keenly interested in this Band, hence out of respect for him I venture to write you personally with these particulars, and I hope you will see that an independent enquiry is made, and the earnest wishes of the Indians conceded.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nReeve.\nOttawa, March 12th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Superintendent Vowell has forwarded to the Department your communication of the 1st instant, with enclosures, in reference to the resignation of Mrs. Lucy de la Giroday, assistant to Mrs. Thompson at the Homalco Indian school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in order that no time might be lost, a cheque for Mrs. Giroday's salary has been sent direct to her at Church House, B.C. Mr. Thompson has been so advised and he has been authorized to engage Annie Moses as assistant at a salary of $25.00 a month, until such time as a competent white woman can be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nR.

She is a fairly good house-keeper, and will, I think, fill the position satisfactorily.\n\nKindly advise me if the Department can make Mrs. Lucy De La Giroday's salary cheque payable to Mr. Thompson.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nA.

The Department, however, realizes the difficulty that would be met with if the help were discharged during the short period that the children might be out of school and will, therefore, agree to the permanent engagement of Mrs. De La Giroday so long as it is found necessary to supply assistance of the nature rendered by her.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to instruct the teacher of this school to include with his quarterly returns a report showing the number of children in residence during the whole or part of the period and giving other general information in reference to the work being conducted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I enclose herewith Mr. Thompson's reply, and I think he must have misunderstood Mr. Inspector Green when discussing the matter with him.\n\nI saw Mr. Green since his inspection of this school, and we fully discussed the whole question, and he agrees with me that, if the Department would place $100.00 each quarter at the disposal of the teacher, it would enable him to purchase provisions for the children of those parents who are too poor to supply their share for the maintenance of the school.\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nThese Indians frequently complain of the hardship it is for them to keep the school supplied with provisions, and sometimes when they are away from the reserve for a considerable time, the provisions run short; and, if the teacher had funds at his disposal, he could in such cases purchase supplies to keep the school running until the return of the Indians. Under the present arrangement, some of the Indians are obliged to contribute more than their share so that the children of those who are unable to contribute, may have food.\n\nThe building at present in use would have to be considerably enlarged and improved so as to provide increased accommodation before it would be suitable for a regular boarding school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nSir -\n\nWe the undersigned Indians of the Homalco Band, Aupa Reserve Church House, Fraser Agency B.C. Herby petition your honourable self to make this our day and private boarding school a Government boarding school under your supervision and give us a grant for a boarding school at $8.00 per capita. By doing so it will enable us to educate our children.\n\nThe need of this your petitioners is mainly the shortage of funds, as our money has been spent in building a good school house for our children to board in at a cost of about $4000.00 so as they may continue their studies while we are away from here during the summer months at work. We might also state that it would be beneficial to the children to reside permanently in the school. The school has been under the supervision of Mr. and Mrs. Thompson for the past year, and the progress the children have made is wonderful and with your assistance by making this a boarding school it will be a great benefit conferred upon us and our children. At our request the boys and girls are separated, Mr. Thompson teaching the boys and Mrs. Thompson the girls. The girls are also given a course in cooking and general house duties, and by granting us the above petition it will enable us to carry on the school in an efficient manner as we are well pleased with our present teachers. Trusting you will give this our petition a favorable consideration and your petitioners will ever pray.\n\nSigned by:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nAct.

In regards to the petition signed by the Indians here, asking for a per capita grant at $8.00 per month. I do not think they are asking too much, everything being so high in the provision line, for we have to pay such high freight charges. I do not know if it is the wish of the petitioners that the Department should pay a per capita of $8.00 in addition to the salaries already paid. They are not home, so I cannot ask them. I am sure they do not know or care as long as they get what they ask for. When they asked Mr. Green to help them, he sent for me, and said he thought the Department would give $5.00 per capita the same as most of the boarding schools get. I told him that I could not run a boarding school out of that sum out here, so he made it $8.00 and if the teachers and other servants, have to be paid out of that, I did not know it all. Ask for in regards to the salary question is, that we shall be on the same footing as the other boarding schools, I know that the Department will do what is right by us. You say that the grant at present given, $900.00 a year, is nearly as much per capita for the average attendance at school, as is paid to the ordinary boarding schools, that may be the way the School is at present, our average boarding at the School is sixteen, but if they get a Government boarding...\nSchool, we will have at least 25 pupils to start with, the reason that so many do not board at the School is, because they have not the means to give their children the amount of provisions required during their absence from the Reserve. I will also state that the Indians here have been asked to let the Indians from Squirrel Cove, and other Reserves know when they get the Government grant, and some of them are waiting to send their children. Last month a man and his wife from Cape Mudge came here with a nice little girl to put in the School, with the consent of the Indians here, when I told them they would have to furnish provisions, they said we are too far away, but when you can provide for her we will bring her, do you see, that if the petitioners get their grant, the other Indians on other reserves will also get the benefit of it.\n\nIn regards to the number for which the per capita is asked, Mr. Green after looking through the building said he thought with a little remodeling we could accommodate about forty pupils at present until the other Indians are notified & think I can start with 25 pupils, when they know that the Government will feed their children, they will bring them. I am sorry I overlooked date my letter last week. Trusting this will find you well with our kind regards.\n\nR.G.

From what the Agent states it would seem that Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, the teachers, expected more assistance from the pupils than they have received and consequently more has fallen to their lot than expected. Under the circumstances the request for an assistant seems not unreasonable. It is noted though that Mr. McDonald omits to state whether for the monthly sum of $20.00 or $25.00 the services of a suitable\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nsuitable white woman could be secured, and he is being asked respecting this matter.\n\nNo mention is made by the Agent, as will be seen, as to getting the Indians to consent to supplying the necessary fuel for the use of the school. This oversight on his part is being drawn to his attention, though it is thought unlikely that the Indians will supply the required fuel, as in many other instances Indians have refused to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nMarch 22nd, 1908.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nReferring to your letter of the 2nd ultimo, No. 690, M.S., requesting a full report on the management of Homalco Day School, and the results of the experiment so far as shown up to the present, I have the honor to state that I visited the said school on the 19th instant.\n\nThere were 25 pupils on the roll and 19 in attendance on the date of my visit. I examined them in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and in view of the fact that the school has only been in operation since the beginning of August last, and that none of the pupils could then speak English, and none had previously attended any school, I consider that they have made excellent progress. They read very well in the First Primer, their writing is good, and they can count and add fairly well. Twelve of them are now sufficiently advanced for promotion to the 2nd standard.\n\nSixteen pupils boarded in the school from the beginning of August to the latter part of December, when the parents returned to the village and took their children to their own houses, except four pupils, who remained inmates of the school all winter, and were still there at the time of my visit.\n\nAt the beginning of April, the parents will nearly all be going away to work, and will again leave their children as boarders.\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nboarders in the school.\n\nMr. Thompson teaches the boys and Mrs. Thompson, besides teaching the girls, has to attend to the cooking, washing, and keeping the building in order. The big girls, whom she expected to assist her with the housework, only attend as day scholars, and, consequently do not help her as was expected they would. She is not a very strong woman, and complains that the amount of work she has to do when 15 or 16 children are boarding in the school, is too much for her, and Mr. Thompson and herself would be glad if the Department could give a grant of $20 or $25 a month to pay a white woman to relieve Mrs. Thompson of a portion of this work. Unless this is done, it is feared that they will have to discontinue keeping the children as boarders in the school, and, in that event, the parents would be obliged to take their children away with them to where they are working. This would practically paralyze the school, at least for the summer months, and I would, therefore, recommend to the favorable consideration of the Department the question of a salary for a white woman to assist Mrs. Thompson, at least for six or nine months in the year when the children will be resident at the school.\n\nThe parents take a keen interest in the school, and are very well pleased that their children are getting along so well. They have, however, expressed a strong desire to have their school converted into a boarding school, with the usual per capita grant, as they say it is a great hardship to provide provisions and clothing for their children when in the school.\n\nMr. Thompson informs me that, so far, the Indians, with a\na few exceptions, have provided sufficient provisions, etc., for their children while in the school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nMemo.\n\nMr. Vowell asked to obtain a special report on the Nomalco school from the Agent, Mr. McDonald.

As there was nothing to show where it came from, Mr. Agent McDonald was asked for a report on the application.

(RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThis proposition for a Day School at Homalco reserve, Fute Inlet, B.C., is in the line of our idea for an improved Day School and I think is worthy of consideration. At the same time our policy has been not to increase the schools in British Columbia, or to make any new arrangement there, without carefully considering the whole field. It seems hard to refuse assistance in this case when the Indians themselves have spent nearly $4000.00 on the building. Would it be possible to allow the School to go on as an experiment for a year. I would rather favor that plan. We might offer $600.00; and I would propose to charge it to the first vote for Boarding and Industrial Schools rather than the Day School vote. There is no money provided in the latter vote, and the former vote can bear it.\n\nAccountant.\nOttawa, March 26, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent-General,\n\nOn December 33 a petition was received from Chief Williams and other Indians of the Nomloco reserve, Bute Inlet, B.C., asking for a grant for the salary of a teacher, as they have erected a school-house.\n\nMr. Agent McDonald, who was asked to furnish a report on this application, has written the Department, stating that there are about 30 children of school age, none of whom have as yet attended any school. They will not consent to send their children to Squamish or Sechelt or any other school off the reserve.\n\nwithout consulting anyone they have put up a building at a cost of about $4000 with accommodation for a regular boarding school. They have agreed to provide the necessary furnishings, if the Department will make a grant for the teacher's salary. They wish to secure a qualified teacher, holding a public school certificate, preferably a married man with family; as their school is in a very isolated locality, no white settlers within 30 miles of the village, the steamers calling there only once a week, the Agent thinks there would be difficulty in securing the services of a qualified\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher and his wife would require $600 a year, $300 for each, but they would look after the children who are left by their parents while away fishing. The Agent considers this would be the best arrangement that could be made and recommends it to the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\nThese Indians are reported to be industrious, with good homes, which are well provided for, and the Agent states that for a time at least they would be able to supply provisions, etc., for the maintenance of the school, as they have made no request for such assistance.\n\nIt seems to me that Indians who are so anxious for the education of their children should be encouraged.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, No. 318400, requesting a report from me in regard to a petition received by the Department from Chief William and other Indians of the Homalco band, Bute Inlet, asking for a grant to pay the salary of a teacher on the reserve where they have erected a schoolhouse.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that these Indians have, for several years, been anxious to have a school established on their reserve. They have about 30 children of school age, none of whom have as yet attended any school. I have, on several occasions, requested them to send some of their children to the Sechelt school, and others to the Squamish Mission school, as each of these Institutions has accommodation for several additional pupils, but they did not wish to send their children so far from home; and, as they would not consent to send their children to any of the schools already established in the Agency, I advised them that they should join with the Klahoose and Nlakpmx Indians, who are also anxious for schools, and erect a building on some reserve conveniently situated for the three bands, but they would not consent to this proposal either, as they wanted a school on their own reserve. I may add that the Rev.\n\nFather\n\nJ. D. Mclean, Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFather Chirouse, Missionary to these Indians, advised them in this matter along the same lines as myself.\n\nAbout a year ago, without consulting anyone, they commenced the erection of a school building on their Alpe reserve, where their village is situated. When I visited them in the month of September last, the building was then not quite completed, and there were no furnishings in it.\n\nAt that time, they did not wish me to apply to the Department for a grant for them, until they would have their building completed and furnished, and some necessary clearing and grading done around it. As soon as they had everything ready, they were to notify me, so that I could lay their request before the Department.\n\nThey have put up a fairly good frame building, the main part of which is 50 x 40 feet, two stories high. The first story has two class-rooms, each 15 x 30 feet, one small room 10 x 12 feet, and stairway. The second story has two dormitories, 15 x 30 feet each, and one small bedroom, 10 x 12 feet. Adjoining the rear of the main building is a kitchen 20 x 30 feet, one story. The building cost in the neighborhood of $4000 and has been all paid for by the Indians themselves. It is fairly well constructed, but has not sufficient accommodation for a regular boarding school, as such institutions are conducted in this agency.\n\nI have just been informed by these Indians that the school building is now completed, and that they will provide the necessary furnishings as soon as provision is made by the Department for a teacher's salary. They say that they would like to have a teacher holding a public School certificate, a man with wife and family preferred, but, as their\ntheir school is in a very isolated locality, there being no white settlers within twenty miles of the village, and passenger steamers calling there only once a week, I fear it will hardly be possible to secure the services of a public School teacher to go to such an out out of the way place, as there is a scarcity of such teachers even further the public Schools of the province.\n\nThese Indians, by reason of their occupations, are obliged to be away from their village most of the year, usually taking their families with them, and, in order that the children could attend school regularly, it would be necessary for them to board in the school, at least during the absence of their parents.\n\nIn discussing the matter with the Rev. Father Chirouse, he informed me that he can secure the services of a gentleman (I have forgotten his name) who has had several years' experience teaching in the Indian schools of Vancouver Island, and who, with his wife, would be willing to take charge of this school, provided the remuneration were sufficient, he teaching the boys, and his wife teaching the girls, and, with the assistance of the older girls would look after the cooking and other housework, for which he would require a salary of at least $600 per annum, or $300 for each of them.\n\nThis, in my opinion, is the best arrangement that can be made, and I would recommend same to the favorable consideration of the Department.\n\nIt is thought that the Indians will, for a time at least, be able to provide provisions, &c., for the maintenance of the school, as they have made no request for such assistance.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 27, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received a petition from Chief William and other Indians of the Bute Inlet (Homalco) reserve, asking for a grant to pay the salary of a teacher on the reserve, where they have erected a schoolhouse.\n\nAs no address is given, the Department is inclosing herewith its reply, and you will be good enough to forward the same to its destination.\n\nThe Department would also like you to make a report for its information on the request of these Indians.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nR.G.

Garland.\n\nIn connection therewith I have to say that Mr. Garland was in the employ of this Department for a period of about two years as teacher at an Indian School at Komalco, B.C. In his capacity as teacher he did not handle any funds of the Department but I am not familiar enough with his personal history to answer the questions as submitted by you.\n\nMr. Garland was relieved of his position on account of friction between himself and other employees of the Department and, as intimated above, I am not in a position to pronounce upon his worthiness in respect to your issuing a bond on his behalf.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFidelity Insurance Company of Canada,\n36 Toronto Street,\nToronto, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith report for June quarter of Mr. Arthur N. Becher, teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School, at Church-House, B.C.\n\nMr. Becher has requested that his cheque be forwarded to him care of this office as he is leaving for Vancouver this week.\n\nI have written Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn calling attention to the pitifully small attendance compared with the Sliammon Day School and the expense of maintaining a field matron and teacher at the Reserve at a cost of over \u00a31,500.00 per annum. I pointed out that four of the pupils are non-Indians who are permitted to attend the school, viz., the Pallen children who have much the best attendance.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nB/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer again to your letter of the 16th ultimo regarding Homalco Day School matters.\n\nMr. Becher called here yesterday and stated that he had received a cable from Ireland to return there as soon as possible and he has now applied for six months leave of absence which is submitted for our consideration. As he is taking his family with him, the position of field matron is also vacant under the same circumstances.\n\nI would not respectfully recommend that a teacher and field matron be appointed temporarily in their place, and in six months' time we can then determine whether the school has made progress or not and how far Mr. Becher is responsible for the backwardness of the pupils and his re-employment at Homalco can then receive further consideration.\n\nAs there is not time to receive your instructions on the matter before Mr. Becher leaves Vancouver, I have advised him that I can give him no assurance that his former position will be open for him if and when he returns. I trust you will approve of this action, but if not, any instructions you may have to the contrary can be communicated to him in Ireland during his leave of absence.\n\nI have notified Mr. Assistant Commissioner Perry in accordance with the above and as Mr. Barry, Inspector of Schools, has not visited Homalco and does not understand the peculiar conditions under which the teacher and field matron have to live, I hope I shall be consulted before any appointment is made.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SGD.) F.J.C. BALL.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 7th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nIn his report regarding his visit to the Homalco Indian Day School on the 12th ultimo, Inspector Barry reports that the teacher is keeping seven large dogs and that he received complaints that they were bothering the children. Please let me know if you consider any action should be taken in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. [Signature]\nActing Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nThe teacher keeps a number of large dogs at the school. When I visited the school there were seven there. I warned him that he had better see to it they did not bother the small children when they attended school. He informed me that the old dog was kept tied up when children were coming to school. I am not in favour of the keeping of large dogs at Indian Day Schools. This matter is mentioned here for the information of the Department, as I understand from Mr. Bartlett that there has been trouble in the village over these dogs, and that some two or three of the children have been bitten. I had not heard this when I spoke to the teacher about his dogs, and in fact did not hear about it till we had left the village in the Gikumi. I consider that the Department should be made aware of the above, even if the matter is not inquired into at the present time.\nOttawa, September 25, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to Mr. and Mrs. Sowrey, teacher and field matron, respectively, at Homalco Reserve.\n\nIn view of your report, the Department approves the retention of the services of Mr. and Mrs. Sowrey during the academic year 1933-34. They will be allowed the same salary as last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nYour File 167-33-1.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th instant with reference to the temporary application of Mr. and Mrs. Sowrey as teacher and field matron respectively at Homalco Indian Reserve.\n\nI have much pleasure in reporting that the school attendance has improved tremendously and that Mr. Sowrey has taken much interest in his duties as teacher, and is also giving manual training instruction as part of the school curriculum.\n\nMrs. Sowrey, being a qualified nurse, has also given valuable services to the Homalco Indians and is keenly interested in her work.\n\nThere is an entirely different atmosphere at this school and reserve, and the Indians are now living under much more sanitary and hygienic conditions since Mrs. Sowrey took over the duties of field matron.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Becher wrote me personally some time ago saying they did not intend returning to Canada and I respectfully recommend that Mr. and Mrs. Sowrey be retained in their positions.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.

The Department would appreciate your reporting at once regarding the work done by Mr. and Mrs. Sowrey during the past year. You should also state if Mr. and Mrs. Becher have returned to Canada and if they have requested to be re-appointed at Homalco. If so, you should advise whether or not you recommend the re-appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Becher or the retention of the services of Mr. and Mrs. Sowrey for the academic year 1933-34.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

I observe that Mr. V.H. Sowrey went in on the last boat to act as school teacher in the place of Mr. Becher; and that Mrs. Sowrey is a Graduate Nurse who wishes to substitute for Mrs. Becher.\n\nThe name of Mrs. Sowrey may be included in the monthly pay list in place of Mrs. Becher, and with the same remuneration. Mrs. Sowrey should be informed, however, that if she should later be appointed to the position of Field Matron, she will begin at the minimum of the salary range ($300 - $400) less the 10% reduction which is general throughout the Service at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes\nActing Secretary\n\nF.J.G. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n622 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, September 3rd, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your /4969 of the 27th ultimo, nominating the services of Mr. W. H. Sowrey as teacher and his wife as field matron to replace Mr. and Mrs. A. N. Becher, who have applied for six months' leave of absence. With regard to a teacher for this school, I have to say that the Department will approve of the temporary appointment of Mr. Sowrey with salary at the rate of $95 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\nWhile the appointment of Mr. Sowrey is temporary, the Department could give no guarantee that the position will be kept open for Mr. Becher. The Department will await a report regarding the success that Mr. Sowrey meets with in the work and in the encouraging of a regular attendance of the Indian children. There has been a very small attendance at this school and, under the charge of Mr. Sowrey, there may be a great improvement both in the attendance and in the classroom work. You should furnish a full report early in the new year regarding the work being accomplished and the attendance, when the retention of Mr. Sowrey for a further period than six months would receive consideration. Please inform Mr. Sowrey of his temporary appointment and the salary he is to receive.\n\nYou will be written in a separate communication regarding the appointment of Mrs. Sowrey as field matron.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Sowrey and his wife as teacher and field matron respectively to replace Mr. and Mrs. A.N. Becher temporarily and they are proceeding to Homalco by the next boat.\n\nMr. Sowrey is a qualified teacher and has already taught for one year in the Stikine Agency besides several years experience elsewhere and Mrs. Sowrey is a trained nurse and they should be successful at this School.\n\nI beg to request that these temporary appointments be authorized as this is the best arrangement which can be made and will give me an opportunity of comparing the progress made under the two teachers.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.

Arthur N. Becher.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant regarding Mr. Barry's report on Homalco Indian Day School on the 12th ultimo.\n\nThis is Mr. Barry's first visit to Homalco since his appointment and he probably does not know conditions very well in that district.\n\nMr. Sowrey, the teacher, has two dogs, both pure-bred Alsatians, and there were five pups born within the last few months. He includes these as \"large\" dogs.\n\nI call at Church-House fairly often and if the Indians had any complaint to make about the dogs, they certainly would make it to me.\n\nThis Reserve is infested with mongrel dogs belonging to the Indians who leave them to starve when they go fishing. They are far more dangerous to the Indian children than the teacher's dogs which are kept around the residence. As Mr. Sowrey often leaves Mrs. Sowrey on the Reserve, when he goes for supplies, etc., they are needed for her protection and I respectfully suggest that no notice be taken of Mr. Barry's report in this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C. Hall]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTowards the end of my inspection the teacher told me that some Indians wished to speak to me. I explained to the teacher and later to the Indians that I WOULD NOT HOLD ANY SORT OF MEETING WITHOUT THE INDIAN AGENT. I was prepared to listen to anyone who wished to speak to me however. Four or five Indians explained the reason why they sent me the petition complaining of the teacher and the school. T. Paul spoke for the others. He was most impertinent and asked me all sorts of foolish questions. I told him to ask the Indian Agent who was the official who had charge of the matter. He explained that there were far more children in the village than were in school that day. I told him that the Indians could not expect their children to get on in school if the parents did not send them to school. He said that the teacher did not ring a bell for school. I asked one of the Indians who looked as if he could understand English if he did not know the time. He said he did. I remarked that if he knew the time he could see that the children were sent to school regardless of any bell.\n\nI asked the teacher to requisition for a new bell and in the meantime to try to mend the old one. All that is required is a large hand bell which the teacher can ring for school.\n\nThe whole attitude of the Indians was truculent.\n\nI have read a long letter from Mr. Indian Agent Ball in which he gives the teacher's explanation of points raised in the petition sent by the Indians of Church House to me, and later forwarded to the Department through the Assistant Commissioner for British Columbia. I wish to say that I am in complete agreement with the observations of Mr. Indian Agent Ball as far as the Homalco Indian Day School and the Indians and others at Church House are concerned. I told the Indians that they were in my opinion being made fools of by others, and that the best thing they could do was to send their children to school. They, however, let me know that they do not intend to do this.\n\nIn some ways it might be best to transfer Mr. and Mrs. Sowrey to another school in the Vancouver Agency should there be a vacant position, at Sliammon for instance. I doubt that under the circumstances Mr. Sowrey could be expected to do better than he has at Church House. The Indians appear out to upset the Department's work there if they can do so. I am certainly of the opinion that they are being urged on by someone other than an Indian.\n\nThese points are all mentioned here as I wish the Indian Agent, Mr. Ball, to know that I entirely agree with him in his estimate of the conditions at Church House.\nOttawa, February 26, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nInspector Barry visited the Homalco Indian Day School on the 4th instant, and I enclose, for your information, an extract from his report.\n\nI also enclose copy of letter which is being directed to the teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nENC.\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, February 26, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department understands that, on the occasion of his recent visit to the Homalco Indian Day School, Mr. Barry suggested that you attend this year's Provincial Summer School in Victoria and specialize in the Primary Subjects course.\n\nIt should be understood that this Department does not provide the funds for this purpose. However, I feel certain that, in view of our wishes in the matter, you will make the necessary arrangements. Please advise me accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. H.

Box 8, Vancouver, B.C.\n\n26th October, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your 167-33-1 of the 14th instant, with which you enclosed a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Ball addressed to the Department, regarding the situation at the Homalco Indian Day School, Church House.\n\nThis situation continues to be given close attention. At present the children have not returned to School but I was given assurances yesterday by one of the local advisors to the Indians of Church House that the children would return to School in deference to my wishes.\n\nMr. Sowrey has not been a success as a teacher at Church House and, whatever causes there may be for the dissatisfaction that exists with respect to the conduct of the Indian Day School there, this is one of the contributing factors to the present situation, if not the main one.\n\nInspector Barry, in report on the situation on October 7th, stated:\u2014 \"I am quite unable to recommend the retention of the services of Mr. Sowrey, the teacher at Church House. He is not in possession of a Normal School certificate, and though he did attend the Provincial Summer School in Victoria last year he appears to have made a complete fool of himself there.\"\n\nFrom the information I now have before me, I cannot do otherwise than recommend that Mr. Sowrey be replaced at Church House. He is heartily disliked by both parents and pupils and the continuation of his services there would only tend to aggravate the dissatisfaction that already exists. Mrs. Sowrey's work as Field Matron at Church House has been outstanding, and her services should be secured for one of our other Reserves, if it is possible to make satisfactory arrangements.\n\nAfter considering all the circumstances involved, I do not think it advisable this time to prosecute the parents under the compulsory provision of Section 10 of the Indian Act.\n\nI would recommend that His Excellency Archbishop Duke be asked to nominate a new teacher and field matron for our work at Church House.\n\nMr. Ball's letter is returned herewith, as requested.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith quarterly report from Mr. W. H. Sowrey, teacher at Homalo Indian Day School, showing that no children have returned to school this term.\n\nI believe you should have the following particulars regarding the situation at Homalo Reserve (Church House). There is a well-kept combined school and residence building on this Reserve, about 100 miles north of Vancouver. The Reserve, of 14 acres in extent, is the headquarters of the Band chief, and is on a rocky bay at the mouth of Burrard Inlet. An old store building holds the Reserve, being occupied by an old French woman of 80, named Thompson, and a nondescript man of about 35 named Prendergast, trading under the name of the Rute Mercantile Company. These are the only white people within some miles of the Reserve. Besides the school building on the Reserve, there is a large Roman Catholic church, a new and substantial council house, and about 35 dwellings, all frame buildings. The Homalo Band numbers 156, of whom about 25 should be attending the day school provided.\n\nThe present teacher is Mr. W. H. Sowrey, and his wife is fieldmatron. Mr. Sowrey is well-educated and was formerly science master at Kingsley School, North Vancouver, but does not hold B.C. teaching certificates. His wife is a qualified nurse, and both served during the war. Mr. Sowrey has been teaching at Church House for five years, succeeding Mr. Becher who resigned. Mr. Becher gave as the reason for his resignation the continual interference and unpleasantness experienced by himself and his wife by the two white persons living at the store. Mr. Becher's predecessor, Mr. Garland, was also a stipendiary magistrate, and he sentenced Prendergast to six months imprisonment on one occasion, so although I have no personal knowledge of Garland, he also apparently had trouble with these people.\n\nMr. Sowrey believes, and I think he is correct, that all the trouble about the school emanates from these people at the store, who apparently resent the presence of any other white people, as it interferes with their solicitation of the Indians. In this connection I should mention that a few years ago, these store people were agitating the Indians to ask for relief, stating they were starving, and the Department advised me to have some relief work done on the Reserve. Orders were given on the store to each Indian for the amount of work done, and when the bills were received, 75% of the purchases were for face-cream, hair oil, face-powder, shaving soap, chocolates and tobacco, showing that there was no destitution. This shows the class of people who are advising the Indians at Church House against schools and Department officials generally.\n\nThe man referred to, A. J. Prendergast, has been convicted for trespass on the Reserves; there is no question of\nwhy he goes there. We have records of Church House Indian girls coming to Vancouver and staying at low-class hotels, Prendergast occupying the adjoining room.\n\nUnfortunately, for all of us, the missionary for Church House, Reverend Father P. Flannagan, always makes his headquarters at the store, and is quite unaware of the real character of Prendergast in particular.\n\nImmediately after the summer holidays, Father Flannagan took all the Church House children to Sechelt Residential School without the formality of applying for permission to place them there, and I instructed the Reverend Principal to return them, which he did. The teacher is under the impression that Father Flannagan is opposing the day school, being influenced by the store people. Whether this is so or not, I cannot say. He is very old, and has been missionary for many years, and probably views day schools with disfavour.\n\nI cannot blame the Indians entirely for their present action, as they are no doubt confused in the matter, if they are given the impression that their priest does not approve the day school. This would not be direct, but through the store people. Mr. Sowrey complains that the children are sent to the store for religious instruction, which is given at the school when they attend.\n\nI have mentioned this matter to School Inspector Barry, who is unable to attend to it at present as he is going north. He says he went to Church House last year on this question, and was not received very well by the Indians. Mr. Barry advises me that Mr. Sowrey has not been entirely successful as teacher at Church House, the children have not made the progress they should. Mr. Sowrey admits this, and says the reason is that he has been interfered with continually by the store people and the children have been very irregular in attendance.\n\nThe new Chief, Tommy Paul, is also opposed to the school, and Mr. Sowrey says he is instructed by Prendergast and is advising the parents not to send their children to school.\n\nI believe this covers the situation, except that it should be stated that Mrs. Sowrey, as field matron, has rendered invaluable service to the Indians, especially in recent epidemics, and Dr. Lyons, the medical officer, says he believes she saved several lives by her devotion to duty.\n\nI hoped to transfer Mr. and Mrs. Sowrey to Shuswap, when Mrs. Nicholson, field matron there, resigned, but she withdrew her resignation, and it was not possible to do so.\n\nIf other teachers had not had trouble at Kamloops School, I should be inclined to think Sowrey was at fault, but Teacher's left there because conditions were impossible. The store woman referred to was at one time paid as teacher at Church House, although the teaching was imaginary, and undoubtedly this is why any teacher will be thwarted. Prendergast was recently before me on a charge of trespass when he interfered with the field matron's\nwork in one of the Indian houses, but through slackness and incompetence of the Provincial Police prosecuting, I had to dismiss the case.\n\nI respectfully offer these suggestions in the matter:\n\n1. To close the school temporarily, leaving the Sowreys there so that Mrs. Sowrey's work will not be lost to us.\n\n2. Send a teacher there temporarily who could reside with the Sowreys, but could not stay alone on the Reserve. (I do not know whether the Sowreys would remain very long under these conditions).\n\n3. Prosecute all parents under Section 10(4) of the Indian Act.\n\nIf it was only a question of replacing the Sowreys, it would be simplified, but in that case, their successors would be under the domination of the store people, and the position of all officials of the Department made impossible. The Nomalco Indians already think the store people control the Department's policy at Church House, and I would not like this opinion strengthened.\n\nYour instructions and advice are respectfully requested.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Fred J.

As you suggested at Powell River, it is a nil return.\n\nActually the number of attendances should have been in the region of 100. There have been more children on the Reserve this month than in any previous September since I came here.\n\nI have already brought to your notice that there was a refusal on the part of parents to send their children to school. No one was ignorant of the fact that school was open. In point of fact I have heard children down the village shouting they heard the bell, which has been rung regularly. Fr. Plamondon was in the village during part of the month, and was aware of facts, but I do not know of anything he did to get children to attend.\n\nTwo weeks ago the chief, Tommy Paul, visited you in Vancouver, as you had written him informing him that children should attend school. You informed me that he assured you that he had not told Mrs. Bowrey that he had told them not to attend. This statement made by the chief is absolutely incorrect. I heard him say, in the dispensary, in reply to a remark by Mrs. Bowrey, \"Mear that you have told the children not to attend school.\" That's right\". Since his return, children have not attended. Also I have been told that on his return to Powell Bay, he again told a parent, Joe J. Wilson, that no children were to attend school and Joe Wilson from At Cal is said here. Some parents tell me that they have been threatened about sending their children to school. These parents tell me they are willing but afraid.\n\nI notice that again there is an exodus of children to the store in school hours on school days. Not all the children who should be attending school are going, nor do many of the boys appear to be going. The time they may would seem to preclude the idea that they have gone to purchase candy; nor do they appear to be carrying anything on the return journey. This seems to be the same business started by Fr. Plamondon last January which I brought to your attention at that time.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Mrs. M.

These Indians are rather a peculiar tribe; they appear to be truculent and offensive as Mr. Barry says, but they are friendly enough whenever I visit them. They have promised not to be influenced by Prendergast or other worthless white people in future, although I do not put much faith in these promises. Their secretary, Albert Wilson, is apparently a friend of Prendergast, and together they compose all kinds of letters to various persons, which sound quite alarming. I mentioned to Wilson one letter in particular and he said he \"did not understand some of the words he wrote.\" One or the better Indians told me they were mostly to blame themselves for poor attendance at School. It has been recommended that a new handbell be supplied to replace the present broken one.\n\nSome of the Indians made a complaint that other day schools fly a flag every school-day and want to know why Homalco does not. I advised them that this will be attended to also, and while on this subject, I may say that Seghelt Residential School recently took down their flag-pole, and several people have asked me why the flag is not flown there as is done at Provincial schools.\n\nI respectfully recommend that a hand-bell and the usual school flag be supplied to Homalco Day School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gallagher of Ladner, B.C., to fill the positions of teacher and Field Matron at Church House on January 1st. His Grace informs me that Mr. Gallagher taught school for some years in Alberta and has a splendid record and that Mrs. Gallagher is a qualified teacher and also holds a First Aid and Home Nursing Certificate.\n\nI would recommend that the Department favorably consider the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Gallagher to undertake our work at Church House. I may say that I called on Archbishop Duke today and advised His Grace of the contents of Indian Agent Ball's report and particularly the complaints regarding interference of Mr. Prendergast and the alleged lack of co-operation on the part of the Reverend Father Plamondon, Missionary Priest to the Homalco Indian Reserve. His Grace assured me of his deep interest in the work of the Department among the Indians and his wish to cooperate fully with us and encourage the co-operation of the Clergy within his jurisdiction in the educational work being carried on.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

MCGILL:\n\nRE: Homalo Indian Day School.\n\nDo you think it would be advisable for Indian Commissioner MacKay to see Archbishop Duke and inform him fully in regard to the action being taken towards the appointment of a new teacher at this school. I think the Archbishop should be advised of the contents of the Indian Agent's report and also the other complaints on file regarding the interference of Mr. Prendergast and the alleged lack of cooperation on behalf of the resident priest.\n\nWe should do everything we can to see that nothing interferes with the education of the Indian children. No doubt Mr. Sowrey was not fully qualified but I think that the local interference was of considerable hindrance to his work as teacher.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nSecretary.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDeputy Minister\n\nWith reference to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of October 12, 1937, and my reply of October 19 regarding the Homalco Indian Day School, a report has just been received from Indian Commissioner MacKay.\n\nHe advises that he has very carefully considered the situation that has arisen at Homalco and recommends the dismissal of the teacher, Mr. Sowrey.\n\nMr. MacKay is being advised that the Department concurs in his recommendation and we are instructing him to notify Mr. Sowrey that his services will not be required after December 31, 1937.\n\nAs the Department has always allowed the Archbishop of Vancouver to nominate the teacher for the Homalco School, I am also requesting Commissioner MacKay to communicate with Most Reverend W.W. Duke, D.D., with a view to having him nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of this school in January 1938.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, November 3, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of October 26 in which you report on the situation that has arisen at Homalco and recommend the replacement of Mr. Sowrey.\n\nPlease advise both Mr. and Mrs. Sowrey that their services will not be required after December 31, 1937.\n\nYou should also interview Most Reverend W.M. Duke, D.D., Archbishop of Vancouver, with a view to having him nominate qualified workers to replace Mr. and Mrs. Sowrey.\n\nWhile the best arrangement might be to secure a qualified married male teacher for the school, provided his wife would be capable of performing the field matron's duties, at the same time I realize that it is sometimes difficult to obtain such a couple. You might consider the advisability of securing a qualified female teacher for the school and another lady who would be congenial with the teacher to do the field matron work.\n\nWe are prepared to allow a salary at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month for the teacher, but the amount to be allowed the person doing the field matron's work will depend on their qualifications. In any case, this would not exceed $450.00 a year.\n\n(Full particulars)\nFull particulars regarding the person nominated by Archbishop Duke should be forwarded for our consideration. I would appreciate receiving this nomination at the earliest possible date in order that we may have plenty of time to consider the matter before the end of the current calendar year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Sewrey, teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School, would terminate on December 31, 1937. To succeed Mr. Sewrey the Department is appointing Mr. D.J. Gallagher.\n\nHe will be allowed salary at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month and his appointment will date from January 1st, 1938. The following entries should therefore be made on the January pay list:\n\nNo. 815 - D.J. Gallagher,\nTeacher, Homalco Indian Day School,\nChurch House P.O., B.C. - $95.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that on April 16th I received a letter dated April 1st from Mr. W.J. Phillips. It was headed \"Churchouse April 1st\" but was mailed in Vancouver April 15th. In his letter he resigned as teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School, effective April 21st. I forwarded this letter to the Indian Commissioner in the usual way.\n\nOn the 21st I received a radiogram from Chief Tommy Paul, of the Homalco Band, saying the teacher had left the school and it had been broken into on the night of the 12th instant. I left for Churchhouse on the 22nd, arriving there on the 23rd. Meanwhile I had radioed the B.C. Police boat to meet me and investigate the breaking and entering charge. En route to Churchhouse by gasboat and about two hours run from there, I passed another gasboat which I did not recognize and took the number of it as I usually do in such cases.\n\nUpon arrival at the Reserve, the Chief told us that Mr. and Mrs. Phillips and two others had been to the School, taken some tools to the School, and had taken away some packages when they left about two hours before - this was the boat I had passed earlier.\n\nUpon entering the School - which is a combined school and residence building - we found the tools above mentioned lying on a chair, there was a saw, hammer, chisel and screwdriver all completely covered with red, salt-water rust, and practically worthless. Upstairs we found a few broken rusty tools. Mr. Phillips had advised the Chief that the tools were there when he left and had evidently been stolen when the school was broken into. I could not find out when Phillips left, as apparently he was in and out of the Reserve several times. The date of the breaking and entering was the Saturday following Good Friday, when all the Indians except two were celebrating Easter at another Reserve 25 miles away. The Police searched these two houses as Chief Paul said Phillips mentioned that they had probably done the stealing but nothing was found at their places.\n\nLater in conversation with the Chief, he told me that a departmental cheque for $45.00 which I had sent to him through Phillips (copy of my covering letter enclosed) duly arrived, but Phillips told him to endorse it and let him have it and he would pay it back later, and the chief stated that Phillips told him I had authorized him to use the money. While on the Reserve, the local storekeeper sent a letter to me asking if I could help him collect a $55.00 grocery bill from Phillips but I advised him this was not in my jurisdiction. Dr. Lyons, medical officer, also mentioned that Phillips had borrowed money from him.\n\nWe sealed up the School building, and I left on the police boat to locate Phillips. We found their boat late at night tied up at a small dock. I questioned Phillips and...\nhis wife on the Police boat, and he denied saying I had authorized him to use the $45.00, but admitted that, being short of funds, he had asked the Chief if he could borrow it. As this money represented wages for about 11 men for cutting wood for the School, and did not belong to the Chief, it was an unfortunate thing to do. This money was to be put in a fund to buy shingles to repair the Church roof.\n\nPhillips had bought a gas-boat from an Indian, paying a small sum down and had built a cabin on it and left for Vancouver. This boat had not been registered, and was stopped by the Naval Patrol when it tried to enter the harbour, and taken into False Creek, where it is now held. This Indian says he did not know Phillips was leaving the School, or he would not have sold him the boat. Phillips tried to register the boat in his own name, but the Registrar refused without a bill of sale.\n\nThe B.C. Police discovered an unregistered rifle in the boat, and I do not know what action will be taken in either of the above misdemeanors.\n\nWithout going further into a long list of his reprehensible actions, I would point out that Mr. and Mrs. Phillips left the Reserve about the end of March or beginning of April and that any salaries due them should be paid until March 31st only. Further, that the $45.00 being held by him, should be deducted from such salary cheque, as this money belongs to several Indians. For that reason I wired you on the 24th requesting his cheque be held pending this report.\n\nI understand that Phillips intends travelling around in the boat he bought, selling insurance. His school work I believe was satisfactory and Mrs. Phillips was field matron, and there was no reason for them to leave. They are both very young and have two small children. Unfortunately, Phillips does not appear to have much balance and his integrity is not beyond question.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n(COPY)\n\n416 Ederal Building,\nVancouver, B.

These resignations are effective April 16, 1941, and the salary due both of them for the period April 1 to April 15 should be forwarded at once.\n\nAt the same time you should also forward to them any amount that has been deducted from their salaries since they began duties at Homalco. The present address of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips is 1525 West 11th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith the resignation of Mr. W.J. Phillips, teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School, Church House, B.C., and covering letter from Mr. Indian Agent Ball.\n\nThe matter of Mr. Phillips' resignation has been discussed with Inspector Barry, whose report on the Homalco Indian Day School was forwarded under cover of my letter of February 21st last. Captain Barry found that Mr. Phillips' work in the class room was satisfactory. He was given assistance and advice at the time of the inspection of the school and did not then suggest the possibility of his resignation before the end of the academic year.\n\nInspector Barry suggests that although it would appear that Mr. and Mrs. Phillips have abandoned their work at Church House without giving the Department any notice, it must be assumed that he was in charge of the school there from April 1st to April 9th, and that under these circumstances the Department might be well advised to pay them for the first half of April.\n\nI would recommend that the Department accept the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips as teacher and field matron on the Homalco Indian Reserve, and that they be paid salary for only the first half of April. The refund of any salary held back monthly by the Department in accordance with superannuation regulations should also be included in the final cheque to Mr. and Mrs. Phillips.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI would suggest that the Homalco Indian Day School remain closed until the end of the present academic year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

No mention is made of his wife's resignation as field matron, but I am advised that they both came to Vancouver before Easter and that Mrs. Phillips stated she would not return under any circumstances.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Phillips asks for his resignation to take effect from April 1st, whereas he must have left the School previous to the 6th, the closing date. Mrs. Phillips was not entitled to leave of absence.\n\nI have no idea where the keys of the School have been left and I have received advice from Ottawa that a shipment of medical supplies has been forwarded to Churchouse recently.\n\nThe resignation was dated \"April 1st, 1941, Churchouse, B.C.\" but was mailed in Vancouver on April 15th.\n\nI recommend that as they have left the School without any notice whatever, both the teacher and field matron be paid to March 31st only, and that Ottawa be so advised before their cheques are sent to them.\n\nMr. Phillips' conduct, other than in the school room, has been unsatisfactory from the first, and he undoubtedly applied for the position only until he could obtain employment in some other line; I understand he is an electrician, and no doubt came to Vancouver to seek employment, and having found it, left without the slightest consideration for the Department.\n\nI have radioed the B.C. Provincial Police patrol boat in that vicinity asking them to call at the school and see that it is properly secured until such time as I can get there.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of October 22nd, your file 167-33-1, regarding the nomination of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips as teacher and field matron at Church House.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Phillips are twenty-four and twenty-three years old respectively. They have two young children.\n\nMr. Phillips informs me that he was advised by the examining officer that he was unfitted for war service because of defective eyesight.\n\nI omitted to state in my letter of October 19th that this young man has had experience in the training and supervision of boys between the ages of seven and fourteen in Y.M.C.A. work for a period of nearly three years at Windsor, Ontario. It is considered that this experience should be helpful to him at Homalco if given the position.\n\nI interviewed this young couple and was favorably impressed with them and feel that they would fully measure up to the duties and responsibilities of the positions at Church House.\n\nInspector Barry is absent in the interior of the Province on inspection duties and is therefore not available to pass on the qualifications of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips.\n\nI would recommend that the nomination of His Excellency Archbishop Duke be approved and should appreciate the Department's decision by airmail.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

I feel you will realize that the Department hesitates to appoint two persons without any special qualifications for the work which they will be expected to undertake. Besides, it is noted that Mr. Philips is a B.Sc. and in view of present conditions, when technical men are being required all over the country, it is rather difficult to understand why he would be willing to accept a position at an Indian day school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

A copy of His Excellency's letter is enclosed.\n\nMr. Philips is a B. Sc. of Western University, London, Ont. He has had no teaching experience.\n\nMrs. Philips has had some training in nursing and first aid work.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to secure a fully qualified married couple for the positions at Church House. Of the applicants who have been interviewed Mr. and Mrs. Philips are considered the best qualified and should, with instruction and assistance from Inspector Barry and the part time Medical Officer in the area, discharge the duties required of them in a satisfactory manner.\n\nI would recommend the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Philips to the vacancies at Church House, and also that the same salaries be paid them as were paid to their predecessors, Mr. and Mrs. Gallagher.\n\nPlease let me have a reply by airmail.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

McGuinness as teacher and field matron respectively on the Sliammon Indian Reserve. Consequently no further payment of salary should be made to Mr. McGuinness. I understand though that Mrs. McGuinness will not leave the Reserve until September 30, 1940, and consequently she should receive salary to that date.\n\nIt has been decided to transfer Mr. D.J. Gallagher from the Homalo Indian Day School to the Sliammon Indian Day School. His appointment at Sliammon will be effective from October 1, 1940, and the school will be in operation to June 30, 1940.

Gallagher, teacher at Homalco Indian Day school, Churchouse, B.C.\n\nI wish to call attention to Mr. Gallagher's splendid work since he has been teacher at this school, and also to his practical patriotism at this time.\n\nHe says: \"Irrespective of salary for September, I shall be here for that month\"\n\nF. J. C. Ball.\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nIt has sometimes been my unpleasant duty to report adversely in the matter of teaching at our Indian schools, but I now wish to report to the Department upon the excellent work which has been done during the past year by Mr. J. Gallagher, teacher at Homalo Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Gallagher has had wide teaching experience, as he has taught at public high schools, but not always does this experience count so much when teaching Indians in the lower grades. The attendance of Homalo School has jumped from about five or six to twenty-five or twenty-eight, which is 100% attendance on the Reserve. The pupils are bright, alert, extremely clean, and well-behaved, and the progress they have made under Mr. Gallagher is amazing. Immediately upon entering the school room, one notices the obedience the pupils have in the teacher and the kindness of his attitude towards the pupils, but discipline is perfect. Mr. Gallagher informs me he has never yet had to punish a pupil. His theory, as told to me, is that each pupil has a head and a heart, and although he may sometimes miss the head and have no scholastic success, he has never failed in his aim at the heart to win the regard of his pupils.\n\nMrs. Gallagher is field matron, and also has had teaching experience. Homalo is a rather isolated Reserve; their only contact outside being a weekly boat and on account of his experience in high schools, we may not be able to hold him long, which will be an irreparable loss to Homalo.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.W.

Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:\n\nThe new field matron of Homalo Reserve, Mrs. D.J. Gallagher, has reported a number of repairs needed at the residence. These repairs were found to be required on her arrival to take over the residence in January last.\n\nI have obtained a report from the only person anywhere within 50 miles who is able to do this work, Mr. J.J. Parrish, and the following is his report:\n\n\"The 1\u00bd\" waste pipe from the bath is broken underground, and the discharge is running onto the garden. The cold water tap in the sink is broken and they are unable to use same. The sink waste trap is also broken and pipes plugged. The waste pipe from the wash basin in the surgery has been cut off half way up the outside wall allowing waste water to run down the wall and around the foundation of the house. It will be necessary to take up the ground pipe and clean out and make new connections. Following is a list of fittings required:\n\n3 only 1\u00bd\" pipe couplings galv.\n1 length 1\u00bd\" galv. pipe\n2 only 1\" galv. pipe elbows\n1 only \u00be\" cold water tap\n1 only 1\u00bd\" cast iron sink trap with waste to wall complete with sink collar and gasket.\n\nHe has offered to do the work for \u00a330.00, including travel from Stuart Island to Church House. The material would cost approximately \u00a318.00 delivered at Church House, making a total of about \u00a348.00.\n\nAs these repairs are very necessary, I respectfully request approval of the work being done.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Phillips, former teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School. Indian Commissioner MacKay forwarded your letter of April 18 to the Department and recommended that Mr. and Mrs. Phillips be paid salary for the first half of April. Following out this recommendation the amount due Mr. Phillips is $44.17 and the amount due Mrs. Phillips is $18.50.\n\nAs cheques are issued monthly it was not possible to withhold the March quarter cheques as they had been sent previous to the receipt of your telegram of April 26.\n\nThis Branch has no authority to issue Mr. and Mrs. Phillips a cheque in favour of anyone but themselves. However, I am enclosing the two cheques mentioned above and you should arrange to have them endorse these cheques and you can then refund the $45.00 to the Chief and pay them the balance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Hall,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nThe recent appointments to Homalco are Mr. and Mrs. C. O. Daly, who are transferred from another agency. They are quite evidently disgruntled by this transfer, but I have been given absolutely no information whatever about them, and in fact, my first advice of their arrival at Homalco was from an Indian in this agency.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C. Bell]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nB/AL\nDear Sir,\n\nI regret that it is necessary to protest against the manner in which this office is ignored completely in the matter of appointments to day-schools in this agency. A previous appointment was made to Silsillon Day School; and within a short time the teacher was forced to resign because of his actions in connection with some young Indian girls on the Reserve. In the last appointment to Homalco, the teacher proved to be a thief and a rogue. Recently, I hear from the Indians that Mr. and Mrs. Daly have arrived at Homalco to take over the school. In these isolated places, the teacher and field matron are people who can either cause embarrassing situations to the Department, or be of great assistance, according to the type of person employed.\n\nAt Homalco, the teacher was incurring all kinds of expenses, chargeable to the Department, in addition to straight theft from Indians and others. I believe that the Indian Agent, as senior official in the agency, is held accountable for what occurs in the agency. Therefore, he should be consulted, or at least advised, as to the kind of people with whom he is expected to work.\n\nIn the case of Homalco, referred to above, in addition to the dishonest activities of the teacher, the field matron ran wild in the granting of relief, etc., to Indians, which was absolutely unnecessary. The present incumbents at Silsillon, Mr. and Mrs. Gallagher, are an exceptional fine couple, and I do not see why the same type of people cannot be employed elsewhere. Of course the school inspector is responsible for the academic training; but the agent, who is not consulted about the appointments, is responsible for them otherwise.\n\nUnless much more care is taken in these appointments in future, the Department may receive adverse publicity by the actions of such employees. I would like to say that it was not an easy matter to prevent publicity in both the cases mentioned above.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 8, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of a letter which has just been received from Indian Agent Hall, also a copy of our reply.\n\nIn connection with the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Daly at the Homalco School I would refer you to official letter of June 2 last.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 6, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to the appointment of teachers at the day schools in your Agency. I am forwarding a copy of your letter to Indian Commissioner MacKay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSeptember 12th 1941.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAs requested I have read with care Mr. Indian Agent Ball's letter of August 26th last a copy of which was forwarded to you with Departmental letter 167-35-1 of the 8th instant.\n\nWith special reference to the first paragraph of Mr. Ball's letter the teacher to whom he refers must be Mr. P.J.A. McGuinness. This teacher was appointed to the Indian day school at Sliammon on the nomination of His Excellency Archbishop Luke. The appointment was of a temporary nature as explained in Departmental letter 167-24-1 of September 1st 1938.\n\nThough Mr. McGuinness had no professional qualifications I did not object to his nomination as Mr. Indian Agent Ball asked me to consider the fact that his wife was a good nurse and he wanted her at Sliammon, see his letter of September 2nd 1938 to the Department.\n\nMr. McGuinness resigned his teaching position at Sliammon on September 1st 1940 to join the Canadian Active Service Forces, his letter to this effect being forwarded to you by Mr. Indian Agent Ball under date of September 6th 1940.\n\nThe teacher referred to in the second paragraph of Mr. Ball's letter was Mr. Phillips who was nominated by His Excellency Archbishop Luke on October 13th 1940, and recommended to the Department in your letter 15/14/8377 of October 19th 1940, and later appointed by Departmental letter 167-35-1 of October 26th 1940. You will note that I was absent at that time and did not see Mr. Phillips at the time you recommended their appointment to the Department.\n\nThere is considerable difficulty in obtaining the qualified teachers sought to fill vacancies in Indian day schools, and from time to time those with satisfactory academic qualifications but without Normal School training have been appointed.\nThe present Departmental policy of having the various Church authorities nominate candidates to fill vacant teaching positions in general works quite well provided the nomination is sent to the Department through your office. For in this case certain records only open to Inspectors of schools may be consulted. It is possible for instance for me to obtain from the Registrar of the Department of Education, Victoria an accurate record of the particular candidates work while at Normal School, and also to see the teacher's reports as filed by Provincial Inspectors at the Parliament Buildings, Victoria. In other cases I can and do consult Provincial Inspectors directly.\n\nNone of this could be done by an Indian Agent, and no other Indian Agent as far as I know has suggested that he be consulted before the Department makes appointments since I was appointed Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nWhen delay occurs even in forwarding the nominations candidates accept other appointments and when the appointment is made by the Department and the teacher is advised the position is declined, which means that we have again to ask for nominations. Were it decided that Indian Agents should also be consulted it would simply be impossible to fill vacancies, at least with Normal trained teachers.\n\nI do not think it necessary to go into detail into the reasons for the transfer of Mr. C.O. Daly from the Skawah Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency to the Homalco Indian Day School, Vancouver Agency.\n\nThe actual transfer of Mr. Daly was approved in Departmental letter 156-2-1 of June 2nd 1941. Your own letter to Mr. Daly 13/9/41 informing him of the Department's decision is dated June 4th last and copies of this letter were sent to Mr. Indian Agent Daunt and to Mr. Indian Agent Ball.\n\nThe suggestion made by Mr. Ball in the last paragraph of his letter of August 28th 1941 to the Department that he was not informed of the Department's decision is negatived by the records on our files.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa,\nOctober 2, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of August 26 regarding the appointment of teachers at the day schools in your Agency, and particularly to the last paragraph of your letter which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"My first advice of their arrival at Homalco was from an Indian in this Agency.\"\n\nI am now advised that you were forwarded a letter on June 4, 1941, which definitely stated that Mr. Daly was being transferred to the Homalco School. It is further pointed out that Mr. Daly called at your office on one or two occasions prior to his departure to take up duties at Homalco.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of September 8th forwarding a copy of Mr. Indian Agent Ball's letter of August 26th last, together with a copy of the Department's reply thereto.\n\nFollowing receipt of this correspondence, I endeavored to explain to Mr. Ball the existing procedure in connection with the nomination of teachers for our Indian Day Schools and pointed out to him that in the case of the appointments of Mr. Phillips and Mr. McGuinness he had been advised before these teachers took over their duties, of the action taken by this office.\n\nMr. Ball was also informed of the appointment of Mr. Daly to the Homalco Indian Day School, a copy of my letter to Mr. Daly of June 4th informing him of the Department's decision being supplied to Mr. Ball. Mr. Daly also called at Mr. Ball's office on one or two occasions prior to his departure to take up his duties at Homalco.\n\nI should think that Mr. Ball's main objection to the existing policy is that he is not consulted in connection with the nomination of teachers. To consult our Agents in connection with the nominations submitted through here could not be helpful in any way and would only delay and complicate matters. As Inspector Barry points out in his letter to me on the subject dated September 13th a copy of which is attached, the present Departmental policy of having the various church authorities nominate candidates to fill vacant teaching positions, in general, works quite well provided the nomination is sent to the Department through the office of the Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary\n\nSeptember 25, 1941.\n\nMr. Daly was called to this office on August 6th and informed that his retention as teacher of an Indian Day School would depend on the work accomplished during the academic year 1941-42 and that the Department expected and would insist on considerable improvement in this respect and in other directions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n/GR\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo regarding the appointment of teachers in day schools in this Agency. I do not make statements to the Department which are not in accordance with facts, and would appreciate a copy of your letter of June 4th 1941 referred to.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner advises me that all these appointments are now made by the various Church authorities. I was not previously aware of this change of policy. Formerly the name of the teacher selected by the Department was sent to the church authorities for approval of the applicant's religious qualifications.\n\nI had intended to give you a detailed report on the two teachers previously appointed by the new method, which would have surprised you and would certainly have caused considerable embarrassment to the Department had the facts been made public, but there would be no point to it now if these teachers are not appointed by you.\n\nMr. Daly called here once to say that he and another man were going to Churchouse to see what kind of a place it is. That was the only time I had seen him until last week when I visited Homalco Reserve and met him again, and Mrs. Daly for the first time. They will be given every assistance and co-operation and do not appear to be people who will make any difficulties for the Department, but they are most disconsolate by reason of their transfer to Homalco. I have not been told the reason for this transfer, but it was apparently not at their own request, and I hope they will make a success of their work there.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(F.J.C. Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nOctober 17, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant with reference to the appointment of teachers in day schools in the Vancouver Agency. With reference to the first paragraph of your letter, I understand that Indian Commissioner MacKay wrote a letter to Mr. Daly on June 4 and that a copy of this letter was forwarded to your office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nre: File No.167-33-1\n\nI beg to return herewith cheque No.2227 in favour of William Phillips for $26.37, also the slip which accompanied it. Mr. Phillips has never shown up here, as he knows there are considerable debts against him.\n\nThe principal one is for $48.00 owing Johnson Wilson, Indian of the Homalco Band. When Phillips left Homalco School rather suddenly, he \"bought\" a boat from Johnson Wilson and stated that he intended selling insurance from the boat, and would pay him for it shortly. Instead of doing this, he came directly to Vancouver and sold the boat to a white man, and paid Johnson Wilson nothing.\n\nAs we are getting near the end of the fiscal year, I thought it would be advisable to return the cheque at this time. If there is any way in which it could be applied on the Indian's account, I know it would be greatly appreciated, as all trace of the boat has now been lost. I might add that this is only one of the many shady transactions by Phillips.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nMay 22, 1941.\n\nThe Chief Treasury Officer,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:-\n\nWe enclose herewith cheques in favour of the undermentioned persons, being refund of Retirement Fund accounts.\n\n| Your letter | Cheque No. | In favour of | Amount | District         |\n|-------------|------------|--------------|--------|------------------|\n| May 3, 1941 | 2227       | Wm.

Ball, VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nOn the 19th I left with two Constables of the R.C.M.P. by launch for the northern part of the Agency, which I have not visited for three months on account of expense. During two days of this trip we took Miss Gerry, travelling nurse, to various Reserves where she did tuberculin tests. The Day School at Homalco was visited, but being Saturday, School was closed. The teacher and field matron, Mr. and Mrs. Daly, are apparently making the best of it, although they do not like the isolation; We found the Indians elated at the idea that they would not have Japanese competition this year at the fishing grounds, and many Indians are trying to buy Japanese boats. It would be a splendid idea to purchase some of these boats, if funds could be found, and allow the Indians to pay for them from fishing.\n\nFred J.C.

Mac Jones,\nSec.-Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the following facts:\n\nMy February cheque was for $11.10 instead of the usual monthly amount of $27.75, a reduction of $16.65 for that month. I reported this matter to F.J.C. Bell, Esq., Indian Agent, Vancouver, and asked if he could explain the reduction. He replied that he knew nothing about it but that he had sent my letter to the Dept. at Ottawa. Since then I have had neither acknowledgment nor reply.\n\nA few days ago I received my May cheque and was astonished to find it was only $5.75\u2014a reduction of $22.00 making a total reduction of $38.65 since February. I am naturally mystified over all this and would feel thankful for an explanation.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs) C.W. Daly.\nWm. C. O.

Gill, Esq.,\nDirector - Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you please inform me whether the appended paragraph taken from your circular letter of 15th Oct. concerning tax deductions at the source, means that besides the duplicate forms of T.D.I.A. which I enclose I am required to file with you another T.D.I.A. form before 1st January, 1945.\n\nI also beg to call your attention to the fact that since the closing of the post office here some months ago and the substitution instead of a string-bag weekly mail service our address now is Church House, via Vancouver, B.C. and that the post office authorities have asked me to notify all my correspondents of this change in the form of address.\n\nYour truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAttention is particularly directed that the relief given by reason of the filing of this form shall not extend beyond the calendar year in which the form is filed, and, unless a new declaration is filed in advance of the 1st of January in the following year, deductions will be made in accordance with the table of income tax deductions.\nOttawa, September 25, 1944.\n\nEXD.\n\nMr. F.J. Ball, Indian Agent, 416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, inclosing a letter from Mr. C.O. Daly regarding articles stolen from his residence during the summer holidays.\n\nAs you intimated in your letter the Department can not assume any responsibility, consequently we are not in a position to recompense him for any loss that he has suffered.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI have been requested by Mr. C.O. Daly, teacher at Homalco Indian Day School, Churchouse, B.C., to send the enclosed letter to you. I have already advised Mr. Daly that we are not responsible for the individual acts of Indians, but he appears to think we are liable in this matter.\n\nThe School was closed as usual for the summer holidays last year and the Dalys left for Vancouver, the robbery being discovered on their return to Churchouse for the re-opening of school in September. This is a most isolated place, and few Indians are around the Reserve in the summer. One Indian admitted stealing some groceries, but denied stealing anything else. After he broke in, it was easy for anyone to walk into the house and the police made every effort to trace the property which Mr. Daly says was stolen, but without success in recovering any of it. As the school had been broken into in other years, although nothing was taken, I was surprised when Mr. Daly said they had left jewellery, etc. lying in the school for two months. It seems incredible that such articles as watches, bracelets, medals, etc. were not taken with them when they left Churchouse on their holidays. It is quite possible that white men could have entered the school and the police had one under observation because of his reputation and proximity to the School.\n\nMr. Daly was not insured against theft. He has had a lot of trouble with the Chief and some of the other Indians and consequently they will not co-operate in trying to locate any of the stuff allegedly stolen. Will you please advise what can be done in this matter, as I feel sure that the Department will not accept responsibility?\n\nB/DH.\nEnclos.\n\nIndian Agent.\nHomalo Indian Day School,\nChurch House, B.C.\n11th Sept. 1944\n\nJ.J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ball,\n\nI hereby make application through you to the Dept. of Indian Affairs for $157.00 as compensation for property, as listed, stolen from me by local Indians who broke into the teacherage during my absence on holidays last year.\n\nAs you are aware an Indian named Walter Hackett admitted breaking into the house and stealing groceries and that he received a sentence of two years for that offence. Hackett swore in court on three occasions that three Frances boys - Marshall, William and Wilson - broke windows and locked doors and entered and ransacked the house with him, breaking open locked trunks, drawers and closets and scattering the contents on the floor. Notwithstanding Hackett's sworn testimony and the fact that a pair of stolen pillow slips were found by the police in the possession of Marshall Frances and his father.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6393, File 815-1, part 2)\nGeorge Francis, all escaped conviction owing to the lack of corroboratory evidence. That they were guilty, nevertheless, neither the police nor their Indian neighbours have any doubt. And neither have I.\n\nThe enclosed list does not contain the full amount of our loss as, from time to time, after it had been delivered to the police we found other articles to be missing, namely, a watch, a pair of fur-trimmed kid gloves, a shaving mirror, an enamel toilet set, paint brushes and two bottles of perfume. Besides all the three large trunks were irreparably damaged by having the locks forcibly wrenched off them. All in all the sum of $157.00 which I am claiming as compensation for my loss is a very conservative estimate and therefore, I trust that you will endeavour to recover that amount for me from the Indian Dept.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are quarrels between the teacher, Mr. Daly and the Indians, usually the Chief, and a charge, later withdrawn, had been laid by the teacher against the Chief. Mr. Daly, his wife and sister-in-law are all elderly people and this is not a good place for people of that age as it is too isolated.\n\nFred J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 13, 1942.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the payments made to you in February and May.\n\nThe deduction in February was due to the fact that in September last you were paid at your former rate of $40.00 a month instead of $35.00 a month.\n\nThe deduction in May was due to the fact that we had been allowing you the cost-of-living bonus. This was a mistake on our part, as the regulations governing the payment of the cost-of-living bonus provide that where the husband is being paid the bonus and his wife is also employed by the Government she is not entitled to receive bonus. I hope the following statement will explain the matter fully to you:\n\nSeptember salary paid at former rate plus cost-of-living bonus ............ $ 44.40\n\nCorrect salary of $35.00 a month with cost-of-living bonus added would amount to ......................... $7.75\n\nOverpayment $ 16.65\n\nThis amount was deducted from $7.75 in the month of February, leaving a balance of $11.10 which was sent to you. As stated above, it was not until May that it was noted that you could not be allowed\n\nMrs. C.O. Daly,\nHomalo Indian Reserve,\nChurch House, B.C.\nbonus according to the regulations and consequently in that month we deducted the seven months' bonus at $5.75 a month ($19.25) from your salary of $25.00, leaving a balance due of $5.75.\n\nI understand from the Treasury Branch that the matter of your salary has now been fully adjusted and in future you will receive your salary of $25.00 a month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Neary's letter of July 18, 1947, concerning the classification of Mrs. Culton as Teacher, Indian Welfare, at the above mentioned school.\n\nThis school is quite isolated and difficult for the Agent to visit frequently. There is no question that the teacher at this school should be given the classification, providing she has the required personality. Mrs. Culton is a very formidable character, which seemed to give rise to considerable difficulty at Seabird Island. However, she has apparently avoided antagonizing the Indians at Homalco, and the Acting Chief spoke very highly of her work on the occasion of my visit in April.\n\nI recommend that she be given the classification of Teacher, Indian Welfare.\n\nR.F.

Culton.\n\nAttached to this is a covering letter from Mr. Indian Agent Taylor. You will note that Mrs. Culton requests classification as a Grade II teacher at a salary of $1,740.00. As she is entitled only to a salary of $1,560.00, it is presumed that she is requesting classification as a welfare teacher.\n\nIn view of Inspector Davey's comments in his report of April 10, 1947, and your past experience with Mrs. Culton, we would appreciate your comments upon this application for classification as a welfare teacher.\n\nBernard F.

Her salary rate at Seabird Island was $90.00 plus bonus and with the basic salary and bonuses consolidated, it means that she was paid to the end of December at the rate of $112.00 a month. However, the salary paid at Homalco to the former teacher was at the rate of $125.00 per month (consolidation of basic salary of $100.00 and bonus).\n\nWe have found from experience that when a teacher is transferred to a school at which a higher salary has been paid than at the school from which the teacher came, there is always a great objection, if we do not allow the increase. We therefore, have placed her name on the pay list effective January 1st, 1947, at a salary of $125.00 a month.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Indian Agent Strang, has advised that Mrs. Oulton did not open Seabird Island Indian Day School after the Christmas holidays on account of illness, and Mr. Taylor has advised that she assumed her duties at Homalco, on January 22nd.\n\nIt is presumed that her service will be considered as continuous in view of her illness, and the expense and time involved in her transfer. We may say that underdate of February 11th, Mrs. Oulton advised me that her salary rate had not been changed since her transfer, but it is presumed that an adjustment will be made.\n\nD. M.

Daly as teacher and his wife as field matron at Homalco Reserve in the Vancouver Agency, and would recommend acceptance of same.\n\nWith reference to the proposal of Mr. Ball to employ Mr. F. Grist, former teacher of this Department, I would advise that I have no knowledge as to whether he is prepared to accept a position with this Department and am asking His Excellency Archbishop Duke to nominate a teacher for the position.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nKT\nEnc.\nIndian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nre: Homalco Indian Day School\n\nI enclose herewith the resignations of Mr. and Mrs. C.O. Daly, teacher and field matron respectively of the above Day School, Church House, B.C.\n\nThese elderly people have not been happy at this isolated and rugged place, and I am surprised that they have stayed so long. Under the circumstances, there has not been much improvement at the School and I recommend that their resignations be accepted. Mr. Daly informs me that he will teach Latin and Mathematics at a private school - he had no scope for these subjects at Homalco.\n\nThe Homalco Indians are a truculent, quarrelsome and drunken Band. They are rather remote from supervision either by myself or the police, and this adds to the unpleasantness of existence there.\n\nAbout 20 years ago we employed a man as teacher under similar conditions and he greatly improved the Indians by precept and example. His name is Frank Grist, who is at present in the Veteran's Guard of Canada. If he could be employed at Homalco, it would be a splendid thing for the Indians and the administration of the Reserve. Grist is a fine man of undoubted integrity and does not mind isolation. Evidently he is appreciated in his Unit as he has been promoted to Warrant Officer. He is unmarried, but we could get along without a field matron, as he is a good first aid man and taught at Osyoos and other Indian Day Schools. I have not contacted him of course until I hear from you. He is a Roman Catholic as are the Homalco Indians.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nHomalo Indian Reserve,\nChurch House, B.C.\n31st August, 1945\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n6th Federal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ball,\n\nI hereby tender you my resignation as teacher of the Homalo Indian Day School, said resignation to become effective on 30th Sept., 1945. I gladly avail of this opportunity to thank you for the many kindnesses, sympathetic consideration and support that you uniformly extended to my wife and myself during the four years of our service under you at Church House.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Daly, Esq.,\nHemalco Indian Day School,\nChurch House\nvia Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of December 26 enclosing T.D.LA income tax form claiming exemption of income tax deductions at the source for the year 1945.\n\nIn connection with the deductions made at the source from your salary during the year 1944, I did not mean to convey that you were not entitled to a refund of the tax. You will, however, have to claim the refund direct from the Inspector of Income Tax for your district when you submit your income tax return for 1944 in the same manner as you did for 1943.\n\nI trust the above is satisfactory.\n\nL.W. McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nOttawa, December 9, 1944.\n\nC.O.Daly, Esq.,\nHemalee Indian Day School,\nChurch House via Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYour letter of November 23, addressed to Dr. H.W.McGill, Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, has been transferred to this office for reply and attention.\n\nWith reference to our circular letter of October 13, I wish to advise that the purpose of the circular letter was to inform all employees that Form T.D.IA, tax exemption claim, was available. It is necessary for an employee in this category to file a T.D.IA form prior to January 1 for the purpose of securing exemption from tax deduction for that year, beginning January 1. If an employee remains in this category, a form must be filed each year prior to January 1.\n\nThe form you submitted was apparently for the year 1944, and, as salary has been paid and deductions made on account of income tax, it is impossible to take any action on this form. You should immediately file a T.D.IA showing the estimate of your earnings for the year 1945.\n\nL.W.McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nLWMcG/S\nAPPLICATION FOR CLASSIFICATION ON INDIAN SCHOOL TEACHER'S SALARY SCHEDULE\n\nI.

Boyle, Teacher of the Komakoo Indian Day School.\n\nI wish to state, for your information, that salaries of Indian day school teachers have, for years, been paid once every quarter. Until recently, the Department of Indian Affairs made four equal payments during the year to this class of employees. This method of payment was found most unsatisfactory and payments are now made quarterly, but on the basis of the number of teaching months in each quarter. It is realized that this method may cause financial inconvenience in the fall of each year, as there is but one teaching month in the September quarter. To obviate this difficulty for teachers as much as possible, it is the Department's practice to make advances in November or December on the employees' earnings for the December quarter.\n\nRelative to the payments to Miss Boyle, I have to inform you that she receives a salary of $700 for the ten teaching months, plus a bonus of $15 a teaching month. Payments are made during the academic year as follows: End of September, $70 and $15 bonus; end of December, March and June, $210 and $45 bonus.\n\nPayment of Miss Boyle's September quarter salary, of $70 and $15 bonus, was delayed because of an error in the Indian office in Vancouver and her cheque was not directed to her until the 3rd of December. The Department of Indian Affairs, realizing that this teacher would be financially embarrassed, sent her on the same date an advance of $100 against her December quarter's earnings. Miss Boyle had therefore, before the Christmas season, a payment of $185.\n\nI trust this explanation will convince you that the Department is considerate in its dealings with Indian day school teachers and I have to add, for your information, that Miss Boyle's relations with the Department have been most pleasant.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nJohn MacDiarmid, Esq.,\nDominion Hotel,\nVictoria, B.

Hedley Garland are being dispensed with from the end of the present month and at that time there will be a balance of salary due him of $135.00. We have had a communication from the Bank of Commerce here about a claim of their Vancouver Branch against Mr. Garland. The amount was not stated.\n\nWe cannot pay any portion of Mr. Garland's salary without a proper power of attorney but I will withhold the amount due him for a while if you care to endeavour to obtain his authority for payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Manager,\nBank of Hamilton,\nPrincess St., Branch,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMemorandum:-\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nRelative to the attached letter from the Manager of the Bank of Hamilton, Winnipeg, with reference to an amount of $66.51 due the bank by A. Hedley Garland, teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School, Church House, B.C., I beg to say that Mr. Garland has been the teacher at this school since May 1st, 1926. Recently, an investigation was held by Mr. Inspector Ditchburn into complaints made by the Indians regarding his conduct. His services are being dispensed with from the end of the present month. There will be a balance of salary due him at that time of $135. The Bank should obtain an order or a power of attorney from Mr. Garland and payment to them of the amount due could then be made.\n\nMr. Paget had a phone message yesterday from the Manager of the Bank of Commerce here relative to a claim of their Vancouver Branch against Mr. Garland and requesting that the amount due be withheld from his salary. The amount of this claim was not stated. We could withhold payment of Mr. Garland's salary until the Bank of Hamilton has time to obtain an order from Mr. Garland for the payment of the balance due him on salary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The application of Mr. and Mrs. Becher, together with the testimonials which you enclosed in your letter, was also received. It is noted that their appointment meets with the approval of Rev. John Belsh, C.M.I., also Mr. Inspector Cline and yourself. While Mr. Becher has no professional qualifications, the Department will, in view of the recommendations mentioned, approve of his temporary appointment as teacher, also that of Mrs. Becher as field worker, from the 1st of September, next, their continuance in the work to depend upon the success which they achieve.\n\nMr. Becher will be allowed salary as teacher at the rate of $35 per teaching month, payable quarterly. The salary allowed in the case of Mrs. Becher, who is to perform field worker's duties, will be at the rate of $450 per annum. This will be payable monthly upon receipt of your monthly pay list.\n\nPlease inform Mr. and Mrs. Becher of the approval granted for their temporary appointment, and arrange with them to take up duties on the date above mentioned. It is hoped that they will meet with every success in their work at Hanaloa. Should they not be able to make satisfactory progress after a period of six months' trial, the Department would then consider the question of the closing of the school and sending the children to residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

It is noted that the school was open for only 42 days during the quarter. As there were 65 school days in that quarter, you will note that the school was closed for 23 days, or practically one month. Please advise why the school was closed for such a considerable period during the quarter and, also, state how much you consider the teacher should be allowed for the period he taught the school during the June quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The closing of the school appears at present as the only alternative to the continuance of the arrangements at present obtaining. The Indians must leave the village to work, as there is nothing for them to do at their village. They are at home, however, a great deal in the winter.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Becher's salary be paid for the full quarter, he having been on duty during the period and available to the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C.

We got a man working with me that time, and the school house was all built and I wrote to Mr. J. D.

We you have to tell Mr. Byrne to settle this up for this Christmas some of the fellows of are working when the school house was built asking me if I received any money at Ottawa.\n\nWish you a Merry Xmas and prosperous New Year, all of my family say Merry Christmas to you.\n\nWish you will settle this up for me.\n\nChief George Harry.\nOttawa, December 31st., 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to transmit herewith extract from a letter of the 24th December, which was addressed by Chief George Harry, to Mr. Bury, of this Department.

It should be thoroughly scraped and cleaned and the brickwork repointed. As it now stands there is an ever present danger of fire breaking out and demolishing the building.\n\nWilliam Marsden,\nTeacher.\nOTTAWA, July 24th, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe teacher of the Homalco Indian Day School, in his report for the June quarter, draws the attention of the Department to the need of wire screens for at least 6 windows of the school building, in order to prevent them from being constantly broken during the games played on the village playground. He also states that the chimney of the school building is in a very bad condition, and recommends that it be thoroughly cleaned and the brickwork repointed, in order to prevent fire.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will arrange to have wire screens placed on the windows of the school building facing the playground. You may also arrange to have the chimney cleaned and the brickwork repointed.\n\nThe above work should be carried out at the lowest possible expenditure. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenses incurred.\n\nThese matters should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Building covered with tar paper and shingled-shingles to have creosote stain.\n2. New floor in school-room.\n3. New steps to front porch.\n4. The present living room being too small, partition moved back three feet into school-room.\n5. Small cupboard off kitchen, as at present no provision made for storing food stuffs etc.\n6. New brick chimney, as present one is inadequate to carry smoke from existing flues.\n\nI would also respectfully recommend that the above work be completed at once, as it will be more economical, otherwise, in my opinion, teacher's cottage should be erected, it being almost impossible to keep the present building warm, the weather at this particular place being very cold for, at least five months in the year. Also that the material be purchased by the Department and a competent carpenter engaged to perform the work on the building.\n\nThe Indians are willing that the total cost be charged to the trust account held by the Department at Ottawa, it was impossible to obtain a petition signed by the majority of the members, as they are nearly all away working in the logging camps.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.

(RG 10, Volume 6394, File 815-5, part 1)\nOttawa, August 25, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, reporting on the repairs required to the Homalco Indian Day School and Teacher's Residence.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the repairs as mentioned by you being carried out. It will be necessary to purchase the material needed, after competitive prices have been first obtained. The material should be purchased from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nArrangements should be made with a competent carpenter to do the work, and you will be good enough to see that all these repairs are carried out at the lowest possible cost. You may arrange to have the building covered with tar paper and shingles so that shingles to have creosote stain. A new floor should be placed in the schoolroom and new steps made to the front porch. The partition in the living room may be moved back 3 ft. in order to provide more accommodation in the teacher's living room. A small cupboard may be built in the kitchen to provide storage room for foodstuffs, etc., and a new brick chimney may be built.\n\nThe Department will expect that all the above work will be satisfactorily performed and that no undue expenditure will be incurred. When completed, properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded, covering the expenditure, to which should be attached a memo showing the names of the firms asked to quote on the materials used and the prices quoted. It may be that the teacher can give you assistance in having these repairs carried out.\n\nIt is noted that the Indians are willing to have the total cost of the work charged to the funds at their credit in the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sowrey, drew attention to the condition of the interior of the building. It badly needs repairing and painting in places. Mr. Sowrey said he would be pleased to do the work without cost to the Department for labour, as it would be part of the manual training he is giving the pupils. The paint and a brush or two would cost approximately $20.00 and the lumber, nails, etc., a further $15.00, $35.00 in all.\n\nMr. Sowrey has done a lot of work already, having built a good cabinet for the dispensary, cupboards for the school material, repaired the roof and also the drain-pipes and wood-shed. He says this occupation helps pass the time in their isolation at this cheerless spot.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Sowrey live on the reserve and there is no other white population and no roads out of the place and it is pleasing to see the way they are both working there. Mrs. Sowrey is a graduate nurse, having served overseas during the War, and is invaluable as field matron, taking her work very seriously, and already well-known among both whites and Indians alike for many miles around the Coast, where there is no doctor and her services are in constant demand.\n\nI held a meeting of this Band when ninety-three Indians of all ages were in a room 30'x20' for over three hours and I remarked afterwards on the entire and unusual absence of odour in such confined space. I learned afterwards that the field matron had persuaded this Band to bathe daily. I think this is most commendable.\n\nI am well aware of all the demands being made upon the Department by the schools and hope this will not prevent this school from being given these necessary repairs.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nR/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that the teacher will carry out the work in the repairing and painting required without cost to the Department for his labour.\n\nYou should forward an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the materials.

However, Mr. Sowrey, the school teacher reported that the cream shell gloss was not suitable as it was a varnish paint and not heavy enough to cover up the many stains on the wall and had no effect on the gyproc boards. Messrs. Brandram-Henderson were requested to exchange it for a different kind of paint and the enclosed voucher represents the small difference in the price of the paint and freight charges.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOffice of the Vancouver Indian Agency,\n\nVancouver, B.C., May 23, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 6318, amounting to $4.00 in favour of Mr. W.M.

The material will cost very little and is as follows:\n\nOne section of pipe,\nBitumen paint for uncovered portion of pipe,\nNew trap at intake (wire netting 10\" x 3'6\" and staples),\nAlso a galvanized chimney pipe and cowl 10\" diameter 2'6\" high.\n\nThe teacher, Mr. W.H. Sowrey, advises me that if no other labour is available, he will do the work himself, gratis.\n\nThe cost plus freight on the material should not exceed \u00a325.00.\n\nMr. Sowrey has done a great deal of repair work on this building and takes a genuine interest in improving it.\n\nHomalo Reserve is an isolated and rather desolate spot and in the past we have been very unfortunate in the type of teacher employed there. The Department's selection of Mr. Sowrey for the position has proved a particularly successful one from all angles.\n\nIn the past we have paid substantial accounts for a plumber to go there to do the simplest jobs on this building, the boat hire being usually higher than the wages and material. As Mr. Sowrey is also unmeasurably superior to any teacher we have had in the past as regards his teaching qualifications and his wife is a trained war-time nurse doing excellent work as field matron, the Homalo Indians are unusually fortunate.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Fred J.

The account should show the number of hours and the rate per hour.\n\nThe Department is inclined to feel that the charge of $4.00 is rather high, especially as the teacher is made an allowance for janitor services and the cleaning of the chimneys might properly be considered part of the janitor's duties. You might consider this account further and, if you think that the teacher is entitled to some extra remuneration for this service, another voucher may be forwarded for our consideration.

I have written to Mr. Sowrey, the teacher and enclose herewith a copy of his reply. Mr. Sowrey has done a considerable amount of work around the school and residence for which he has sent in no account, and I would not wish to impose upon him by expecting him to clean the chimneys, as this is scarcely a job which comes within the janitor services.\n\nPrevious to Mr. Sowrey taking over the school, this work was done every quarter, but the chimneys have only been cleaned once during the past year. I trust that the information contained in Mr. Sowrey's letter is satisfactory and the account can now be paid.

I did not time them, but they started in about 9:00 a.m and finished at 1:00 p.m.\n\nAs Francis and Simon are both out and will not be in until the fall, I cannot get a receipt until that time.\n\nWill you please advise me what to do.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) Walter W.H.

It might be advisable for you to consult the wife of the teacher concerning the articles required. You may then arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the approved list. Please obtain an itemised account, in triplicate, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. If possible, this account should reach the Department before our books close at the end of the present fiscal year, viz.: March 31st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nYour File 167-33-5.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder date of October 12, 1932, the Department authorized the supplying of a small quantity of sewing and knitting material for Homalco Day School.\n\nMrs. K.M. Sowrey, Field Matron and wife of the teacher there, is keenly interested in the girls at the school and voluntarily instructs them in domestic science, during the hours when the boys are at manual training.\n\nGood use was made of the material supplied fourteen months ago and a further supply is needed of some articles, as follows:- sewing cotton, needles, wool, crochet needles, crocheting thread and sewing material, quantities depending upon the amount authorized by the Department. Mrs. Sowrey uses her own sewing machine for instruction purposes although personally I think it would be only fair to supply one. However, no request has been made for it so I leave that point to the discretion of the Department. Twenty Dollars would be sufficient material to carry on with for another year and I hear that uniform dresses for the pupils are to be made if the material is supplied. This is done in the residential school at Sechelt and the pupils appreciate having these uniform dresses.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.

This is not intended to provide for the plumbing, as the Department is not aware how the plumbing work is to be done, nor how much it would cost to have a plumber come to Homalco to do it. A supplementary requisition for this purpose may be issued on your report that there is a man available at Homalco, which seems doubtful, or that a plumber can be brought to Homalco at a cost corresponding with the necessity. If Doctor McQuarrie can supply the two gallons of Lysol from his medical stores, it would be more economical than local purchase. Any purchase of materials should be made from approved firms, and you may allow Mr. Sowrey a reasonable wage for doing the work. This is in reply to your letter of June 1st.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nFred J. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.

He also advises that the children's toilet is in very bad condition and recommends that two separate single toilets be erected.\n\nYou may have the minor repairs done and report to the Department, giving the approximate cost of erecting two toilets.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nActing Secretary.\n\nF.J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nThe house was built on the Indian Reserve during the winter of 1917-18. The foundations appear to be in good condition, as does the roof. There are however two small leaks in the roof, the water coming in near the chimneys, where cement flashings have crumbled. The drainage is to a septic tank. This tank is reported to smell in the spring. I believe that it should be cleaned out this Autumn. The Indian Agent has provided pipes which will take the drainage from the bath, and kitchen, direct to a small creek. It will not run into the above mentioned septic tank.\n\nThe children's toilet is in a very bad state of repair. It is falling down, and the teacher pointed out to me that it was dangerous to step into it as the floor was completely rotted away. The pit is full up and in fact the toilet can not be used in its present condition.\n\nI have to strongly recommend the construction of two separate single toilets at this school. There can be no doubt that they are urgently required, and that they should be ready for use for school opening in September, next. The teacher pointed out to me that he was quite unable to clean the present toilet. I should like to suggest that when new toilets are constructed here, padlocks be supplied, and that the toilets be kept locked except when school is in session. The field matron suggested and I agree with her that the old toilet should be burned. The pit should of course be filled in. The new toilets should be located in a fresh position a little farther from the playing field and screened by the small bushes growing there.\n1 wash-hand basin, complete with fittings and coupling for 1\u00bd\" pipe on waste,\n2 20' lengths \u00be\" galvanised iron piping,\n8' 1\u00bc\" galvanised pipe,\n14 \u00be\" 90\u00b0 galvanized elbows,\n2 \u00be\" 90\u00b0 galvanized elbows,\n2 \u00be\" galvanized \"T's\",\n12 \u00be\" pipe clamps,\n2 \u00be\" x 6\" galvanized pipe nipples,\n2 \u00be\" couplings,\n4 \u00be\" dart unions,\n2 \u00be\" to 1\" pipe bushings.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th July authorizing minor repairs to the school building as per Mr. Barry's report to you.\n\nThe necessary material is being sent up to Homalco School and to save freight I shipped at the same time enough lumber to build two toilets. The cost of roof repairs and building two toilets will be approximately $50.00 with freight, and I trust this action will be approved by you although I have not received definite authority for the latter.\n\nAll the work will be done by the manual training class under the instructions of the teacher, Mr. Sowrey, without cost for labour. I consider these small jobs much more valuable as instruction than work done in the class room as it is more in line with what they will do after they leave school. Although Mr. Barry did not report it, the school woodshed is leaking badly and needs repairing and there should be enough material left over to do that job also.\n\nRegarding the septic tank, this work can not be done at present, but will be taken up at a later date. We are not sure of the cause of the odour and on the return of the majority of the Homalco Band to Church House it will receive further attention. There is no trouble with the tank at the present time.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/HM\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo regarding the dispensary at Homalco.\n\nUpon further inquiry I find there is a plumber living at Stuart Island, about three miles from Homalco, who will do the work for $20.00 inclusive guaranteeing same to be in good order and any faults developing within a reasonable time to be done without cost to the Department.\n\nI enclose a list of articles necessary for the work, the cost being approximately $17.50 delivered to Homalco, so that the total cost would be approximately $37.50.\n\nI respectfully request your instructions as to this matter.\n\nThe remainder of your letter will be carefully followed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.

For this extra amount I believe we can do the whole improvements required, including the necessary material, as Mr. Sowrey advises me that he would do the other work without pay in order to have the dispensary put in good shape. On a recent visit I found he had built cupboards and shelves and made other furnishings, and lumber has been sent to repair the exterior and roof. Mrs. Sowrey has suggested if the amount of $20.00 referred to above can not be granted that we first put in the plumbing from the $100.00 encumbrance and then purchase as much linoleum as possible from the balance remaining, and possibly this is the better arrangement as the wash basin is badly needed.\n\nI therefore have taken the responsibility of having this work done and will not purchase any linoleum until you advise me whether the further amount required will be forth-coming.

(RG 10, Volume 6394, File 815-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nHonalo Indian Day School,\nChurch Street, O.C.,\n20th Sept., 1911\n\nDear Mr. Bell,\n\nMany thanks for information and valuable suggestions contained in your letter of the 11th and 16th inst.\n\nCampbell has been here for the first three or four days. He has shown me your letter to Louise Nelles case. Campbell says that the woman has not been living with the man, but for some considerable time, and that the case can not be considered as settled satisfactorily.\n\nRe wood for fuel.\n\nI have received two cords. It is the largest the Indians could get, but it is really very green and therefore hard to burn. We have tried it on the stove, but it does not work well. I am foreseeing difficulties with wood range and want to make it fit to cook with. I am foreseeing difficulties with wood range and want to make it fit to cook with. I am foreseeing difficulties with wood range and want to make it fit to cook with. I am foreseeing difficulties with wood range and want to make it fit to cook with.\n\nI hope it is all right. In fact the questioner for question is with the wood consumption. The eight gals applied for should last a long time as I have used only 2\u00bd gals during the five weeks. I have been able to save more. I will need more after next week. A gal. will last considerably longer than the same quantity of gas. I am wondering what the two gas lamps I have are useless unless they can be repaired. Unfortunately I brought two gas lamps here with me.\n\nRe tools.\n\nI am not requisitioning any tools for manual training, those I am calling for are those which in my opinion are indispensable to the proper upkeep of a house and grounds. Yet will probably work; why I am ordering wash basins and wash pans. The fact of the matter is that the kitchen sink and also the washing room will have to be in working order once we arrive. The whole plumbing of the house is out of order and the water at times unattractive, so much so that we have to close all the doors and let down the windows. We thought at first that some animal had died under the house but some diagnosis\u2014inspired by the plugging of the water\u2014showed the true state of affairs though not until several pounds of food and other food stuffs in the cooler were over one of the cool pots had been spoiled.\nIt is beyond me to fix this, even if I had the lumber and fittings which I have not. As it is, it is a serious menace to health. I am not going to wait for this until you visited the house, but it struck me that unless I did you would not see the need for washbasins and pans. Some of the former tenants must have experienced the bad smells because in the course of the digging I found several obsolete oil lamps which evidently had been pierced and then buried to serve as deodorants. It seems to me that a large area of soil underneath the house and outside the house on the east and south sides has been saturated with the overflow.\n\nMr. Oah and myself are very thankful for your good wishes. It will probably require an effort to settle down, but we must do so and to leave nothing undone to make our stay here as pleasant and profitable for you and for our Indian charges as it is humanly possible to make it.\n\nYour very truly,\n\nC.O. Agh.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith requisitions received from Mr. W.O. Daly, teacher at Homalco Indian Day School, who has just been transferred there from another agency. Every assistance will be given to Mr. Daly in making a success of his work there.\n\nThe first requisition is for material required at the school residence and around the building, which is badly overgrown with brush. There has been no teacher there since March.\n\nThe second requisition refers to school supplies and the third to fuel for the building. As there was very little fuel left by Mr. Daly's predecessor, I have authorized two cords, pending your approval, which I trust will be satisfactory.\n\nMr. Daly reports that the drainage system is out of order, and I enclose his letter regarding it. Apparently, this needs the services of a qualified plumber, but nobody can say what the cost will be until it has been opened up. There is no plumber anywhere near Homalco and it will be necessary to send a man there from Vancouver. It would take 4 days for a man to go there, inspect the work to be done and return to Vancouver, and I would suggest, if the work is to be done, that the man be employed to do it while he is there, rather than make two trips. However, you may wish to make some other arrangement, and I respectfully request your advice in the matter. I have had no previous complaint regarding the plumbing.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nsir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n[F.J.C.

You may arrange for purchase of the articles shown on the attached requisition. If you consider conditions are as bad as stated by Mr. Daly you may arrange to send a plumber from Vancouver to Homalco. This may involve a rather heavy expenditure and the Department will depend on you to keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J.C.

I, therefore, asked Mr.R.R.Stiller, of Grantham's Landing, B.C., to go to Homalo and put the sewage disposal system in good order.\n\nHe found the whole system over-flowing and the pipes clogged, and it was necessary to construct an entirely new septic tank, and empty the old one. Stiller is a practical man and made cedar planks and pipes and completed the job without the necessity of purchasing any material whatever. A second tank for the kitchen was also necessary, and he made that also. Apparently a good job was done, as the teacher reports everything quite satisfactory.\n\nAs there is only one boat a week to Homalo, he worked all the daylight hours, and sometimes after dark and was able to take the first boat out. He has charged only for his labour, and nothing for travelling and other expenses which must have amounted to at least \u00a315.00.\n\nThe job, in consequence, has cost considerably less than I anticipated, and the account is respectfully submitted for payment.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(F.J.O.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** C.J.

If the expenditure involved exceeds the sum of $50.00, it will be necessary to have the purchases made or approved by Indian Commissioner MacKay. A copy of the requisition is returned herewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a requisition for material at the combined Homalo Indian Day School and residence. I also enclose a letter the teacher has written to me in explanation of his requests.\n\nIt is quite true that these replacements should be made as some of the furniture which has been used by many teachers is in a deplorable state, and if funds can be found, I recommend that the request be favourably considered.\n\nWith regard to fuel, this has long been a troublesome matter. All good wood logs have been used up long ago and it has become a problem to obtain wood. The Indians will not cut and haul it when they can do any other work. Coal appears to be the only solution, and would probably be cheaper than wood. The teacher asks for 1 ton only as a trial, and I respectfully recommend that this be supplied, and a further report made later as to the success of it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nHomalo Indian Day School,\nChurch Road B.C.\n20th Aug 1942\n\nF. L. Ball, Govt.,\nIndian Agent,\n6th Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ball,\n\nPlease find enclosed requisition in quadruplicate for school materials regarding which it may be necessary to state the following facts:\n\nLamps. When I woke up only two last fall I found the two genuine lamps in stock out of order and therefore useless. Fortunately I had brought two old lamps of my own along not knowing what I might be up against. After a year service here without standing some rough beat spring\u2014these lamps are now useless and need to be replaced with new ones.\n\nMattresses there were three in stock. They were ragged, stained and smelly. One was so bad that I turned up the two others I have never used much preferring to use two belonging to myself that I brought along with me. Of course when I have those will go along with me and new ones must be supplied for the next teacher as no self-respecting person would sleep on the old one.\n\nCoal, the fuel situation here is a constant worry. Several times I have run down almost to the last sticks. The wood supplied is generally of the poorest quality, being what the Indians term \"country\" and saturated with \"hide-wax.\" At present I have but more than half a cord on hand and there is no prospect of getting any for months to come. Some of the Indians I have spoken to\nabout getting fuel at #6.00 a cord just laughed at me. They say they can get from #8.00 to #10.00 a day in the lumber camps and that it would be wasting their time to handle fuel wood at less than #10.00 or #12.00 per cord. For these reasons I am asking you to help me along for the present by giving me a ton of coal for cooking purposes.\n\nWindow shades. It is but the bare truth to say that we have none worthy of the name. They have been torn and have had pieces cut off and then re-tailored until only remnants of the originals remain and these can neither be pulled down nor rolled up.\n\nThe requisitions that I am making for lamps, mattresses, linoleum, window shades and a chair, are all for standard equipment & replace articles rendered useless through age and long service. Not one of them can be classed as a luxury. They are all essential to the most modest standard of housekeeping and will not need to be replaced again for many years and I am therefore hoping that you will kindly sanction them.\n\nYour sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of June 30, 1943, authorizing an expenditure of $215 for repairs to the Homalco Day School. On October 14, 1943, we received from the Vancouver office voucher No. 264 for $155.77 covering the cost of the shingles. A cheque in payment of this account was forwarded to the Reliance Lumber Company, Vancouver. We have not received any account for the labour, but today we received a bill from the Union Steamships Limited covering the cost of transportation of M. Jantz from Vancouver to Church House. The transportation warrant, No. 16984, was issued on March 28. Presumably the work has only commenced within the last ten days. Was it necessary to send a man from Vancouver? Was there no Indian at Church House capable of doing the work? An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nR.A.

School Inspector Davey reported on the need for new toilets at this school following his visit on April 10th and it is recommended that Mr. Taylor be authorized to have the work proceeded with.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nencl.\n-hm\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver.\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 24th last, regarding need for new toilets for Homalco Indian Day School, I have only now been able to locate someone in the vicinity of Church House, who will do this work.\n\nNo lumber is available in the district.\n\nI enclose a requisition for material for two toilets and for new steps in front of the school entrance.\n\nThe present steps are in very bad repair and are a hazard. They should be replaced before someone is injured. The school teacher has located a carpenter but he cannot give an estimate of total labour costs, merely stating he will do the erecting at a rate of $1.00 per hour.\n\nMrs. Oulton undertakes to keep a record of his time, and to ensure that his time is fully occupied, and from what I know of her she will protect our interests in that respect.\n\nThe local rate for carpenters is now $1.40 per hour.\n\n(H.

Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nReference enclosed requisition for a radio-telephone for the Homalco Indian Day School teacherage. I would advise as follows:\n\nThis school serves the Indian village of Churchouse, which is an isolated community of Indians only.\n\nThe school teacher has no contact with white people nearer than on Stuart Island some five miles distant. There is no telegraph or telephone communication between Churchouse and outside points, it being necessary to go to Stuart Island for such.\n\nIn view of the isolation, the lack of police supervision, and the turbulent conditions which prevail owing to the excessive drinking habits of the Indians, it is considered essential that the school teacher be enabled to send out messages by radio-telephone.\n\nThe model requisitioned will enable messages to be radio-telegraphed from Churchouse to Cape Lazo on Vancouver Island and they are transmitted from there as ordinary telegrams.\n\nIt is not considered necessary to establish connection by telephone also, as such radio equipment costs several hundred dollars, requires installation by a technician, and a small power plant to charge batteries.\n\nThe model recommended can be set up by any user and one battery can service the set whilst the other battery is being re-charged at Stuart Island.\n\nAt present telegrams to the teacher are only accepted for Stuart Island and remain there until an Indian boat calls for them. As some of the Indians will read or neglect to deliver the telegrams, the operator is reluctant to hand them out for delivery in this manner.\n\nIt is very necessary from every viewpoint that some direct communication be established to this isolated point and I would strongly recommend approval of purchase.\n\n[Signature]\n\n(H.

Taylor, and enclosures with regard to the proposed installation of a radio telephone at the Homalco Indian day school teacherage, has been the subject of careful consideration and discussion with District School Inspector Davey and it is agreed that in view of the circumstances it would be most desirable to have this equipment installed.\n\nYou will note that the initial cost is $270.00 and maintenance will consist only of recharging the batteries periodically.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nReference enclosed requisition for heaters etc. for the Homalco Indian Day School at Church House, I would advise as follows:\n\nThere is a wood burning heater in the school classroom and a wood burning heater in the sitting-room in the teacherage, which is attached to the school building. These two heaters are connected to the same chimney.\n\nAs oil is used in the kitchen range in the teacherage it would be more economical and labor-saving to provide oil heaters to replace the above mentioned wood burning ones.\n\nIt is difficult to get wood delivered at Church House, and the present set-up is a fire hazard, the wall having been badly scorched on two occasions by overheated stove pipes.\n\nAsbestos boards are included in the requisition for installation on the walls behind the heaters. An additional Coleman gas-lamp is necessary, as the one at present in use has to be carried from room to room. Broken window panes also need replacing.\n\nIn view of the isolation of this school, it is necessary that it be made as attractive and comfortable as possible if teachers are expected to remain.\n\nPurchase of the above is recommended.\n\n(H.

Peter Byrne,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSitt Meadows, B.C.,\nFeb 18, 1914\n\nPeter Byrne,\nIndian Agent,\nWhitehorse.\n\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nThe Indian children attending Sitt Meadows Public School, owing to the school filling up with white children, and the added burden in the way of school taxes, we do not feel that we should except Indian children from Whitey's Reservation. We are of the opinion that your department should establish a school for them, on that Reservation, as an undertaking is being done at other places. The Indians are showing a desire for learning now, more so than at any time in the past, and this desire should be encouraged, and while Public School trustees, will do what they can, a good many will not want to face the friction that might result from the mingling of the races. Also we think the Indian children would do better with a teacher of their own, one who understood them, and could give his whole time to them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.W.

At present there are twenty-five children of school age on this reserve and I would respectfully recommend that the Department establish a school for them.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a petition from the Indians of the Katsie Band, together with a census of the people who reside there, and also a letter from the Secretary of the School Board.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, March 20, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo enclosing a petition from the members of the Katzie Band praying for the establishment of a school on their reserve for the reason that the white school which their children formerly attended is now closed to them.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be willing to provide a teacher and school material as soon as the school building which they propose to erect is ready for occupation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Murphy opened this school on September 1st, with fourteen pupils on the roll; five others are expected to attend as soon as their parents return from the fishing.\n\nI accompanied Mr. Murphy to this reserve and from my observations I believe that he will make a very successful teacher.

It is 27 X 35 ft. with a loft ceiling. The building, although an old one, has been repaired and altered, and I believe will answer very well the purpose for which it is used. The Indians have put in a new floor and ceiling and lined up the walls on the inside so that it now looks clean and neat. There are four large windows which will supply ample light, they can be opened from the top, and this with a loft ceiling will ensure plenty fresh air for the pupils while in session.\n\nThe Indians generally are very enthusiastic in their expectations of the results of this school and wish me to convey to the Department their sincere thanks for supplying a teacher and school material for them. I expect to visit this school again during the present month and will report fully to the Department the progress made and the conditions existing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 14th, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing application of Mr. J.J.

I may add that as Mr. Murphy's resignation came unexpectedly, and as I was loathe to keep the school closed awaiting a reply, as these children are anxious to learn, I requested Mr. Wilson to take charge and open the school on September 1st, pending the decision of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosures:\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg leave to apply for the position of teacher rendered vacant by the enlistment of Mr. J.

Mr. Murphy and Mr. Wilson, the others, enlisted. It will be understood that things have been somewhat upset by such numerous changes. However, on my way home, I called at New Westminster and discussed the problem with Mr. Agent Byrne.\n\nI visited the reservation and met the Chief.\n\nHe informed me that they wanted a teacher with a certificate. I think a female teacher with a certificate as a possibility, here, as a good boarding house can be secured within a reasonable distance of the school.\n\nDate of Report, May 22nd, 1916.\nOttawa, April 5, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo reporting that Mr. John F.

B. McGarrigle, together with testimonial as to his character and qualifications from the Rev. Wm. P. O'Boyle.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the resignation of Mr. Wilson is accepted and the Department approves of Mr. McGarrigle being placed in charge of this school. He will be paid at the same rate of salary as Mr. Wilson received, viz.- $600.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Wilson, Teacher of the Katzic Indian Day School resigned the position last week, to join the 211 American Battalion for Over Seas Service. Immediately on Mr. Wilson advising me of his decision to resign, I communicated with the Missionary in charge of these Indians, who recommends the appointment of Mr. P. B. McGarrigle, whose application I am enclosing herewith, together with testimonial from Rev. Doctor Wm. P. O'Boyle, as to the character and qualifications of the applicant.\n\nI visited this school on Monday last, the 27th inst., and placed Mr. McGarrigle in charge of it as teacher. This was necessary as there is one pupil, at least, in the Entrance Class, and the parents were very anxious that the school should continue. Mr. McGarrigle is a man with a wife and four children and I believe he will make a very efficient teacher, as he seems to be very sympathetic towards the Indians.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, I would respectfully recommend that the resignation of Mr. J.

Traiman for your Indian appointment at Port Hammond.\n\nFirstly, as to character, personality, and influence for uplift; it would be extremely difficult to find a more ideal worker. Miss Traiman is\u2014and always has shown herself\u2014kind, thoughtful, sympathetic, devoted and intelligent. Even the most trivial duties are done with a better lengthy acquaintance with Miss Traiman's family, I can but spend of them with esteem.\n\nAnother sister is entering her third year in our public school service and is giving entire satisfaction.\n\nSecondly, as to qualification or training, though\nThe Junior has no B.C. Certificate for her academic standing is of a high order.\n\nNot alone qualified to teach the academic branches, she can teach Domestic Science and Domestic Art, clay modeling, painting, drawing, sketching, woodwork, dress making and sewing, weaving, music, vocal and instrumental music, first aid, and a course in education.\n\nThese are all more or less valuable qualifications on the part of any teacher particularly for an Indian school where fitting for life's duties and happiness counts for far more than mere \"book cramming.\"\n\nI am pleased to say that this young lady will be able to give a sound practical education in any or all of these.\n\nIn a word, I most strongly commend this Junior to our Chief Selection Board and rely she will give entire satisfaction.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 343/26.\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nSeptember 5th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith application received from Miss M.

Welch, O.M.I., and Mr. J. J. Dougan, Educationalist, and Secretary of the Teachers Association for the Province of B.C.\n\nAt the time that Miss Gregory's application was forwarded from this office it appeared that there was no more applications forthcoming, but Miss Trainor having heard of the opening decided to apply for the position, and in view of the fact that she is well qualified, and that the salary expected is the same as that usually paid by the Department, namely $600.00 per annum, I would respectfully recommend that her application be accepted in preference to that of Miss Gregory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnclosures:\u2014\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 5, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, enclosing the application of Miss Helen Coughlen for the position of teacher of the Katzie Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the appointment of Miss Coughlen as teacher of this school and she will be allowed salary at the same rate as her predecessor, namely, $600.00 a year.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB.

I am capable of teaching catechism and singing.\n\nI have not been advised as\nTo the salary paid in this school but presume it equals those paid in the white schools.\n\nAs I am a resident here I had an interview with the Chief of the reservation, and also visited the school.\n\nIf successful in receiving such an appointment I feel confident that I can guarantee satisfaction both in imparting knowledge and maintaining discipline.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n(Mrs) Helen Coughlan\nOttawa, March 20, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing the resignation of Miss Rose E.

You will be good enough to advise her accordingly.\n\nThe Department will consider an increase in salary when she has proved that her work will merit the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith application of Miss Rose E. Ganey, for the position of teacher of the Katsie Indian Day School, together with a recommendation from the Rev. J. Welch, O.M.I., that Miss Ganey receive the appointment.\n\nMiss Trainor who was appointed teacher of this school some time ago only remained one day after she took charge; hence I took the liberty of withholding this application and placed Miss Ganey in charge of the school to enable her to fully understand the Indians and the conditions under which her work as teacher was to be carried on. I was present when the school was opened by her on the 10th inst., and I made another visit yesterday the 23rd, and am pleased to state that she is quite satisfied to continue the work. The Indians and pupils are very well pleased with her.\n\nMiss Ganey is a regularly qualified teacher of the Province of Ontario, having been in charge of a school there for four years. In addition I may say that she is a very respectable young woman, highly accomplished in music, and I believe that her efforts as teacher will be crowned with success. Miss Ganey has undertaken the work at the usual salary of $600.00 per annum and is prepared to continue, but she hopes that the Department will favourably consider an increase when she has proven that her work will merit same.\n\nIn\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Trainor to Katzic Indian Day School and made her acquainted with the pupils and conditions there she resigned her position after teaching two days. The reasons given by her for resigning are that the place was too lonesome, and the pupils, being Indians, were not such as she was accustomed to teach.\n\nI have appealed to the Church Authorities for assistance in getting a teacher for this school, but up to the present I have not received any further applications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 14, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 30th ultimo and the 1st and 5th instant enclosing applications from Miss Gladys A.

She can get higher wages in a Public School. She is doing such excellent work and is so interested in the Indian children, I should like to see her remain.

This will make her salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum, which is the maximum salary allowed teachers in Indian day schools in British Columbia. She will also be entitled to the bonus during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. I shall be pleased if you will inform Miss Coughlan accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMiss Helen O'Gorman, teacher of the Kaslo Indian Day School, has applied for an increase in her salary. At present she is receiving salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum and the bonus of $150.00, a combined salary and bonus at the rate of $750.00.\n\nShe has been teaching this school since September, 1917, beginning at a salary of $600.00, which was increased to $700.00 on July 1st, 1918, and further increased to her present salary of $600.00 from January 1st, 1920. There are 30 children enrolled, with an average attendance of 17. Miss O'Gorman has a third class certificate with full normal training in British Columbia, and Inspector claims states that she does excellent work; the condition of the school is splendid; her teaching is scientific and systematic and that this is one way school that justifies its existence. He states that the main factor in the success of the work is an interested and trained teacher.\n\nThe maximum salary paid to teachers in British Columbia is at the rate of $600.00 per annum and Miss O'Gorman requests that her salary be increased to that amount. She is no doubt meeting with much success and I would recommend that her salary be on the same basis as that allowed other teachers having her qualifications in British Columbia. If the increase, namely, $100.00, be granted it could take effect from the last instant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I might state that Miss Coughlan has taught at this school since September, 1917, beginning at a salary of $600. She received increases of $100 on each of the following dates: July 1, 1918, January 1, 1920 and January 1, 1921. She is drawing at present $900 per annum, plus whatever bonus is allowed by law.\n\nYou are in a position to know what effect another increase to this teacher might have upon the minds of those engaged in our work on the Western Coast, and, as the Department pays more than $900 to one day school teacher only in Canada, I believe; I am somewhat hesitant about recommending to the favourable consideration of the Department Miss Coughlan's request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

I have consulted the Indian Agent, Mr. Daunt, and the Provincial Inspector of schools, Mr. D. Daniels, and neither has any objection to the strictly temporary accommodation of the Edwards' children at the Katzie Indian Day School. It has been pointed out by the Provincial Inspector of schools that the Official Trustee has made reasonable arrangements to pick these children up by means of the School Bus, but that the children would still have to walk a certain distance.\n\nI would recommend that the children of Mr. and Mrs. Roy Edwards of the Pitt Meadows Stock Farms Limited in Grades one to six inclusive but in no higher Grade, be given permission to attend the Katzie Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency, during the pleasure of the Indian Affairs Branch. I would further recommend that if this permission be given, the parents of the children be informed that such permission is only of a strictly temporary nature, and that it will be withdrawn at once and without notice should the children in question become in any way troublesome to the teacher, or the attendance vacant seats in the schoolroom be required for Indian children. It would be possible to terminate the proposed arrangement at any time upon the recommendation of the Indian Agent at New Westminster and without reasons for such action being of necessity given to the parents.\n\nThe whole file in this case has now been forwarded to you, but I may say that Mr. Indian Agent Daunt has been supplied with a copy of each letter. As I am leaving for an extended inspection itinerary in the northern part of the Province, I would request that the Department's decision be transmitted directly to Mr. Daunt, as soon as it is received from Ottawa. I have informed Mr. Edwards that consideration is being given to his request and that he will be informed in due course through the Indian Agent at New Westminster of the decision of the Indian Affairs Branch in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

Indian day school teachers in Canada receive, on the average, less than $650 per annum. It is true that salaries are higher in British Columbia than in any other province, but the Department cannot see its way clear to offer Miss Coughlan another increase. She has taught at the Katzle Indian Day School since September, 1917, beginning at a salary of $600. She received increases of $100 on each of the following dates: July first, 1918, January first, 1920 and January first, 1921. She is being paid at present at the rate of $900 per annum, plus whatever bonus is allowed by law.\n\nYou may inform Miss Coughlan of our decision and assure her that the Department, in refusing this application, is not casting any reflection upon her ability as a teacher. We are hesitant about paying her a larger salary, in view of what other teachers at Indian day schools are receiving. The Department wishes to thank Miss Coughlan for her faithful and excellent work, and I trust that she will see the situation from our standpoint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

However, the school is small. The\nenrollment does not exceed fifteen.\n\nIf the maximum salary is $300.00 per annum, in my opinion, it would be better to refuse the request for an increase\ntill such time as the policy of the Department is changed.\n\nIf a thousand dollars per annum is given Miss Coughlan,\nthere are a number of other teachers who would have as strong\na claim for an increase.\n\nOf course the time may soon come when in order to re-\ntain the services of good teachers more money will be neces-\nsary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

It should, of course, be further understood that this permission is only of a temporary nature and that it will be withdrawn at once and without notice should the children in question become in any way troublesome to the teacher, or if the accommodation at present vacant in the school is required for Indian children.\n\nI feel it should also be possible to terminate the proposed arrangement at any time, upon the recommendation of the Indian Agent at New Westminster and without reason for such action being of necessity given to the parents.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 5,\nVancouver, B.C.\nKalze Indian Reserve,\nEast Hammond W.P.\n\nSept 36, 1938.\n\nA.O.M. Owen Esq.,\nThe Indian Agent,\nNew Westminster B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Owen:\n\nI wish to apply for the work of bringing the children across the river to the Kalze Indian School, for the coming academic year.\n\nI am willing to do this at the rate of a dollar a day, for the two round trips, which is a total of about five miles.\n\nHoping for your favorable consideration,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6394, File 816-1, part 1)\nSIR:\n\nWe have had, in the past, some considerable trouble in getting many of the children of the Katzie Band to attend the Day School on their No. 1, Reserve.\n\nThis was really not their fault, as there are more than half the school-age population on the No. 2, and No. 3, Reserves across the Fraser River from the village on the No. 1, Reserve, where the school is situated. Hitherto, the cost of a definite transportation system has been too high, but I am now enclosing an offer from Andrew James, an Indian on the No. 3, Reserve, to make the necessary trips for One Dollar per day. There are at present thirteen children of school age on the south shore, who would thus be added to the present school list. At the moment, there are only nine pupils on the register.\n\nI would recommend that if at all possible, this offer be accepted, and an account submitted by the teacher, at the end of each month, for the number of days on which Andrew James brought pupils to the school. Such action would more than double the pupilage, and I trust the Department will give the proposition every possible consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA. O. N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to transporting children from the Katzie No. 3 Reserve to the Katzie No. 1 Reserve where the day school is located. It is noted that you can have the children transported at a cost of $1.00 a day. You may arrange for this work to commence immediately as an experiment. Careful check should be kept of the number of children who take advantage of this opportunity and a detailed statement forwarded to the Department when the school closes for the Christmas holidays. We will then decide if this transportation service should be continued.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nKatzi Indian Day School,\nFort Hammond, O.C.\n\nDec. 30, 1928.\n\nA.O.M. Saunt Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Alberni, O.C.\n\nDear Mr. Saunt:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 28th inst., I beg to submit the following report on the transportation of children from across the river to the Katzi School.\n\nThree children attended, with a very satisfactory attendance record. They seemed to show an interest in their studies. Only one boy, age 14 yrs., did not attend. He could have done so, owing to the ill health of his brother he will be attending a Residential school after Christmas.\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned five, two more will be attending school next September.\nwho are at present under school age. These children from across the river have nearly doubled the school attendance & bring more life and interest to the school.\n\nTrusting this will prove a satisfactory report I remain\n\nYours sincerely\n\nMary Winter\n\nC.S. I have not forgotten Andrew James accounts. They are all made out but he left the school after the concert, before I noticed, so was not able to get him to sign them. I will see him immediately upon my return to school on the 4th & forward them to the office right away.\n\nM.W.\nSIR:-\n\nReferring to your letter dated the 25th of October, File No.153-18-1, I beg to forward you herewith, a report received from Miss Mary Winter, Teacher of the Katzie Indian Day School, in connection with the boat service across the Fraser River from the No. 2 and No. 3 Reserves to the Katzie Day School on the No. 1 Reserve.\n\nThis service has been satisfactory, and I would recommend that authority be given to continue it for the balance of the School year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 12, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 4th instant you may continue the arrangements for the boat service across the Fraser River from the No. 2 and No. 3 Reserves to the Katzie day school on the No. 1 Reserve until the end of June, 1939 at which time you should again communicate with the Department if you wish this service continued for the academic year 1939-40.\n\nIn view of the fact that your letter of October 3, 1938, stated that there were 13 children of school age on the south shore who would take advantage of the boat service across the river the Department is rather disappointed to learn from the letter which you forwarded from the teacher that only 5 children have been using the service provided. It is hoped that this number will be increased during the remainder of the current academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nSIR:-\n\nUnder date of October 25th, 1938, you authorized the transportation of Indian children from the Katzie No. 3 Indian Reserve on the south bank of the Fraser River to the No. 1 Reserve, where the Day School is situated, at a cost of $1.00 per day for the gasoline boat.\n\nThis has been carried out throughout the last School year, but it is found that the amount of $1.00 per day does not cover the expense and loss entailed in giving the service, and it will be necessary to increase the amount to $1.50 per day, if the service is to be continued.\n\nIn order to keep this School running, we need the children from the south side of the river, and I would request that, if possible, authority be given to pay the rate of $1.50 per day for the service mentioned during the School year about to commence.\n\nI discussed this matter with Mr. P. Phelan when he visited the Agency, and he will remember the circumstances as detailed to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 1, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the transportation of children to the Katzie Indian day school. I have discussed the matter with Mr. Phelan and it has been decided to approve the continuance of this service at a cost of $1.50 a teaching day.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Consequently no further salary should be paid to her as teacher of the Katzie School.\n\nI will advise you later regarding the name of the teacher who will be in charge of this school for the academic year 1940-41.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nArchbishop W.M. Duke of Vancouver has suggested the appointment of Miss Maureen Daly, 620 Wellington Ave., Chilliwack, B.C., as teacher of the Matzie Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency.\n\nThe above nomination has been discussed with Inspector Barry who informs me that Miss Daly is the daughter of Mr. O. Daly, teacher of the Skawah Indian Day School, that she has just completed her professional training at the Vancouver Normal School and, though quite inexperienced, might well prove a success at a small Indian Day School such as that on the Matzie reserve where boarding accommodation with white people is available at a reasonable distance. Inspector Barry will give Miss Daly detailed instruction with regard to the work to be covered, etc., should her appointment be approved.\n\nWill you please let me know, by air mail if possible, the Department's decision, at the same time mentioning the salary that will be allowed to Miss Daly if approval is given this appointment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.H.
