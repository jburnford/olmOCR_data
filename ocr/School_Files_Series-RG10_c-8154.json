Subsequently this Department was billed for taxes on the said parcel by the Municipality for the balance of the year on the ground that the rate for taxes for the year was struck in January of 1922 and that taxes are considered as having been imposed on and from the 1st day of January in each year. The Municipality claimed that in view of these circumstances the taxes should be paid for the balance even though for the last half of the year the property was owned by the Crown. The Department gave favourable consideration to these representations and paid the taxes for the balance of the year.\n\nWe are now in receipt of a letter from the office of the City Solicitor of North Vancouver making claim for further taxes in respect of local improvements giving particulars of the same. He states that he has ascertained that both in Vancouver and Victoria, the Government has always committed the local improvements and paid the City. He states further that the Government has some special form which it desires to be completed in such cases, which form he thinks is supplied by the Department of Public Works. I am enclosing a copy of the particulars of four Local Improvement Taxes, which the Department is being asked to pay.\n\nWould you be good enough to advise me as to whether it is the practice in your Department to continue to pay such taxes to a municipality after the property has been acquired in the name of the Crown.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.B. Hunter, Esq., B.A.,\nDeputy Minister of Public Works,\nOttawa.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY MINISTER\nOTTAWA\n\n5th January, 1926\n\nFrom: The Acting Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Public Works,\n\nTo: The Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, in reference to the payment of taxes for local improvements in North Vancouver, B.C. In reply I may say that it is customary for this Department to commute such local improvement taxes and I am enclosing special forms used for that purpose. I may say also that it is the practice of the Department to continue to pay for local improvements (not general taxes, however), which may be carried out by the municipality after the property is acquired by the Crown. I would draw attention to the fact, however, that there is no legal obligation on our part in this connection, the matter is wholly at the discretion of the Government.\n\nR.C. Desrochers,\nActing Deputy Minister.\nThe exception from taxation of Crown Property is by virtue of section 125 of The British North America Act. The section is imperative in its terms, not permissive, and is based on the theory that property acquired and used in establishing the necessary Public Services of Canada, should not be liable to assessment. These Public Services are established and maintained at the expense of all the people of Canada; this expense is paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund made up of taxes, direct and indirect, levied on all the rate payers. Since these services are maintained at the expense of the people of Canada, and are primarily for the benefit of all the people of Canada; and secondarily for the benefit of the people of the special locality in which they are situated; it is neither reasonable nor right that the people of Canada collectively should be assessed or required to pay taxes to the particular locality, secondarily benefitted, on the value of the works and improvements required for that service.\n\nIf it be admitted that the Municipality has the right to so tax the Crown, then the greater the value of Public Works and improvements in any city, town or municipality the larger the tax; the result being that the penalty for providing the city, town or municipality with a competent Public Service increases in direct ratio with the cost of the improvements. In other words the greater the benefit conferred on the City, Town or Municipality in this regard the greater the penalty imposed in return by the City, Town or Municipality on the people of Canada.\n\nHaving always in mind that the Public Service is established and maintained at the expense of all the people of Canada, and recognizing that the requirements of the Public Service occasion much larger expenditures in Cities and Towns than in Country Districts; the inevitable result follows that the benefits inure more largely to the urban than the rural ratepayer, while the tax is uniform; what then will be the result if the right of the various Civic Municipal bodies to tax Dominion Buildings and improvements be recognized and established? This discrepancy will be largely increased at the expense of the rural population.\n\nTake for example the case of a municipality having no Dominion Public Buildings, as compared with that of a City having expensive Public Buildings; the ratepayers of the Municipality will be taxed not only for the establishment and maintenance of the Public Service in the City; but they will also be taxed in common with all the other ratepayers of Canada, for the exclusive benefit of the City, on the full value of the Dominion Government Buildings there. A double tax on all the ratepayers of Canada with no corresponding benefit to the Municipality in question.\n\nThe illustration is of course an extreme case, but the general result will be largely discriminative against the rural population.\n\nNo one has ever disputed the right of the individual property owner to deal with his own property as he wished; thereby doing no injury to his immediate neighbors.\n\nNo. 990 - Page 1.\nThe proposition that a ratepayer should be restrained from an investment which may result in loss and the consequent diminution of his assessable property, or from dealing with his real estate in such a manner as may produce a like result, is a novel one and contrary to the reasonable recognition of private rights; the parallel proposition that the Crown should be prevented from, or taxed for, taking over property and improving it with a view to establishing or improving a Public Service, is equally novel and unreasonable; and the further proposition that the Municipality should in both cases, or either case, be reimbursed for the loss of taxes occasioned by the decrease of assessable valuation within the district, is equally unsound, and directly contrary to the spirit and letter of our constitution as expressed in the B.N.A. Act.\n\nIn many Cities and Towns in Canada, the Civic Authorities have adopted the expedient of assessing Crown Property under the guise of charges for water and sewerage services, fire protection, etc., and Civic by-laws have been adopted declaring in effect, that the impost is a fee for the respective services, not a tax; notwithstanding the fact that the amount is based on the assessable valuation of the Crown Property, in the City or Town.\n\nIn my opinion this is a direct violation of both the letter and spirit of section 125 of the B.N.A. Act, and as I have already pointed out an unfair discrimination against the rural population of CANADA.\n\nBy the same methods, if recognized or approved by the Crown, this doctrine may be applied to every Civic Service, maintained for the benefit of owners of property, within any City or Town; with the result that Section 125 of the B.N.A. Act will become in effect repealed by Civic by-laws.\n\nIn my opinion a tax is levied in all cases where the impost is based on the assessable value of the Crown Property instead of the commercial value of the thing supplied, and should be met in cases of water supply to Public Buildings particularly by expropriation proceedings covering the service pipes and casements, required by the Crown, the Exchequer Court being asked to assess damages therefor based on the cost of water per gallon; as established by the cost of constructing and maintaining the water works.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Sgd) T.J. Carter,\nDepartmental Solicitor, P.W.D.\n\nNo. 990 - Page 2\nJanuary 12, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nIn case of further investigation into the charges for local improvements in connection with our property in North Vancouver (Squamish Indian Residential School) it might be advisable to ask the Public Works to have their local district resident engineer prepare a site plan showing the size and area of our property and the municipal improvements adjoining it. We would have to submit with our request the description of the parcel. (In connection with the correspondence with the Corporation of North Vancouver and concerning the completion of the forms provided by the Public Works Department, help can be secured from Mr. D. A. Hewitt, Telephone Hunter 257).\n\nP.W. Morris will assist in determining what improvements are of a permanent nature and should be allowed.\n\nRoom 950\nHunter\nASSESSMENTS AND LOCAL IMPROVEMENT RATES\nFOR WORKS OPPOSITE TO OR AFFECTING

It was my intention to commute these and make one payment and I wish to point out that I have been in communication with Mr. A. Aitken Gray, City Solicitor for your corporation, with this end in view. Please get in touch with Mr. Gray and suggest that he reply to my letter of January 12th, last, and return, properly completed in duplicate, the forms which I directed to him.

I was informed by Mr. Archibald that up to the present moment the Corporation has never put a tax on improvements and that there was no likelihood that such a course would be resorted to this year, and that in such an event happening in the future he thought that sufficient notice would be given by the Corporation to property owners in the Municipality.

L. 271 - Your file\n\nYou will remember that there was some correspondence between us some time ago on the above matter and finally it was suggested that you might make some arrangement as to payment of local improvement charges and send me the necessary forms for completion.\n\nThere has been some delay on this matter owing to the Treasurer and the Auditor being unable to agree with your figures. Our sinking fund is based at a 5% rate and you have computed your figures at a 6% rate. It is true that the bonds bear interest at 6% but as a matter of fact our sinking fund rate as I have stated is 5%. In other words you are computing the present value of $1.00 at 4\u00bd% whereas the City officials think this should be at a 5%.\n\nThe difference, however, only amounts to $500.00 on the whole transaction and I have been successful, at the last Council meeting, in having the forms signed on your basis, so as to get this matter settled.\n\nI have pleasure in enclosing herewith forms, marked by you \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" and \"D\" each in triplicate and duly authenticated by the proper officers.\n\nThere is one other matter, which apparently has never been settled.\n\nThe owner, Marie Chaminade only paid a portion of the 1922 taxes; the idea being, I think, that she paid the amount apportioned to the date you took over the property. This, of course, is not in accordance with our act, as used. Taxes are levied and must be paid by the person assessed.\n\nI believe, Mr. J. W. de B. Farris has, from time to\ntime given the Dominion Government advice. He is recognised as one of the ablest lawyers in B.C. and he agrees with me in my interpretation of our Municipal Act.\n\nThis, of course, will not affect you but I wish to make it quite clear that the settlement we now make with regard to local improvement is not to be taken as a relinquishment by the City of its claim against Marie Chaminade for the balance of the 1922 taxes or a relinquishment of its claim against the land.\n\nI shall be glad if you will get the local improvement matter settled as soon as possible and forward a cheque.\n\nAgain thanking you for your help in this matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCITY SOLICITOR.\n\nAAG/EN.\nEncls.\nOttawa, June 1, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 21st ultimo, with enclosures, with reference to local improvement charges on Block 123, D. L. 271, City of North Vancouver. Before an adjustment can be made, it will be necessary for me to know what sewer connections, if any, have been made into our property.

C.\nOctober 21, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Hunter:\n\nFor some months I have been in correspondence with the Corporation of the City of North Vancouver, with reference to the commutation of local improvement rates in connection with Block 123, District Lot 271, Registered Plan 750 - which property was acquired by the Department in 1922. All taxes have been paid up to and including December 31, 1922. Your office has already supplied forms, which have been directed to the Corporation for proper completion.\n\nCertain information is still required and I am enclosing four schedules and blue print of the site, with the request that you have your District Resident Architect supply the necessary information and certify to the accuracy of the schedules. It might be well to arrange the commutation of rates as on the first of January, 1928. You will note that the schedules at present are completed for a date approximately two years ago.\n\nI should be grateful if you would have your officer prepare revised schedules, in triplicate, for the attention of this Department. I should like to have your opinion, also, as to whether any of the charges are to be disallowed because of non-permanent nature. When you are directing an answering communication, I should like to have the blue print returned for our files.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. B. Hunter, Esq., B.A.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Public Works,\nOTTAWA\n25th October, 1927.\n\nFrom:\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Public Works.\n\nTo:\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour letter of the 21st instant, enclosing schedules of rates and a blue print of the site for your property at North Vancouver, B.C., has been received.\n\nThese documents will be forwarded to the Chief Architect for the usual attention, and the points that you have raised in your letter have been noted, and will be dealt with on the arrival of report from the District Resident Architect for British Columbia, who will locally obtain the particulars for this Department.\n\nJ. B. Hunter,\nDeputy Minister.\nReferring to my conversation with you yesterday, I append below extract from a letter from the First Lutheran Church and the Norwegian Lutheran Mission Home, Vancouver, from the Rev. Overt Skilbred, who is Pastor and Superintendent:\n\n\"A Society is being formed under the name, the \"Norsemen Society of B.C.\" The object of this Society is to aid the immigrants from Norway to become good citizens of the adopted land.\n\nIn order to obtain this end, they must be instructed in the language and customs of the new land. It is also necessary to stimulate their spiritual life, that they must continue in the footsteps of their fathers, who have won respect and honor among all the great nations of the world.\n\nIt is the purpose of this Society to establish its headquarters in the Province of B.C., at North Vancouver. There are at present over 60 Norwegian families and between two and three hundred individual Norsemen living there. A suitable building is being planned. This will function as a home for the newcomers and other single men who have no home of their own. The building will be arranged similar to those of the Y.M.C.A. The lecture room, or reading room, will hold about 150 people. There will be lodging rooms for about 50 single men.\n\nThese are the high spots in our plan and we hope you find that our intent is strictly within the scope of the most helpful undertakings in the upbuilding of a real Canadian Community.\"\nYou will see from the above the purpose for which the property is proposed to be acquired.\n\nMr. Skilbred wishes us to ascertain whether the Department would sell this property for $5,000.00 and what terms could be given for payment. The Purchasers might wish to take up the land a portion at a time, or say one-third when they commence their first block of buildings, and the balance later.\n\nWe assume that the Department will allow the usual agent's commission to us of 5% on the purchase price.\n\nYour kind consideration and early reply will be much appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nCANADIAN FINANCIERS TRUST COMPANY\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Manager.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith a letter received from Messrs. Canadian Financiers Trust Company, Vancouver, relating to proposed purchase of Blk. 123, D. L. 271, North Vancouver, which will be self-explanatory.

If you refer to your letter to Commissioner Ditchburn of May 8, 1922, you will understand that the Department feels free to dispose of the property in the open market when it is no longer required by the Squamish Indian Residential School. In the correspondence with Rev. Father Guy, of Ottawa, and Very Rev. Father Welch, of New Westminster, there is no suggestion that the land be eventually returned to the Sisters.\n\nThe City Solicitor for North Vancouver communicated with the Minister of Justice, concerning the transfer of this particular block. He asked that the Department of Justice enquire if the transaction was for the express intention of evading payment of the taxes and, if so, to have the land returned to the actual owners. I assured the Department of Justice at that time that the title for Block 123 was in the Crown and when the property was no longer necessary for our educational work, it would be publicly sold and the proceeds considered as public moneys.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Dr. Scott;\n\nI take the liberty to make application on behalf of the boys of the Squamish residential school at the solicitation of their teacher, for a grant of $90.00, for grading their proposed play ground situate on that parcel of land close to the school property which your department a few years ago purchased, in order that it may not be sold for taxes.\n\nAs you know the school property proper is small, and there is no place in it big enough for the boys attending the school to use for baseball, football and other athletic endeavor. In years gone by they used to use a field on this reserve, but a good portion of that is now occupied by the combined auditorium and manual training building which is now completed, the natural result is that the boys, (especially) and the girls have not a big enough place for muscular relaxation, which is a necessity in connection with any institution of learning. The boys of their own volition with their teacher have slashed a big enough place on the Indian Department property, for them to play on, but it requires grading, the stumps, although small would have to be pulled, the ground plowed, and then scooped so as to be made level as their a small ravine to be filled, which is now partly filled with the limbs of the trees now slashed.\n\nRecently I asked a white man who owns a team of horses and who does that work, as what it would cost, to grade it, and he said it would cost $90.00. The sisters evidently are afraid to ask for this grant since it is hardly connected with matters of study, then the boys teacher and the boys, with the desire of having a playing field tried to get one, by slashing the property but they later found out that the task was too great for them in that they could not do work, that only a team of horses with the necessary implements can do. So the asked me to make an appeal to you, to come to their assistance and I hope you will agree with me that a playing field is a necessity to the good conduct of the boys of a school of learning.\nI brought this matter to the attention of our Indian Agent Mr. C.C. Perry and asked him to ask the Department to make this grant, but his reply was that while he was not opposed to the boys having a playing field, he was reluctant to make the application as he knew that the Department had been asked to sell the property in question, and he did not know of the present position of that land. I told him that before the Department sold that land the Squamish Indians should have an opportunity to also acquire it.\n\nThe real position at present is that there not a place big enough adjoining the school for the children to play on, and for $90.00 spent in grading they could have a playing field, at the same time the Department would add to the value of the land by having it cleared and graded, the boys have already done very valuable work in slashing it.\n\nNot being so old, and still have recollections of the time when I used to enjoy to play like those boys at present attending the school, I am in sympathy with them, in their need for a playing field, and I heartily endorse their request, if you will be good enough to have some regard for my recommendation, I trust that you will grant this prayer of boys who do not know how or who to ask, but who dearly love to have a playing field, so much so, that they have spent their recreation hours, clearing this land, instead of playing at their games. Spring is here now, and summer will soon be at hand and the grading of this property can not be too soon in the opinion of the boys, of the Squamish residential school and fully endorsed by,\n\nVery respectfully yours\n\nAndrew Paul.\n\nP.S. I am not asking that this be charged to Squamish funds, but from departmental funds. A.P.\nOttawa, April 3, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 21st ultimo, addressed to Dr. Scott, who is at present on holiday.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Perry, authorizing him to arrange for the grading of the lot which the Department holds for the use of the Squamish Indian Residential School. It is possible that Mr. Perry will get in touch with you in connection with the offer you have received for the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nAndrew Paull, Esq.,\nSquamish Indian Reserve No. 1,\nNorth Vancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, April 3, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Andrew Paull has urged the Department to level Block No. 125, District Lot 271, which is held by the Department for the use of the Squamish Indian Residential School. It is proposed to make a playground for the use of the pupils. Mr. Paull, I understand, has been in touch with a contractor who would do the work for $90. You might see him and make the best arrangements possible. I believe it advisable for the children at this school to have a suitable playground. The cost will be met from Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. C.

Mr. Cairns and I were accompanied by Dr. Germain, who is attached to the Boarding School, and we made an inspection of the property together. We were all of the opinion that the site would not be at all suitable for the purposes mentioned. The land is poor, gravelly, covered with stones and badly broken up. The clearing of deadfall and other thick growth would also be very expensive. After looking over the land we returned to the school where we discussed the situation with Rev. Sister Ada and Rev. Sister Aronson, the former appearing to know nothing about the condition of the land and the latter stating that the primary object in asking the Department to purchase the area was to get rid of the land and obtain, if possible, a return to them of an investment on the same of approximately $15,000.00.\n\nThese Sisters have carried this land since about 1912, paying taxes thereon, and it is our opinion that they were badly misled as to the quality and fitness of the land for their purposes at the time it was sold to them. We advised the Sisters that the best test of the value of this land would be to advertise the same for sale and see what offers they would get for it in that way.\n\nIt occurred to us whilst discussing the situation that a possible solution of the school problem at North Vancouver might be:\n\n1. The acquisition by the Department of the present site of the Squamish Residential School with its orchard, garden and other improvements.\n\n2. The creation of a block of land for school purposes of approximately twenty acres by adding to the existing school property the block which the Department purchased some years ago from the Sisters to relieve them from the burden of taxation and the acquisition of an additional strip of land by purchase from the Squamish Indians in the Mission Reserve No. 1 adjoining the present school site.\n\nWere it not for the fact that the Department\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq., LL.B., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAugust 28, 1923.\n\nIn a letter written to me some time ago stated that it would never be likely to erect a new building on the present site, a complete assessment of the value of the lands herein suggested would have been prepared and submitted for the consideration of the Department. If, however, the Department would care to reconsider this phase of the matter, I shall be glad to ascertain all the details necessary in this connection and submit the same to you.\n\nWe informed the Reverend Sisters that we could not recommend the purchase of their land and although they seemed somewhat disappointed they stated that they thought our observations quite fair and reasonable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(C.C.

Personally, I do not think that this would be advisable, for the following reasons:\n\n1. That although the Inlet separates the City of Vancouver from North Vancouver, yet from a commercial and shipping standpoint they are one. As Vancouver advances, so will the North side advance. All foreshore from the First Narrows - both sides of Burrard Inlet - to Port Moody will be utilized before long, and come under the control of the Harbour Commissioners.\n\n2. As regards a school of this nature, you ought to have a large area of ground for playgrounds and for general farm use and the Indian Reserve is not suitable. This site will most certainly be purchased for industrial purposes very soon.\n\nRe Acreage at Capilano\n\nIn company with Mr. Astbury we made two trips and viewed the ground, and whilst we did not cover all of it we got a fair idea of its layout.\n\nWhilst there are stones of various size upon it, still they are loose. The ground is of a black sandy loam nature and is sloping more or less from the North to the South. I am informed that there are about fourteen acres\nin the two pieces, and this I think should be enough to place a school upon, such as the one you now have at North Vancouver.\n\nWhilst the clearing might cost two or three hundred dollars per acre, still as you stated that you would give the land free to the Department of Indian Affairs to build a school upon, it would in my opinion be a good move for the Department to seriously consider this proposition towards taking up your offer.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHTD/AR.\nSquamish Residential School  \nNorth Vancouver B.C.  \nJune 18th, 1929\n\nDoctor Dunham Scott  \nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa Canada\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nAs I am informed the Department intends to build a new School for the Squamish Indian Children of school age.

Mother Theresine, who is now the Superior General of the Order in France, has spent many years working for the Indian children in the various schools in British Columbia. Rev. Mother Aimee, as Provincial head of the Order, as you are well aware, Mr. Scott, has spent the last thirty years of her life in the service of educating and rearing Indian children at the excellent school maintained by the Sisters at North Vancouver.\n\nThe work which has been carried on during that time, is, as you know, invaluable, and I am sure that the Indian Department wishes it to be continued. At the present time the Sisters find it necessary to provide new living quarters for themselves, as the old building is in a state of total dis-repair, and in any event has been far too small for the past few years.\n\nI do hope, dear Mr. Scott, that some assistance will be given these good Sisters, and I am glad to make use of this opportunity to thank you again for all your kind favors of the past, to me in the work of Indian Education in which I took so much interest.\n\nShould this request be given any consideration, I shall as well as these good Sisters, feel deeply grateful for your kind interest.\n\nMost respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nAugust 1, 1930.\n\nDear Sister Justinian:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to a new main building for the Squamish Indian Residential School. There are many pressing claims on the Appropriation for Indian Education and, at the present time, I do not know when it will be possible to give assistance. In fact, the Department has not learned what the future holds for this institution. It is very doubtful if it should remain where it is, as there is not sufficient land for gardening and a milch herd. I feel that, if the Squamish Boarding School is to be continued, a new site should be found.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Sister Justinian,\nProvidence Orphanage,\n836 Twelfth St.,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nAugust 18, 1930.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nReverend Mother Theresine, Superior General of the Sisters of the Child Jesus, from France, visited the Department today, with reference to the future of the Squamish Indian Boarding School. The Order would be very grateful if the Department could investigate conditions, not only on the present site, but the Capilano property, and endeavour to decide what site should be used when the proposed new school is constructed. It was represented that the present site would be retained by the Order for a Provincial House. They would like to see the school built as close as possible to their property.\n\nI promised to write to Sister Mary Amy, the Provincial at North Vancouver and let her know what the Department is doing to arrive at a conclusion. I propose to write to Commissioner Ditchburn, with a view to having him give us a full report after seeing the Sisters.\n\n[Signature]\nSeptember 23, 1930.\n\nDear Sister Mary Amy:\n\nThe Very Reverend Mother Theresine, Superior General of the Sisters of the Child Jesus, visited Ottawa recently and asked that we come to a decision, if possible, concerning a site for the future Squamish Indian Residential School. Of course, I do not know when the Department will be in a position to build a new residential school, but there is no reason why we cannot make an effort to determine what site might be used. I understand that your Order would like to know our wishes before deciding the location for your new Provincial Headquarters. I have today written to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn, asking him to have Mr. Perry make a full report and recommendation in this connection, and I hope to write to you again in the matter in a few weeks.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Sister Mary Amy,\nPrincipal,\nSquamish Indian Residential School,\nNorth Vancouver, B. C.\nSeptember 23, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nThe Superior General of the Sisters of the Child Jesus recently visited the Department and discussed the future of the Squamish Indian Residential School. The Order would be very grateful if the Department could indicate what site they would like to use for the continuance of this work. They are not pressing for immediate reconstruction of the school, but they wish to know our plans, so that they can fix a site for their own Provincial Headquarters. Of course, they would like to have the school as near as possible to their Provincial House.\n\nI have to request that you will have Mr. Perry make a full report and recommendation in this connection. On August 28, 1928, he examined a property in the Capilano district and thought it hardly suitable for residential school purposes. At that time, Mr. Perry recommended using the present site and adding to it from the reserve. It occurs to me that the present property might some day come under the control of a harbour commission, as, no doubt, the north shore will some day be required by shipping interests. It has been hinted that even the Squamish Indian Reserve will be needed for industrial purposes in the not distant future. Please have Mr. Perry give this his attention at his convenience. Of course, he should have a full and frank discussion with Sister Mary Amy, Mother Provincial of the Order in British Columbia.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nVictoria, B.C., Oct. 31, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that in accordance with your instructions I visited the Vancouver Agency.\n\nCommissioner Thompson of the Harbor Commission was briefly consulted by way of ascertaining some information of the intended developments on the north shore of Burrard Inlet; having in view matters relating to the continuity of a residential school at North Vancouver and the suggested utilization of a portion of the Squamish No.1 Reserve for such purposes. This is preliminary to a full investigation on the subject for the Department in the near future.\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst.

B. Hunter\nDeputy Minister.\nOctober 26, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Hall:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of August 14th, last, in connection with local improvements near the vacant property which is used by the Squamish Indian Residential School. The Acting District Resident Architect for the Department of Public Works, who made a report in this matter, states that the property is vacant and has no sewer connections. When Crown property is not connected with a sanitary sewer, it is a matter of grace with the Crown whether a claim is paid to the municipality. The funds at our disposal are so limited, that I regret the Department cannot contribute towards the cost of the recent improvements. You will please so inform the Corporation of the City of North Vancouver.\n\nIt may be argued by the Corporation that, in the spring of 1928, the Department committed the local improvement rates for sanitary sewers, permanent grading and pavement in connection with this same block - 123 D. L. 271. It is true that at that time we paid the City of North Vancouver $5,705.30. Funds could be found then for the purpose and consequently the claim was dealt with favourably. The Corporation, when considering our present refusal, should remember that, in the past, we have dealt generously with them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nF. J. C. Hall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n619 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMinister's Office\n\nDecember 16, 1951.\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThe Minister would like you to return the attached correspondence addressed to him by the Honourable Murray MacLaren, Minister of Pensions and National Health, and also to let him have a memorandum which will serve as the basis of a letter to the City Clerk of North Vancouver.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n28th December, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Thomas G. Murphy,\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 16th instant with attached correspondence, I have to say that the lot in question was acquired by His Majesty as represented by the Superintendent General from the Sisters in charge of the Squamish Indian Boarding School, Vancouver, B.C., by instrument dated the 27th day of July, 1922, the consideration being the sum of $2000, plus arrears of taxes and taxes for the current year to the 1st of August amounting in all to the sum of $6919.97. The Sisters were unable to meet the increasing burden of taxes and the lot would eventually have been sold for taxes had not the Department taken the action it did to preserve this lot which was considered necessary for proper conduct of the said school. The fee of this lot having passed to the Crown, the lot ceased to be assessable for taxes by the municipality. It was, however, contended by the municipality that while this was the case, taxes are considered to have been imposed on and from the 1st day of January in each year and that the municipality should accordingly receive taxes in respect of this lot for the full year of 1922. After taking the matter up with the Department of Justice, it was decided to pay the taxes for the remainder of the year, which was done.\n\nIn December 1925 the Solicitor of Vancouver wrote the Superintendent General pointing out that upon inquiry he had ascertained that in both Vancouver and Victoria the Dominion\nGovernment had always commuted the local improvements in respect of property held by the Crown and paid the City and the Solicitor at the same time enclosed particulars of local improvements charged against the property in question and asked that the charges for these improvements be commuted. The matter was referred to the Department of Public Works and we were advised by the Acting Deputy Minister that there was no legal obligation, the matter being wholly at the discretion of the Government but that it was not unusual for the Government to pay for local improvements. The improvements in question were subsequently commuted at the sum of $3705.30 and paid, the amount being available from funds voted by Parliament.\n\nThe Department is now being asked to commute the payment for sewers recently constructed which commutation amounts to the sum of $965.70. The property in question is vacant and has no sewer connections and we are advised by the Deputy Minister of Public Works that under such circumstances it is a matter of grace with the Crown as to whether this is paid to the municipality. Wing to the fact that our estimates are reduced to a minimum no funds are available for the payment of the requested commutation even if we were favorably disposed towards such payment, and as the municipality has no legal claim for such payment I do not see that it has any real grievance. If it is proposed to pay this claim funds will have to be provided by Parliament.\nOttawa, 14th January, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nI am returning our memorandum dated the 28th December to the Minister, as requested.\n\nI would be glad if you could let us have for our file a copy of your reply to the City Clerk of North Vancouver for reference in case the Department should receive any correspondence in connection with this matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

The Department sees no reason why the Indian children should not attend the white schools in the neighborhood, upon payment of the usual tuition fee, which the Department would be willing to provide upon receipt of quarterly returns showing the number in attendance at each school. The number of children of school age shown in your Census return for the whole Agency is much less than the number that you claim could attend from three Reserves. The usual tuition grant paid is 50 cents a month per pupil.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.R. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherston, N.S.\n\nD.McLean\nSecretary\nSir,\n\nReplying your favor of the 24th April No. 183165 I beg to state that when setting the census I did not go from house to house, but accepted the information which I received from Indians whom I casually met and upon this information I based my report. At the time I thought the figures correct, but now after having made more diligent inquiry and visited the reserve for myself I find I was in error.\n\nThe number of children who I am assured by many of themself as well as by their parents would take advantage of the school proposed to be established, as I stated in my letter of the 14th of April to you. The parent as well as the children seems very anxious to have the school and hope the school will be attended.\n\nThere's a vacant house in the reserve which at a cost of about $300 could be converted into a suitable school room. The rental would be but a trifle, and the expenses of a school in the district should be justified by the results expected.\n\nThe Indians will not send their children to the white school because of the distance of the school from them to begin with, and because of the timidity and shyness of the Indian child \u2014 in the presence of the whites.\n\nI have the honor to be in your obedient servant,\n\nL. M. Dunlop, Indian Agent for Caribou\n\nChief Secretary\nOTTAWA, 10th July, 1899\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 28th ultimo, in further reference to the application of the Indians of the Afton Reserve, for the establishment of a school, I beg to say that as you have already been informed, no funds are available for this purpose, and your application has received too late for consideration in connection with this year's estimates.\n\nThe Department is still of opinion that if the Indians are as anxious as they appear to have their children educated, they might make an effort to send them to white schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Scotia March 31, 1904.\n\nHis Excellency The Governor General in Council,\n\nThe memorial of the undersigned, the Afton and Heatherton Band of Mic-Mac Indians, and also of the white residents ratepayers of the adjoining districts, respectfully showeth:\n\nThat the population of the said Indian Band is about 150, and the number of children of school age, that is from 5 to 16 years, is 39.\n\nThat these young people are growing up without any schooling, because the Band never had a school of their own, the need of which is felt more and more every year, in view of the progress in that respect made by the white people amongst whom they live.\n\nThat your memorialists desire with satisfaction the care and liberality with which the Govt. provide schools for other Bands of Indians in the counties of Halifax, Pictou, on the Island of Cape Breton and elsewhere.\n\nThe undersigned earnestly call your attention to the facts of this case, and bespeak your favorable consideration of the situation and circumstances of this Band, and also hope that you will see your way towards providing a school for them at Afton, the most central and populous of the three Indian reserves, and thus placing them on an equal footing with their brethren elsewhere by having the great benefits of education within their reach.\n\nJohn Stephen, Esq. + Peter Nicholas, Capt. + Frank Tom, Do. + Frank Philip, Do. +\nDear Mr. Redley,\n\nI enclose petition of the Afton and Heatherton bands of Micmac Indians. It is signed by the agent, the parish priest and various others besides the Indians. I have a personal knowledge of the matter and the statement set out in the petition are true. I feel that sufficient grounds are given for the erection of a school as requested and I hope the department will take steps at once to do so.\n\nTrusting that\n\nC. F. Macdonald\n\nFrank Redley, Secretary Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nPopulation\n\nSummerside = 22\nAfton = 78\nPonquilt = 49\n\n149\n\nThe No. of children on the above reserves between the ages of 6 and 15 years is given as\n\nThe reserves are some distance from each other.\nOTTAWA, 25th March, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith further reference to the application for the establishment of an Indian school at Afton I beg to say that I consider that it would be a mistake to grant the prayer of the petitioners for the following reasons:\n\n1. The three small reserves which it is proposed to benefit by opening a school there are so far apart from each other that the same objection of distance would hold good against either locality, while Heatherton, where there is a white school, is between Ponquette and Afton, and Summerside (the other reserve) is only a short distance north of it. The Census gives the population of these reserves as 149. Summerside, containing 100 acres, 32 Indians; Afton, 2 reserves, 160 acres and 245 acres, 78 \" Ponquette, 120 acres, 49 \".\n\nThe number of school children stated in the petition is correct, about 39.\n\n2. You will see from the foregoing that although the Indians live in separate communities on their reserves, their livelihood is not dependant on the soil. They have to gain their living with or for the whites, and the sooner their children are brought up amongst them and learn the English language the better for their future prospects. As I said\nbefore, there is a white school at Heatherton, which is centrally located and I am sure some suitable arrangement could be made with the Trustees, as is done in other places, for the admission of Indian children.\n\n3. With regard to the prejudice of the Indians against sending their children to white schools, the sooner the Department, the sooner they are helped to overcome this bias the better. That all the Indians are not so prejudiced we will see from Mr Agent McDonald's letter of 16th April 1899, where he recommends the appointment of a young Indian to take charge of a school then proposed who had received his education at the white public school.\n\n4. The only teacher we could get for such a school as is proposed would be an Indian, and our experience of Indian teachers in Nova Scotia has been anything but satisfactory.\n\n5. I consider that the results likely to be obtained from the establishment of such a school would never justify the outlay and if the Indians wish to have their children educated they should have taken advantage of the offer made them some time and sent their children to the white schools.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1904.\n\nDear Mr. McIsaac,\n\nReferring to your favour of the 23rd ultimo, forwarding a petition for the establishment of a school for the children of the Mic-mac Indians of the Afton and Heatherton Bands, I beg to say that a similar request was received some years ago but the Department was of opinion that if the Indians were anxious to have their children educated as they appeared to be they might make an effort to send them to neighboring white schools where their tuition would be paid.\n\nThe position of affairs in that district is that we have three reserves, Summerside, containing 100 acres, 33 Indians,\n\nAfton, 2 reserves, 160 and 345 acres, 78 Indians\n\nPonquette, 130 acres, 49 Indians.\n\nThe number of school children is, as stated in the petition, 39. At Heatherton, which is between Ponquette and Afton, there is a white school, while Summerside is only a short distance north of it.\n\nC. F. McIsaac, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons.\nAs at present advised the Department does not see its way clear to establish a school as requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nMy Dear Mr. All, I have\n\nreceived your letter of the 1st inst.\n\nwith enclosure duly received.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Education for the Indian Affairs Department at this time\n\nwrite John Stephen, Secretary to the Board\n\nfor the Indian Affairs Department\n\nthat the Indian children attending the school\n\nwere brought in by the teacher\n\nso that the material which the Indians\n\nhave in their hands and which is their\n\nchief means of support, is not thrown away\n\nand around here they have been told\n\nto go back, back of the gate, to work\n\nwith their families under the guidance\n\nof various directions and the question\n\nis what efforts would it take to build a\n\nsmall school where children could attend school.\nOttawa, 22nd April, 1904.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nMr. McIsaac, M.P., called this morning and left the accompanying letter from the Rev. Father Chisholm, the Parish Priest at Heatherton, N.S., in which he strongly sets forth the necessity for a school being established on the reserve. Mr. McIsaac endorses what Father Chisholm states and asks that, if the Department is not prepared to erect a building, the experiment be made, as suggested by Father Chisholm, of renting one of the Indian houses on the reserve and fitting it up, although Mr. McIsaac would prefer that the Department agree at once to establish the school in the regular way.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOTTAWA, 26th April, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn connection with the application of Mr McIsaac, M.P., with further reference to the establishment of a school at Heatherton, N.S., I beg to say that I consider that Father Chisholm's letter to Mr McIsaac only strengthens the hand of the Department in the stand it has taken in this matter. The occupations followed by the Indians necessitate their leaving the reserve for long periods, and as they take their children with them, no regular attendance could be had if a school were established. There certainly would be no justification for the Department's going to the expense of erecting a building and if a house were rented and a teacher engaged, his salary would have to be paid yearly whether the pupils were present or not. It would be better to afford a little assistance in the way of clothing for the Indian children to enable them to attend the white school. If the Indians are so anxious to have their children educated, their timidity might be overcome.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOTTAWA, 29th April, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the application for the establishment of an Indian school at Heatherton, N.S., I beg to say that the Department considers that Rev. Father Chisholm's letter, which you left on the 22nd instant, only strengthens the stand it has taken in this matter. As the occupations of the Indians necessitate their leaving their reserves with their children for long periods, no regular attendance could be obtained if a school were established. The Department would not, therefore, be justified in going to the expense of erecting a building, or even renting one, and paying the salary of a teacher who would have no children under charge for the greater portion of the year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nC.F.

N.S. and other ratepayers of the surrounding districts, respectfully showeth:\n\n1st. That this Band consists of about 23 families, located on three Reserves, not quite three miles apart, including about 35 school age children, but that this Band never had a school of their own, and they cannot induce their children to attend the school of the whites.\n\n2nd. That in former years, and up to the present time in other localities, the Gov. occasionally distributed blankets one or two to each family, according to the number of members, but that since 25 years no such distribution has been made to this Band.\n\n3rd. That in this Band there are usually, old, sick and dying people, who are absolutely unable to do anything for their own support.\n\n4th. That the Chief in pursuance of his duties as such has to devote a good part of his time to looking after the business of the Band, such as seeing to the necessities of the sick and dying and burials, repairs to the Church etc. etc. whilst at the same time, being a poor man like the rest, the support of himself and family depends on his time and industry.\n\nTherefore the undersigned submit to your favorable consideration the situation of this Indian Band and the facts and circumstances of which can be verified, with a view of obtaining\nobtaining for them:\n\n1st. The establishment and provision of a school amongst them.\n\n2nd. To distribute, as formerly, say 30 or 35 blankets to the Band.\n\n3rd. To make a moderate and reasonable provision for the absolute necessities of the sick and dying.\n\n4th.

You will observe that the petition is also signed by a large number of Whites living in the district, among them the Indian Agent, Mr. McDonald.\n\nThe Department is asked to establish an Indian School; to distribute blankets; to provide relief; and to pay a yearly salary to the Chief.\n\nIt is desired that you will kindly look into these matters carefully, and furnish a separate report and recommendation with regard to each, at your early convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA.J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nRiver Burgeois, N.S.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 13th ultimo No. 377002 enclosing the copy of a memorial to His Excellency, the Governor General in Council, in the interests of the Indian population of Antigonish Co., N.S. signed by Chief Francis Paul of Heatherton in that County and other Indians as well as by a large number of their White neighbours, I beg to make the following observations regarding the essential contents of the memorial:\n\n1. The question of establishing a school for the benefit of the Indians of Heatherton, Rayfield and Pompquet, as requested, is one to which I have given considerable thought, not as to the necessity for the school, which I have recognized from the beginning but as to its proper location - a point that I think could be dealt with best at a meeting attended by the Indians of the three communities interested. Wherever located, its distance from the most remote parts of the Indian settlements will be considerable, and consequently a matter of inconvenience to some. Therefore in order to make the school a success, my opinion is that it would be necessary to make provision for the conveyance of the pupils to and from school, who would not otherwise attend it.\n\nThese are matters which it will be necessary for me to look into carefully, before I can recommend to the Department a definite course of action with regard to this subject.\n\nA. J. Boyd\nIndian Superintendent,\nHeatherton, Antigonish Co., N.S.\n\nJan'y 14th, 1911.\n\nTo His Excellency the Governor General in Council.\n\nMay it please Your Excellency,\n\nThe memorial of the undersigned the Chief and Indian Band of Heatherton, Antigonish Co., N.S. and others ratepayers of the surrounding districts respectfully showeth:\n\n1st That this Band consists of about 22 families located on three reserves, not quite three miles apart, including about 35 school age children but that this band has never had a school of their own and they cannot induce their children to attend the schools of the Whites.\n\nFrancis Paul, Chief\n\n(and others)\nOttawa, March 21, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, and in reply to that portion in which you deal with the establishment of a school for the Heather-ton, Bayfield and Pompquet Indians I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to have you, as suggested, look very carefully into the question of the best way of meeting the needs of these Indians. When reporting at a later date on this matter you will be careful to deal with all phases of the question. I may say that the suggestion of the Department in the past was that these Indians should attend the white schools in the neighborhood, which it is understood are available; however, if a school so situated that all the Indians would be able to take advantage can be provided the Department is prepared to consider the question of the erection of a building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nTo the Hon. Robert Rogers,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nThe Memorial of the undersigned, the chief and heads of families of the Heatherton Band of Indians in the County of Antigonish N.S., and also the ratepayers of the white population of the surrounding districts respectfully showeth:\n\nThat there are 40 families in this Band and about 52 children of school age from 5 to 16 years.\n\nThat this Band never had a school of their own, although this is the fourth application they have made for such a school within the last 14 years. It is true they were promised $3 a month for each Indian pupil at the school of the whites, but this offer would never do. As a matter of fact and experience the Indian children are too timid to mingle with and compete with white children. Within the specified time not more than 3 Indian pupils could be induced to attend the school of the whites. The result is that the youth continue in the dark to grow up illiterate and it is unnecessary to point out the previous disadvantage under which they suffer in the struggle for subsistence amid an intelligent white population. They feel their grievances the more when they see the Indians of other counties well provided for in the matter of schools.\n\nYour memorialists therefore relying on the facts and merits of their case, and on the favorable consideration thereof by the Minister and the Govt., confidently trust that they will grant with as little delay as practicable the comparatively small setting necessary to provide a school for their children.\n\nSigned in behalf of the Indians and at their request,\n\nHeatherston N.S.\nFeb. 8th 1912.\n\nFrancis Paul, Chief\nPeter Nicholas\nPeter Marble\nJames Prosper\nJames Bernard\nFrank Prosper\nJoe.

J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOFFICE OF THE INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT.\n\nRIVER BOURGEOIS, N.S., 29th Feb., 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe subject of your letter of the 22nd inst., No. 183163, is one which I have given much thought and attention, without being able to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion, having in view efficiency with reasonable economy. In fact it impresses me with the characteristics usually representative of the proverbial Chinese puzzle.\n\nI am already pretty well acquainted with the situation at Heatherton, Bayfield and Pompquet; but, as you suggest, I shall visit these places again in the near future and afterwards report to the Department, placing before it all the information possible bearing on the establishment of a school for the Indians of that locality. It was my intention to refer to this matter in my school report.\n\nI may here mention that the recent very stormy, cold weather has greatly retarded my tour of school inspection; and I cannot hope to finish the discharge of my duties in that respect, including a visit to the Indians of Antigonish Co., before the 13th of March. I shall forward my school report as soon afterwards as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to make the following report on the subject of your letter dated February 22nd last:\n\nI visited two Micmac settlements in Antigonish Co. on the 26th and 27th ultimo, and inquired fully into conditions and circumstances affecting the establishment of a school for the benefit of the Indians in that county. As the Department is aware, there are three settlements, one of which - that at Pompquet or Summerside - need not be taken into consideration in connection with this matter; because its educational requirements are already well provided for by the public school at Heatherton, which is within convenient distance of the Pompquet Indians, whose children - only three in number - attend that school regularly, and that fact narrows the interests remaining to be dealt with to those of the Indians at Heatherton and Bayfield.\n\nThese places are rather over than under four miles apart. Bayfield is by far the more important, both in point of population and otherwise. It has 27 children of school age, that is, between 5 and 15 years; while Heatherton has only 10 such children. All parties interested are most anxious for the establishment of a school, and the Heatherton Indians are quite agreed that it should be\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\nbe located at Bayfield for the good of the larger number.\n\nBut the fact appears to be that most of the Heatherton Indians intend moving to Bayfield in the near future, as their supply of wood for fuel and for other purposes is exhausted; whereas there is a good supply of wood for all purposes at Bayfield, whose soil also is more fertile, and much of it being intervale, is better adapted for farming operations, than is the case at Heatherton. I think this fact accounts for their willingness to see the school located at Bayfield, and explains their statement to me that they were looking forward to making such arrangements as would enable their children to attend school at Bayfield as soon as one would be established there.\n\nUntil I discovered by actual count how many children of school age are at Bayfield, I had no idea the number was so large; otherwise, I would have brought to your notice, on my own initiative, the absolute propriety and necessity of providing school accommodation for their benefit, even should the children at Heatherton not be able to share its advantages; but seeing the attitude of the Heatherton Indians in the matter, I unhesitatingly recommend the establishment of a school at Bayfield with the least possible delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, May 21, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in reference to the establishment of a school for the Indians at Bayfield, Antigonish County.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has not at the present time funds with which to put up this building, but a note will be made for next year's estimates. In the meantime I have to ask you to be good enough to state the size and style of building that you think should be erected. I would also ask you to state whether at the time of your visit to the reserve you located a site.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, May 21, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of February 12th, last, in reference to the establishment of a school for the Indians at Heatherton I beg to say that the Department is in receipt of a detailed report from the Indian Superintendent, Mr. A. J. Boyd, in which he recommends the establishment of a school at Bayfield where there are a larger number of children than at Heatherton. Mr. Boyd states that this arrangement is agreeable to the Heatherton Indians, as they will be able to attend a school so located. The Department has no funds this year with which to undertake this work, but a note will be made for next year's estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. Lavin Girroir, Esq., B.A., LL.B.,\nAntigonish, N.S.\nOttawa, November 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of May 21st, last, in which you were asked for information respecting the size and kind of building that you think should be erected at Bayfield, Antigonish County, and also whether at the time of your visit you located a site.\n\nThe Department will be taking up the preparation of plans at an early date and would like to have this information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Hoping this humble appeal may have some weight in securing a continuance of the pupils' daily allowance.\n\nI am Yours\n\nRespectfully,\nWm. J.

You should make out a requisition for say three months' supplies for this purpose and submit it to the Agent, who should then forward it to the Department for approval. You should not purchase any supplies for this school without first having obtained the sanction of the Department through the Indian Agent. This mid-day meal is to be supplied to the children only and you should take every care to see that the supplies furnished are not wasted. It is, however, considered that during the warm weather the giving of this lunch might be discontinued and then the cold weather starts next fall it can again be supplied.\n\nAccounts have recently been received for readers\n\nWm. J. Rogers, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nAfton Indian Day School,\nAfton, N. S.\nreaders, copy books, pencils and other school supplies purchased for the use of this school.

On no account are supplies of this nature to be purchased by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of yours of the 7th inst., and am pleased to learn that it was not the intention of the department to discontinue issuing a daily lunch to the pupils.\n\nWith regard to the method of furnishing these supplies, I was never authorized by your Dept. nor Agent, to submit any requisitions for the same to anybody; so I never did more than notify the party who was supplying the Biscuits, by postal, that we were in need of further supplies and left that the quantity to be decided by him.\n\nThis notification was given at the request of the Supplying Biscuits.\n\nI do not consider that...\nas purchasing supplies without authority, as the agent Mr. Cameron informed me that Mr. McIlwain of Antigonish was furnishing the supplies.\n\nWith regard to the waste, the supplies have been kept locked, and nobody handles them but myself, and that they are used economically and carefully.\n\nThe last supply of Readers, etc., I asked for was made on the Requisition Forms. This was some time in March. I received the Slate Pencils, Lead Pencils and Dictionaries, but did not get the Readers nor the Opies yet.

He was also advised that the Stationery Office has been asked to hold this order until the new series of Nova Scotia Readers is published, and then to have 24 of the No. 1 Readers forwarded. Mr. Cameron was instructed to inform you accordingly. No copy books were asked for in the requisition referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. J.

He is the man to report as to the manner in which Mr. Rogers is making out, and if his service is satisfactory, hoping this is satisfactory to you I remain your obedient servant.\n\nW.J.

Athey,\nDeputy Chief, General\nIndian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 1st inst., I called up the Agent on the phone and asked him if he was with Mr. Boyd when examining the Indian School and if they were \"yes\". When asked him by Boyd made statements to him like those written to me namely that Rogers the teacher \"was making no progress\u2014would make nothing\" and he asked that Boyd did make such statement.\n\nOn Aug. 25th last Mr. Cameron wrote me that in response to a letter from you he stated \"that he finds no recommendation a change in teacher as he thought during his short term experience that Mr. Rogers has given satisfaction as far as his judgment went to Mr. L. therefore giving a different version to\nWhat Boyd said and all I can say now is that I have brought the matter to some attention and I feel the idea that Rogers should continue \"marking time and making deposits\" the responsibility is on him, but I would like the Indians to have a good school when the work is being done.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. A. Armstrong\nOttawa, Sept. 11, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. McIsaac:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the position of teacher at the after Indian Day School. I have noted that Mr. Agent Cameron, of Heatherton, is more impressed with Mr. Rogers' success than is our Mr. Boyd.\n\nI am of the opinion that the public school inspector of the Provincial Department of Education is better qualified than either of our officers to inspect a day school and comment on the teacher's success. Mr. A. G. McDonald, Separate School Inspector, of Antigonish, has reported from time to time on Mr. Wm. J. Rogers as follows:\n\nJune 1914. \"Teacher's success - satisfactory.\"\nMay 1916. \"The teacher is patient and painstaking and in my opinion is well qualified for the position.\"\nMay 1916. \"I consider him suitable for the school. He is patient against king and knows considerable about child psychology. The children made good progress.\"\nNov. 1916. \"Teacher's success - satisfactory.\"\nMay 1917. \"Taking Mr. Rogers' work all in all, I would find it difficult to name a teacher who would do better. He is kind and patient with the children - essential qualities in dealing with his school. The children are fond of him.\"\nMay 1918. \"He has done well in the school.\"\nApril 1919. \"Teacher's success - satisfactory.\"\nDec. 1919. \"Teacher's success - satisfactory.\"\nFeb. 1921. \"Teacher's success - satisfactory.\"\nJune 1922. \"On the whole I am satisfied that the management of the school is about as good as one should expect.\"\n\nIn view of Mr. Rogers' long and faithful service, and in the light of the public school inspector's reports from year to year, I am disposed to allow him to continue his work among the Indian children. What is your opinion, now that all the facts have been reviewed?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nC. F. McIsaac, Esq., M.P.,\nAntigonish,\nN.S.\nOttawa, Sept. 11, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have yours of the 29th ultimo, referring to Mr. Rogers, Teacher of the Afton Indian Day School. The Department is disposed to follow your recommendation in this matter and retain Mr. Rogers' services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAset. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton, N. S.\nSir,\n\nChief Thomas Francis of this Agency has asked if the Indians could have the use of the Indian Day School in the Afton Reserve three times a week, on Tuesday and Thursday after school hours to teach the children their catechism and religious instruction, and on Sunday afternoon to have a prayer meeting of the Band. The chief said he would be responsible for school that everything would be left as they found it. I told him I could not give it without first getting authority from the Department, and did not know if the Department would give the use of the school. Kindly advise me if the Department will give the Band the use of the school for the purpose mentioned. awaiting a reply I remain your obedient servant.\n\nH.J. Cameron\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, March 20th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, regarding the request of Chief Thomas Francis for permission to use the Indian day school building on the Afton Reserve three times each week in order to teach the children their catechism and to hold prayer meetings of the Band.\n\nRegarding this request, please state if there is not a Roman Catholic Church at which these Indians could attend, and who will teach the children their catechism and conduct the prayer meetings on Sunday afternoon. You should also state what arrangement was carried out in the past to provide religious instruction and church services for these Indians, as it is considered that a request of the nature made by the Chief is unusual, and, unless there are sufficient reasons advanced, the Department would not be prepared to authorize the use of the school. When this was done in other places, there were continual complaints as to the condition in which the buildings were left after each service. However, when we have full particulars, we will be in a position to decide whether the Chief's request can be granted or not. Please also state whether the teaching of the catechism and the holding of prayer meetings would be carried on with the approval of the local Parish Priest.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton, N.S.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No 46-1-1 dated March 20th 1924, the Catholic Church is about three and half miles from the Clifton House, and the Indian Church on the Summerhill Road is about three miles from the Clifton House. In the past the children used to meet in certain hours to be instructed in their catechism. The Chief says that an Indian named Frank Williams is to teach the children and hold the prayer meetings, and this same man very seldom goes to church himself, and I don't think would be capable of teaching the children.\n\nThe local Board Point think it would be better if more of the Indians and their children attended school on Sunday. There to have a prayer meeting themselves. I don't think it advisable to give them the school, as they would likely make it a place for the young people to gather and have a good time. I think the custom they had in the past was all right. The children on the Heatherton still do that, gather at a certain one of the houses, and one of the older Indians teaches them their catechism on Sunday afternoon, and the children on the Clifton could do the same if they desire to do so. As Chief Thomas Francis is a new chief he is only trying to start something new. There is no doubt they would leave the school in a dirty condition after those meetings. I would advise the Department not to grant the Chief's request and give them the school.\nSir,\n\nas I am sure the teacher would be complying if the school would not be in the condition he left it. I would therefore recommend that the Department do not give the Chief Authority to get the School. I remain your obedient servant.\n\nH. J. Cannon\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 3rd, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the request made by Chief Thomas Francis for permission to use the Indian day school building on the Afton Reserve in order to teach the children their catechism and to hold prayer meetings of the Band.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, after fully considering all the circumstances regarding this request, the Department cannot approve of the granting of the Afton school building for the above mentioned purposes. The Department does not see the necessity of this, as the Indians can attend the local parish church. You may inform the Chief that the Department cannot grant the use of the school building for the purposes mentioned, and you, as Agent, should see that these instructions are carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Public School Inspector states that he does not hesitate to suggest that Mr. Rogers' services be continued. I wish to quote in part from the special report: \"Mr. Rogers seems to understand the peculiar mentality of the scholars coming to him for instruction and hence is making a success of his work where perhaps others would meet with failure. Moreover, the children seem to like him and hence attend very well. This is important, as, from my observations, it takes very little to antagonize the Indian children, and, if this is done, they will not attend school.\"\n\nMr. Indian Agent Cameron also recommends that this teacher's services be continued.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

And they will continue to do so while the present teachers remain in charge of them.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 46-1-1 dated June 26th 1926 regarding the Public School Inspector's report as to the discipline of the children in the Clifton Indian Day School. I may say a few years ago I took the matter up with Mr. Rogers, at which I visited the school. I thought the children did not keep very good order at times although they were not bad. He told me that when he would discipline that he found that the child would scream away for a few days from school, and the late Public School Inspector, Mr. J. H. Donald, told him not to be too strict on Indian children. I know he gave the same instructions to the teacher in the Heatherton White School, in which Indian children are attending telling him not to be so strict with Indian children as White children that is why Mr. Rogers has been easy on them, but if instructed he says he will use discipline and it might affect the attendance for a time but I think that would be only for a day or so regarding the service of the present teacher Mr. Rogers. I think he has given very good service in the past and I would recommend that he be employed during the next school year under the present School Inspector if he thinks that he could place a teacher there whom he thinks could do more effective work.\nSir,\n\nit is quite suitable to me, but if Mr. Rogers is instructed to use more discipline in the School, he will do so. It was due to the instructions of the late School Inspector that he was easy on them. Hoping this report is satisfactory.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nW. J. Cameron\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept.

It is felt that more effective work could be accomplished by him. It is expected that the teacher will use tact in the maintaining of proper order in the classroom. It may be that the attendance will decrease at first; but we believe that, when the Indian children and their parents see that proper order is to be maintained, the pupils will resume a regular attendance.\n\nThe Department will approve of the re-engagement of Mr. Rogers for the next school year, beginning September first.

J. Rogers, teacher of the Indian Day School on that Reserve. He states that the pupils are making no progress and that the Indian Band want a change in teacher. He has recommended the appointment of Michael Prosper, who has been attending school in Antigonish for sometime.\n\nI have to request that you will state whether, in the interests of the pupils of this school, you would recommend that the services of Mr. Rogers be dispensed with and a new teacher engaged. Sometime ago the Department received a request that, in the event of Mr. Rogers' services being dispensed with, Mr. A. J. MacGillivray, of Dammaglass, be asked to forward an application. If you would advise that a change be made in the teacher at this school for the next school year, you should forward your recommendation, and if you have any particulars as to the qualifications and experience of Mr. MacGillivray I shall be pleased to have same. It is considered doubtful whether the services of Michael Prosper would be satisfactory.\n\nYour early reply giving as full information as you can regarding the question of securing a new teacher or the continuing of the present arrangement should be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I don't think the Indians themselves are very good to judge if the Teacher is qualified or not, as they are very careless in sending their children to school, and the School Office has to be continually after them, but I would refer you to the local school inspector Mr. A. B. Mr. Donald. If Mr. Mr. Donald thinks that in the interests of the pupils a change in Teacher would be for the better, I am quite satisfied, regarding the Indian Band recommending the appointment of Michael Proctor as Teacher this young Indian did not get a grade yet, he wrote for his C. this year but, I understand he is not likely to get it even if he did. I don't think that his service would be satisfactory regarding the qualifications of Mr. A. J. the Secretary of Darnaglass. I do not know, he is a man about sixty years of age, has been local. Mr. P.P.\nSir,\n\nFarmer Brother, from 1921 till 1925, and his appearance as a teacher I do not know, but the local school inspector would be able to give that information, as I have already stated I think Mr. Hogan has been given fairly good service, but that of Mr. Donald, School Inspector, would say a change in teacher would be for the better, I am satisfied, if not that the Department continue the present arrangement.\n\nAbdient Servant\n\nW.

You should inform him that it is expected he will continue to give faithful service and will use every effort in making the work in the classroom a success. You should assist him in every way you can to encourage a regular attendance of the Indian children.

I intend to revisit that locality early next month on my return from Annapolis, when I expect to succeed in interviewing Mr. Bonvie.\"\n\nI may say now that I could get no information, when I visited Afton on the 19th instant, to show that Mr. Rogers had taken an active part in any election, and unless the charge that he gave a bottle of liquor to Joseph Bonvie, as alleged, presumably to influence the latter's vote, can be substantiated, I do not think any evidence can be found to indicate that he acted improperly in the election of 1925.\n\nBut apart from whatever his activities may have been in election contests, I consider it my duty to inform you that he has outlived his usefulness as a teacher of the Afton Indian Day School. I visited this school on the 19th inst., and found only four pupils present, exactly the same number that was in attendance when I inspected it last March. There has been absolutely no progress among the pupils during the past three years, and I advise that his services be dispensed with after the present school term.\n\nAs stated in my report quoted above, I expect to visit Afton again next week, when I hope to interview Joseph Bonvie, and I shall communicate with you again at an early date regarding this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nDuncan C.

We have surmised that our wish was not complied with.\n\nThere are several and very good reasons why this change should be effected and we are going to mention some of them.\n\nIt is generally known that Mr. Rogers is an aggressive conservative. In the election of Hon. E.M. McDonald he is known to have used rum in an attempt to influence liberal voters. We may add that...\nThis was mentioned to Hon. Mr. Chisholm last July by one of our committee members.\n\nThis school was built in 1912 and Mr. Rogers was teacher since that date. So late he has sent one pupil to high school at Antigonish. This pupil went to Antigonish in the fall of 1924 and was found to stand the grade eight common school work. He is now in grade ten. It is interesting to note that this work is being done in our common schools up to and including grade ten and even grade eleven by the common school teachers of whom Mr. Donald was one.\n\nThis student was in Antigonish three years. The government is paying $6 per week for his board in addition to a tuition fee ($50 per year we are told) on a total of $520 a year for work that could and should be done by their teacher at Afton. Of course this may be a boast for Antigonish and perhaps it is one reason why the committee in Antigonish did not take\naction. I believe however you will agree with us; that this is an unnecessary expenditure of public money and in itself sufficient cause for dismissal.\n\nWe have tried to place the facts of this case fairly before you and if necessary can prove our statements. In conclusion we appeal to you as our representative to remedy this state of affairs which is unfair to the public and still more unfair to your supporters.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAlex R. Macdonald\nChairman\n\nJames Armstrong\nSecretary\nMinister of Indian Affairs,\nAltaura,\n\nHon. O. Dean, Sir:\n\nWe enclose a copy of letter concerning Indian schools at Afton N.O., which was forwarded to Mr. Duff Sept. 19th.\n\nHe replied stating that he referred our letter to your department. We would be pleased to know what action your department is taking in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAlex. R. McDonald,\nJames Armstrong.\nOctober 15, 1927.\n\nDear Sirs,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant and copy of a communication which you addressed to Mr. William Duff, M.P., regarding the Teacher of the Indian school at Afton, N.S. In reply I beg to say that recently action was taken to discontinue the services of Mr. W. J. Rogers as Teacher at this school and to appoint Mr. John L. McDonald, of Taylors Road, in his place.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nAlex. R. McDonald, Esq.,\nJames Armstrong, Esq.,\nHeatherton, N.S.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No H6-1-1 dated October 6th 1927, I notified Mr. J. Rogers, Teacher at the Afton Indian School, that his services would not be required after November 11th next. I wrote to John L. Mr. Donald, Taylor's Road, offering him the position as from November the 14th next, the salary to be $65.00 per teaching month.\n\nMr. Donald called on me today and said he would accept the position, and said he would be prepared to begin duties on the date mentioned. I would ask if you would send me a Register for the Afton Indian School as the one on hand is about used.\n\nI remain your obedient servant,\n\nW. L.

Cameron, Indian Agent here, that my services as teacher of this school will not be required after Nov 1st next. Inasmuch as my services were engaged for the present school year, I cannot understand the action of the Dept in thus terminating my services.\n\nThe public schools term in this province opened the last week of August last, and teachers are now engaged in all schools. It is therefore impossible for me to secure a position in any other schools, for the remainder of the school year. Thus the action of the department is a very serious matter for me. If the Department insists on releasing me on Nov 1st, I feel sure you see I am justified in asking for a generous gratuity in lieu of yearly salary. I feel confident the Department intends doing this and I shall be glad to have your early confirmation of the same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWilliam J. Rogers\n(teacher).\nSir,\n\nAt the request of Mr. A.

To supplement the money received\nfrom the Department towards my expenses during the past four years while a pupil in United India, I have been obliged to borrow money and from fear that a return must be made.\n\nIn view of these facts I sincerely trust that my application will receive the consideration of the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be, dear Sir,\n\nVery gratefully yours,\nMichael Prosper.\n\nMay 16, 1926.\nOttawa, May 23rd, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, requesting that, providing there is no vacancy for a teacher for the next school year in the Afton Indian Day School, you be appointed as teacher in one of the other Indian day schools in the province of Nova Scotia.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we will not be aware as to what vacancies there will be until the end of the present school year.

MacDonald, teacher, whose pupils are taking up this work at present with excellent result.\n\nI understand Mr. MacDonald would undertake to teach a class of adults, after school hours if the Dept. will furnish material, and allow him some extra salary for this extra work. Work which would greatly benefit the Indians on this reserve.\n\nCatherine MacDonald.\nOttawa, February 12, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nMiss MacDonald, travelling nurse for the province of Nova Scotia, in a report on her visit to the Afton Indian Day School, states that a number of Indian women on the reserve at that point are anxious to take lessons in basketry and reed work from Mr. J. MacDonald, the teacher, whose pupils are taking up this work at present with excellent results. The nurse states that Mr. MacDonald will teach a class of adults after school hours if the Department will furnish material and allow him some extra salary for the work.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report stating whether you would recommend that the teacher conduct classes in basketry and reed work for the Indian women. If you recommend that the teacher be authorized to carry on this work after regular school hours, you should give the approximate cost of the material required, and state what extra remuneration you would advise be paid Mr. MacDonald for his services. You might also state the approximate number of Indian women who would attend these classes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton, N.S.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 46-1-1 dated Feb 27th, 1929. I took the matter up with Mr. Donald, he said that the young women did not seem anxious to take up the work, but that a number of young Indians wanted to learn it.\n\nMr. Donald said that the cost of the materials would be about thirty dollars at first, and as the young Indians do not want to come during the evening hours, that it would be necessary to learn them after night, which would require some lamps. Mr. Donald says he will teach them from six to ten hours a week after night for five dollars a week. I am inclined to think that the cost of this work would be too expensive, as they would not likely attend regularly, and then it would be at night, and the school would not be in good condition in the morning for school, as has been Donald's teaching the evening classes and as some of the younger Indians attend at times, that any young Indians, boy or girl who are anxious to learn the trade might build attend them and learn, and save the extra expense.\n\nI do not feel like recommending the work at present, but that he continues with the school children, and any adult may attend and learn with them.\n\nI remain your\n\nThe Secretary\nDept Indian Affairs\nAttorney\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, March 2nd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the conducting of evening classes in basketry and reed work by the teacher of the Afton Indian Day School for the young men and women of the Afton Reserve.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that the Department, after considering your report on this activity, is not prepared to authorize the expense in providing the material and equipment required and in the payment of the teacher's services in conducting these classes during the present school year. It is thought that if any of these young Indians desire to take up reed work they could attend during the period the teacher is giving instruction to the regular pupils of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I teach the pupils a little red work every day and also instruct a few adult Indians who are interested in the work.\n\nTo continue the work will mean considerable expense.\non our part between tools and supplies. If you consider it advisable to continue you would greatly favor us by again assisting us by supplying us with the needed tools from the Dominion Road Supplies Ltd., Toronto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn L. McDonald\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing a letter from Mr. John L. Macdonald, teacher at the Otonabee Indian Day School, asking for some supplies from the Dominion Supplies Ltd., Toronto, so that he may continue to teach the Indian children and adults who may attend the red and basketry work, which he has begun with good results. I think it is good teaching for the children and they are doing some very nice work, and will I think be a great help to them as they grow older. I would recommend that he be given these supplies so that he may continue the work at a cost not to exceed $6.00.\n\nI remain yours,\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. Indian Affairs\nAttawa\n\nAssistant Secretary\nIndian Agent\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo relative to the request of the teacher of the Afton Indian Day School to be supplied with a quantity of reed, etc., in order that he may continue teaching reed and basketry work to the Indian children and adults. In reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure, not exceeding approximately $26.00, in the purchase of the supplies required by the teacher. I am returning herewith the list of the supplies required as prepared by the teacher and you may place the order for same. Please obtain an itemized account, in duplicate, covering the cost of these various supplies and, when the goods are received, you should certify the account in the usual manner and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton, N.S.\nThe Secretary\n\nMay 29, 1929\n\nSir,\n\nWithout wishing to trespass upon your valuable time, I permit me to ask your consideration of a subject which, I am of urgent necessity, namely, the question of an increase of salary.\n\nThe reasons for asking an increase are twofold:\n\nFirstly, the work of teaching the Indians is so difficult, burdensome, and thankless, that it is necessary that the remuneration should be sufficient to provide a reasonable living wage.\n\nSecondly, I wish to render a better and more beneficial service to the Indians and people. If the Department will allow me twelve hundred dollars for the term, I shall be willing to do all I can to aid the adult Indians as well as the pupils and I will spend my vacation doing up some lines of vocational work which I believe is greatly needed on this reserve.\n\nIf you are willing to risk this increase, I hope that it will not be money spent in vain. I shall endeavor to work honestly and faithfully for the good of all concerned.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\nJohn L. Macdonald\nOttawa, June 4th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, applying for an increase in salary as teacher of the Afton Indian Day School, and stating that you would be prepared to render more service, not only to the Indian children but to the adult Indians as well.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that there are many demands on our appropriation. The Department will, in view of the services which you are performing, allow you an increase of $5 per teaching month in your salary, to date from the beginning of the present fiscal year, viz., April 1st, last, this being the full amount that can be allowed. This will make your salary from that date at the rate of $70 per teaching month. We are informing Mr. Agent Cameron accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn L. McDonald, Esq.,\nAfton,\nN. S.\nOttawa, June 4th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is allowing Mr. John L. McDonald, teacher of the Afton Indian Day School, an increase of $5 per teaching month in his salary from the beginning of the present fiscal year, viz., April 1st, next. This will make his salary from that date at the rate of $70 per teaching month. This increase is made in view of the services Mr. McDonald is performing, both with the children and adult Indians on the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

INSPECTOR MacDONALD,\nDATED JUNE 19th, 1929, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nAFTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 46-1-6.\n\nIn previous reports, I have stressed the need\nof an experienced, sympathetic lady teacher for Afton\nIndian School. I am still of this opinion and trust\nthat sometime in the future the suggestion will be\nconsidered.\nOttawa, June 26th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Afton Indian Day School, requests that, in the near future, the Department give consideration to the appointment of an experienced lady teacher. I shall be pleased to have a report from you on the work being performed at this school by the present teacher, Mr. John L. McDonald. You should state the progress he is making with the pupils in the classroom, also remark on the discipline and his work in the school generally. I shall be pleased to have this information at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton, N.S.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 46-1-1 dated June 26th 1929 regarding the report of the School Inspector of the Afton Indian Day School, I may say that I was always of the opinion that a lady teacher would be better in the Indian School than a man, but when the change was made two years ago, I was not consulted about the appointment made at that time, but I think the present teacher is doing very good. On my recent visit there I found that the children were making fairly good progress and he also teaches them seed work which I think they will find very useful later on in life. The discipline perhaps might be a little better, and I spoke to him about it. He admitted that it was very hard to have the discipline as good in an Indian School as in a white school, and I believe he is right; due to their mode of living, there are naturally more rather than white children, and again when he is teaching them the seed work they get into the habit of being more noisy. On one of my recent visits to the School I took along with me Rev. Father Macdonald who is their spiritual advisor, and he made the remark to me after that he thought they were making very good progress and complimented the teacher on his work in teaching the children and the adults in the seed work they were doing.\nSir,\n\nyour letter No. 46-1-1 dated June 4th in which you informed me that Mr. Donald the teacher was given an increase of $5.00 per teaching month in view of the service Mr. Donald was doing both with the children and the adult Indians on the reserve. Your informant in that matter I think was quite right. Inspector Mr. Donald's view is all right, that if a change were made at any time that a lady teacher be given the position, but as Mr. Donald is given satisfactory service I would say that his services be retained.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAbdient Servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. Indian Affairs\nAttawa\n\nW. J. Cameron\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, July 11, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, reporting on the services of John L. McDonald, teacher of the Afton Indian Day School. In view of your report as to the work Mr. McDonald is performing, the Department will approve of his continuing as teacher for the next academic year. Should there be a change in teacher later, the Department will keep in mind the recommendation of the Public School Inspector, that the services of a lady teacher be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton,\nN. S.\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDecember 5, 1929\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI resign my position as teacher in the Afton Indian Day School forthwith from January 3rd, 1930.\n\nI am sorry I cannot make an unfavorable recommendation as has been requested by Inspector Woodward's report. Without doubt my position here was not up to the highest standard as you likely knew before you received the written inspector report. However it may not be correct to remark that I do haven't given the time entirely to school work & believe it was not all effort in vain. I have worked about an hour a day and walked nearly everyday; in fact, some people have given me the freedom so that they may permitted to talk and work about. This manual training did not work.\nrather of some immediate financial value should also be considered primarily for this purpose.\n\nCerational training of any kind would I believe be of great use to the Indian pupils. The practice of using the hands to advantage in moulding, weaving, working, etc., is necessary when the pupils are young as without doubt 95 per cent of them a few years later will be trying to earn a living for themselves by the skilled use of their hands even if they should break away from their Indian tribes.\n\nIt is interesting to note the work the blind man in Halifax can do towards earning a living. They are trained and have the necessary ambition. The Indians can be trained and probably a desire for work and to mount above the level at which they ordinarily stand could be instilled into their minds through work.\n\nHope are not naturally lazy or it is not an instinct to be indifferent about work. Environment plays the greatest part in the child's welfare and this is\nthe biggest obstacle in Indian education. But this can be conquered by gradually having them work in the different lines of livelihood or trades.\n\nAnd again they are not a stupid people. An example may be noted. A little boy seven years old who started going to school recently without a word of English was looking at the pictures in an atlas' Geography. He noticed a man calling some with a harmonica and \"Teacher look\" I did so and inquired what the man in the picture was doing. He replied \"He taking mean commerce.\" It is not that they cannot do work that they are below average, but that they are well contented and satisfied with their lot and do not want to advance. An Indian does not worry if he gets a bite to eat at present, supposing there is nothing in view for the future.\n\nI understand you are making very satisfactory progress in your residential schools and no doubt you will continue the work in extending\nand encouraging the Indians in every way possible so that before a very long time they may be making a better and more substantial living for themselves as well as setting a good example for their offspring.\n\nI much thank you for assistance given me during my period of service especially in the red line.\n\nWith best wishes for the continued advance of Indian civilization.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJohn S. Macdonald.\nOttawa, December 12, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, tendering your resignation as teacher of the Afton Indian Day School to take effect at the beginning of January, next. In this connection I have to say that your resignation is accepted to date from the 31st instant.\n\nYour remarks regarding the teaching, in future, of manual training, reed work, etc., have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn L. MacDonald, Esq.,\nAfton,\nN. S.\nOttawa, December 12, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received the resignation of John L. MacDonald, teacher of the Afton Indian Day School, to take effect at the end of the present month. His resignation is accepted.\n\nI have to request that you will endeavour to obtain the services of a qualified teacher to succeed Mr. MacDonald, and to begin duties when the school reopens after the coming Christmas holidays, on or about January 6th, next. You might consult the public school inspector for the district, and he may be able to recommend a teacher. The inspector has, in his reports, recommended that the services of an experienced, qualified lady teacher be secured for this school. The salary allowed would be at the rate of $65 per teaching month. Please give this matter your immediate attention and forward the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you recommend be appointed. If you desire, you may consult Mr. W. J. Cameron, the local Indian Agent, Heatherton, N.S., in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. J.

It has not been the practice of the Department to change teachers in the middle of the academic year unless their services are unsatisfactory. No reports have been received showing that Miss McKeough is not capable of handling this school, and departmental officials feel it would be in the best interests of the children to have her continue in charge of the school until the end of the academic year, viz., June 30th, next.\n\nI have directed the attention of our officials to your recommendation that Mr. Daniel McDonnell, Bayfield, N.S., receive consideration when a teacher is required for this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nWilliam Duff, Esq., M.P.,\nLunenburg,\nN.S.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJanuary 14, 1936.\n\nDR.

She possesses a Class \"C\" Nova Scotia Teacher's Certificate. In a recent report from H. M. MacDonald, Provincial Inspector of Schools, on his inspection of this school, he states as follows regarding Miss McKeough's services:\n\n\"Miss McKeough, the present teacher, is much above the average teacher. She has lived all her life within five miles of the Indian Reservation and I believe she knows how to deal with these children better than any teacher serving in my district. Her services should be retained as long as possible.\n\n\"Miss McKeough is a superior type of teacher and in a few short weeks she has furnished evident indications of progress. The conduct of the pupils is certainly better and the cleanliness and neatness of the children is apparent.\"\n\nIf Miss McKeough's services are terminated - at the Afton\nat the Afton School at the end of the present academic year - June 30th, next - would it be in order, in view of her services, to transfer her, should there be a vacancy in another school in Nova Scotia?\n\nThe Department has no information concerning the age, qualifications and experience of Daniel McDonnell, whom Mr. Duff has nominated for the position, and I beg to suggest that he be requested to furnish this information.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI wrote some time ago inquiring for a few copies of records relating to Indian School papers and other matters but did not receive any reply and may be a few copies.

If his services would be satisfactory to the Department it is desired that he should be appointed as teacher for the above school.\n\nWill you kindly advise me further as soon as you obtain information as to his qualifications.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to request that you will interview Mr. Daniel MacDonnell, Heatherton, and ascertain from him his age, religion and also the teaching qualifications and experience which he possesses. You should advise the Department as soon as possible. Please state, also, if he is at present teaching in a white school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J.

MacDonald, teacher of the Afton Indian Day School, to take effect at the end of the present month, and nominating the services of Miss Christina Kennedy.\n\nThe Department wrote you on the 12th instant regarding this matter. I may say that a communication has also been received from Mr. Agent Cameron, in which he recommends the appointment of Miss Kennedy and states the qualifications and experience which she possesses. Mr. Agent Cameron is being notified today, by telegram, of the approval granted for Miss Kennedy's appointment. He is being requested to inform her and to arrange with her to begin duties when the school reopens after the Christmas holidays, on or about January 6th, next. In view of her qualifications, the Department is allowing salary at the rate of $70 per teaching month.\n\nIt is hoped that Miss Kennedy will meet with every success in her work at the Afton Indian Day School. Mr. Cameron is being requested to give her every possible assistance upon her taking up duties. It is noted that the local school inspector reports favourably regarding her capability as a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. J. McNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAntigonish, N.

It is also noted that the teacher, Miss Kennedy, is ill with this disease.\n\nThe Department regrets the illness at this school and hopes that the disease will run the usual course without any fatalities therefrom on the Reserve. The school may remain closed during the illness of the teacher. You might advise Mr. Agent Cameron accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. J. McNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAntigonish, N.S.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a return for \"After Indian Day School\" for quarter ending March 31st 1930. You will note the school was closed for some time due to the teacher taking Scarlet Fever, and an epidemic of measles among the school children. This illness the teacher made a great effort in getting away from the school where she was teaching, and it was unfortunate that she took Scarlet Fever after starting teaching. I think she will make a very capable teacher among the Indian children, and that we will be able to keep her.\n\nI do not know what the Department does in a case when the teacher loses some time on account of sickness, but I would recommend if the Department saw proper that they pay her for the full quarter, so that she might remain with the school next term. When she was sick, the children nearly all took the measles, and I am doubtful if she would have had any school were she able to teach.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nChristine M.

For these purposes you may proceed to get the wood cut, and the ground cleared, using your own judgement as to the area required in each case. In the meantime I shall communicate with the Department, to ascertain whether the whole acre should be cleared or not, and shall communicate the result to you in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nW.

The whole thing will cost about $75. I could not hire the Indians with a foreman (whom) to do the work. I understand the desks are not included in the Contract. I calculated that 24 desks each for two pupils ought to be sufficient now. The School house will require one very large stone or two smaller ones. These materials are required at base boards.

The price should not exceed the architect's estimate, which is $40.00.\n\nYou also state in the letter above quoted that the well needs to be repaired. You may have this done and the cost should not exceed your estimate, viz.-$20.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nW. G.

Apparently you have not carried out this suggestion and the Department would like you to do so, as it is too bad that the contractor should be kept out of his money owing to your failure to perform your part of the work. Be good enough to have this matter attended to at once, so that there may be no delay in making payment to the contractor.

The school has two very elaborate verandas, and the entire outline is such as will not allow it to be said that the structure is an eyesore among the beautiful surroundings.\n\nBeing entirely for the use of the Indians the building has, of course, been put up by the federal government and is a tribute to the usual thoroughness with which such necessary works are carried out.\n\nIn quite contrast to this splendid building is the shabby little hovel which serves as a schoolhouse for the children of the many farmers around. Small, inconveniently situated, and in every way unsuitable and altogether out of keeping with the more recent structures for the provision of education of the Indians.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Feb. | Lighting fires during November, December & January.

Deputy and Secretary\n\nPeter Durant, Esq.,\nAfton, N.S.\nOttawa, June 1, 1914.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to inform you that a letter has been received from H. J. Bond, Indian Superintendent, requesting the Department to return your deposit cheque in connection with the Bayfield School contract, and to inform you that this Department will be pleased to return this cheque as soon as you have put in place, the slate blackboards specified.\n\nThe Department is writing Peter Durant, who inspected this work, asking him why he passed this work as completed when the blackboards have not been provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Poirier, Esq.,\nDecouase, N.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nReferring to your letter #183163/5 under date of May 16th, I beg to say that I have gone into the matter to which you refer and have come to the conclusion that the cheapest way to get this work done is by contract.\n\nMr Donald McLellan of Heatherton has been on the ground and in communication with Mr Rogers the teacher and has offered to make the proposed changes in the present \"outhouse\" and also erect a second one for the sum of $40.00. This may seem large but I feel sure that if it is done on days work the work will cost as high as $50.00 as it would be necessary to have a foreman that would look for big wages and besides it is difficult to get labor that would have even a tolerable knowledge of Carpentering work, without paying a large wage. It would seem to me that any work done of this kind could be done cheaper by contract as I have always found it to be the case that where any Government work was going on, the work-men were inclined to make a long job of it.\n\nKindly let me know how you wish me to act in this matter. In this connection I might say that this work should be undertaken as soon as possible as the people will be at haymaking in about six or seven weeks time and cannot undertake any extra work.\n\nTrusting to hear from you in this matter at your convenience, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Cameron,\nPer.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo A.J.

Some of the shingles came off the roof, and I had to get him to patch it up before rain would get in. Last year when we painted the school, we did not stain the roof due to the shingles not being good. It will be necessary to shingle the school roof this year as the shingles are getting bad and slipping off. It will take about $75 to shingle it, and then it will have to be stained. I was making an estimate of what it would cost, and figured about $200. Besides one of the doors broke during a recent wind storm, and they are about six panes of glass broken, which would be about $30.00 extra.\n\nKindly advise if the Department is prepared to have them put down.

You should arrange for the purchase of the shingles, obtaining competitive prices, if possible, and you should see that a good grade of shingles is supplied. The work of putting on the shingles should be done by day labour, and Indians should be employed, if possible. You may also arrange to have a new door installed and any broken glass replaced. We note that you estimate the cost of the reshingling of the roof and the replacing of the broken door and glass to be approximately $220. The Department will expect you to see that a satisfactory job is completed.\n\nAfter this work has been completed, you should forward vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the material and for the labour employed.\n\nThe voucher which you submitted in favour of Murdock Cross will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

They laid stress on all kinds of work but especially emphasized outside work and playground equipment and supervision. The latter they put on a higher level.\nthen inside work, because it is so often neglected, and went on to explain how much easier and simpler it was to teach physically as well as mentally and morally than outside games or rather than three books or direct study.\n\nThey made a special offer to all teachers present; that is they will give a number of library books free to all schools putting three pieces of play equipment on the school grounds. Being\nSobch. I do not wish to let the free offer pass but take this opportunity to ask for same as I believe it will bring out as fine results as they mentioned and which you already know about. The equipment may consist of three of the following (1) sand pile (2) merry go round (3) jumping stands (4) parallel bars (5) valley ball (6) a substitute. I think three pieces could be constructed for a sum not to exceed ten dollars. Hopping this will meet with your approval. Yours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn L.

J. Cameron\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. McNeil\nInspector Indian Agencies\nEXTRACT from Report of Mr. Inspector A. F. Chaisson, dated May 12th, 1930, on his inspection of the AFTON Indian Day School.\n\nOne Building:\n\nSuggestions Regarding Repairs:\n\nThe section of stovepipe leading from the stove nearest the teacher's desk is in poor condition and should be replaced. The lower panels in the front door of school are split and partially torn away and, unless given attention, will not last much longer.\n\nThe front steps of the school are broken, the bottom step being supported at present by wire and a few light sticks. I should say that it is unsafe. Three boards ought to be replaced in the entrance platform as they have worn and rotted through. One pane of glass needs to be replaced in the front door and another in a small window next the stockroom. The ceiling of the school-room ought to be whitened. At present, it is very dingy and whitening would result in a much more pleasant room, and presumably a valuable psychological effect on the children's work.\n\nSchool grounds in good condition. Outside of the points mentioned, the plant is in good condition.\n\nGeneral Remarks: Certain suggestions for improvement have been made under the preceding heading. The teacher would like to have a baseball bat and two softballs for the boys. A swing for the girls would also be well worth while and if it were possible to erect one in the school grounds, I think that it would be an asset. The teacher would like to have 25 tin drinking cups for individual use by the students. At present, they must use the same one or drink out of their hand as I observed some doing. I think that the use of such cups, in addition to promoting sanitation, would also have an educational effect.\nOttawa, May 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Afton Indian Day School, states that the following repairs are required in order to place the school in good condition:\n\n\"The section of stovepipe leading from the stove nearest the teacher's desk is in poor condition and should be replaced. The lower panels in the front door of school are split and partially torn away and, unless given attention, will not last much longer. The front steps of the school are broken, the bottom step being supported at present by wire and a few light sticks. I should say that it is unsafe. Three boards ought to be replaced in the entrance platform as they have worn and rotted through. One pane of glass needs to be replaced in the front door and another in a small window next the stockroom. The ceiling of the schoolroom ought to be whitened. At present, it is very dingy. Whitening would result in a much more pleasant room, and presumably a valuable psychological effect on the children's work.\"\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to have the repairs required as mentioned by the Inspector carried out at the earliest possible date. You should arrange for the purchase of any materials required in the carrying out of the repairs and for the labour. It is expected that you will see no unnecessary expenditure is incurred and that all work is satisfactorily completed. After these repairs have been carried out, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that 24 enamel drinking cups be supplied for the individual use of the pupils. You may arrange for the purchase of this number of cups and have them delivered at the school. If hooks are required on which to hang same, you may also make the purchase and have the hooks installed.\n\nThe Department is ordering two indoor baseballs and bats, and will forward same to the teacher. One of these outfits is for the use of the boys and the other for the use of the girls.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton, N.S.\n\nA. S.

As this school is located on the main highway, it would redound very much to the credit of the Department to have these grounds put in proper condition and also greatly improve the appearance of the premises. I understand that in the past these grounds have been cleared but during the last few years they have grown up again. However, I would suggest that another effort be made to improve them and that they be ploughed and seeded this fall.\n\nFor this purpose I would recommend that an expenditure of approximately $100.00 be allowed please and in future we shall put a little work on them every year so as to keep them in a proper and attractive condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 18, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, requesting authority to incur an expenditure of approximately $100 in improving the grounds around the Afton Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that our funds this present fiscal year are extremely limited and we will be unable to provide the expenditure asked for.

You may arrange with Michael Prosper, an Indian, to supply the posts and do the work, and the cost should not exceed the above authorized amount.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Armstrong, Trust Fund & Relief Branch, regarding his visit to the Antigonish County Agency on August 2nd and 3rd, 1935.\n\nOriginal on File 77-46.\n\nI visited the Afton School. I found it in very good shape except that the walls are very dirty and should be cleaned. The desks have been scrubbed so often that the varnish has been removed due to the use of soft soap. Possibly, the desks could be re-varnished and the floors painted. A number of windows in this school have been broken and will have to be replaced.\nOttawa, September 19th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nFollowing his recent visit to the Afton Indian Day School, Mr. Armstrong of this Department reports that the walls are very dirty. He also states that the desks should be re-varnished and the floors painted. Please let me know, as soon as possible, the approximate cost of doing the work suggested by Mr. Armstrong.\n\nHe also states that a number of the windows have been broken. If these have not yet been replaced, you should make the necessary arrangements for doing so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Cameron, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHeatherton, N. S.\n\nPP/O'M.\nSir,\n\nI would ask authority to do some repair to the Otoni Indian Day School. The steps and platform on the two entrances are about gone, and require new ones. One of them is completely gone and the other one will require new covering. And they are a number of pairs of glass broken and one lost in the store is gone. The cost would not exceed $10.00.\n\nI would also ask authority to purchase ten tons of coal for the school. This has to be bought locally, as only one man Duncan went today in a car of coal for a few in the district.\n\nI remain yours,\n\nResident Secretary\n\nThe Secretary\nDept.

H. Purdy, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nBear River, N.S.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that the Reverend Mr. McLean, the Spiritual Advisor of the Indians on the Reserve at Bear River, has asked me to make a change in the teacher on the reserve.\n\nHe says he has reasons for the change he made and will hold himself responsible for the same.\n\nThere is a female teacher that will take the place of Miss Barlow.\n\nMiss Barlow has given satisfactory as a teacher; there has not been any charge made against her.\n\nI told him I would await orders from the Department.\n\nPlease reply as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJas. H. Purde\nAgent\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. M.

H. Purdy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River, N.S.\nExtract from teacher's report on the Bear River school for the year ending March 31, 1910.\n\nSickness, sending or taking children begging, going away from Reserve during warm weather, occasionally will keep pupils at home if corrected in school. If the Indians could be induced to remain on the Reserve and cultivate the land so as to have produce for the winter, I think they would be far better off than now. If they were put under some compulsory law in regard to their children attending school, I think would be a benefit to them. Of course, the people are very poor, therefore, in the spring, having no farm implements and no seeds, or fertilizer, or anything needed for farming, they take their families to the seashore. I think if they could be supplied with the above for one or two years, making them understand that from year to year, to try produce their own seeds for future use, as well as what they want to use in their homes, more of them would remain on Reserve, at least, if they would remain until closing of the school for summer vacation.\nOttawa, March 15th, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nReferring to your annual report on the Bear River School I beg to say that your remarks with reference to enforcing the compulsory attendance of children have been noted. The Department, however, is not prepared to place the regulations in force on this reserve until all other means have failed.\n\nOne of the first essentials is that the teacher should obtain the confidence of the parents. This can only be done by visiting their homes and impressing upon them the necessity of taking advantage of the facilities provided by the Department for the education of their children.\n\nIn many of our Indian schools the teachers are giving instruction in sewing and in some cases, where considered advisable, provisions are supplied to give a light mid-day meal. The Department would like to know whether you consider the teaching of sewing would be an incentive to more regular attendance and, if so, whether you would be prepared to take up this work if the necessary materials were provided.\n\nYou will be good enough to report fully on the conditions of the homes of these Indians and whether there is any necessity for the provision of a mid-day meal by the Department.\n\nMiss Minnie A. Sheppard,\nTeacher,\nBear River, N.S.\nYour suggestions in reference to assistance to the parents themselves will be dealt with on another file.\n\nIn your report you state that your teacher's certificate is in the Indian Department at Ottawa. Be good enough to state when this certificate was forwarded and to whom, as there is no record of its being received in connection with your appointment to the Bear River School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nBear River, Apr. 26th, 1910\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI handed the Indian Agent a full report of what was purchased for the Bear River Indian School, Saturday last, 24th, to be forwarded by said Agent, Monday, Apr. 25th.\n\nPerhaps I did not make quite plain the cost of lunches for five days, for one pupil.\n\nAs I stated,\n\n1 lunch cost about $3 \\frac{2}{3}$ cents,\n5 lunches ... $5 \\times 3 \\frac{2}{3} = 18 \\frac{1}{3}$ cents.\n\nThis note is in reference to yours of the 15th inst., No. 118347/1.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nM. A. Shea, Teacher.\nI think it is a mistaken idea to think the children are destitute in regard to skirt and shirts. There are families sending children to school who would feel indignant to hear this accusation.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\nIndian teacher requests three weeks leave absence to convey invalid mother Boston would make up time teaching in vacation please wire instructions.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Indian Sup't.\nOttawa, May 13, 1910.\n\nA. J. Boyd,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBear River, N.B.\n\nMiss Shea may have three weeks vacation now.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nCharge to Dept. of I.A.\nTo The Department Of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa:\n\nI am now writing upon two points in regard to the school on Indian Hill.\n\nThe school reopened Sept. 19th instead of the 25th of Aug. I was ready, and half-way on my road to Bear River, when I was informed, that the work on the schoolhouse was not far enough advanced, for me to begin teaching.\n\nThe first week was very damp and cold, the stove was not up; I spoke about it and thought it would be up by Friday, so did not go up to the school-house on Thursday, as I had just got over a severe attack of rheumatic neuralgia in my arm and shoulder; that is the reason I did not go to school. Monday morning I was a little late and made up all my time, by giving no recess, teaching part of my dinner-hour and after-school; I always make up any time I lose, on the same day; it does not happen very often.\n\nI am making these explanations for this reason: Mr. Pardee, the Agent, made one of his very few calls, on Monday, and it being the very first time, he did not find me at my post, he made complaints to two parties about me and my time. I was afraid, he did not understand; and as he said, \"he had a big report to send in to Ottawa,\" I thought better for me to\nexplain my affairs to the Department.\n\nI trust and hope, that the delay in opening the school will not prevent me getting my salary; dear Sir, my circumstances are certainly in a bad condition in regard to finance. I am trying to provide for an income another, so as not to have to send her away and for a sister to take care of her; then having to pay board and other expenses, you see, how I would be situated.\n\nThe pictures of His and Her Majesties, King George V and Queen Mary, the Indians are framing and will hang them in the most prominent part of the school-room.\n\nThe school-house is all that can be desired; I am just delighted with all parts of it; no fault can be found.\n\nI pay particular attention to the Calisthenics and note an improvement in pupils' shoulders already.\n\nAm I still to continue to give the pupils the mid-day lunch? they are doing well in sewing.\n\nAm I asking too much, when I ask you, if you could please send my cheque direct to myself.\n\nI try to use utmost ability, to do my work faithfully and correctly in every point.\n\nTrusting all the above, will be satisfactory and hoping to be corrected if in any fault,\n\nI remain Yours obediently,\n\nMinnie A. Shea,\nTeacher, Indian Ville.\n\nBear River,\nWigley Co. S.\nOttawa, October 7, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that your explanations with reference to the re-opening of the Bear River school are satisfactory. I may add that no report was received from Mr. Purdy and on the quarterly return he himself explained the reasons for the delay.\n\nWith reference to the mid-day lunch the Department thinks when the weather becomes colder it would be well to again commence giving a simple meal. Be good enough to state what supplies you think would be most suitable.\n\nAs requested the cheque for your last quarter's salary has been sent direct to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Minnie A. Shea,\nTeacher,\nBear River, N.S.\nTo The Department of Indian Affairs:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am now sending you a list of what I think would be needed to give the pupils of Bear River Indian School, for one week.\n\n1 lb. bacon .22\n2 qts. beans .16\n1 lb. pork .20\n5 loaves bread @ 15 cents per loaf\n1 can milk .12 would last two weeks.\n1/2 lb. tea .15.\n\nNow, in regard to the cooking of the meals, if there was a small cooking stove put in the school house, I could help the children in teaching them plain cooking.\n\nThe above would be a costly way to buy, as everything is so high in price; but if bought in quantity, would be some cheaper.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nMinnie A. Shea.\n\nBear River,\nDigby Co.,\nN.S.\n\nAge about 8\nOttawa, November 3, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department considers it advisable to re-commence the serving of a mid-day meal at the Bear River school during the winter months. Miss Shea, the teacher, has submitted to the Department a list of the supplies that she thinks it well to purchase and she estimates that the cost will not exceed $1.50 a week. You may, therefore, consult with Miss Shea and purchase for her the articles which she mentioned in her recent communication to the Department.\n\nThe teacher has suggested that it would be well to purchase a small cooking stove in order that she might teach the girls cooking. The Department would be pleased to have your views on this matter and you might ascertain the cost of a suitable stove for this purpose.\n\nSupplies that are not perishable should be purchased in sufficient quantities at one time to last for several weeks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJas. H. Purdy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River, N.C.\nNovember 23, 1910\n\nBear River, Light County, Nova Scotia\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to yours of the 3rd Nov in reference to the Mid-day Meal, would say I have consulted with Miss Shea and have purchased messay supplies, we have commenced serving the same on the 21st Nov.\n\nIn regard to a cooking stove, it would cost $16.50 extra pipe and labour advance, in all $20.00. Don't think it would heat the room more than the one we have now will do all that is required except baking the bread. We came to the conclusion to not do without it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJno. H. Purdy\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. L. McLean\nActing Deputy an Sec.\nOTTAWA, NOVEMBER 28, 1910.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department notes that it has been decided to do without a cooking stove at the Bear River school at the present time.\n\nThe Department is pleased to learn that the usual midday meal is again being served.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJas. H. Purdy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River, N.S.\nOttawa, November 3, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 21st ultimo I beg to say that the Department has decided to give a mid-day meal to the pupils of the Bear River school during the winter and the Agent, Mr. Purdy, has been instructed to purchase for you the articles mentioned in your letter and also ascertain the cost of a suitable cooking stove.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Minnie A. Chen,\nTeacher,\nBear River, N.S.\nJanuary 25, 1912\n\nBear River, Digby Co., Nova Scotia.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to inform the deptl. that the teacher of Bear River Indian Reserve School, Mrs. Moore, was taking sick on the close of Christmas holidays, hoping to be well enough to resume labour, but failing to do so, has sent in her resignation as they want a Catholic, and at this time it seems hard to get one. Kindly inform me how to proceed in the matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Dept.,\nIndian Agent\n\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, January 29, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant advising the Department that the teacher of the Bear River School has resigned.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should forward to the Department this resignation to be placed on file. You will be good enough to communicate with the Missionary with a view to securing the services of another teacher, who should be of the Roman Catholic faith and have proper qualifications. Any applications that you receive for the position should be forwarded to the Department for consideration and no appointment should be made until you are advised. Kindly give this matter immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJas. H. Purdy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River, N.S.\nOttawa, March 5, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo in reference to the qualifications of the teachers whose services you are trying to secure for the Shubenacadie and Bear River schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, provided these gentlemen will not accept the positions at the salary offered by you, you are authorized to increase the initial salary to $400.00 per annum. In Mr. Grumley's case a further condition is that it is his intention to continue at the work for at least a reasonable length of time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nSir,\n\nI regret exceedingly having to report Mr. D. McIl. Gillis of Antigonish, the teacher whom I had engaged to take charge of the school at Bear River, N.S., died on the 14th inst., as the result of an acute attack of pneumonia.\n\nI hardly knew where to look for another teacher that would likely go to Bear River at this date, but will do my best to find one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa\nOttawa, March 29, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets to learn of the death of Mr. D. McK. Gillis, the teacher whom you had engaged to take charge of the Bear River School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, June 17, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIn addition to the general instructions given you in connection with your work as Indian Agent it is desired to add the following respecting schools.\n\nThe Department wishes you to pay particular attention to this very important feature. As Indian Agent you are the official who will directly represent the Department and the success of the school in your agency will depend to a large extent upon your cooperation with the teacher. It is noted that where there are capable teachers and enthusiastic agents the Indian schools compare favourably with white schools similarly situated.\n\nYou should visit the Bear River school at least monthly. The buildings and surroundings should be kept in good repair. Authority should be obtained before any expenditure is incurred, unless in cases where the sum of money involved is small and delay would cause inconvenience.\n\nAll requisitions for school material and supplies and returns of various kinds should be forwarded by the teacher through your office.\n\nYou should use your influence with the parents to obtain a regular attendance. A copy of the rules and regulations relating to the education of Indian children is sent you herewith.\n\nAt the end of each month you should submit a report.\n\nR. A. Harris, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River, N.S.\nreport on the school on the form provided, a supply of which is being sent you. Recently the subjects of calisthenics and hygiene were added to the curriculum and I would ask you to see that they are given due attention and refer to the matter in your reports.\n\nShould you desire any further information you should correspond with the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, June 26, 1912.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant advising the Department that Miss Thibodeau has resigned her position as teacher of the Bear River School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is writing to Mr. Boyd, Indian Superintendent, advising him to endeavour to obtain the services of a competent successor. It would be well for you also at the same time to make inquiries having the same object in view. No action, however, must be taken to make an appointment without the express approval of the Department. The salary allowed for a competent teacher with proper certificates will be $400.00 per annum. Any applications received by you should be submitted with as little delay as possible to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. A. Harris, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River, N.S.\nOttawa, June 26, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Miss Thibodeau, who was recently appointed teacher of the Bear River School, has resigned. It will be necessary to secure a successor and the Department will be glad if you will make inquiries with this object in view. A salary of $400.00 per annum will be allowed for a competent teacher with proper certificates, but no appointment should be made without the expressed approval of the Department. This is to avoid any misunderstanding as the Agent, Mr. Harris, is also being instructed to endeavour to secure the services of a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

The reason the school hasn't been visited before now is that I called away at that time as diphtheria had been circulating in this country district through before leaving. I left instructions with the medical doctor Mr. C. A. Campbell should diphtheria break out on the reserve to take all the necessary precautions also for three or thirty-five close the school though they did not do so.

D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. A. Harris, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River, N.S.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR FOSTER ON THE BEAR RIVER DAY SCHOOL.\n\nTEACHER, - Mary Agatha McGinty.\n\nMiss McGinty seems to be doing fair work. There are a few facts however that I wish to report on. In the first place, Miss McGinty seemed to think it was undue interference, on my part in visiting her school. Her manner was \"crusty\" and by no means pleasing to me.\n\nHer register is not marked daily. I called Friday and there was no attendance marked for the week. She stated she could trust her memory for that period. Again pupils are marked for an entire day, always. There were no half days in Miss McGinty's register nor were the proper marks given for tardiness. I would recommend that Indian teachers certify to the correctness of their register under oath.\n\nSchool opens at 9.30 and closes at 12 with no recreation period. It opens in the afternoon at 1.30 and closes at 3.30. I would recommend a short recreation period especially in the forenoon session.\n\nReport dated, November 10th, 1916.\nOttawa, November 20th, 1916.\n\nMiss M.A. McGinty,\nTeacher\nBear River Day Sch.\nBear River, N.S.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report on your school by Inspector Foster. He is the authorized inspector of the Bear River school and the Department expects you to extend him every courtesy when he visits the school.\n\nThe Inspector states that the register is not correctly marked. If you consult the inside cover of the register supplied by the Department, you will find full explanations as to the manner in which the register should be kept. The register should be marked daily.\n\nA copy of the Indian day school regulations is enclosed in this letter and you will notice that the morning session should be from 9 A.M. to 12 noon and the afternoon session from 1 P.M. to 4 P.M. with a recess during each session of not less than 15 and not more than 20 minutes. The Department is informed that you do no allow recess. In future, you will be expected to adhere strictly to the regulations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nOttawa, November 21, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nInspector Foster recently visited the Bear River Day School. He reports to the Department that the teacher did not receive him very graciously.\n\nMiss McGinty is being informed that Mr. Foster is the authorized inspector of this school and every courtesy should be extended to him.\n\nThe inspector further states that the register is not being kept correctly and that no recess is allowed the pupils.\n\nThe Department has forwarded the teacher a copy of the Day School Regulations with instructions to carry out these regulations in regard to the school hours and also to mark the register daily.\n\nYou will be good enough to see that Miss McGinty carries out the instructions sent her. A copy of the Indian Day School Regulations is enclosed here-with.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nR. A. Harris, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River,\nN. B.\nOttawa, December 2, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in reference to the period which you open and close the Indian day school at Bear River each teaching day.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your explanations regarding this matter, the Department will consent to your continuing during the winter months, or until March 31st, next, teaching the same hours as at present. Mr. Agent Harris will be informed accordingly.\n\nThe Department will, however, expect you to keep the daily register of attendance correctly and to fill in the attendance, etc., each day.\n\nThe Department hopes that you will extend every courtesy to the Inspector on the occasion of his visits to your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss M. A. McGinty,\nTeacher,\nBear River Day School,\nBear River, N.S.\nOttawa, December 2, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to official letter of the 21st ultimo in regard to the time of opening and closing the Bear River Day School by Miss McGinty, the present teacher, I beg to say that the Department is in receipt of a communication from the teacher, in which she states that, owing to the distance which she has to walk each day to and from the school, she wishes to be allowed to continue to conduct this school during the same hours as she has been doing in the past. The Department has agreed to allow her this privilege during the winter months, or until March 31st, next.\n\nNo further action need, therefore, be taken by you in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If they do not do so you should enforce the regulations strictly.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear from you in the near future stating what steps you have taken in carrying out these instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nR.

S.\nIndian Agent Office\nBear River, Dec 3rd, 1917\n\nSir,\n\nIn writing the draft relating to the school, the teacher has requested me to give her school a Christmas tree at the close of the school for holidays and would also request the amount of $5.00 for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. A. Harris, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River, N.S.\nSir,\n\nreferring to your letter of Nov 28th, 1917, in reference to the report of Inspector Foster, who visited the Bear River School on Nov 8th and reports very poor attendance, I beg to say that Inspector Foster is correct in saying the poor attendance is due on the part of the parents and I find it is largely impossible to get the parents the importance of sending their children regularly when Inspector Foster visited the school there were only three children present on Nov 8th.\n\nWhen I visited the school on Nov 8th there were eight children present a very good attendance out of nine on the roll. Since your letter of Nov 28th instant, in regard to what steps I had taken in enforcing the regulations strictly, I beg to say that I have told every parent that the regulations would be enforced if their children did not attend more regular and trust that the attendance will done what better.\n\nN. A.

She reports that Miss Gorman has offered the school or the 3rd student Miss Gorman would help the staff to send her a school handbook or the course of study. Something for a guide to teach from.\n\nThe above inquiry was that she has no money to pay her board until she gets her first quarter salary, and she requests that she be boarded until she pays weekly.

Harris\nIndian Agent\n\n[Signature]\n\nExtract\n\nThe Secretary\nOffice of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nRelating to Bear River Indian School I beg to report that I am closing the school until the 28th instant. All schools and churches in this town have been closed on account of the Spanish flu, which at the present time is quite severe in this town; although at this time there is no case on the reserve, so I am taking all precautions & have their houses fumigated and kept by themselves, trusting this will meet the approval of the Office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nK. A. Harris\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of hand of Oct 28th instant, relating to Miss O'Byrne who had been removed by the Indians. I say that I wrote the letter on Oct 29th, but I did not receive any reply. Miss O'Byrne informed me that she had not heard from the chief yet.\n\nMiss O'Byrne informed me that she had not heard from the chief yet. She was told that she would be sent back to school from the 1st to be opened on the 2nd instant or account of the Indians.\n\nOn Oct 26th Miss O'Byrne informed me that she was boarding that they were sick and could not keep her busy longer, and that she could not find any boarding place to take myself and the boys. She said she had to get away to say the least until I can find her a place, she could not get back on the reserve, but she could associate with them, and I said she would have to go to school, I am afraid it will be hard for Miss O'Byrne to make a success in teaching as she won't associate with the Indians. But under these circumstances I must say that the Indians in this reserve are of a very low class & should be treated...\nSir,\n\nthat other place, I found that Miss Howard was of a high class of Indians that made it hard for her, but the Indians here think they are as good as her.\n\nMiss Howard told me she would be glad to have taught this school until she had paid back the debt what they had spent on her, so it looks that another teacher will have to be got\n\nany further information she might wish, she will be glad to report.\n\nyour obedient servant,\nR. A. Harris\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSchools Branch -\n\nPlease let me have a report with reference to the Bear River school, giving the salary of the teacher who is at present employed; since what date; and what sort of reports there are as to her work. I would also like to know whether or not Miss McGinty, the former teacher, gave satisfactory service.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nI think it well to give you some further information in regard to these two teachers.\n\nOn the 15th of April, last, Mr. Agent Harris notified the Department that Miss Agatha McGinty had informed him that she would not be able to take this school after the end of the June term.\n\nOn the 17th of April of this year Mr. Superintendent Boyd wrote the Department stating that he understood that Miss McGinty, Indian teacher at Bear River School, had resigned her position and, if so, he would recommend that Miss Agnes E. Gorman, an Indian girl from Berwick, who had obtained a Grade \"D\" Diploma from the Normal School at Truro, N.S., and the cost of whose education and maintenance had been borne by the Department, should be appointed to succeed her. Mr. Agent Harris also recommended Miss Gorman's appointment. The Department informed Mr. Harris that Miss McGinty's resignation would be accepted and that it would approve of the appointment of Miss Gorman, her duties to commence on the re-opening of the school after the summer holidays.\n\nHe was also told that the Department had paid for this girl's clothing while she had attended the Normal School, on the understanding that when she began to teach she should refund the money so expended, which amounted to about $90.00. The Department decided, however, to only ask her to refund $75.00. Mr. Harris was informed that if she took charge of the school the sum of $25.00 would be deducted from her her salary each quarter for the first three quarters she teachers to make up this amount.\n\nThe great difficulty at this school is to obtain a suitable boarding place for the teacher. Miss McGinty was forced to live in an hotel about a mile and a half from the school. The white family with whom Miss Gorman was living took sick and could not keep her any longer and she was unable to find suitable accommodation, as the white families object to boarding an Indian and she would not live with the Indians on the reserve. The Agent states that the Indians of this reserve are of a very low class and he does not blame Miss Gorman for not wanting to live with them. He also states that Miss Gorman would like to have stayed on until she had paid back what the Department had spent on her, but that it looks as if another teacher will have to be found.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nIn reply to your memorandum of the 12th instant with reference to the Bear River School I beg to say that the salary of the present teacher, Miss Agnes E. Gorman, is at the rate of $400.00 per annum, which is the amount paid to the previous teacher for the past six years.\n\nMiss Gorman took charge of this school on the 2nd of September, last, and in his report on this school for the month of September, last, Mr. Agent Harris states that the attendance during the month has been the best that it has been for months and he trusts that it will continue. Mr. Foster, the Public School Inspector, in a report on this school dated the 8th ultimo, states as follows: \"Miss Gorman is a young, inexperienced girl. On this, my first visit, I endeavoured to give her as much aid as possible in planning her work and as to method in teaching. With experience she will likely become an efficient teacher.\"\n\nThere are fifteen children of school age on the reserve, fourteen of whom are enrolled, and there was an average attendance of 10.4 for the month of September.\n\nThe school was closed on the 16th ultimo on account of the epidemic of influenza and has not been re-opened, so far as I am aware.\n\nWith regard to Miss McGinty, the former teacher, I beg to say that she had charge of this school from September 3rd, 1912, until the end of the June quarter, of this year. The average enrolment for the six years that she was in charge was 12.5, with an average attendance of 7.7.\n\nMr. Morse and Mr. Foster, the Public School Inspectors, who visited this school while Miss McGinty was in charge, gave satisfactory reports on her work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, November 13, 1918.\nNovember 14th, 1918.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr Mitchell -\n\nWith reference to your enquiry regarding the Bear River school, I have to say that at present the teacher is Miss Agnes E. Gorman, who has been employed since the 2nd September last, and is paid a salary of $400.00 per annum, this being the amount paid the teacher of the school for the past six years. There are 15 children of school age on the reserve, 14 of whom are enrolled, and the average attendance for the month of September was 10.4. The school was closed on the 16th October on account of the influenza epidemic, and so far as I am aware is not yet reopened. The Public School Inspector in his report on this school states that Miss Gorman is a \"young inexperienced girl, but that she will likely become an efficient teacher.\" The attendance for the month of September was the best it has been for some time.\n\nWith reference to Miss McGinty, the former teacher, I have to say that she had charge of the school from September 1912 until the end of the June quarter 1918. The reports of her work as teacher are satisfactory.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nSir,\n\nI wrote the Dept Oct 29th 1918 stating that by next morning teacher on this reserve had to go home as she could not get a boarding place and had just received her salary as yet. I hope this may help to get a place for her but fear that we write people will board an Indians and have had an application for the school from being near the duty the former teacher that she would like to have the school again but would have to have $500 dollar in annual as she stated that board was so high in Bear River that she could not teach for less. An application is sent to the Royal Indian Superintendent but have not had reply as yet.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. A. Harris\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nAccording to the statement of Mr. Agent Harris of Bear River to me, you are already aware that Miss Agnes E. Gorman, the teacher in charge of the Indian school there, had to close her school and go home to Berwick, Kings County, on account of not being able to get a suitable place - in fact any place - to board, simply because she is an Indian - a very insufficient reason, I should say.\n\nI was at Bear River quite recently and looked into the situation. As a result, I can see only one way out of the difficulty, namely, to provide her with a temporary residence on the reserve, if such can be had, so that she may keep house for herself, which I would recommend. There is just one vacant dwelling that would suit the purpose, but whether its owner, who is absent, would be willing to rent it for Miss Gorman's accommodation, I do not know at present. If the Department cannot give this proposed arrangement its approval, I presume Miss Gorman will be obliged to resign as teacher of the Bear River school, which I would regret.\n\nAwaiting your instructions in this case, I am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 26, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 16th and 18th instant in regard to Miss Agnes Gorman, who has been teaching the Bear River Indian School, and recommending that she be transferred to the Eskasoni School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to give Miss Gorman a trial at the Eskasoni School and will pay her at the same rate as at Bear River, viz.\u2014$400.00 per annum.\n\nIn your letter you state that a teacher has applied for the Bear River School. If Miss Gorman accepts the position at Eskasoni you may appoint the teacher to whom you refer to the Bear River School and she will be paid a salary at the rate of $450.00 per annum for her services.\n\nKindly advise the Department as to the action you take in regard to the appointment of teachers for these two schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. A. Harris, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River, N.S.\nMEMO.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss Mary A. McGinty, who is in charge of the Indian school at Bear River, N.S., and who has been its teacher for upwards of six years, with the exception of a break covering a part of the present term, in which she makes a plea for recognition in the matter of bounty allowed by the Department to some Indian teachers for the fiscal year 1918-19, and I have decided to write you in her behalf. I am aware that her claim in that respect is rather defective, according to the terms on which the bounty was granted; but if an exception can possibly be made in any case, I think it should be done in hers for more than one reason.\n\nIn my estimation she ranks as one of the most successful, if not the most successful, of our Indian teachers in Nova Scotia, and the fact might well be appreciated in a tangible way. She always gave herself whole-heartedly to her duties, and, as a result, after six years of strenuous and very satisfactory work, her health began to fail. A period of rest was prescribed as necessary in her case, so that it became, one might say, physically impossible for her to retain her position. Therefore, she had to resign her school at the end of the last term, not from choice, but from necessity. After a few months of rest, which restored her to normal health, she applied to be reinstated in her former position whenever the opportunity offered. Under these circumstances, I submit that her plea might be favourably considered by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

With the high cost of clothing and traveling expenses it is rather a hard question to get along on less than three hundred a year. I wish the Dept. would consider this for me so that I can arrange for my boarding house before I leave here.\n\nI would like also for the Dept. to advance me Fifty Dollars of my quarters pay, that I may pay my board before leaving the place.\n\nThank you for your kindness to me.\n\nI remain very respectfully yours,\n\nMary A.

McGinty, teacher of the Bear River Indian Day School, to take effect June 1st, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is regretted that Miss McGinty finds it necessary to give up duties at this time. Her resignation, however, is accepted, but we would prefer that, if possible, she remain and complete the balance of the school year. If she is not able to complete the present school year, this school will have to remain closed during the month of June, as it will hardly be possible to obtain the services of a teacher for that time.\n\nI also acknowledge the application of Mrs. Rose L. Ford, at present teacher of the New Germany Indian Day School, to be transferred to succeed Miss McGinty at Bear River. This transfer to take effect when the school reopens after the summer holidays, or about September 1st, next. Mrs. Ford should remain at New Germany and complete the present school year at that point. In making this transfer Mrs. Ford will be allowed salary at the rate of $450 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law. She receives salary as teacher at New Germany at the rate of $400 per annum and in making this transfer she will receive an increase of $50.00. Kindly inform Mrs. Ford of the approval being granted for her transfer to take charge of the Bear River School after the coming summer holidays, on or about September 1st, next.\n\nAs stated above, if Miss McGinty cannot remain until the end of June, the school will have to remain closed during that month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

She should inform me that it is impossible to get board at a private house in Bear River. The rate at the hotels is $7.00 per week which she says she can't afford. And the best she can do is to get some lodging the day would cost her $5.00 a month for four rooms quite near the station.\n\nMiss Scott would like very much for the staff to pay for her board and five board school, which should cost about $10.00 during the quarter and about $5.00 a month.\n\nYours obedient servant\n\nR.

This will allow her a salary from the above date at the rate of $500 per annum.\n\nIt is expected, in view of this increase, that Mrs. Ford will not only arrange to pay the rental of the rooms she has engaged but will also provide any wood she may require.

I am very grateful to the Dept. and also thankful to you.\n\nMy house is now in trouble again. I haven't received my bonus for six months. Do you think the Dept has withdrawn it? I'm almost afraid they have. If so, I do not see how I shall meet expenses as you know I have two children to care for. I may appear greedy to the Dept., but if they thoroughly understood my circumstances they'd feel otherwise.\n\nMiss McReynolds got $6.50 including bonus. She claimed high board & long distance were some of reasons for resigning.\nPrices haven't dropped very much and it may be I am worrying without a cause. I only hope I am not the chief may have gone astray or it might be an oversight of Dept.

As soon as Mrs. Ford's returns for the current quarter are received, a cheque for the amount of salary due at the increased rate allowed, together with a cheque for bonus due for the months of September, October, November and December, will be sent.\n\nIt is noted that Mrs. Ford is satisfied with the increase in salary allowed her, which is to be applied towards the payment of rental for living quarters for her use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You will recall that on February 4th I advised you that Mrs. Ford was ill and unable to attend to her duties at the School. She resumed her duties on February 22nd but is evidently not yet in the best of health. Mr. Harris has recommended that she be allowed the sum of $10.00 to help defray the cost of car hire going to and from the Reserve.

The Dr., who has been treating it, thought all would be well by Sept. 1, now he feels the eye should rest a little longer.\n\nIf agreeable to you and the Dept., I am having Wilson - my son - work in my place for a few weeks. He is a College Grad. and holds Superior first-class Licence & has had experience.\n\nHe will open school Sept. 4.\n\nThe Dept. has always been very kind any time I have been ill and I feel sure they will not mind Wilson temporarily for me.\n\nThe children loose so much time in winter months from colds & want of proper clothing that it would be a great pity for school to be closed during the warm weather.\n\nYou know times are very hard and I do not want to loose my position and have no other means of earning my living.\n\nIf you will please notify the Dept., and I only hope this will be agreeable to you & the Dept.\n\nI am sincerely,\n\nRosie L.

Mrs. Ford has been a good teacher and it would be a pity to lose her services from the school here.\n\nShe asks that her son be allowed to substitute for her for a few weeks.\n\nI feel sure that this arrangement would be satisfactory to all concerned as this young man is very capable and has worked his way through college. But owing to scarcity of work in this part of the country he has been unable to secure a position.\n\nI would recommend that Miss Ford's request be granted and that her son Wilson Ford be allowed to substitute for her until such time as her health will allow her to resume her duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nH.C.

Although there\nwere only three pupils in Grade III he had this\ngrade split in two classes. The same was true\nwith Grade V.\n\nI recommend that if Mrs. Ford fails to\nimprove in health and it becomes necessary to name\nher successor, that this appointment be not given\nto Mr. Ford. I am not urging, however, any\nimmediate change.

Mrs. Ford teaching at Indian Day School.\n\nI do not think Mrs. Ford will be able to teach her school at the beginning of this New Year.\n\nI called on her and she does not seem to have much improved in health.\n\nShe admitted herself that she did not think she could be able to take the school very soon but rather than lose this position she would have a try at it after the holidays. But I do not think this would be a good idea as I am sure she could not stand the walks to and from the Reserve.\n\nI do not understand why Mr. Foster should find fault with Wilson. Finds attitude as he is only beginning to teach and by way of training is making a good show at it. There has been a better attendance since he has had the school and the children seem to take more interest in their studies.\nI would recommend that if possible the teaching arrangement of the Bear River Indian Day School be allowed to go on as it is at least until the end of the term in June 1935.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nF.C.

Wickwire,\nAssistant Private Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Miss Wickwire,\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo requesting to be advised if Mrs. Ross Ford, teacher of the Bear River Indian Day School, N.S., would be entitled to superannuation or a gratuity in the event of her retirement.\n\nTeachers in Indian schools are wholly exempt from the operation of the Civil Service Act and are classed as temporary civil servants and, as such, do not come under the Superannuation Act for permanent employees of the Federal Government. A teacher of an Indian school, who has had 10 years' continuous employment, would be entitled, upon retirement, to a gratuity equal to two months' salary - this being the only provision made for teachers upon their retirement. As Mrs. Ford has given 17 years' service as teacher in the Indian school at Bear River, she would be entitled, in the event of her retirement, to a gratuity of two months' salary.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.J. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary\n\nMiss Alice Wickwire,\nAssistant Private Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue,\nOTTAWA.\nMrs. Ford\n\nJune 7/1876\n\nin June 1937\n\n= 61 years\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDR. MCGILL.\n\nBear River Indian Day School (Digby County).\nTeacher: Mrs. Rose L. Ford.\n\nI found this building to be in a fair state of repair.\nThere were 15 on the roll, and an average attendance of 12.\n\nThe teacher has been employed by the Department for 21\u00bd years. She is getting fairly well up in years and finds it very difficult to walk from town to the school, which is quite a distance, and most of the time, unless she gets a ride, she has to hire a taxi. This costs her 35 cents a day. She is under the impression that the Department should help her to bear some of this cost.\n\nShe also took up with me the matter of her retirement, as she feels that she cannot continue as teacher very much longer. Some one evidently advised her that she would be entitled to a pension. I, however, informed her that, as far as I am aware, teachers do not come under the Permanent Civil Service. Therefore, she would not be entitled to a pension when she retires. I, however, promised her to take this up, and I would ask that she be written to by the Training Division and also that, if possible, some help be given her to bear the cost of her transportation.\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nEX'L.\n\nOttawa, June 11th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn the occasion of his recent visit to the Bear River Indian Day School, the teacher requested Mr. M. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, that an allowance be made for her transportation from her home to the school. I regret that present regulations do not permit the Department incurring such an expenditure.\n\nMrs. Ford also mentioned to Mr. Christianson the question of securing superannuation in the event of her retirement as teacher. Teachers in Indian schools are wholly exempt from the operation of the Civil Service Act and are classed as temporary civil servants. As such, they do not contribute to the Superannuation Fund and, consequently, cannot benefit from this fund.\n\nThe only provision made for teachers upon their retirement is to allow a retiring gratuity equal to two (2) months' salary. In the event of Mrs. Ford retiring, she would be entitled to receive this gratuity. Please inform her accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. E. Darres, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River, N. S.\nBeaver River, N.B.\nJune 17, 1937\n\nMr. S. E. Davies\nBeaver River,\n\nI received your letter with enclosed reply from the Dept., to my appeal to Mr. Christianson when here. It surely wasn't very encouraging.\n\nI had hoped the Dept. would allow me a few dollars more a month on my salary to help pay cost of living. They may think I'm too lazy to work but my arthritis trouble a few years ago kept me in bed three months and for two years I've had to have a taxi bring me up. Thirty-five cents a trip takes quite a slice off my salary.\n\nThe nurses and officials who visit the reserve and school always come in a car therefore do not realize what a climb it is.\n\nNo doubt the Dept. thinks I'm an old fool so I'll not bother them any more.\n\nI hope to continue to teach as long as my health permits and when I have to resign, I'll secure the Dept.'s will stand well and not turn me down in my old years.\n\nWhen you visit the reserve, I notice you arrange to go down about school closing time and give me a ride, which I appreciate very much.\n\nThanking you for all.\n\nI am sincerely,\n\nR. L. Ford\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing a letter from the Indian Day school teacher, Mrs R Ford. I thought probably in her case of having to far to walk and all up hill that you might reconsider this matter.

L. Ford, teacher of the Bear River Indian Day School.\n\nAs pointed out in official letter of June 11th, present regulations will not permit our making allowance for the transportation of Mrs. Ford from her home to the school.\n\nYou should, also, direct her attention to the second and third paragraphs of official letter of June 11th.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

His ability is very fine, and his industry is exceptional; his standing in all subjects is very high.\n\nHis character is above reproach in every respect. I can recommend him as a young man who, I believe, will honestly and cheerfully discharge the duties of any position of trust that he would accept.\n\n(Sgd.) H. P. McKerrow,\nPresident,\nSt. F. X.

His discipline was good and he proved himself an industrious and successful teacher. He is a young man of good ability, with scholarship and excellent judgment.\n\nTo any Board of Trustees desiring the services of an experienced and conscientious teacher, I can recommend Mr. Cashman as a young man who will fill his part of the contract to the very best of his ability.\n\nGuyborough, N.S.\nNov. 24, 1933.\n\n(P.S.)

He has his work organized with more than ordinary skill, and succeeds, in a very quiet and smooth fashion, in keeping all grades busy, interested, and progressing well at all times.\n\nDuring the two years that Mr. Cashman has conducted the Riverville School at West Bay Road, he has improved considerably the grounds, building and equipment\u2014adding library, play equipment, trees, ornamental fence, and so on.\n\nMr. Cashman is devoted to his profession.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. Cashman, Esq.,\nWhycocomagh, N. S.\nOttawa, November 14, 1939.\n\nDear Mrs. Ford:\n\nI was surprised and somewhat disturbed to learn from Inspector Foster's last report on your school that there were only 6 pupils in attendance at the time of his visit.\n\nIn view of the war conditions in which we now find ourselves, it will be exceedingly difficult to justify the operation of this school unless the attendance can be substantially increased. It is certainly not the intention of the Department to keep Indian day schools open with an average attendance of 6 pupils. If this attendance cannot be substantially increased in the immediate future, an investigation will have to be made to consider the advisability of having these pupils attend either a residential school or the white schools in the neighborhood.\n\nI am sending forward a copy of this letter to the Indian Agent. It is my hope that you and the Agent may find it convenient to discuss this matter together and afterwards perhaps with the Indian parents if you consider such action advisable. The Inspector suggests that a letter be sent to Mrs. Levi Brooks, instructing her that her son Andrew must attend school regularly. Mrs. Brooks should be interviewed by you or by the Agent or by both of you and informed that the Department will insist upon the attendance of her boy at school.\n\nI should like to hear from you immediately following your interview with the Agent. I should like to learn also what provision, if any, you have made for vocational instruction at the school - knitting, crochet work, elementary dressmaking, etc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

Also shortly after the school at Shubenacadie was established, the agent tried the same trick but being new they were willing to go.\n\nMrs. Levi Brooks claims her boy to pick a greater part of the time yet on being questioned admitted he\nwas away from school often when well, but would try to come more regularly.\n\nLast spring we told the parents their relief would be withdrawn if not better attendance, which worked for a while.\n\nMrs. Joe Lewis, who has three children, worked in Rigby from April until about Nov., while there her children, then the influence of some whom she worked for were allowed to attend school in Rigby, which is not always done, as yet she hasn't returned to the Reserve.\n\nMy Sept. report shows only 9 pupils on the Reserve and an average 27.

There is no fence around the house and no well on the premises, and so the Department are under no loss here, and in my opinion can very well be dispensed with, but will be pleased to make any improvements to carry out the wishes of the Department for the benefit of the School. There are some repairs that are much needed; the workmanship inside of the School building should be painted as it now has been, and I feel rather a gaudy appearance and the ceiling should be repainted and whitened and the room given a thorough cleaning which can be done during recess or vacation which commences the 1st of July. The cost of these above may amount to some thirty-eight dollars. And the Room should have a new floor and pipe as the old one is not safe, it is so cracked and broken the family had to repair it with flat stones, etc., since I have been Agent, and the outside of the house would be better for a good coat of lime wash work in preserving the building, and a more cheerful appearance to the surroundings.\n\nI am,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector, Agent General\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\nJuly 12th 1893\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant; and in reply I beg to inform you that you should forward to the Dept. a detailed estimate of the cost of the repairs actually required for the Bear River Indian School not including the fence & well, which you state can be dispensed with.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\nBear River Aug 14th\n\nStatement of cost of repairs in items\n\nPaint - 1.50\nOil - 45\nLabour in putting it on 2.00\nFixing ceiling 2.00\nWhite wash up outside 2.50\nCleaning inside & sweeping 3.00\nTotal cost of repairs 16.45\n\nCharles McAdam\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 16th, 1893.

When I received my commission as agent (secretary) certain instructions from the Dept. at Ottawa about the school, I wrote to you and asked for an estimate of the expenses without being obliged to pay, in any case, which is impracticable. The Dept. ordered the immediate repairs and improvements, but they have not been carried out, therefore because my predecessor was unable to contract for Bear River that he could not make a special order must come from Ottawa.

D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. H. Purdy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River, N.S.\nOttawa, 13th January, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the account which you forwarded recently in favor of Mr. H. B. Purdy for supplies for the Indian School at Bear River, I beg to inform you that you should in future make application to the Department when chalk, pens, and ink powder, etc., are required for the school. The rule is to supply such articles from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nJno. H. Purdy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBear River, N.S.\nSir,\n\nI deem it my duty to call your attention to the condition of the school house on the Duncan reserve, Bear River, highly located, which is badly in need of repair. The roof is leaky, especially on one side, and I would advise reshingling with cedar shingles if possible. The main door is without a latch, which should be replaced without delay, as in order to keep the door shut it is necessary to lock it, which is inconvenient. A storm-door also is required and should be provided. Again, the wood shed, attached to the rear of the school house, is in a rather dilapidated condition and requires a new roof; the original covering being almost completely gone. The doors and window casings should be painted; also the doors, and the window-casings, and the walls outside ought to receive a generous coat of whitewash at least.\n\nI am pleased to say that the teacher of the school is giving good satisfaction, circumstances considered; but she is working at a disadvantage for want of common school supplies, which I was surprised to find had not been furnished by the Department. A supply of copy books, drawing books, slates, lead, and dots, pencils, pens, pencil-boxes, and rulers, should, I think, be provided as soon as convenient.\n\nI spoke to the Agent, Mr. Penny about these matters, namely, the condition of the school building, and the absence of text books and supplies absolutely necessary in a school room; and I answered to\nhear him state that he had brought them to the notice of the Department months ago, but that so far nothing has been done to improve the situation.\n\nWith regard to repairs and improvements to the building, I beg to observe that I think some of the divisions of the Reserve are not sufficient enough to be worth under the direction of a foreman.\n\nShan the house to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He was asked for certain details, which he gave, and on the 30th of that month he was again written to and asked to obtain offers as soon as possible from any parties who might be willing to do the work and submit the same to the Department for consideration.\n\nNo reply was received from Mr. Purdy to this letter, but he will be again communicated with on the subject.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, March 30, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Superintendent Boyd has drawn the Department's attention to needed repairs at the Bear River school. On September 22, of last year, you furnished the Department with the details of the repairs needed and on the 30th of that month you were asked to obtain as soon as possible offers from any party who might be willing to do this work and submit the same to the Department for consideration.\n\nNo reply was received to this letter, and I have to request that you will take the matter up at once, in order that these apparently very necessary repairs may be attended to.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

Purdy for $52.00 to do the work as per statement forwarded to you.\n\nThe Indians say they will help do the work & B. Purdy will take them as help. Mr. Dunn will not.\n\nI would suggest that the work be done by the day laborers so as to keep the Indians. I am sure that the money is honestly expended.\n\nKindly advise me at once as to whether School is closed in Vacation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJas H. Purdy\nIndian Agent\n\nS.K.

B. Purdy to do the work required to fix up the Bear River school premises as outlined in your letter of September 35, 1907, for the sum of $53.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may have this work done and it should be undertaken at once in order that it may be completed before the school reopens. The accounts should show in detail the work done, the amount of material used and the number of days labour, but the sum above mentioned should not be exceeded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

This was taken down and a new chimney twenty-five feet high was built from the ground; foundation of rock and cement; bricks laid in mortar and cement, and is now thoroughly fire proof. While Mason was at work had all holes in underpinning repaired.\n\nWINDOWS \u2014\u2014 The four small windows in building were inadequate to give proper light in School Room. These were taken out and six new windows, two lights in each sash, size of glass 14 X 28, were placed in building, three on either side. All the sashes hung with cords and weights so windows would lower from top and raise from bottom, giving good chance to ventilate room. Beside this, where the old chimney was removed, a galvanized ventilator was placed on roof. (This was advised by Dr. Kendall, who claimed the building would then be perfect as regards ventilation).\n\nENTRANCE \u2014\u2014 A Porch was built, size 8 X 8 ft. \u2014 foundation, sills setting on hackmatack posts; sheathed nicely inside, and clapboarded on outside\u2014 bottom finished with lattice work; good set of steps, making easy access to building for small pupils. Porch lighted with one two-light window, size of glass 14 X 28.\n\nMAIN BUILDING \u2014\u2014 The outside was stripped of shingles and clapboards. On front and two sides these were covered with tarred paper and clapboarded; painted with two coats of white paint. The inside sheathing was hard oiled; platform built across one end of School Room six inches high, on which a desk was built containing three drawers in one side and closet on opposite side to store all books, papers and lunches, etc. A new chair furnished for Teacher; Pupils desks reversed and placed in a position so the small pupils could sit in their seats and use the desks without placing themselves in uncomfortable positions; New Blinds furnished the six new windows; Stove Pipe furnished to connect stove with new chimney.\nWOODSHED \u2014 This forms a lean-to on the back part of School House and formerly opened in school room. This entrance was closed and door placed in side of shed \u2014 one of the old windows placed on opposite side to give light.

Bayliff\n\n[Signature]\nMEMO. REPAIRS SCHOOL HOUSE INDIAN RESERVE.\n\nCHIMNEY \u2014 The old chimney being hung from rafters was found to rest on pieces of 3 x 4 Scantling, partly burned through. This was taken down and a new chimney twenty five feet high was built from the ground; foundation of rock and cement; bricks laid in mortar and cement, and is now thoroughly fire proof. While Mason was at work had all holes in underpinning repaired.\n\nWINDOWS \u2014 The four small windows in building were inadequate to give proper light in School Room. These were taken out and six new windows, two lights in each sash, size of glass 14 X 28, were placed in building, three on either side. All the sashes hung with cords and weights so windows would lower from top and hoist from bottom, giving good chance to ventilate room. Beside this, where the old chimney was removed, a galvanized Ventilator was placed on roof. (This was advised by Dr. Kendall, who claimed the building would then be perfect as regards ventilation).\n\nENTRANCE \u2014 A Porch was built, size 8 X 6 ft. \u2014 foundation, sills setting on hackmatack posts; sheathed nicely inside, and clapboarded on outside\u2014 bottom finished with lattice work; good set of steps, making easy access to building for small pupils. Porch lighted with one two-light window, size of glass 14 X 28.\n\nMAIN BUILDING \u2014 The outside was stripped of shingles and clapboards. On front and two sides these were covered with tarred paper and clapboarded; painted with two coats of white paint. The inside sheathing was hard oiled; platform built across one end of School Room six inches high, on which a desk was built containing three drawers in one side and closet on opposite side to store all books, papers and lunches, etc. A new chair furnished for Teacher; Pupils desks reversed and placed in a position so the small pupils could sit in their seats and use the desks without placing themselves in uncomfortable positions; New Blinds furnished the six new windows; Stove Pipe furnished to connect stove with new chimney.\nWOODSHED \u2014 This forms a lean-to on the back part of School House and formerly opened in school room. This entrance was closed and door placed in side of shed \u2014 one of the old windows placed on opposite side to give light. The side of shed next to School Room was covered with Tarred Paper and sheathed with lumber, making a suitable place to store wood and kindlings for School purposes.\n\n[Signature]\n[Date]\n\n[Signature]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo J.

Armstrong's account against the Department for repairs and improvements made to the Indian school house, near River, N.S.\n\nThe expenditure for this service is $20 above my estimate, but this could not be helped. When inspecting the building to ascertain what repairs were necessary, I did not expect that the walls would require to be stripped, but when the work of repairing began, it became evident that the outside shell so originally constructed was of the flimsiest and cheapest kind and only stuck together. I then decided it would be best to make the repairs, while about them, as thorough as possible, which was done. The character of the new work is of the best, and, I do not hesitate to say, will stand inspection by any one. I am quite proud of what has been accomplished for the outing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. H.

The material is selected entirely from our Native Wood, and the Workmanship throughout is of the First Quality.\n\nLIST OF SIZES\n\n| Double Desk | Length | Height of Seat | Height of Top | Width of Seat | Width of Top | Extreme Width | Age in Years | Price |\n|-------------|--------|----------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|-------|\n| B\u2014High School | 42 in | 15 in | 28 3/4 in | 12 1/2 in | 15 in | 13 to 16 | $10.00 |\n| C\u20144th Class | 42 in | 13 in | 20 3/4 in | 12 in | 13 in | 13 to 15 | $9.00 |\n| D\u20143rd Class | 42 in | 13 in | 20 3/4 in | 12 in | 13 in | 13 to 15 | $9.00 |\n| E\u20142nd Class | 36 in | 12 in | 21 1/2 in | 9 3/4 in | 12 in | 12 to 14 | $8.00 |\n\nBack or Starting Seat to correspond with either side.\n\nSingle Desk\u2014Length, A, B, C, 24 inches; D, 21 inches; E, and F., 18 inches; otherwise same as Double.\n\nWe offer this Desk in the fullest confidence that in all desirable points it is WITHOUT EQUAL.\n\nThe Desks are so constructed that for ease and comfort to the pupils, and for strength durability and style they are unsurpassed. The Castings are strong, and the wood is so attached to the iron, as to AVOID THE USE OF SCREWS.\n\nThe slats are put together upon the castings by a dove-tail on the iron, and a groove on the slat. The slats are firmly held together by the use of 18 cloves in each slat making the back and seat (although put together on narrow slats in order to get the rake) very firm and the desk very stiff.\n\nThe seat closes without noise close against the back, giving a wide passage between the desk for exercises, sweeping, etc., and the desk is easily raised and lowered by means of the lever under the desk. The form of the seat and back renders it perfectly comfortable, the pupil sitting in an erect and healthy position.\n\nThe desks are alternately light and dark, and made of seasoned hard wood. The top is provided with a groove, for laying books and papers, and the whole desk is impregnated with oil which prevents the wood from staining in Cherry or Walnut. The whole desk being finished in the best of O.I. Finish which is more durable than ordinary varnish.\n\nIn placing the desk in position, care should be used to have the desk out of wind, and perfectly level. There is a flange upon each claw containing three holes; making in all twelve screws which hold the desk firmly to the floor.\n\nThese Desks are being adopted in all of our schools throughout the Province, and are highly approved of by Inspectors, Teachers and all interested.\nJ.

C. Chalmers\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Chalmers,\n\nWe don't have a school officer on the Reserve, we really don't need one. Wonder if the Deptt would allow me a small amount to offer as foreign aid children might attend more regularly. They do fairly well, but sometimes a little encouragement might be better.\n\nThought to offer each 25\u00a2 first half year & allow 13 days for sickness & 60\u00a2 last half & 5 days off. Wouldn't be more than $1.\n\nThe Deptt may not think it necessary but lot less than School Officer's salary & I think more effective.\n\nYou will please ask the Deptt & let me know. Sincerely,\n\nRose L. Ford.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise the Dept. that I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. L. Ford the Teacher on this Reserve suggesting that an allowance of $15.00 a month be granted by the Dept. Board for the children attending the school. This school has an establishment for irregular attendance at the study. The children go out during the day and always arrive home late. It is undesirable that amounts are annually donated by the parents for some private parties. It is requested that the Dept. Government not make any more grants. I have regard for the welfare and prosperity of the Indians.\n\nH. A.

The same applies to repairs to Indian dwellings. Of course, you understand that relief issues and repairs to Indian dwellings should be dealt with separately. Clothing, as a general rule, is relief. An exception would be clothing purchased for children to allow them to enter the Shubenacadie Residential School; this would be separate and paid for from school vote. Another case would be clothing required for a patient to enter a sanatorium for treatment on account of tuberculosis. This would be paid for from General Vote.\n\nIt is difficult to explain these distinctions in a letter, but it is apparent from your accounts and correspondence that you have a good knowledge of the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H.

The Department will approve of the teacher incurring an expenditure at the present time not to exceed the sum of $3 in the purchase of prizes to be awarded for the best attendance.

Nov. 11th, 19\u2014\n\nThe Indian teacher at Bear River, N.S., Mrs. Howe, has been ill, and has applied to me for leave to live in her school room during the winter months, and I have informed her by letter of the necessity of submitting the matter to the Department for its decision.\n\nI state what I believe to be a fact, from my knowledge of the place, that she has often of mornings walked road to travel between her dwelling house and her school through deep snow, slush, silt, or drifted, during the night, and yet untiringly, in solitary days for her own, which makes the journey one of much fatigue, and results in her arrival at the scene of her daily labors an object in an exhausted condition, and consequently hardly fit to perform her duties properly.\n\nAlthough healthy, Mrs. Howe is not strong, being of delicate constitution, and having already experienced much public hardship for one of her age.\n\nHer proposition is to provide herself with a small folding cot which would be able to assure the appearance of an ordinary setting when put in use, and, therefore, would not be an object that might cause dislocation among the pupils during school hours.\n\nShe thinks by living in the school room during cold weather that it would always be found warm and comfortable for the children as opposed from their homes, and that she would have an opportunity to prepare and serve their mid-day lunch with better satisfaction both to herself and to them.\n\nC. H. Kellem, Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs.\nOFFICE OF THE INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT.\n\nRIVER BOURGEOIS, N.S.\n\nI have given the matter careful thought, and believe that Mrs. [Name] might be allowed with propriety to live in the school-room during the winter months.

It would be cruel to ask a teacher to live there when the Village is so near.\n\nI pay Dorly five dollars for my wood and seventy-eight for House - four rooms which takes quite a slice off my salary. Dorly eight is very little to the Dept. but quite an elephant to me.\n\nI am trying to keep my children at school and you, knowing the cost of living can easily see I am up against a difficulty. So be kind and I have gone over my salary every year since came to Bear River.\n\nIf you will kindly explain the matter to the Department - which, I ought add, is composed of men & all have hearts, I feel sure they will respond favourably.\n\nTrusting you will give\nthis your kind attention and\nshorting you in advance.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRose L.

That he has been studious and attentive at all times to his work. He has covered the work of Grades VII and VIII and he is competent in my opinion to teach the elementary work successfully up to and including Grade V.\n\nHe writes a good hand and reads well so that in the elementary branches of the common school course he should be a successful teacher. Yours truly,\nWilliam A. Creelman Principal\nChristmas Island, Co. Cape Breton, N.S.\nJuly 23rd 1900\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDo me the favour of an early reply to this hurried note. Frederick MacMillan former teacher at Eskasoni, N.B., has resigned. All the Indians without any exception as far as I know are in favour of having Charles Bernard (Indian) as their future teacher in succession to Mr. MacMillan. The only obstacle in the way is that he failed in getting a license, but yet I feel convinced that no other teacher could be hired no matter what grade or license he held, who would be so suitable as Charles Bernard. His thorough familiarity with the Indian language would make it easy for him to impart to the young children whatever he knows of their branches. As to his knowledge otherwise I enclose the testimony of his teacher Mr. Crookman Principal of the North Sydney High School. The School Inspector of the County gave me a similar testimony of him. But young Bernard will not teach unless your Department will consent to give him the usual quarterly salary or annual allowance even although he holds no grade or license.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

I was so glad to see the officer from the department that I did not thought to say anything in regard to my salary. My present salary is $750.00 per year, and I see that there are some Indian schools in Nova Scotia, where the teachers receive up to $300.00 per year.

McLean\nSecretary.\n\nCharles Bernard,\nTeacher of the Mikasani Indian School,\nMikasani, C.B.,\nNova Scotia.\nExtract - original on 234748\n\nOttawa 3rd Nov. 1902.\n\n(Re Echaskomi-school)\n\nThe Indian Department Register is not in use in this school. The last returns made were for the quarter ending September 30th last. These could not be certified to by the Agent for he has been absent. The teacher informed me that he had to get the chief to certify to this return and I recommend that the Chief's certificate be accepted as it is the best that can be got. The register was examined and found to be well kept. The grading of pupils is not correct and the teacher needs the guidance of the Department's course of study. Mr. School Inspector McNeill told him to get one but he has not yet applied.\nThis teacher, unlike those at Middle River and Whycoomagh, receives no grant from the Provincial Government and consequently is much worse off. This appears to be due to the fact that he has not a Provincial license, but if he is sufficiently qualified to teach the school it appears that he should receive a remuneration equal to those who do the same work elsewhere. He informs me that he was promised an increase of pay but has never received it and adds that being a married man he has hard work to make both ends meet with what he receives\u2014namely $200.00. I think this should be increased at present by $50.00.\n\nThe furniture of the school is sufficiently good. The scholars are supplied with 12 benches.\n\n[Signature]\nJ.A. Macrae\nJ.J. A.R.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 17th November, 1902.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWith reference to that portion of Mr Inspector Macdonald's report of the 3rd Assistant in which he calls attention to the salary paid the teacher of the Eskasoni school, I beg to say that Mr Charles Bernard, the present teacher, applied for an increase last year, which was not allowed him as $200.00 was all that was voted for this school.\n\nProvision is made in this year's estimates for ten schools in Nova Scotia with salaries ranging from $200.00 to $300.00. Two hundred dollars is provided for the teachers at three schools, $250.00 for four schools and $300.00 for the remaining three schools. The Cow Bay school for which $200.00 is provided has not been in operation for two years.\n\nI have always maintained that a salary of $200.00 is not sufficient remuneration for a teacher of an Indian school. The attendance at the Nova Scotia schools is not very satisfactory but the one at Eskasoni is quite up to the average, and this teacher should, I think be paid at least $250.00. If the unexpended appropriation for Cow Bay could be used for this purpose, it would be available now.\n\nI think that at the same time the salary of the teacher at Middle River should be raised to $250.00 which is I consider, certainly the smallest salary the Department should pay. The teacher in Prince Edward Island receives $300.00 and the New Brunswick teachers are paid $250.00.\n\n[Signature]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 22nd November, 1902.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nI see that the Deputy Minister has approved of your recommendation on my memorandum regard the salary of Charles Bernard, teacher of the Indian school at Eskasoni, that his salary should be increased to $250.00, but on the condition that he holds a certificate to teach and not otherwise. Mr Bernard has no certificate and neither do many of the other teachers in Nova Scotia who receive from $200 to $300. He was recommended by the Principal of the North Sydney Academy who stated that in his opinion he was competent to teach elementary work successfully up to and including Grade V. He has been in charge of the school two years and has given satisfaction and it seems to me that if we retain his services, he is entitled to the increase asked for, irrespective of his holding a certificate.\n\n[Signature]\nDepartment of the Interior,\nDominion Lands Office,\nOttawa, 190\n\nMEMO.\n\nThe new Deputy Superintendent General will now attend to these matters.\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\n22nd Nov., 1902.\nOTTAWA, 27th November, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to inform you that the Department has been pleased to increase your salary from $200.00 to $250.00, such increase to take effect from the first of October last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Indian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nThe teacher at the Indian school at Eskasoni some considerable time ago employed a carpenter to build a house for him. The carpenter was to be paid at stated periods. Up to the present the teacher has not done anything towards paying the account. I have been thinking that if you were to suggest to the teacher that if he should pay a portion out of his quarterly grant that he might do so. The carpenter's name is John H. McNeill.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, 13th March, 1906.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th inst., stating that the teacher of the native school at Belmont has been absent for some considerable time to Mr. John T. Mitchell, a carpenter there, for building a house for him, and that the debt was incurred on his understanding that it was to be repaid at stated periods, but that up to the present the teacher has done nothing towards liquidating the same.\n\nIn reply, I have to inform you that the attention of Mr. Charles Bernard, the teacher at the Belmont school, has been called to this matter and as soon as his reply is received you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McCleary\n\nSecretary.\n\nA. Belmont, Ont., Canada.\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the attention of the Department has been called to a claim said to be owing by you to Mr. John W. Vail, a carpenter, for work done by him on your house, and it has been suggested that a portion of your quarterly salary should be applied towards liquidating this claim.\n\nThe Department would like you to say whether you are amenable to such an arrangement, and, if so, how much you would be willing to pay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nCharles Bernard, Esq.,\nTeacher of Indian School,\nWabamun, C. B.,\n\nM. S.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th inst., in reference to payment of Mr. John H. McNeil. In reply I beg to say that I am not bound in responsibility to Mr. McNeil's bill. I beg to inform the Department that the said house is owned and occupied by me and my father Andrew Bernard; and we have agreed that my father should pay the carpenter's bill on the house, and I have been responsible to the building materials on the house, which I have not yet claimed my bills on the same.\nThe department will clearly see that I am not legally responsible to the said bill of Mr. John P.

To comply with this clause of the Nova Scotia school law is not easy, for there are no ratepayers having power to elect trustees\u2014the Indians being exempt from taxation. So the Inspector, and the Indian Agent, Mr Angus Cameron, Christine Island, have\nadvised me to write you for an increase of salary\u2014say at the rate of three hundred dollars a year also. Please let me know your decision as soon as possible for the Secretary. Believe it soon to be made out and oblige.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. Baxter\nOTTAWA, 13th October, 1903\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nA letter has been received from P. Beaton, teacher of the Naskapi school, asking that his salary be raised to $350.00 per annum on account of the withdrawal of the Provincial Grant from this school. As the salary provided by the Department is $250.00, it does not see its way clear to comply with this request as there are no funds at present available for meeting such increase. Mr. Beaton has only been in charge of this school since the summer holidays and no returns have as yet been received from him.\n\nThe Department would like to be advised of the terms upon which Mr. Beaton was engaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK FOLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. A. Cameron,\nIndian Agent,\nChristmas Island C.B.,\nN.S.\nFor the special reasons mentioned below I hope Your Honour will see the way clear to give the teacher in the Eskerini Indian School an annual salary of three hundred and sixty dollars.\n\nFirstly, of late years wages in every calling except that teaching have gone up at least fifty per cent. With the rise in wages the cost of living has gone up almost proportionately. The wages of teachers in this province, as a rule, not having kept pace with the general increase, a great many of the country schools consequently are closed and there is no prospect of their opening. The Department of Indian Affairs, I believe, will not be the last to give in to the force of circumstances by raising the wages of teachers in their schools if it wants them to be kept open and not be closed like other schools. Besides, more inducements must be offered a white man before he can be got to teach in an Indian school for reasons known to everyone. The teacher who was here last term was a full blooded Indian, and holds in receipt of two hundred and sixty dollars of a salary from the Department of Indian Affairs, yet he found that at the end of the year he had to ship to get out of the way of his creditors who have thus been left in the lurch. The question is, can a white man live cheaper than the Indian and have something to show at the end of the year?\n\nSecondly\u2014Until last year, since time immemorial, the salary of the teacher in the Eskerini Indian School was two hundred dollars. Last year, however, the teacher not having a regular license could not draw a Provincial grant, and the Department, to supply the deficiency added sixty dollars to the two hundred already given\u2014giving him in all two hundred and sixty dollars.\nfor the School Term. The withholding of the Provincial Grant this year again, but for an entirely different reason, should make the way clear to making a permanent increase in the salary of the teacher here. The Inspector of schools for this district has notified me that though I have a regular license I cannot draw Provincial grant on account of the fact that the section does not comply with all the conditions imposed by the Provincial Government before a grant can be drawn. The principal condition not complied with, is that and which will never be complied with, as far as I can see, is that in order to draw a Provincial Grant the School section must be organized and must be paying taxes out of which the school funds come, but the Indians are not taxed, so their schools cannot participate in the School funds. Now it was formally that the teachers in Indian schools were paid out of the County and Provincial funds, I find it hard to understand unless someone overlooked certainness of the law or perhaps late legislation did it.\n\nThere are many schools vacant in this Province, and I could easily get one paying even better than this Indian school, but I was asked, after failing to procure a teacher at the rate of two hundred and sixty dollars a term and Provincial grant besides\u2014thinking the section would draw Provincial grant\u2014by a friend who has the interests of the Indians much at heart, and who wanted to see their school open, knowing that of any class of people the uneducated Indian is the worst off when he goes out into the world. The Chief of the Micmac Indians of the Maritime Provinces lives here and is doing his best for the education of his subjects. By settling the various disputes all over the Maritime Provinces he saves\nmuch trouble to the Department of Indian Affairs. The former white teacher in this school had a house and farm within easy reach of the school house and so could afford to teach for less. I have to pay my board and that in a place about two miles from the school house for it would be impossible to teach here in an Indian house. All which involves extra trouble and work.\n\nThe Department will, I hope, see its way clear to grant the reasonable salary of three hundred and sixty dollars. The Indian Agent here and the Inspector of public schools think it right that an increase should be made.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nPatrick Beaton.\n\nP.S. Please send me a form for quarterly school return, and if the increase of salary is granted a manual of school law.\nOTTAWA, 30th October, 1903\n\nRev.

He has evidently heard of the additional grant allowed to Miss Nelly Connolly for this work at Sydney, C.R. If he wishes to evince an interest in the betterment of the Indians he is at liberty to do so, and his duties as teacher should include such work. Mr Boyle would apparently be the only one to benefit by the increase of salary he demands. He lives at Amaguadus Pond, which is over three miles from the reserve.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 24th October, 1904\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant stating that for an extra $100.00 a year you would be willing to visit the Indian houses and enforce the necessity for cleanliness and more regular habits among the parents.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that the Department cannot supplement your salary as teacher of the Eskasoni school.

But the man has recently returned home and gave me the following information in regard to the work done by him for the late Indian teacher at Eskasoni whose name is Charles Bernard (Indian) and now teaches school somewhere in New Brunswick.\n\nThis teacher after getting married employed Mr. Neil to build a house for him and promised faithfully to pay by instalments, that is to give a portion of his quarterly salary until the whole would be paid. On this condition Mr. Neil built the house, but when the house was finished the teacher left the reserve all of a sudden and has never been heard since. He owes Mr. Neil \u00a35 3s. 2\u00bd.\n\nMr. Neil is but a poor man, and feels the loss of his earnings very much.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA.

In reply I beg to say that I am not legally responsible for this claim in question so I now inform the Department how the matter was arranged: In the spring of 1902 I bought material for a house.\nwith the exception of one door and eight window casings and frames which were supplied by Mr. McNeil when he built the house. And it was arranged that my father Andrew Bernard would pay Mr. McNeil for building the house and for the articles he had supplied. At any rate my father paid through his bank to meet his bill. So then Mr. McNeil asked me to pay it and I gave him part payment out of my own money and ever since he wants to hold me responsible to that claim.\n\nBut I would promise\nThis one thing which I believe it would satisfy him, thus: As I know through correspondence of Chief John Denny, of Eskasoni that the Eskasoni Band desire me to return to Eskasoni and teach there once more (as I left Eskasoni for the health of my wife) and I intend to return to Eskasoni after the end of this term to teach there again and I promise that I will accede to pay 50% of the amount out of my first two quarters salary, i.e., Sept. 91 and Dec. 90 '05.\n\nYours faithfully,\nChas.

I had nothing to do with affair; in fact I told Mr. Bernard when he spoke to me before he was engaged about the school that I would neither recommend his appointment to your Department nor sanction it in any way. My reason was as I told him, the flight in which he left all his creditors when he left the section before. I had no fault to find with him as teacher. Perhaps on account of his knowledge of his mother tongue, he was better able to connect to the very young who were too tall ignorant of English, the rudiments of education than a white teacher could be.\n\nThe Chief who is unable to write and who has a large congregation to attend to on account of his being Grand Chief of the whole province found Mr. Bernard very useful as his secretary. Hence I believe his anxiety to have him engaged as teacher. I think it would be well for your Department to plainly tell the chief the limits of his jurisdiction in matters like this. I have nothing but praise for the Chief. He does all he can for the good of the tribe. His word is law to them. But he should be told that he cannot ignore your Department in a case like this.\n\nI remain,\n\nA.

Mr. Cameron by Grand Chief John Denny of Eskasoni, was received in the Department without any covering letter. Chief Denny recommended the appointment of Mr. Chas. Bernard as teacher of the Indian School on that Reserve. As no intimation had been received of the intention of Mr. Boyle, who was in charge of the school, to resign, Mr. Cameron was informed that if Mr. Boyle decided to resign, the question of appointing his successor would be considered then. On the 26th September last Chief Denny wrote the Department stating that he had appointed Mr. Bernard as teacher of this school, and Mr. Agent Cameron also enclosed a letter addressed to him by the Chief also advising him of his having appointed Mr. Bernard. The Chief had no authority to appoint Bernard or to ask for the resignation of Mr. Boyle, and Mr. Cameron took the proper course when he closed the school to await the Department's instructions with regard to Bernard's appointment.\n\nMr. Cameron says he had nothing to do with this appointment; and in fact he told Mr. Bernard when he spoke to him about the school that he would neither recommend his appointment to the Department nor sanction it in any way, on account of the unsatisfactory manner he had dealt with his creditors when he was formerly employed at Eskasoni as teacher. Bernard was dismissed from this position of teacher of the Burnt Church School at the end of June quarter last by your direction. The Agent says that Bernard makes himself useful to the Chief, who has great influence over the Indians, but is unable to write and finds Bernard's services as secretary very useful. He also says that he had no fault to find with.\nwith Bernard as a teacher; but Bernard proved himself to very\ninattentive to his duties while at Burnt Church and cost the De-\npartment no end of trouble while he was previously at Eskasoni.\nIt would be questionable whether it would be advisable to re-engage\nhim, and I agree with the Agent that the Chief should be told\nplainly that he had no right to take upon himself any appointment\nof this kind. I would suggest that the Rev. Mr. Cameron, our\nAgent, be instructed to look out for a new teacher.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOTTAWA, October 11th---1905.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo enclosing communication from Chief John Denny in reference to the engagement of Mr. Charles Bernard as teacher for the Indian school on the Eskasoni Reserve, and in reply I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to inform the Chief that he was exceeding his powers in appointing Mr. Bernard, such appointments only being by the authority of the Department.\n\nMr. Bernard was dismissed from the position of teacher of the Burnt Church school at the end of June quarter last, and in view of the unsatisfactory fulfillment of his duties, the Department will not re-engage him.\n\nYou are hereby authorized to secure the services of a qualified teacher for this school at the salary of $300.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

The Department would like to be advised as to what steps, if any, you have taken in this matter, as the Chief has again written urging the appointment of Mr. Charles Bernard. The Department has no intention of appointing Mr. Bernard to this school, and he will be so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Cameron,\nIndian Agent,\nChristine Island, O.P.\nOttawa, December 18, 1905.\n\nGrand Chief,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th inst., and in reply I beg to say that the Department has no intention of appointing Mr. Bernard as teacher of your school, as you were previously informed through the Indian Agent, Rev. Mr. Cameron.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nGrand Chief John Denny,\nBakanoni, O.P.\nChristmas Island, Dec. 25th, 1906\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received your letter of the 23rd inst., and reference thereto I have cause to say that as soon as your department notified me that you were not going to engage Mr. Bernard this year for the Eskimo School I advised the Chief thereof. At the same time I wrote to Dr. Thomson, Rector of P.E.I. College, Antigonish, to ascertain if any among his hundreds or more students there who held a license to teach, would take charge of this school.\n\nThe reply was that none wanted to break up his class now, as it would interfere with their course. The young man who taught here last year and who is in College now would have gladly engaged there but that the Chief told him at end of last term he thought that he had arranged with Mr. Bernard to teach here this year. But now that he entered College he would not come this year.\n\nI then wrote to the Inspector of Schools for this County to know if he could find any competent person. He said that earlier in the year he had a few applications, but that he did not know of any now. I then drove over to Eskimo to see the Chief about engaging. Eschik has written for the balance of the year; he was an old teacher who taught there for about twenty years. The Chief was not home that day, but I told his son my errand and to tell his father to write me when he could come home from St. Peters. I have not heard from him since on the subject, and I do not believe there won't be any use to hire a teacher without his consent, or against his will. He would only have to raise his finger, and not a child on that reserve would go to school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. Cameron, Agent.\nJan. 4th., 1906\n\nMemo for Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nChief John Denis of Tsaksoni has been agitating for the appointment of Mr. Bernard as teacher of the School on that Reserve. Bernard was dismissed from the Burnt Church School for the unsatisfactory manner in which he performed his duties, and Mr. Agent Cameron was notified not to engage him for Tsaksoni, the Chief was also informed that Bernard's services would not be accepted. Bernard is writing the letters for the Chief and makes a strong plea for reinstatement. Mr. Agent Cameron writes under date of 23rd., ultimo that he does not believe there will be any use in engaging a teacher without the consent of the Chief or against his will, as he would only have to raise his finger and not a child on the Reserve would go to school. They are at present without a teacher in this Reserve, and if no one but Bernard would satisfy the Chief, they might just as well have the School closed. I would suggest that the Agent be instructed to notify the Chief that until he consents to some other person than Bernard being placed in charge of the school it will have to remain closed.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, January 18, 1906.\n\nRev.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th inst., reporting that you have secured a teacher for the Indian school at Nakasomi, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that Chief John Denis has withdrawn his opposition to this school being placed in charge of anyone but Charles Bernard, and the Department approves of your appointing Mr. John B. Beaton, who is evidently the young man referred to by you, though you omitted to mention his name in your letter, as teacher of this school. His salary is to be at the rate of $300 per annum.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Cameron,\nIndian Agent,\nChristmas Island, B.B.\nConsidering the fact that the teacher here does not draw any other salary from the local Government Authorities, I think it is only fair that he should be put on the same footing, for instance, as the teacher in the Indian school at Sydney, who draws in all, over five hundred dollars.\n\nI have to walk over five miles a day; this is just as much work, it is just as unpleasant.\n\nI came here more at my friend's bidding than induced by salary\u2014between cannot live on charity.\n\nI heard that the senators and in fact nearly every Government official, as well as other labourers have pointed out increase in wages since a few years ago, and it is now the time for the Indian teacher to demand living wages. If you will this select draws three hundred\u2014that is two hundred more than the teacher in the Sydney Indian school gets. Make it four hundred a year and I'll be satisfied.\n\nHoping that you will see merit in granting me this increase, and kindly add to my salary or just return.\n\nTo\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nJohn S. Beaton,\n\nChief, Canada.\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa\n\nSchools Branch\n\nMarch 27th, 1906\n\nSir,\n\nA friend, who had the interest of the Indian school at Eskasoni at heart, has asked me to teach here for some time, as the Chief had failed to get a teacher to keep the school open. I am willing to give a chance to the Indians growing up to acquire elementary knowledge, and especially to prevent them from falling into the bad habit of staying away from school, which they certainly would acquire if the school was closed for any length of time.\n\nThis friend of mine and the Chief wrote me asking me if possible to go to teach here for some time\u2014and if the salary was low to make an application for a decent living salary, to the Department of Indian Affairs. This Indian school is quite different from the other Indian schools in Cape Breton and other Counties, in so much as it does not draw any Provincial or County Grant, by it is said to not have.\n\nThe salary paid by the Dominion Government is three hundred dollars a year, and that is all the income a teacher has who teaches here.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, March 30, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr. John F. Beaton, teacher of the Eskasoni school, has applied for an increase of salary. He is at present in receipt of $300 per year, and although he makes out a good case I do not see how the Department can pay him more without making an all-round increase.\n\nMr. Beaton is mistaken in his statement that the teacher of the Sydney school is in receipt of $500 per annum. The Department only pays that school $300 now, although for one year it paid Miss Connolly $300 as teacher and $100 as field matron, but after her resignation the field matron salary was dropped.\n\nNone of the Indian school teachers receive any of the Nova Scotia provincial grant; this was withdrawn about two years ago, and we have time and again explained to the agents and teachers that this Department has no connection with the provincial school system and that we have no claim on them for any grant. The engagement of the teacher is made with this Department and they know what they are going to receive when they accept the position and have no claim for any more. Of course the present salary is low, and unless, as I said before, a general increase is made, I do not see how an exception can be made in Mr. Beaton's favour.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, April 3, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ult., praying for an increase of salary as teacher of the Eskasoni Indian school, and in reply I beg to say that the Department cannot at present make any increase.\n\nYou are mistaken in your statement that the teacher of the Indian school at Sydney, C.B., is in receipt of a salary of $500 per annum. This Department only pays $300, which is the highest salary paid to any of the teachers in the Maritime provinces. In fact, it is the usual salary paid to Indian school teachers, and until some readjustment takes place, it will have to be adhered to for the present.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn F. Beaton, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nAmagwadoon Pond, C.B.\nCastle Bay, Sept 14th 1907.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI hope you will not deem it inexpedient for me to ask you for some increase in the salary paid to the teachers of the Indian government school at Eskasoni, Cape Breton Co.\n\nIf the school were situated where one could obtain board within a quarter of a mile, there would not be such need for complaints; but when one has to walk a distance of three and a half miles every morning and evening to the nearest hotel house making a distance of seven miles to walk, there is sufficient cause.\n\nAgain you have to force yourself on the nearest house, and prevail on them to take you against their will.\nand as a result you must be content to pay a board bill at whatever price is asked.\n\nAgain one could get along all right in the summer months but during the fall and winter, you must be up before daylight to reach school at the required hour, and also the school is pretty old and cold to spend the winter hours in.\n\nBesides in this school, the teacher does not get one cent of provincial grant over his salary. This is new to a second class teacher, if he teaches the full two days amounts to $120 in this province. That taken off this school's salary would only leave $180 a salary which the poorest school section in the province can boast over. If the salary could be raised to $40, then I should consider that it would satisfy for the hardships which one has to undergo.\n\nI appeal to you once more to think this matter over and give it some consideration.\nWhen I took this school it was under the consideration that I could draw a First Class provincial grant besides my salary from you, but since there proved out that no provincial grant is paid to teachers' salaries, find that one has to be content with the meagre salary that is paid by the Department. So hoping you will increase the salary to $400, and trusting to hear from you soon.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nDan J. McDonald\naddress: Castle Bay,\nCape Breton,\nN.S.\nOttawa, September 12, 1907.\n\nRev. Sirs,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Mr. Dan J. McDonald, who claims to be the teacher at Eskasoni Indian school, asking that his salary may be increased.\n\nAs there is no record of Mr. Beaton's resignation or the appointment of Mr. McDonald, the Department would like to have a report from you as to why these changes took place without its being consulted. If Mr. McDonald was engaged by you, you should state upon what terms, as he claims that he accepted the position on the understanding that he would draw the provincial grant in addition to his salary.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

I referrence thereto I have leave to say there was no understanding between myself and Mr. Dan J. Mac Donald about any Dominion grant. I was not aware that Mr. Beaton was going to give up the school until he called on me on his way home, and told me that he was not going to teach there any longer. He did not feel well. When this young man spoke to me about the school I told him that your Department paid the last two teachers that taught there, and also that I felt sure he would be paid the same as he held a higher grade than either of the others. I did not mention anything about a provincial grant; it never occurred to me. Yet it may be possible that he was under the impression that, besides the grant from your Department, he would draw a provincial salary according to his grade. Of this I know nothing.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nA.

A. Cameron, states that the arrangement with you was that you were to be paid the same salary as your predecessor. However, as you apparently misunderstood the terms, the Department will pay you at the rate of $350.00 per annum from the time you took charge of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

At any rate he said nothing to me about it. It was only shortly before Mr. McKenzie spoke about the School that I was fully aware that Mr. Macdonald had resigned. But I did not make a mistake in not notifying the Dept. as to the resignation of Mr. Macdonald and the appointment of Mr. McKenzie as teacher at Echmiadzin. The latter asked me what the salary would be. I told him I could not say but that he (being a qualified teacher) would likely receive the same as his predecessor. On those terms Mr. McKenzie accepted the school. I may have something to say regarding him later.\n\nYours truly,\nC J MacNeil\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, September 30, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 5th inst., I beg to say that the Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Agent Holloak in which he states that when engaging you as teacher of the Sakamond school he informed you that the salary paid would probably be the same as given your predecessor.\n\nIn September of last year an increase of $50 was made to the salary of the teacher of this school and there are only two other schools in the province in which the Department pays a salary of $350 per annum.

McKenzie, has only been charge since the summer holidays last year and is now paid at the rate of $350.00 per annum, which is higher than any of the salaries paid to other Indian school teachers in Nova Scotia, with the exception of one, who is paid at the same rate. When the Inspector called at this school last term the teacher was absent through illness and he was, therefore, unable to report on his efficiency, but, as the increase asked for, $25.00 is small and as he has had previous experience I would recommend that it be granted, if the next inspection report is favorable. In fact, I think where the teachers in Nova Scotia are doing good work they should all receive some pecuniary recognition of their services.\n\nMartin Benson.\nOttawa, October 10, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd inst., I beg to say that your explanation in regard to the condition of the health of the teacher of the Makasani school is sufficient and no deduction will be made from his salary for the few days it will be necessary for him to absent himself from the school.\n\nYou should advise Mr. McKenzie to requisition for all school material required on the usual forms provided for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.J.

I think in the year 1900 he gave up the school in favour of one of the tribe who was qualifying for the position. I understand there is an allowance or pension allowed to widows whose husbands have been engaged by the Indian department as teachers for upwards of twenty-one years. I may say my late husband spent the best part of his life teaching the Indians school when he retired had a hard struggle to support our family. He never received any extra allowance or pension from the department from the year 1900 until the time of his death, hoping my dear friend you will be pleased to place my claims before the Minister of Indian department - Ottawa & get the allowance or pension as since my poor husband hath have had a hard struggle to support our family.\n\nMrs. R & Mr Milliner\nMcKenzie & Macmillan\nBarristers, Solicitors, Etc.\nD.D.

General:-\n\nMr. D.D. McKenzie, M.P., Cape Breton, incloses a letter from Mrs. Roderick McMillan, widow of a former teacher of the Indian school at Eskasoni, applying for a pension.\n\nShe is under the impression that the Department makes provision for the widows of teachers of Indian schools after twenty years' service. I may say that there is no such provision made and the most the Department has ever done for teachers who have been a long time in its service has been to grant them a lump sum as a bonus on retirement.\n\nMr. McMillan taught for twenty-one years continuously with fair success and, had he applied for a bonus at the time of his retirement in 1900, it would most likely have been considered favourably. He did not do so and no grant was made.\n\nIt is for the Department to say whether after the lapse of time since his retirement it would be willing to make a grant to his widow in recognition of his services. If it felt disposed to do so, $150.00 would be about the amount she might be given on the basis of the grants already made to other teachers who have received bonuses on retirement.\n\nMartin Benson\nTo Mr. Vroom or Mr. Chisholm,\n\nCan you do me the kindness to let me know if you have any news from Mr. W. in Europe?

The woods by which it was surrounded has been cleared away. This will render it safe from destruction by forest fire. Mr. A. J. McKenzie, who is in charge of this school, is a good teacher. He has been engaged in the teaching profession for 30 years, and taught nearly all this time in his native district noted for its good schools. This fact alone speaks volumes as to his worth. The attendance is very irregular because of the straitened circumstances of the people this year. The usual answer to the question \"what is keeping you from school\" is \"No bread\".\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) J. J. McKinnon\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 11, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from Mr. J. J. McKinnon, Indian Agent, in which he speaks in very high terms of the work being performed by you in the Eskasoni school.\n\nThere is, however, one regrettable feature; that is the irregular attendance. The Department is very anxious that these Indians should take advantage of the facilities provided to educate their children and trusts that you will use your influence with the parents. The experience of the Department has shown that very much depends upon the personality of the teacher. If he succeeds in obtaining the confidence of the parents, the greatest obstacle to good attendance is overcome. The Department would be glad, therefore, if you would visit in the homes of the Indians and make an effort to induce them to send their children regularly, pointing out the advantages that will accrue to them and using any other means you may consider advisable.\n\nTrusting that a later report will show a decided improvement,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA. J. McKenzie, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nChristmas Island, C.B.\nOttawa, January 11, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 17th ult., in which you deal with school matters on the Eskasoni reserve, I beg to say that the Department is glad to learn that the new buildings and surroundings are so satisfactory but regrets to learn that the Indians are not apparently appreciating all that has been done for them, as is shown by the irregular attendance.\n\nThe Department would like to see them take the fullest advantage of the facilities provided to enable their children to obtain a good education, and would like you to use your influence with them, which, the Department is convinced, would have a beneficial effect.\n\nThe Department trusts that the combined efforts of the teacher and yourself will show a decided improvement in respect to attendance and a further report from you at a later date will be gladly received.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. J. McKinnon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChristmas Island, N.S.\nChristmas Island Jan 21st 1910\n\nS. Stewart\nActing Deputy Chief of Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that all of what was on the bill of Stationery and other articles, have been handed over in good condition, and I am very pleased pleased with the work done by the teacher. She has been doing so much to me in my office, teaching many, will myself that I must quite up to say more at all yet.\n\nBut one thing I can say I know how to defend the Dept. of Indian Affairs, and give Justice to the Indians.\n\nI want to be heard on this subject, and I believe France should be heard.\n\nAnd the Teacher formed a plan to get the children to attend School.\n\nI promised them that they would all get a prize at the end of the term.\n\nFor good attendance and good conduct, I think after a little I will be able to make them tend more regular.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. M. Wilson Indian Agent\nChristmas Island Jan. 22nd 1910\n\nA Stewart Esq.\nActing Secretary Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to yours No 117552/1 of the 11th inst. I beg to say that the Agent Mr J.J. McKinnon and myself have given a good deal of attention to the question of how to secure larger and more regular attendance at the Indian School of Eskasoni. During the two days that Mr. McKinnon spent this week visiting the Reserve in the interest of the Department, we had a talk over this question with the parents of children in school ages, pointing out to them the many benefits that education would confer upon their children; and in addition to this we told the pupils that at the end of every quarter prizes would be given for regular attendance, progress and good conduct. The plan promises to be productive of good results, for the attendance has risen from 9 to 17 during the week. Now the question is well worth considering.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nDepartment allow about $2.00 every quarter for the purchase of some useful little articles to be given as prizes; I trust that will.\n\nI have sent the Agent a requisition asking for a cupboard and a settle. I have no place to store books, slates copies etc., and the result is that a lot gets spoiled or destroyed. And a settle would come handy on rainy days, when the pupils need some place to sit upon at the stove while their clothes are wet. These articles would cost only about $5.00 altogether.\n\nI have not received, as yet, the copies drawing books, reading books, pens and slates for which I sent a requisition long ago. We need these very much.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.J. McKenzie\nTeacher.\nOttawa, January 28th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, and in reply to that portion which deals with the attendance of children at the Eskasoni school I beg to say that the Department trusts that your efforts with the Indians will be successful in inducing them to keep their children regularly at the school.\n\nI have to ask you when corresponding with the Department to be good enough to deal with only one subject in each communication. This is necessary in order to avoid confusion in filing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. J. McKeown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChristmas Island, N.S.\nOttawa, January 29th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, and in reply I beg to say that, with reference to the inducement to be offered for regular attendance at the Eskasoni School, the Department will be prepared to make a grant for prizes to the deserving pupils to the extent of $2.00 at the end of the current quarter, March 31st, and also on June 30th, next. If at the end of that time experience shows that the giving of these prizes is having the desired effect the Department will be prepared to make a further grant at the end of the December quarter. It is not thought necessary to provide prizes on September 30th, as, in any event, the school will only be opened for about six weeks during that quarter. You will be good enough to report on this matter at the end of the March quarter before incurring any further expenditure.\n\nMr. Agent McKinnon has been authorized to purchase the cupboard and settee asked for by you at a cost of $5.00.\n\nIn regard to the stationery, the readers asked for in November were ordered from the Stationery Office and inquiry will be made as to why they have not been forwarded. Mr. McKinnon was authorized to purchase twelve slates, pipes and broom required, but evidently he has overlooked\n\nA. J. McKenzie, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nChristmas Island, N.S.\nthe instructions sent by the Department. He was also asked to ascertain from you the series of copy books and drawing books wanted. You will be good enough to let the Department know by return mail the names of the publishers of these books, so that they can be ordered. No pens were included in the requisition, but a box will now be sent.\n\nYou, yourself, may purchase the slates and forward the account through the Agent. The Department would also be glad to have a full list of the supplies received by you on account of your requisition of November, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nChristmas Island, Feb 5th 1910\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.\nSecy Dept. Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nYour letter No. 117552/1 dated Jan. 29th 1910, came duly to hand and contents noted. It gives me great pleasure to find the department willing to make a grant of $2.00 per quarter for prizes to the deserving pupils of Eskasoni School. I feel confident that larger and more regular attendance will be the result of this plan.\n\nIn regard to the stationery asked for in November, I have received as yet only 2 maps, 1 dictionary, 6 arithmetics, 1 box slate pencils, 1 dozen lead pencils and a box of ink powder. Agent McKinnon assures me that he has sent you lately the paper I furnished him giving the names of the series of copy and drawing books asked for. He is taking steps to purchase the slates. I received the brown and the stove pipe long ago.\n\nYours truly,\nA.J. McKenzie\nTeacher\nEskasoni, April 1st 1910\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nSec'y Dept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\n\nSir,\n\nAt the beginning of the quarter ended the 31st ult., the Agent and myself decided to offer prizes to the pupils making the best attendance at this school. The Department has kindly agreed to grant the sum of $2.00 for this purpose. The plan has worked well. The average daily attendance rose from 5.4 during the preceding quarter to 13.1 during the quarter just closed. I am offering the same inducement for good attendance during the coming quarter and I trust that result will be equally satisfactory.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\nA.J. McKenzie\nIndian Teacher.\nOttawa, April 7th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is very pleased to learn that the attendance at the Eskasoni school has been much improved owing to the granting of prizes for regularity and will be glad to make another grant of $2.00 for the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nA. J. McKenzie, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nEskasoni, N.S.\nDear Sir,\n\nRev. Father Pacifique of Restigouche N.B. is giving a ten days mission at Eskasoni. All the Indians, old and young, are attending these missions which are given twice a day, at 9 A.M. and 3 P.M. A great many of the Indians of the other Reserves of this Province are also attending. As all the pupils left, I had to close the school until the missions are over.\n\nAbout three weeks ago I received 15 small books in Micmac language which I thought at first that they were the Catechism, but they are \"Sacred History.\" Kindly send the Catechism in Micmac if you have them in stock.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.J. McKenzie\nIndian Teacher\nChristman Island, Cape Breton Co.,\nNov. 7th, 1910.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nTo prevent if possible the spread of the disease, small-pox, into the Indian Reserve of Eskasoni, I have to ask the teacher there, A.J. McKenzie to close the school for two or three weeks, or until the contagion is got under control. The Eskasoni Reserve is in this district.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.J. McKinnon,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, November 14, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your action in closing the Nakononi Indian school for two or three weeks in order to avoid danger of contagion from small-pox. This school should remain closed until the epidemic is stamped out and the white schools re-opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. J.
