Mr. Charles.\nSt. John's Church\u2014Rev. Mr. Smith.\nSt. Andrew's Church\u2014Rev. Mr. Maclean.\nSt. James' Church\u2014Rev. Mr. Taylor.\nSt. Paul's Church\u2014Rev. Mr. Wright.\n\nThis paper may be found in the following newspapers:\n\nThe New York Times.\nThe New York Tribune.\nThe New York Herald.\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 6, 1888.\n\nTHE LIQUOR QUESTION.\n\nThis question is now engaging the attention of the Northwest, and is one with which, if reports be true, the people will very soon be called upon to deal. It is reported that the Dominion Parliament will not deal with the question any further than to give the Northwest Council power to legislate in the matter. The question before the people will be whether they should have a licence system or total prohibition, or some half way measure such as breweries and beer or the system now in force, and already many declare is undesirable, that it should be made the main and in fact the only issue at the next local election, that the candidates should and must be prohibition and anti-prohibition and other matters public interest questions of a secondary place. We take the ground that such a position is wrong, that the electors should not be called upon to support men whose only qualification might be that they have certain views with regard to the liquor traffic. The election should not be conducted on such principles. The best men should be elected, men of ability and known probity, and who are known to be for the general welfare of their particular district as well as the Territories generally at heart, and men who could be depended on to carry out the best views of the electors on the liquor question. To save expense it might be taken simultaneously with the election, and should be by ballot, and is likely by secret vote that the true feeling of the people could be obtained on this question. We are aware that there are many men who would not be ashamed to vote for liquor if they could do so secretly, but who would not vote openly; and on the other hand, many who are opposed to liquor would be intimidated or influenced to vote contrary to their convictions unless the ballot sheltered them. Open voting would undoubtedly strengthen the prohibition cause.\n\nLEGAL INTELLIGENCE.\n\nTHE SUPREME COURT.\n\nThe court opened on Tuesday, 27th ult., in the new court house. His Honour Judge McKeown on the Bench.\n\nThere was a great crowd present before the court sat, and more than one case of vast importance, and one which must affect the interests of all, and the liberties and privileges of a large number whichever it may be decided.\n\nHORSE SHOE STORE\n\nThe Only First-Class Store in the District.\n\nWe Are Right ON THE BOOM\n\nThis is no Regency Sale.
