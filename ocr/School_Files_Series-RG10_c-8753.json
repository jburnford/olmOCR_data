If you review this account you will find that the correct total is $11.50, not $14.20. We have made corrections in other Hudson's Bay Company accounts previously and when we sent a smaller cheque than the amount requested the company invariably returned the cheque and asked for an explanation. As a result there has always been considerable unnecessary correspondence. It is, therefore, felt that it would be advisable to return this account and have the company correct it before payment is made.\n\nR.A.

Neary,\nPP/ST Supt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Kitwaneoool Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to Superintendent Boys' letter of June 9th, attached, although no specific provision is made in the Estimates for the construction of a woodshed at the above-mentioned school, a new shed should be provided this year. I would ask that you endeavour to make available funds to the extent of $100.00 and that an accountable advance of $46.00 be forwarded to Mr. Boys, to meet labour costs.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70, VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nKitwancool Indian Day School\n\nA few days ago I visited Kitwancool with the intention of securing a site for a new day school among other things. I found that the Band had recently completed the clearing of approximately four acres for a new ball ground; they told me that we might have either this or the old ball grounds for the school. I feel that the old ground, although a little small (approximately 1\u00bd acres) would be the most desirable because it is more centrally located and more accessible to water.\n\nI believe that replacement of the present school stands high on the priority list and rightly so, but since it is doubtful if the new building will be constructed this year I must request replacement of the woodshed at the present building. The old woodshed collapsed last winter making it necessary to dig the wood out of the snow drifts. I would suggest construction of a small shed on skids so that it might be pulled to a new location if, and when, necessary. We would require 1,000 ft. of rough lumber which can be purchased from the Band saw mill at $35.00 per thousand, two rolls of 3-ply roofing paper at $4.95 each - plus labour 6 man days at $8.00. The latter should be in the form of an accountable advance. Quotation on the materials required is enclosed herewith.\n\nJ.J. BOYS\nIndian Superintendent\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.\n\nKitwangaol Indian Day School\n\nIt had been intended to replace this old and dilapidated building with a new one room school and teacherage this year, but it is now quite evident that it will have to be held over until 1950.\n\nI had hesitated to request any expenditure on the old building but it now appears that since my visit last June there has been a second small fire in the building, which was unreported by Miss Skatfield. Mr. Schroeder arrived at Kitwangaol a few days ago and both he and his wife must have been somewhat discouraged by what they found.\n\nAs a result of the fire it is imperative that we do some minor roof repairs and some painting in the teacherage. The Schroeders propose to occupy only the small kitchenette and the downstairs room, both of which should be painted. This will necessitate purchase of five gallons of interior cream paint, two brushes and turpentine. The roof repairs will require 800 lbs of rough lumber at $35.00 per thousand, also ten lbs. of nails and five rolls of two-ply roofing at $4.50.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would please let me have authority for this work with the least possible delay and also ask the Department to forward by Air Mail an Accountable Advance for $30.00 or ten man days at $3.00. The road to Kitwangaol has been undergoing repairs and is passable only while present fine weather lasts; fall rains would make it impossible to get to the reserve.\n\nJ. V. BOYS\nIndian Superintendent\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Kitwangaol Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to Superintendent Boys' letter of September 3rd attached, the expenditure requested for repairs to the above-mentioned school building would appear to be unavoidable and I would recommend that an accountable advance of $50.00 for labour be forwarded to Mr. Boys and that an expenditure of approximately $100.00 be approved for the purchase of materials.\n\nNo specific provision was made in the Estimates for repairs to this School on the assumption that the building would be replaced this year.\n\nfor W.S.

The School at Kishagass has been worked by an agent of the Church Missionary Society now for over four years, but hitherto no application, as far as I am aware has been put in, in writing for a grant in aid.\n\nI now make such application, in order that the school may be enabled to get all necessary materials, suitable furniture etc. School opened this fall, on the 1st of October, but no children attended till the commencement of the 2nd week of the quarter; however by working straight on to Christmas, we should be able to get the required number of days of attendance in.\n\nThe register is kept daily, according to directions ordered within, up to the present time there have been 35 children on the roll, but attendance is very very much amongst a hunting and trapping people. The first week of this quarter for instance we could not get any children as they were away with their parents at their potato gardens.\n\nNow we are in full swing of work, with School open for four hours every day except Saturday and Sunday.\n\nF.

Adolph, as teacher of the Kiegogna Indian day school, was advised regarding grant being allowed by your letter 414, 7th, dated the 10th of April 1901, wherein it was stated that by a letter from the Department, of the 5th of that month, it had been so decided by the direction of the Deputy Minister. The said salary ceased to become subject for consideration upon the teacher's departure for England during the spring of 1902, and on an unqualified native teacher taking the place. The attendance of this school had been good, and 18 boys and 16 girls, or 34 all told, were on its roll. Here, both parents and children took much interest in matters pertaining the school, and good progress was made.

June 8th 1905.\n\nA.W.Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Supt. for British Columbia.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt our Diocesan Synod held last week, it was decided to send one of our experienced lady missionaries to Hazelton to assist the Rev. J. Field relieving him of the Indian School work.\n\nIt is now twenty-five years ago since the Church of England began work among the Indians of Hazelton. The Rev. J. Field has been labouring there for nineteen years, teaching the Indian Day School etc., for some years he drew the Indian Department's grant for the day school but through excessive conscientiousness he has taught the Indian Day School for the last four or five years without asking for the Government grant. The Church of England has erected a fine new building for this work and the average attendance of scholars has been very fair. Now that we have decided to strengthen the school work at Hazelton we appeal to the Indian Department through you for a renewal of the Government grant. Our conference also decided to send a qualified teacher to Yishgegas, a Church of England Mission sixty miles above Hazelton where we have kept an Indian Day School for some years past, unaided by the Government except the year Dr. Ardagh taught the school there. We appeal for a day school grant for this important station on the Babine river.\n\nWe notice in the public press that there is a talk of establishing an Industrial School at Hazelton under Methodist auspices. We would most respectfully point out to the Department that Hazelton has been for 25 years a Church of England Mission and that according to the Government Census of 1904...\nof 1904 there are over six hundred Church of England Indians on the Upper Skeena River, above the Canyon, and two hundred and seventy-three Methodist Indians in the same District and if the Indian Department contemplates establishing an Industrial School at Hazelton we trust that the Church of England may be accorded the privilege of securing teachers\u2014farm instructor, &c.,\n\nAs there is no mail up the Skeena river at present I am sending this letter direct to you as Superintendent writing another with a copy of this enclosed to Mr. R.E. Loring the Indian Agent at Hazelton. The Diocese of Caledonia covers the Northern half of British Columbia.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n[signature]\n(sgd) F.H.

Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Sect.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 26th February, 1901\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nMr Superintendent Vowell encloses correspondence covering an application made by Dr Vernon Ardagh, medical missionary of the Church Missionary Society at Kish-ge-gas, B.C., asking that the usual grant be made for the salary of a teacher of an Indian school there. Mr Ardagh says that the school was opened in October last and that there is an attendance of forty-seven pupils. Mr Vowell says that the Indians of this place are intelligent and law-abiding and wish the Department to make provision for the education of their children, and he recommends that the usual grant for a teacher's salary be given.\n\nI may add that about six years ago a similar application was made and declined on the ground that Kish-ge-gas was not an Indian reserve. Since then, however, has been set apart for these Indians.\n\nI should like to know what reply to make to this application, as there is no provision in next year's estimates.\n\nMartin Brown\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter dated the 26th of November last from Mr. Agent Loring of the Babine Agency as well as a copy of an application dated the 5th of the same month made by Dr. Vernon Ardagh Medical Missionary, Church Missionary Society, at Kisegagas in which he requests that the usual grant be made for the salary of a teacher of an Indian day school there. Although the Agent's communication is dated the 26th of last November it did not reach Victoria till yesterday. This delay is due to the lack of mail facilities between this city and Hazelton and accounts for the non-appearance in the last estimates forwarded from this Superintendency of an item to cover the proposed expenditure.\n\nI may add for the Department's information that there are forty-seven children of school age in the Kisegagas village. The parents of these children are intelligent.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nintelligent, law-abiding and are anxious that the Department should make provision for the education of their offspring.

Archdeacon W. H. Collison, of Kinkolith, Nass, B.C., a fit and proper person had been engaged in one Jonathan Mercer of that locality; and that the latter be ready to take up his station by the 1st of September, next, but that it be stipulated that on account of the excessively high cost of living at that post, his salary be no less than at the rate of $100.00 per quarter.\n\nIn so far as I, myself, have learned is, that Jonathan Mercer is a reliable and good teacher, and is a married man; his wife is known to be a very industrious and estimable woman, and they have a son at an age of 10.\n\nUnder these conditions, the selection of the teacher proves a very good one, and beg to add herewith the recommendation to have the engagement take effect at that proposal.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 17, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo stating that Jonathan Mercer has been engaged as teacher of the Kisagegas School and that he will be ready to take up his duties there by the 1st of September next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the appointment of Mr. Mercer as teacher of this school and he will be paid at the rate of $400.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The total expenses paid by our Church amounted to $146.\n\nLet me recall the fact that last June I received a letter from you as Indian Agent stating that the Indian Department had instructed you to communicate with \"the Bishop of Caledonia with a view of securing a competent teacher\" for the school at Gishgegas.\n\nLet me point out to the Department through you that Gishgegas is a very isolated and lonely village many miles from any white people and that it would be impossible to have a single white woman live there alone.\n\nActing upon the instructions of your letter and knowing that a white teacher could not be persuaded to go to such a place on such a salary I found one of our most reliable and well educated natives on the Upper Neas River to fill this position and paid his travelling expenses there hoping that the Indian Department would pay at least half these expenses to this remote place requiring pack horses &c.\n\nMay I also draw attention to the fact that the Indian Department has lately sent three teachers and two field matrons to the Upper Neas paying all the travelling expenses.\n\nIn addition to asking for half the travelling expenses, namely $74, I would request a small rental for our Church Building at Gishgegas which is used as a Government Day School in view of the fact that it was found necessary to make some repairs in this building for the purpose of rendering it suitable for school work.\n\nOwing to the war the financial resources of our Church Mission Fund have been reduced.\n\nTrusting that the Indian Department may favourable consider this matter,\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\nF. H. Du Vernet\nBishop of Caledonia\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to state that I received a letter from the Right Rev. F. H. Du Vernet, Bishop of Caledonia, dated 28th ultimo, requesting that the Department be appealed to for a rebate of half of the expenses incurred by Jonathan Mercer, the present teacher of the Kisgegas Indian Day School, in travelling with his wife from Kinkolith, Naas, to Kisgegas, Skeena, and remarking that the total expenses paid by the diocese of the Anglican Church in that respect amounted to $148.00.\n\nIn connection therewith it is cited that last June the Bishop had received a letter from me with a view of securing a competent teacher for that school; and furthermore quoting in support of the application that the Department of Indian Affairs had sent three teachers and two field matrons to the Upper Naas paying all the travelling expenses.\n\nIn addition to the half of the aforementioned amount of $148.00 = $74.00, I also find the request made for a small rental for the church building at Kisgegas, which is being used for the school.\n\nIn regard to a rental being asked for, I would respectfully suggest, that if the Department may grant the request, that, in my opinion, the sum of $8.00 per month should be ample to be expended in that respect.\n\nRelative the aforegoing, I deem it advisable to enclose herewith the Bishop's letter treating upon the two items herein above referred to.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You looked so vital that I expect to hear soon that you are back on your old stomping ground as well as ever. Indeed this is my sincere hope.\n\nI was glad when you mentioned that the matter of a teacher for Kitwanga should be taken up. If you will let me know that the Department will definitely provide for this I will at once begin to obtain a suitable person to undertake this work next September 1st. I certainly think there should be a teacher for these people, and will be glad to co-operate with you in this matter.\n\nSo far as Kissegas is concerned, I can see your point of view. There are difficulties in the way of successful work there. Tillism Wake is a very fine native with a surprising education for the chance he has had and I believe he could be able to do some effective teaching. He thoroughly understands the people and would be able to get on well with them and is anxious to help them. I have told him that we will give him $25 per month for four months beginning on March 1st, next if he will try it out for that time. If the Department would augment this by a grant of $25 per month for the same time I believe it would be a good experiment and prove well worth while.\n\nI know you are quite as much interested in the natives as I am and always ready to recommend what you believe to be the best for them, and that you will be ready to consider any suggestions which may be presented; and I can be assured that you will give this suggestion about Kissegas the most sympathetic consideration.\n\nWishing you a speedy recovery,\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.

This may be somewhat delayed owing to the very occasional visits made to Hazelton. However, I informed them that nothing could be done during the present fiscal year as, in accordance with your letter of February 17th last, it would be difficult to find the necessary funds. The Hazelton Indian, suggested by the Right Reverend Bishop Rix, is quite well educated and might be very suitable to teach at Kispegas, should the Department approve of his appointment. However, he informed me that he could not possibly keep his family on the $25.00 per month promised him from the Anglican Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nS.

Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, recommending the establishment of day schools under Kitwanebool and Kingogas Reserves.\n\nMy letter requested you to make further enquiries and ascertain definitely the number of children of school age on each reserve. As yet I have received no reply to that letter. The Right Reverend Bishop Rix visited the Department yesterday and again urged the establishment of a school on the Kitwanebool Reserve and I would therefore appreciate having your report at the earliest possible date. The Bishop mentioned that there is a building owned by the church on the Kitwanebool Reserve that could be used for school purposes.\n\nIn connection with the Kingogas Reserve, Bishop Rix stated that he intended to send an educated Indian to this reserve this year as an experiment. This man will endeavour to give some rudimentary training to the children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nG.C.

However, it is doubtful if the necessary salaries can be allowed this year, as no provision for this expenditure was made in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1937-38.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, recommending the establishment of day schools on the Kitwancool and Kisgegas Reserves.\n\nAs no provision has been made in our appropriation for the establishment of schools on either of these reserves, it would be extremely difficult to find the funds that would be necessary. In any case, the Department requires more definite information before the schools can be considered.\n\nYou might make further enquiries and ascertain definitely the number of children of school age on each reserve. In this regard I may say that the last census returns do not indicate as many children of school age on the Kisgegas Reserve as are mentioned in Bishop Rix's letter.\n\nYou should also let me know if there is any building available on either of these reserves that would be suitable for school purposes. Do the Indians on these reserves reside sufficiently close to some one point to permit the children to attend school regularly?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. Mallinson, Esq.,\nClerk-in-Charge,\nBabine Agency,\nHazelton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nre - Kishgegas Indian Reserve\n\nMr. Indian Agent Mortimer has handed me the attached letter from the Rt. Rev. G.A. Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, to be submitted to the Department for its consideration regarding a grant for a teacher to the Indians of the Kishgegas Reserve, as contained in paragraph three (3) of the Bishop's letter.\n\nThe Kishgegas Reserve is situated some 50 miles Northeast of Hazelton, with a summer, pack-horse trail connecting the two places. Winter travel is over the Skeena River ice.\n\nThere are approximately thirty Indians living on this reserve, some twelve to fourteen being children of school age. These Indians are so isolated that they do not speak or understand English.\n\nMr. Mortimer wishes to leave this matter entirely in the hands of the Department at Ottawa and would appreciate a reply as early as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Mallinson,\nClerk.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, volume 6420, file 864-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Doctor:\n\nWhen I called upon you at your Office in Ottawa last September, I was greatly encouraged by your kindly reception and your assurance that you would welcome any communication I sent direct to you and give it your personal attention. I am therefore taking the liberty of writing about several matters, some of which I discussed with you. I think Mr. Mallison of Hazelton told me he had written about some of them to your Department.\n\n(1) The village of Kisagagas, about 65 miles north of Hazelton, has had no teacher there for a number of years. At one time your Department gave a grant in the neighbourhood of $500.00 towards the stipend of a teacher for these very isolated people, but for some reason this lapsed. It is a very small community and very isolated and I do not think that it is a place where a white teacher should be sent. But I have a fairly well educated Indian in Hazelton, Mr. W. Wals, who is quite capable of teaching the really only necessary things, such as reading, writing and arithmetic and is ready to undertake this. I am inclined to think that about six months per year would be all that these families would be found at home. If the Department would give a grant of $75.00 per month for these six months, it would meet the situation adequately.\n\n(2) I also spoke to you about the village of Kitwancool, a fairly important village about eighteen miles north of Gitwangah. These people have never had a school. They were very much prejudiced against the Government\nover the land question and would not allow them to even establish a school. Recently the younger men have been anxious to have a school for their children and on several occasions have approached me about the matter. Since calling upon you I have visited this place and discussed the question with them and they expressed their great anxiety to have a teacher. Mr. Mallison of Hazelton was to have visited them a couple of weeks later when they were going to put the case up to him.\n\nAt this place there is also a native, Mr. Williams, who has a more than ordinary bright mind and is fairly well educated and would be willing to undertake the work of teacher. He could not take up some of the things ordinarily taken up in schools at present, but he could teach the fundamentals as mentioned in the case of Kisagagas. As in the case of Kisagagas, I do not think any white teacher should be asked to go and live there.\n\nMr. Barry, I believe, thinks that in the case of Kitwancool a white teacher should be sent. I personally know this place and cannot agree with the idea.\n\nIt must be remembered that the children in both the above places cannot speak English and only one who has knowledge of their language could make any progress with them.\n\nA grant similar to the one mentioned for Kisagagas would be sufficient for Kitwancool from October 1st to the end of March. This would cover all the time the natives could be relied upon to be at home.\n\nI believe there would be little difficulty in getting some suitable place to carry on a school in either of the above places.\n\n(3) On more than one occasion Mr. Barry has reported against our teacher Mr. S. Kinley of Aiyanash. On his last inspection he personally told Mr. Kinley that he would give him a good report and yet word was received later from your Office that the report\nwas not good.\n\nMr. Kinley has taken two terms at Victoria under Mr. Barry and puts himself wholeheartedly into the work of the school. He has had an unusually good average attendance of children and is highly thought of by the natives and is held in the highest esteem by myself. His influence for good in the community could not be excelled. As a matter of fact, he is outstanding among the workers among the natives. I would be extremely sorry if I did not get your assurance that he would be carried on at Aiyansh to continue his really excellent work.\n\nOne thing needed very much there is a new school where in all probability better work could be done. At present the school is held in a large room in the mission house.\n\n(4) I got a distinct surprise a few weeks ago to hear that Mr. Barry had recommended a change in the school at Metlakatla. Mr. Bryant has been the teacher here for I think about eight years. His school has always been held up as an example of all that is fine in such schools. I have no supervision over him as I have over certain others of the teachers, but I know him well and hold him in the highest respect. As a man, a Christian and a teacher he stands the test. I believe you visited this school yourself and expressed yourself as unusually pleased with it. And I happen to know that Col. Pragnall recently visited it and made written notes upon several things which he thought to be outstanding in their excellence. The Indian Agent here has many times expressed himself of his pleasure of having such a man at Metlakatla. Mr. Barry objects to his age. I believe he is 59, and is in better health than he was when he undertook the work there. But he is at an age when if he were thrown out he would find it difficult to get anything else to do, as you so well know in these days. Unfortunately he has an invalid wife which adds seriously to his problems. I am satisfied\nif you or Mr. Hoey could inspect the excellent work Mr. Bryant is doing, you would not only consent but insist upon his remaining at Metlakatla.\n\nI am grateful that I have your assurance that I am free to write to you what I have on my mind. I have, however, told Mr. Collison, the Indian Agent here, that I was writing and what was the import of my letter.\n\nI was not sure whether I should take up your time or that of Mr. Hoey, but I am enclosing an extra copy which could be handed over to him if you so think it wise.\n\nWith every good wish,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. A. Rix.\nDear Sir,\n\nre - Proposed Seasonal Day School at Kisgegas.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of March 17th, file S-1-348, and Mr. Hoey's reply of March 26th, I wish to advise you that a suitable building for school purposes, equipped with heater, has been offered at a rental of $60.00 per annum. A teacher's residence can be obtained at a rental of not more than $24.00 per year.\n\nThe Indians of Kisgegas ask that the school be open from September 1st to March 31st - seven months.\n\nAs previously mentioned, desks can be made on the reserve. Is it possible to obtain \"roller\" blackboards, as all equipment must be sent in by pack-horses? Books, stationery, etc.- supplied from Ottawa - should be sent to this office. I shall be glad if you will kindly give me authority to purchase all necessary equipment that can be obtained locally.\n\nMr. William Wale, a well educated Hazelton Indian, is still available and is prepared to live at Kisgegas during the Department's pleasure.\n\nI presume the Anglican Church will contribute $25.00 per month to the teacher's salary - as per the letter of the Rt. Rev. G. A. Rix, dated February 1st, 1937 - making a total of $75.00 per teaching month.\n\nWill you kindly advise me as soon as possible in the matter and oblige?\n\nGCM/SM.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nApril 5th, 1938.\n\nH. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI was greatly rejoiced to get your letters re Kisgagas and Kitwancool.\n\nMr. Wale is still available for the Kisgagas village. He is a fine character and I am asking Captain Mortimer to arrange that he be allowed to observe methods &c. at the native school at Hazelton under Mr. Burling so as to be some help to him at Kisgagas. Mr. Wale's address, I imagine, will always be Hazelton, even although he is living at Kisgagas, as I question whether there is a Post Office there.\n\nThis is an experiment trying out an Indian for this important work, but the place is so isolated and the people so primitive that I would not care to see a white teacher go in there.\n\nI note your desires re Kitwancool and I will endeavour to get a qualified teacher, a married man if possible and one who understands Manual Training. It may not be easy to get all this, but at least I can get a qualified teacher. I suppose I may promise to a suitable man the usual $80.00 per teaching month and a house.\n\nWith best wishes, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. A. Rix,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nOttawa, March 26th, 1938.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 24th, 1937, and also Dr. McGill's reply of December, I am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Agent Mortimer in connection with the proposed establishment of a school at Kispegas.\n\nMr. Mortimer suggests that a seasonal school be conducted, and we are prepared to allow a salary of $50 a month for a six months' period. I am writing Mr. Mortimer to ascertain what date he considers this school should commence operations.\n\nIn your letter of November 24th, 1937, you suggested that an educated Indian, Mr. W. Wale, should be secured as teacher for this school. Please let me know if his services are still available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, March 26th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, in connection with the proposed establishment of a day school at Kisgegas.\n\nThe Department is prepared to favourably consider the establishment of a seasonal school, and we will allow an amount of $50 a month for a six months' period.\n\nPlease let me know what date you consider this school should start. You should also make further enquiries regarding the buildings that can be secured. It is noted from your letter that you consider the rent will not exceed $5 per month.\n\nLast Fall, Right Rev. Bishop Rix suggested that an educated Indian, Mr. W. Wale, be appointed as teacher. I am writing Bishop Rix with a view to ascertaining if Mr. Wale's services are still available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. N. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nre - Suggested Indian Day School at Kisgegas.\n\nReferring to your letter of September 10th regarding the suggestion of a day school at Kisgegas, I wish to submit the following particulars for your information:\n\nThere are approximately twelve children of school age who have not received any education.\n\nSuitable buildings can be procured for use as school and teacher's residence at reasonable rentals, that of the school building being about $5.00 per month.\n\nAs this reserve is more than fifty (50) miles from Hazelton, over a rough mountainous trail, I am of opinion that the suggestion of the Right Reverend G. A. Rix, D. D., Bishop of Caledonia, to send an Indian Teacher there would meet the situation, if this has the approval of the Department.\n\nAs the attendance at the school would be very small I would suggest that an allowance of $50.00 per month be given the teacher for six months - or more, if necessary - each year at present.\n\nDesks of whip-sawed lumber could be made on the reserve, it being almost impossible to ship in the regular school desks.\n\nAs to whether a day school should be established or not in this village is entirely up to the decision of the Department. Consideration as to the remoteness of this reserve; the difficulty of access to it and the impossibility of the few children there obtaining education are points in favour of a school. On the other hand it would be utterly impracticable to send a White Teacher to this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, December 2, 1937.\n\nMy dear Bishop Rix:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Lordship's letter of November 24th, in which you submit, for my consideration, a number of proposals with respect to the administration of Indian day schools in the diocese of Caledonia.\n\nI may state that the employment of teachers at Indian day schools, other than those who have secured professional certificates, has, in recent years, been given a great deal of consideration by the departmental officials. We have a great deal of sympathy for a number of elderly teachers, many of whom have rendered faithful and conscientious service in our schools at a time when it was exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to secure fully qualified teachers. It is scarcely necessary to point out, however, that there are at the present time hundreds of fully trained teachers, many of whom are university graduates, who have throughout the depression failed to secure employment. The Dominion Government, in cooperation with the Provinces, is engaged at the moment in the promotion of a programme designed to secure for the young people of the country the opportunities for useful employment to which these young people feel they are entitled. In view of this fact, it is exceedingly difficult to justify the employment of teachers lacking the ordinary qualifications. I am, personally, of the opinion that it will be impossible to secure from Parliament, during the days that lie ahead of us, money for the payment of teachers in charge of Indian day schools, other than those who have taken the regular course of training in the provincial normal schools. This subject has been discussed on a number of occasions.\n\nRight Reverend G. A. Rix, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nof occasions by representatives of the churches with our officials, and all of these representatives have agreed that only fully qualified teachers would be recommended by them in the future. This decision may appear somewhat harsh to certain teachers now in our employment, but I cannot possibly see how any other decision can be reached.\n\nIt is my intention to review again Inspector Barry's reports covering the work of Mr. Kinley and Mr. Bryant, with the object of retaining these men at their respective schools for another year or two, at least. Certainly, no action will be taken with respect to either until we have communicated with you again.\n\nYour request for grants, sufficient to provide a certain amount of instruction at Kisagagas and Kitwancool, seems to me to be reasonable, in view of the number of pupils in these districts for whose education no provision appears to have been made. I am afraid, however, that we shall experience a great deal of difficulty in any attempt we may make towards the employment of either Mr. Wale or Mr. Williams. It may be possible in certain cases to justify the employment of teachers who lack full academic and professional standing but who have, nevertheless, rendered fairly satisfactory service over a period of years; but, to ask the Department to engage teachers not previously employed would, I am afraid, create a great deal of bitter controversy and would be scarcely fair, either to the teachers employed on the one hand or to the Department on the other. If, as you state, it would be inadvisable to send white teachers into these districts, would it not be possible to get one or two young Indians and have these young men or women trained for this work? I am submitting this suggestion to you for your consideration, and I feel confident that either\n\nCommissioner\nCommissioner MacKay or Inspector Barry would be glad to cooperate with you in securing the services of such teachers. I may state that, while the money at our disposal this year will not enable us to make a grant to either Kisagas or Kitwancool, it is my intention to recommend that a grant be made to both of these districts immediately following the opening of the school year 1938.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank you for your letter and for having brought to my personal attention a number of matters relating to the betterment of the Indian population in your diocese.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDr. Harold W.

We make an arrangement with Mr. Tom Graham at the hatchery for the lumber we are going to have in store where not started yet but are going to do this winter. We think this is better than going to have River for the lumber so we ask for the Indian Depot - went to help us for the nails and the shingles to be done. Know how much nails and shingles until we will insert the building. We want nail and shingles from Lillooet and for windows and door we want by Douglas wood next summer. We will let you know how many and doors of one other time and we want some tar paper for the floor and some paper for the wall so we all very glad to start this now for you know this are many childrens here at Pemberton Meadows so good bye I hope this letter will find in good health with best regard to you Yours Truly,\n\nChief James Matzie\nIndian Reserve Pemberton Meadows\nSir:\u2014\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith a letter dated the 14th instant, received from Chief James of Pemberton band, in regard to the building of a school house for the children of the band.\n\nMr. T. Graham, the manager of the Dominion Government Salmon Hatchery at Pemberton, has installed a small saw-mill plant at the Hatchery, and the Indians have arranged with him to have the lumber for the school building sawed there, they furnishing the logs and paying for the sawing in labor; and they want to know if the Department will supply nails, shingles, windows, doors, etc., as well as pay the salary of a teacher when the building is completed. They will do all the necessary carpenter work, etc., in connection with the erection of the building.\n\nThe Chief states in his letter that he does not know what quantity of material will be required. From this it is evident that they have not yet decided what size building they will put up.\n\nIf the Department decides to give favorable consideration to the request made by the Indians, perhaps it would also furnish a suitable plan, and then the quantity of material required could be figured up, and an estimate of the cost of same prepared.\n\nThere are between 40 and 50 children of school age in the band, and the building would have to be sufficiently large\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nto provide living apartments for the teacher.\n\nSome few of these Indians have been attending St. Mary's Mission Boarding School from time to time, but the others have had no opportunity of attending any school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 7, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo enclosing a communication from the Indians of the Pemberton Band in which they ask the Department for assistance to enable them to erect a school building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to grant this assistance provided it is assured that the building that the Indians will erect will be a substantial structure and meet the requirements. If they supply the lumber and perform the labour the Department will provide the doors, windows, shingles, tar paper and hardware, etc., and will also furnish the school-room and pay the salary of a teacher when it is ready for occupation.\n\nThe Department has no plan that would be suitable for a building of this kind, but I may state that in several sections of British Columbia the Indians have under the supervision of the Indian Agent put up suitable frame structures. It is thought that you should be able to furnish a sketch of a building that would be suitable for the purpose of the Indians and give them such instructions as will enable them to do the work. The size of the building will depend upon the number of children to be accommodated. There should be 16 square feet of floor space and 250 cubic feet of air space for each child. The floor should\n\nR. C. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nshould be well laid and there should be a porch at the entrance. If accommodation for a teacher is necessary it is thought that it would be preferable to erect a leanto unless the dimensions are such that there would be no danger of overcrowding the pupils if a couple of rooms are provided for the teacher. The Department would like you before taking final action to submit a sketch that you think would be suitable with a description of the building, and, if approved and the Indians agree to do the work in accordance with your plan, the permission to purchase the material above referred to will then be given.\n\nI may say that it is the wish of the Department to give these Indians every encouragement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, March 27, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in further reference to the erection of a school building by the Pemberton Band of Indians.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if these Indians will erect a good substantial building along the lines of the sketch submitted with your letter the Department will purchase for them the shingles, doors and other articles mentioned in your letter. If you consider it necessary you may authorize the purchase of the nails, tar paper and shingles at Lillooet, in order that the Indians may get at the work earlier in the season. I have to ask you to be good enough to state what means you will have of watching building operations, or how often you will be able to visit the locality yourself. If it will not be possible for you to visit the locality at frequent intervals you should make arrangements to receive reports from some reliable person.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. C. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 7th ultimo, No. 380000, regarding the application made by the Pemberton band of Indians for assistance to enable them to erect a school building on their reserve, I have the honor to enclose herewith a ground floor rough sketch of the proposed building a copy of which I also sent to the Indians of the band, and they informed me that they are willing to put up such a building, provided the Department will grant them the assistance asked, and also provided the sketch meets with the approval of the Department.\n\nA school room of the size indicated on the plan, should give sufficient floor and air space for 40 pupils, and it is not likely that there will be more than that number at any one time attending school.\n\nThe following is an estimate of the quantity of material required and the cost of same at New Westminster:\n\n- 16 M. Shingles ........................................... $36.00\n- 5 Doors .................................................. $25.00\n- 5 Door Frames ............................................ $15.00\n- 14 Windows ............................................... $70.00\n- 14 Window Frames ....................................... $42.00\n- 12 Rolls Tar Paper ....................................... $9.00\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\n5 Rim Locks (complete) ........................................... $3.00\n5 pairs Hinges .................................................. 1.00\n100 lbs. Shingle Nails .......................................... 4.50\n300 lbs. 2\u00bd inch Nails ......................................... 10.20\n100 lbs. 5 inch Nails ........................................... 3.25\n\nTotal ............................................................... $218.95\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the freight charges, as it will depend altogether as to how the material can be shipped. The Steamer Beaver usually makes one trip from her to Port Douglas in the month of May each year, carrying supplies for the store at Douglas and for the Hatchery at Pemberton; and if this material can be shipped in this way, it should not cost more than about $20.00, and the Indians would be able to take it from Douglas themselves, the distance from there to Pemberton being about 60 miles.\n\nThe Indians, however, ask that the shingles, nails and tar paper be purchased at Lillooet, as they evidently wish to commence the building before the month of May, and would not be able to get these articles in by Douglas before the latter part of May or first of June.\n\nPrices are very much higher at Lillooet, and are as follows:\n\n100 lbs. Shingle Nails .......................................... $6.50\n300 lbs. 2\u00bd inch Nails ......................................... 17.25\n100 lbs. 5 inch Nails ........................................... 5.50\n12 rolls Tar paper ............................................... 13.80\n16 M. Shingles .................................................... 72.00\n\nLillooet is about 65 miles from Pemberton, but they could haul this material from there at any time now, and it would enable them to make a start on the building before planting.\nplanting time. I understand that they will have the lumber ready in April.\n\nThese Indians are very anxious to have their school opened as soon as possible, and I feel sure that they will put up a good, substantial building.\n\nI would have replied to this communication sooner, but that I was awaiting quotations from Lillooet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nApril 5, 1911.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo, No. 380000, regarding the erection of a school building by the Pemberton band of Indians, I beg to say that I have written to the Chief, informing him that I have received authority from the Department to purchase the material asked for by him, and that I will forward an order for the purchase, at Lilicoet, of the shingles, nails, and tar paper, as soon as I hear from him that they have the lumber ready for the building, and are prepared to start work on the erection of same.\n\nAs it will hardly be possible for the agent to watch the building operations, I have written to Mr. T. Graham, Manager of the Dominion Fish Hatchery at Pemberton, and have asked him to be good enough to report from time to time as to how the building operations would be progressing; at the same time, I have every confidence in these Indians, that they will do the work faithfully and well, as there are some very good carpenters in the band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 13, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nNearly last spring the Department authorized the late Agent, Mr. McDonald, to grant assistance to the Pemberton Band of Indians to erect a school. This assistance was to be in the form of material such as shingles, doors and other articles mentioned. On April 3rd, last, Mr. McDonald wrote stating that he had communicated with the Chief informing him of the authority granted to purchase material and that the order for the purchase would be placed as soon as he, the Agent, heard from the Chief.\n\nThe Department has had no further communication in respect to this matter and I would ask you to make inquiries and report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.\nJanuary 22, 1912.\n\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter dated the 15th inst., and No. 380000, in regard to the erection of a school on the Pemberton Meadows Indian Reserve, I beg to say, that while there last summer, I in company with the Chief of the Pemberton Meadows band, visited the school site and I found that a great deal of the timber necessary in the construction of a school building, was then on the ground. I informed the Chief that the Department was desirous of having the work done as soon as possible, in order that their children should receive an education. The Chief informed me that he would urge upon his people, the necessity of the work being done without delay. I have not heard anything in regard to this matter since.\n\nI am writing to Chief James Stager, of the above named band for information on this subject, and on receipt of a reply I will advise the Department.\n\nIt is almost impossible to reach this reserve during the winter season owing to the difficulties caused by the snow. In the summer time it takes about two weeks to make the round trip, so the Department can see that I can do very little else, other than to write for the information required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nThese Indians should have a school. They already have the lumber cut for one, but owing to the fact that they have been unable to settle among themselves as to the most favourable site, the building had not been gone on with. This matter I took upon myself to settle, and selected the site, and the Indians gave me their promise that the building would be constructed during the present year. As there are at least fifty children of school age on this reserve, and as their parents stay on the reserve practically all the year, there should always be a good average attendance at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nW.E. Ditchburn\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of January 22nd, last, I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Ditchburn in a report on the proposed Pemberton School states that a site has been selected and the Indians have given their promise that the building will be constructed during the present year.\n\nThe Department would like to see this work done and if operations are to go ahead you will be good enough to see that they are furnished with the material which the Department agreed to supply, viz.\u2014nails, tar paper, shingles, doors, windows and window frames. You will find a complete list of these materials in a letter dated March 15th, 1912, written by Mr. McDonald, who was then Agent of that district. You should be guided by the patronage list in making these purchases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, Ont., October 21st, 1915.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your report for the months of August and September; and in reply, I may say that it is observed that you refer to the request made by different Indian bands for the establishment of schools and also for the appointment of doctors on their behalf. The Department will be glad to receive a more definite report and recommendation from you in each case to which you have made reference with the exception of the request for the appointment of Dr. Paul as medical officer to the Squamish Indians, upon which you made report in your letter of the 11th September (File No. 145,202-1A). I may say that although the Department asks for these reports in order to be fully informed in the matter, it is desired to point out to you that the Department is averse to increasing the expenditure for medical attendance at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Stewart,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6421, file 865-1, part 1)\nSir:-\n\nReplying to your letter of 1st October, 1915, in which you requested me to give further information with respect to the establishment of schools for the Indians at Pemberton Meadows as well as those of the Douglas tribe along the Lillooet River, the latter extending from Harrison to Lillooet Lakes, a distance of 29 miles, I beg to say that a boarding or industrial school established in the vicinity of Pemberton Meadows would serve a very useful purpose, as, at present, the Indians of these tribes are without any education facilities.\n\nThere are about 75 children of school age at Pemberton Meadows and another 75 in the various villages of the Douglas tribe. A few are at present attending the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School, at Mission City, which is distant from Pemberton Meadows approximately 120 miles and from Fort Douglas 60 miles. The largest village of the Douglas Indians is at Skookumchuck, 19 miles above Fort Douglas or 79 miles from Mission City. The Pemberton and Douglas tribes are in the New Westminster Agency but contiguous to the Pemberton band are the Anderson and Seton Lake Indians, where there are also a number of children without any school facilities.\n\nA boarding or industrial school established somewhere\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nsomewhere near Pemberton Meadows would thus have a large field from which to obtain pupils and would thus leave the boarding school at Mission City free to take pupils from the reserves in closer proximity to that point.\n\nWhen taking up the matter of establishing a school for these Indians the question of obtaining a favourable site would have to be given serious thought. The Pemberton Indians suggested a site at the head of Anderson Lake, 17 miles distant. This, no doubt, would be an ideal location were land available there, but unfortunately it is not. The Anderson Lake Indians have only about 500 acres in their four reserves and it would, therefore, not be wise to expropriate sufficient land for a school and farm which should have at least 100 acres. The Catholic church had a large tract of land at this point some time ago but sold it to the Pacific Great Eastern Railway Company. To obtain any other land in this section of the country it would have to be acquired by purchase and, no doubt, at a high figure. The location on the Pemberton Meadows would not be desirable as the lands are subject to overflow occasionally, and every summer from June until the middle of August mosquitoes are a very serious pest. These flies are so bad on the bottom lands that the Indians have to move their families and drive their cattle into the hills at times. There is, however, some good land at Pemberton Reserve No. 6 the old Smith-Bell pre-emption, on which a school might be established. This reserve is in a valley about nine miles above the Pemberton Indian village and at a much higher elevation. I am given to understand also that there is plenty of good water and is much freer from mosquitoes than the lower land. This site might be kept in mind for future consideration when the Departments feels that\nthat the establishment of a school in this section of the country can be taken up.\n\nAs regards physicians to treat the Indians of the Pemberton and Douglas bands I also beg to say that they are without medical attention, unless the Pemberton, on the one hand go to Dr. Christie at Lillooet, 60 miles distant, or to Dr. Paul at Squamish, 75 miles away. With the building of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway through the Pemberton Valley no doubt a number of settlers will soon go into this country who will, in all likelihood, be followed by a doctor. This, no doubt, will help the Pemberton Indians, but will be of little advantage to the Douglas Indians on the Lillooet River, as to reach the doctor at Pemberton the Indians of Samahquam, Sachteen and Skookumchuck would have to travel nine miles by wagon and 25 miles by boat up the Lillooet Lakes to reach the Pemberton Meadows. The Douglas Indians at Fort Douglas have to go down Harrison Lake 28 miles by canoe or launch and five miles by road to be treated by Dr. McCaffrey at Agassiz.\n\nWith regard to the Indians along the Douglas River I see no hope for the future of a doctor ever being in closer touch than Dr. McCaffrey is at present, for it is purely an Indian country, there being no white people in the district whatever. At Pemberton, however, the case is hopeful, for as I have already stated, there is a great probability of this section of the country being occupied in the near future by a considerable number of white settlers.\n\nI trust the foregoing will be sufficient information for the Department to keep on file for future use when consider-\nconsidering both the establishment of a school and also the necessity of appointing a physician to attend the Indians when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nI herewith enclose a marked plan, showing the various points alluded to in my letter, in order that you may have a fair conception of the section of country in which the Indians live where the establishment of a school would serve a very useful purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, January 31, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 17th instant reporting on the educational needs of the Indians at Pemberton Meadows, as well as those of the Douglas tribe along the Lillooet River, extending from Harrison to Lillooet Lake, I beg to say that the same has been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nP. O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C. February 25, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that recently I received a letter from the Chief of the Pemberton Indian Reserve No. 1, in the New Westminster Agency, asking that a day school should be erected on their reserve for the education of the Indian children of which he stated there are over fifty of school age.\n\nOn receipt of the Chief's letter I wrote to Mr. Indian Agent Daunt asking for his opinion and he has informed me that there are more children on the Pemberton reserve than can possibly be accommodated at the St. Mary's Residential School at Mission, and he would be very much in favor of a day school being provided for the Pemberton children. He further states that a Field Matron would also be of the greatest assistance. The Pemberton band have a population of just under three hundred Indians and there are about twenty children from the place now in the Mission School and there must be another forty of school age around the reserve. Providing it would be possible to accommodate all the children of the Pemberton reserve at the school at Mission, it must be remembered that there are always a certain number of the Indian children who are not physically fit to be admitted to residential schools and a day school would be the only institution at which they would have the opportunity of receiving an education.\n\nIf a day school is to be built on the Pemberton Reserve it will also be necessary to provide living quarters for a teacher and his wife, and the latter might be appointed to the position of Field Matron. The total cost of the two buildings I should think would not exceed $6,000.00.\n\nThe Pemberton Meadows on which the Indian Reserve is situated are at the head of Lillooet Lake close to the northern boundary of the New Westminster Agency.\n\nSome time ago I wrote to the Deputy Minister furnishing him with information as to what points throughout the Province I thought our residential schools might be extended and among the points I mentioned the Lillooet district at which I thought a residential school should be established in order to take care of the education of the children of the Pemberton Meadows as well as those children in the bands in the northern part of the Lytton Agency. I have, however, heard nothing as yet that my recommendation in this regard has been put into effect and, therefore, I am of the opinion that it would be advisable to at least build a day school for the Pemberton Indians.\n\nWED/KD.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Dittohburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6421, file 865-1, part 1)\nOttawa, September 2, 1937\n\nEX'D.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo enclosing Captain Barry's report on the educational survey of the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve.\n\nBefore this can be submitted to the Minister, I require a report regarding conditions on Pemberton Meadows Reserve. This report was previously requested in official letter of June 29th, and it is hoped will reach the Department in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A.

C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your 153-28-1 of the 29th ultimo, in which you request that arrangements be made to have Inspector Barry make a survey of the Pemberton and Tswassen Indian Reserves with a view to determining if day schools should be established on these Reserves.\n\nArrangements have been made with Inspector Barry to carry out this survey immediately on his return from his holidays.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nDM/HN\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nMost Reverend and Dear Sir:\n\nThe Honourable Mr. Crerer has not yet returned from the Coronation ceremonies and the Imperial Conference, and I am replying to your letter of the 21st ultimo, in which you ask whether it will be possible for Inspector Barry to investigate matters relating to education at Pemberton Meadows and Tsawassen Indian Reserves, British Columbia.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner for British Columbia is being asked to have Mr. Barry make this survey, although I might say that Mr. Barry will be absent on holidays until about the 1st August.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nH.J.F. Pratt,\nSecretary.\n\nMost Reverend W.M. Duke, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Vancouver,\n646 Richards Street,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Deputy Minister.\n\nEnclosed is the letter from Most Reverend W. M. Duke, Archbishop of Vancouver, forwarded to me under cover of Mr. Pratt's memorandum of June 28th.\n\nBoth the Pemberton Meadows and the Tsawassen Reserves are in the New Westminster Agency. Indian Agent Daunt suggested the establishment of a day school on the Pemberton Meadows Reserve in the year 1934, but, in order to start a school, a building would be required and, as no funds were provided for the purpose, no action was taken at that time. There are, approximately, 320 Indians in this Band and there are 78 children of school age, of whom 36 are attending the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School. This leaves 44 on the reserve without educational facilities.\n\nA day school was conducted on the Tsawassen Reserve from 1913 to 1915, but was closed in the latter year owing to the small attendance. This Band has a membership of only 47 and the last census shows only eight or nine children of school age.\n\nInspector Barry is on holidays at the present time but he will return to duty about August 1st. A letter is being directed to Major D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, requesting him to have Mr. Barry visit these reserves early in August and make a survey and report to the Department regarding the feasibility of establishing day schools.\n\nActing Director.\nJune 29th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMost Reverend W. M. Duke, Archbishop of Vancouver, has written The Honourable the Minister, requesting that Inspector Barry make a survey of the Pemberton Meadows and Tsawassen Indian Reserves with a view to determining if day schools should be established.\n\nA day school was in operation on the Tsawassen Indian Reserve from 1913 to 1915 but was closed owing to the small attendance.\n\nIn 1934, Indian Agent Daunt suggested the establishment of a day school on the Pemberton Meadows Reserve but, as no funds were available and a new building would be required, no action was taken at that time.\n\nWhen Inspector Barry returns from his holidays, the Department would appreciate it if you would have him visit the New Westminster Agency, consult Agent Daunt and visit the two reserves mentioned. You should then report fully regarding the possibilities of establishing a day school on one or both of them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nMajor D. M.

MCGILL\n\nRe: Establishment Indian Schools at Pemberton Meadows, B.C., and Tsawwassen Indian Reserve, Ladner, B.C.\n\nWith a return of the attached letter to the Minister from the Archbishop of Vancouver, will you please furnish a full report which may be placed before the Minister upon his return.\n\nEncl. June 21.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt\nSecretary.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. A. O'N. DAUNT,\nINDIAN AGENT, NEW WESTMINSTER, DATED APRIL 7, 1936.\n\nI would remark regarding the school question, that we have 49 Pemberton children in St. Mary's Indian Residential School, which is a generous proportion, considering the rights of other Bands. There are nevertheless, many more children of school age on the Reserve, and I feel that they should have a school, if Funds permitted.\nSIR:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 1st, File No. 153-28-1, I beg to inform you that I visited the Pemberton Reserve on June 1st and 2nd, and I find that building adjacent thereto upon which I had counted as perhaps being available as teacher's quarters and school room are otherwise occupied.\n\nI am afraid there is therefore nothing we can do in this connection at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nIn your letter of the 23rd ultimo, you refer to the advisability of a day school on the Pemberton reserve.\n\nPlease let me know if there is a building on the Pemberton reserve which would be suitable for a classroom and for accommodation for the teacher. If so, you should give me full particulars. Please state, also, what expense would be involved in commencing a day school on this reserve. When your report comes to hand, the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM A. O'N. DAUNT,\nIndian Agent, New Westminster, B. C., His\nNo. 1-8-D, dated April 23, 1934.\n\nOriginal on 153-12-1.\n\nxxxxxxxxxx\n\nThe Pemberton Indians, with a membership\nof about 320, have been asking for a school for years.\nThey have 78 children of school age, of whom 34 are\ntaken care of in St. Mary's Mission Residential\nSchool, leaving 44 on the Reserve without educational\nfacilities. The Chehalis School and Cottage need\nrepairs and it is possible that the cost of these\nwould fit up temporary premises at Pemberton if the\nDepartment were inclined to transfer the teacher\nprovided such accommodation could be found. We badly\nneed a Field Matron at Pemberton also, as it is over\nsixty miles from the nearest doctor. It would be\nmuch better policy to endeavour to place a teacher\nand Field Matron at Pemberton than to carry on the\nChehalis School either with Mr. Burns or a new\nteacher.\nOttawa, April 10, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 27th ultimo in which you request that educational facilities be provided on the Pemberton Reserve, it is regretted that, owing to lack of funds, the Department is unable to favourably consider your request at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary\n\nChief R. J. Steer,\nOwl Creek,\nB.C.\nOwl Bank B.C.\nMarch 27/30\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to you about the possibility of having a school here this year as the other classes of Indians have schools already. I don't see why we should not have it here.\n\nWe have from 60 to 70 children here and ready to go to school now.\n\nAlso, I am writing to ask you about the Willow Lake trading post here in our new Indian Reserve near No. 3. I have not heard anything about it so please reply to me.\n\nI wish you will find this with best understanding.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nChief R.J. Taylor\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6421, file 865-1, part 1)\nOttawa, March 5, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/11020 of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the advisability of providing educational facilities for the Pemberton Indian Reserve.\n\nThe Department has in mind the extension of the residential school system in British Columbia and it is hoped that, in a few years, such a school can be established somewhere in the Lillooet area. At the present time, however, there are no funds for this purpose, and I believe we should favourably consider your recommendation that a day school be established on Pemberton Indian Reserve No. 1. As you are, no doubt, aware, our Main Estimates for the coming fiscal year are tabled, and it may be impossible to secure an appropriation for the purpose in the immediate future. However, the matter will not be overlooked. Your recommendation that a field matron as well as a teacher be placed on this reserve will also receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

(RG 10, Volume 6421, file 865-1, part 1)\nDATE OF SURVEY: In company with Mr. Indian Agent Daunt, I visited the Pemberton Reserves to undertake the field work in connection with this Report, and also the Birkenhead Hatchery, on August 27th. On September 3rd in the Indian Agent's Office in New Westminster, I completed the necessary office work.\n\nMay I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Indian Agent Daunt and Miss Dynes for the great help afforded me in carrying out the Department's wishes.\n\nPURPOSE OF SURVEY: This survey was carried out on instructions from Major D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, and in accordance with the provisions of Departmental letter 155-28-1 dated June 29th, 1937.\n\nThe special question to be reported upon was the necessity or otherwise for further educational facilities for the Indian children on the Pemberton Indian Reserves, and particularly, the matter of the establishment of an Indian Day School at that point.\n\nMETHOD FOLLOWED: As mentioned above, I visited Pemberton during the period from August 26th to 28th, inclusive, and in company with Mr. Indian Agent Daunt made a thorough inspection of the site at Mile 62, P.G.E., where many partly constructed houses await completion by the Indians to whom they have been allotted. A visit was also paid to the old Pemberton Indian village and later to the Birkenhead Hatchery.\n\nLater at the Pemberton Hotel, and in company with Mr. Indian Agent Daunt, I had a short conversation with William Pascall, Indian Secretary and Councillor, who was informed that, if and when, an Indian Day School were established at Pemberton, it would be absolutely necessary for all available Indian children to attend regularly. He further explained to this Indian Councillor that the decision with regard to the establishment of an Indian Day School rested with the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa, and that, while I was prepared to recommend the establishment of such a School, it must be clearly understood that the cost of said School would have to be included in the Estimates for the next financial year, and that, therefore, no immediate decision could be arrived at in the matter.\n\nAPPEARANCE AND ATTITUDE OF CHILDREN: Many of the children on the Pemberton Indian Reserves attend St. Mary's Indian Residential School, Mission City, where they, of course, receive an excellent education. It was pointed out to me by William Pascall that in addition to those children attending School at Mission City, a very large number were not receiving any education and that the Indians were very anxious to have a Day School at Pemberton.\nAppearance and attitude of Children - Cont'd.\n\nI spoke to a few children whom I happened to meet during my visit to Pemberton Reserve No. 2 but failed to obtain any worthwhile response. The children were not very well dressed and appeared somewhat uncared for. The establishment of an Indian Day School with resident teacher would, no doubt, correct this condition.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF CHILDREN:-\n\nThe list of children given in the Appendix and forming part of this Report has been compiled with very great care. A list was prepared in the Indian Agent's Office, New Westminster, and a copy forwarded to the Secretary of the Indian Council at Pemberton for any necessary alterations and additions. On receipt of this revised list in the New Westminster Office, Miss Dynes was good enough to prepare the very complete tabulation now attached.\n\nThis shows the children with ages, and by families; the name of the parent being given in each case.\n\nThere are in all 159 children of school age and under registered on the Pemberton Reserves.\n\nOf the above 159 children, there are 105 of school age, or between the ages of 6 to 16, inclusive.\n\nOf the 105 children of school age, 38 were attending St. Mary's Indian Residential School at Mission City last year. This leaves a total of 67 children of school age not at present attending any School.\n\nThere are 54 children under 6 years of age, which gives approximately 9 children for the receiving class or Grade 1-C yearly.\n\nRELIGIOUS TEACHING:-\n\nThe children of Pemberton are members of the Roman Catholic Church; and it would, therefore, be under the auspices of said Church that the Indian Day School, should such be established here, would be administered.\n\nBUILDINGS AVAILABLE:-\n\nI was unable to discover any building on the Pemberton Reserves or at Mile 62, P.G.E. which could possibly be turned into an Indian Day School.\n\nShould it be decided to establish an Indian Day School here, I would strongly recommend the erection of a building with class-room accommodation for at least 40 pupils, and additional rooms for living accommodation of a married teacher.\n\nSITE OF PROPOSED SCHOOL:-\n\nAccompanied by Mr. Indian Agent Deunt I made a careful inspection of the land at Mile 62 P.G.E.\n\nWhen the Subdivision was made at this point as shown in a map mentioned below, a site was tentatively\nSite of Proposed School - Cont'd.\n\nchosen for a future school but we found on examination that this site was not very suitable and would certainly require considerable clearing and grading before a School could be erected. Even then I consider that this site was originally chosen by someone unacquainted with school requirements, as there would be no suitable ground for school gardens or a playground.\n\nBy far the best site for the proposed Indian Day School would be that shown as Lot 4 and part of Lot 3, on a map entitled \"Pemberton I. R. No. 10, Lillooet District, B. C., Subdivision Survey, Department of Indian Affairs 27153-28 dated March 31, 1934\". Lots 3 and 4 face on the P.G.E. Railway. I consider that the School itself with teacher's residence should be located on Lot 4, which is approximately 219.5 ft. by 215.3 ft. Part of Lot 3 adjoining could well be used, when cleared, as a garden for the teacher's use and a small playground for the children.\n\nBIRKENHEAD HATCHERY:- This Hatchery located at Owl Creek, Mile 64.3 P.G.E. has been abandoned as a hatchery, I understand, by the Fisheries Department.\n\nBirkenhead Hatchery is about three miles by road from the proposed site of the new School. The transportation of material from the Hatchery to Mile 62 either by road or rail would be an easy matter. At Owl Creek, P.G.E. there is a spur siding capable of accommodating from six to ten freight cars. The actual distance from this spur line to the Birkenhead Hatchery buildings is not more than 200 yards.\n\nIn addition to the main hatchery building, in which there are a large number of windows and much material, there are a supervisor's house unfurnished, a bunk house partly furnished and a number of other smaller buildings. The general condition of the buildings appears to me to be quite good and the lumber, windows, etc. well worth the cost of the necessary salvage operations.\n\nI was unable to obtain a list of the contents of the buildings but noticed a 3 K.W. electric light generator direct current Fairbanks-Morse, which is worked by a Pelton Wheel, and a small circular saw outfit worked by water power. I believe that there are also a McClary's kitchen stove and bathroom fixtures in the bunk house.\n\nGENERAL:- Should a School be established on the site recommended at Mile 62, those Indian children who live on the new Subdivision would only have at most about a hundred yards' walk to School, while those still living in the old Pemberton village would be within one mile by road of the proposed school.\n\nIn general I consider that, from a statistical analysis of the list of children available, as well as from an actual visit to Pemberton, there is no doubt but that an Indian Day School is very badly needed in that locality.\nRECOMMENDATION:\u2014 I would recommend that an ungraded Indian Day School to accommodate not less than 40 children be established as soon as possible at Mile 62 P.G.E.\n\nI would further recommend that the schoolroom be attached to and form part of a school building which would give ample accommodation for a married couple, and leave room for a small dispensary.\n\nIt may be noted in passing that no single teacher should be placed here, but rather a married couple, where the husband, a trained teacher, might possibly instruct the children, and his wife, a trained nurse, look after medical needs of the Indians.\n\nI further recommend that by far the greater part of the material used in building such a School as I have proposed be obtained from the Birkenhead Hatchery, should it be still possible to take over the buildings and equipment at that point.\n\nWhile the local Indians would no doubt be able to do much of the construction work on the proposed School, I feel that the Department would save money (should they decide to erect such a School), by having the work done on contract.\n\nThere is far more material at the Birkenhead Hatchery than would be needed in the erection of such a School as I have recommended. I should like to suggest that when all this is necessary for the proposed School is taken and any other equipment which Mr. Indian Agent may require for any other points in New Westminster Agency, the Pemberton Indians be allowed to move windows and lumber to Mile 62 to finish the construction of new cottages at that point, which are at present unused by those to whom they have been allotted.\n\n---\n\nAny delay that may have occurred in the submission of this report has been due to the necessity for a very careful examination of the locality and of plans and documents in Mr. Indian Agent Daunt's Office. In accordance with the Department's instructions the survey has been made in close co-operation with Mr. Daunt. It was felt that the wishes of the Department would best be served by going into the matter as thoroughly as possible.\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nVictoria, B.C.\nSept. 4, 1937.\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVICTORIA, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nIn accordance with your instructions and with reference to Departmental letter 153-28-1 from the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, dated June 29th, 1937, I have now completed an educational survey of the Pemberton Indian Reserves, New Westminster Agency.\n\nWith the assistance of Mr. Indian Agent Daunt, the field work was completed during a visit to the Pemberton Reserves from August 26th to 28th. The necessary office work was undertaken with the help of Miss Dynes during a visit to New Westminster on September 3rd.\n\nDuring my visit in the Pemberton district, I inspected with some care the buildings of the Birkenhead Hatchery at Owl Creek. Owing to the absence of the local Fisheries officer it was not possible to enter those buildings which were locked, and I have no complete list of the available equipment in this Hatchery.\n\nWhatever the Indian Affairs Branch may think of my proposals, a consideration of the list of children (attached to and forming part of this Survey Report) can only lead to the conclusion that an Indian Day School is urgently required at Mile 62, P.G.E.\n\nI trust that the work undertaken in the preparation of the attached Survey Report will prove of value to yourself and the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch, to whom it is submitted with respect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA\nTuesday, the 21st day of June, 1938.\n\nThe Deputy of\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nWHEREAS the Minister of Mines and Resources reports that there are 60 Indian children of school age on the Pemberton No. 10 Indian reserve, in the New Westminster agency, Province of British Columbia, for whom at present no educational facilities are provided; and\n\nThat funds are available in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39, Vote 165, for the establishment of a day school on the Pemberton No. 10 Indian reserve;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 96, R.S.C. 1937, is pleased to order that a day school, to be known as \"The Pemberton Indian Day School\", be and it is hereby established on the Pemberton No. 10 Indian reserve, New Westminster agency, Province of British Columbia.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources.\n\nIndian Affairs.

No school facilities have previously been provided on this reserve, although, for some years past, our officers in the field have been urging the establishment of a day school.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation, funds were provided for the erection of a new school on this reserve and the Surveys and Engineering Branch is at present preparing plans for this new building.\n\nIn order to comply with Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, it is necessary to secure an Order-In-Council establishing this school and I therefore enclose Memo to Council for that purpose.\n\nDirector.\nJune 6, 1938.\n\nPRECIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL:\n\nEstablishment of the Pemberton Indian Day School,\non the Pemberton No. 10 Indian reserve, New Westminster\nagency, province of British Columbia.\nJune 6, 1938.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT there are 50 Indian children of school age on the Pemberton No. 10 Indian reserve, in the New Westminster agency, province of British Columbia, for whom at present no educational facilities are provided;\n\nTHAT funds are available in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39, Vote 188, for the establishment of a day school on the Pemberton No. 10 Indian reserve;\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that a day school be established on the Pemberton No. 10 Indian reserve, New Westminster agency, province of British Columbia, in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 38, R.S. 1927, to be known as \"The Pemberton Indian Day School\".\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines & Resources.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\n\nRe: Establishment of Indian Day Schools - Pemberton Meadows, British Columbia, and Taawassen Indian Reserve, Ladner, B.C.\n\nIn response to the request contained in Mr. Pratt's memorandum of June 28, 1937, I am attaching hereto a summary of reports prepared by Inspector Barry and forwarded to the Department by D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia.\n\nI may state that, in view of Inspector Barry's report on the lack of educational facilities at the Pemberton Indian reserve and the number of children of school age, it is our intention to include in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year an appropriation sufficient to construct an Indian day school on this reserve.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith Inspector Barry's report on the educational survey of Pemberton Indian Reserve, New Westminster Agency, carried out by him in accordance with 153-28-1 of June 29th, 1937.\n\nInspector Barry recommends that an ungraded Indian Day School to accommodate not less than 40 children be established on the Indian Reserve in the vicinity of Mile 62 P.G.E. Rly. Station and, further recommends, that the building be such as to provide for a school room, a married teacher's quarters and a small dispensary. I concur in these recommendations. The cost of a new structure such as Capt. Barry has in mind would be approximately $5000.00.\n\nIt will be noted that the Inspector suggests that the Birkenhead Hatchery buildings, which are within three miles by road from the proposed school site, could be dismantled and the lumber used in the construction of the new school. These buildings however, although not in use, are not available at present, as the Fisheries Department finds the buildings may still be required in connection with possible fish cultural operations on the Fraser River. Should the Fisheries Department find that these buildings are not going to be required, arrangements should be made to turn them over to the Indian Affairs Branch so that they could be dismantled and the materials used for very much needed improvements to the homes of the Pemberton Indians.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

This teacher is quite a success. Her Inspector's reports are good and she is very popular with the Indians. The attendance has held up very well during the year, considering the number of Indians who are away from the Reserve. An average attendance of 22 was maintained out of 30 pupils on the register, which is a much better showing than would have been possible a few years ago.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON NEW WESTMINSTER AGENCY FOR THE YEAR ENDING 1944-45.\n\nSchools: Three Day Schools have been operated throughout the year, viz: Pemberton, Chehalis and Skwah. The fourth school at Katzie Reserve has remained closed, and the desks have been shipped to the Skeen Agency.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nRepairs to Buildings - The only Departmentally owned buildings in the Agency are four Day Schools, viz:- Pemberton, Chehalis, Skwah and Katzie. These are all in fair repair, except Katzie. This latter School has been closed for two years, and most of the windows were broken by boys. We boarded them all up, so no further damage is possible. The roof is also in poor condition, and we stopped actual leaks with such material as was on hand. The desks were all shipped to Skeena Agency in January. Both Chehalis and Skwah Schools should be painted and redecorated, but it is impossible to interest people in submitting tenders at the present time. When there is more work available in the cities and towns than can be attended to, no workmen are anxious to go out in the country on jobs. The buildings will really come to no harm until after the war, but they should certainly be attended to then.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON NEW WESTMINSTER AGENCY FOR THE MONTH NOVEMBER, 1943.\n\nOur two new teachers, Miss McDonald at the Pemberton Indian Day School, and Mr. J.M.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the last instant, the Department does not see any objection to having the children of Mrs. S.A. Purden, Field Matron at the Pemberton Reserve, attend the Pemberton Indian Day School. It is understood, of course, that there is accommodation for them and that their admission will not adversely affect the Indian children attending the school.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Daunt's letter of\nthe 28th instant requesting authority for the admission of\nthe two children of Mrs. S.A. Purden, R.M., our Field Matron\nat the Pemberton Reserve, to the Pemberton Indian Day School.\nAs the teacher has no objection to undertaking this extra\nduty, I would recommend that the application be approved sub-\nject to no expense being incurred against our Departmental\nappropriation.\n\nKT\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOctober 28th, 1943.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have received a request from Mrs. S.A. Purden, R.N., our Field Matron at the Pemberton Reserve, for permission to send her two children, a boy and a girl, to the Indian Day School.\n\nThese children formerly attended the Provincial Public School, at Pemberton Station, some five miles from their home. Before the gasoline and tire shortage, they were driven to school, but this is now impossible, and as they are within walking distance of our Indian school, permission is requested for their admission.\n\nMiss McDonald, our teacher, is quite willing to take them, provided the Department approves. I understand that at the Departmental school she taught formerly, children of Departmental employees were allowed this privilege.\n\nWill you kindly advise me, in this respect, at your early convenience.\n\nA.O*N.

As a consequence the Treasury Branch was notified not to issue any cheques to her after November 1st, 1945. When I received your letter of December 21st I overlooked the paragraph in which you stated that she did not receive her November cheque. This letter explains the omission and we have nothing on our files to say she was continuing to teach the school. Please let me know immediately if she taught both months and if she is continuing in charge of the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPemberton Indian Day School No teacher has been found as yet for this School, but the present incumbent, Mrs. J.M.

She says she must have February and March off on private affairs, but that if a substitute teacher could be found for those two months, she might take over again from April 1st, if we are still unable to find a new teacher.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the new Pemberton Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency, which I inspected on February 24th last.\n\nIt was very difficult to get to the school as all roads were deep in snow and no truck or taxi was available. On request, the P.O.E. Railway Co. allowed me to hire a gas speeder from Pemberton to Mile 62 and return later in the day. I later thanked the officials concerned for their cooperation.\n\nConsidering that Mr. Barre, the teacher of the new school, is new to this sort of work, I consider he has done splendidly. He is doing his very best to put into effect the many suggestions made to him when he and Miss Blank called at my office last December.\n\nI shall try to find time after my return in June from the Queen Charlotte Islands to visit Pemberton again, but should there be any difficulty Mr. Barre has been instructed to write to the Indian Agent or myself at once.\n\nSome painting appears to require completion when the weather makes this possible. As the Department has decided against inside toilets in Indian Day Schools, I must needs recommend the erection of a simple outside toilet for the teacher as apart from the children's toilets now constructed. These are too small and almost useless in a general sort of way, though it is quite correct to have one available in case of illness of the teacher or his family. Such an inside chemical toilet does not do away with the necessity for an outside toilet such as are in use throughout British Columbia.\n\nThough later some work may be necessary on the inside of the school due to shrinking of lumber in general the building appears to me to be well constructed.\n\nSeveral matters were brought to my attention by the teacher and Indian Agent, such as the provision of domestic supply of water by sinking a pipe with sand point, which I should recommend to a surface well, but such matters will be looked into by Mr. Indian Agent Daunt in due course. An extra copy of this letter is attached so that it may be sent with the report on the school to Mr. Daunt.\n\nAll Indian schools in the New Westminster Agency have now been inspected. The Indian Agent is to be congratulated on the present highly satisfactory condition of his schools, and I wish to thank him for the assistance he has given to me in the carrying out of my professional duties.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

Furniture and other articles in the schoolroom were properly arranged.\n\nMr. and Mrs Barre are to be congratulated that in such a short space of time such a good school is now in operation in this district.\n\nThe children are happy, well dressed, and clean. The teacher has very good control indeed of these pupils.\n\nFire drills are held, and I suggested a few minor modifications to improve these.\n\nWith the exception of the school at Chehalis all the schools in the New Westminster Agency have now been visited during the present academic year. Reports have in each case been forwarded to the Department through your office.\n\nI have received considerable assistance from Mr. Indian Agent Daunt during my inspections in the New Westminster Agency, and he is I think to be congratulated on the fine condition of these schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

There may be some special reason why the Department should go to the expense of the education of the above children at St. Mary's Mission; but in general I trust that children with good home conditions be sent to the local Indian day school, where some fifteen more pupils can be accommodated.\n\nI consider that the plan of some Indian parents by which small children are kept out of the day school to insure that they are taken later to St. Mary's Residential School should be discouraged. Orphans and those children who for various reasons, poor home conditions etc., the Indian Agent considers should be at a residential school might well be included in whatever plans exist at St. Mary's Mission. This is I believe the policy of the Department and Mr. Barre has been so informed.\n\nThe general standing of the Pemberton Indian Day School is good and reflects much credit on the work of the teacher and the Indian Agent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As you will see from my report the academic work of the school is highly satisfactory.\n\nDuring the year the Indian parents have cleared and graded part of the school grounds for a playground and here the children play games.\n\nI was particularly pleased to learn that a number of young trees of value have been planted around the school property by the teacher and children, and that a school garden has been started. Questions were made to the teacher with regard to the operation of this garden and he was asked to let me have a report later on what was done in the way of experimental work by the children.\n\nThe school was perfectly clean. Children were well dressed and certainly appeared happy. They were very well behaved in and out of school, and they responded to my own teaching very well indeed.\n\nThe Pemberton Indian Day School is doing splendid work for the Indian children, and is a great credit to the Agency.

In either event, you should state the size of the site you consider necessary and the general condition of the land, viz.: whether level or sloping. You should also mention the direction in which you consider the building should face.\n\n(3) Will it be necessary to provide living quarters for the teacher, in connection with the School?\n\n(4) Can drinking water be easily obtained on the site recommended by you?\n\n(5) Would you recommend construction by contract or by day labour?\n\n(6) Do you consider a full basement advisable?\n\nIn addition to the information requested above, you should also give any particulars that would assist the Department in planning the building. It is hoped that your reply will be both detailed and definite, in order that further correspondence will not be necessary.\nIn connection with the proposed School on this Reserve, I understand that Inspector Savoy discussed the matter with you when he made a survey of the Pemberton Reserve on August 27th. For your information, I might add, that Mr. Savoy considered that provision should be made for 40 children, and sufficient accommodation should be provided to enable the employment of a married couple.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Savoy,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. O'N. Bennett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nNEW WESTMINSTER, B.C.,\nNovember 2nd, 1934\n\nYour Reference No. 153-38-1.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 25th of October, regarding the proposed Day School at Pemberton Indian Reserve, and submit the following answers to the questions contained therein:\n\n(1). There are sixty-seven (67) children of school age on the Reserve, apart from thirty-eight (38) in Residential Schools. The number is too great for one teacher to handle, so I submit the proposed school should accommodate as many pupils as the Department feel one teacher can successfully instruct. I would say, not more than forty (40).\n\n(2). The Site recommended in the Report of the School Inspector, Lots 3 and 4, Pemberton No. 10 Indian Reserve, Subdivision, Department File No. 57153-38, dated March 31st, 1934, is available without charge, as the Lots, in question, were laid out with the intention of their eventual use for public purposes. These Lots are quite level, but somewhat rough and will need grading. The light brush with which they are covered can be easily cleared. As will be seen from the subdivision plan, these Lots front on the Pacific Great Western Railway tracks, so I think the proposed building should face that way also.\n\n(3). Yes, living quarters for a married teacher should be attached to the school building. One heating plant would thus suffice. From the isolated nature of the place, a male teacher should be employed, and it would be a great advantage to have his wife as Field Matron, if a satisfactory combination can be found.\n\n(4). Good water can be obtained from a well, probable depth about twelve feet. This would be less costly than a pipe line from the Birkenhead River, which would entail probably 1,000 feet of pipe besides the labour.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6421, file 865-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nFile No.1-84\n\n(5). I would recommend construction by contract. Apart from any other consideration, the locality is too far from Headquarters to exercise any supervision over this type of workmen, in so far as day labour is concerned.\n\n(6). I would recommend a sufficiently large basement to carry the heating plant, and fuel, besides storage for winter vegetables and such articles as frost would destroy. If the sum found to be available for this School will admit of a central heating plant, I would recommend a sufficiently large basement to carry the furnace and fuel, besides storage for winter vegetables and such articles as frost would destroy.\n\nConstruction should include fully screened porch and windows, as the mosquitoes at Pemberton are terrible. Sanitary arrangements, would have to be of the usual outside type, as I hardly think it feasible to lay water on, without greatly increasing the expenditure.\n\nFreight rates would make the price of coal prohibitive, so heating plant should be designed for wood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.O.M. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, November 19, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Smith,\n\nIn appropriation for Indian education for the fiscal year 1938-39, provision is being made for an amount of $5,000, to provide for a combined school and teachers residence on the Pemberton Reserve, the New Westminster Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia. I would appreciate your forwarding a sketch plan of a building which you consider might be suitable at this point. In preparing this plan, the following should be kept in mind.\n\n(1) The proposed building should include:\n   (a) Classroom for 40 pupils\n   (b) Living accommodation for teacher.\n   (c) Two outside toilets should also be provided for the pupils.\n\n(2) Full basement should be provided.\n\n(3) Wood burning furnace should be supplied.\n\n(4) Construction should include fully screened porch and windows, as the mosquitoes at Pemberton are stated to be terrible.\n\n(5) A site for this building is available on Lots 3 and 4, Pemberton No. 10, Indian Reserve.\n\n(6) The Indian Agent recommends construction by contract. His reason for this recommendation is that the locality is too far from New Westminster for him to exercise any supervision in the event of the building being erected by day labour.\n\nAs soon as you forward sketch plan, I will send it to our Indian Agent for his comments. At that time any additional information that you require could be secured.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, on December 20, 1937, following representations made by our Department for the buildings, Mr. J. A. Rodd, Director of Fish Culture, Department of Fisheries, advised that his Department considered it desirable to retain control of the Hatchery buildings until the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission had an opportunity of further considering the nature and scope of its activities. The use of these buildings, therefore, cannot be considered in any plan for the construction of the proposed school. The Provincial Superintendent of Education has supplied me with the following information regarding the cost of erecting a standard school, large enough to accommodate forty pupils in a rural district:\n\n(a) School approximately 32 x 24 with heater and no basement - $2,500.00\n\n(b) School approximately 32 x 24 with heater and with basement - 3,500.00\n\n(c) School approximately 32 x 24 with basement and furnace - 3,600.00\n\n(the above figures include in each case two outside toilets.)\n\nR.

I enclose \"Building Data\" form which I trust supplies any further information that you require.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n21st February, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe: Proposed Day School and Teacher's Residence, Pemberton Indian Reserve, New Westminster Agency, British Columbia.\n\nI am forwarding herewith two sets of blue prints of \u00bc\" scale sketch plans of the above school. The general layout is similar to that of type A.1 School, with a bedroom on the second floor and with the addition of a screened porch for the teacher's use.\n\nThe classroom windows and teacher's desk would be reversed if the Front elevation is required to have a westerly aspect.\n\nI would be glad if you would look over these plans and return one set initialled, if you approve, or with any comments you wish to make.\n\nThere is not sufficient information in regard to the building site and it is requested that your Branch furnish a site plan and other information under the headings;-\n\nDescription of site and conditions, orientation of building, nature of soil, drainage requirements and other particulars.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 24, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 2, 1937 and previous correspondence regarding the proposed day school on the Pemberton Reserve the Surveys and Engineering Branch request the following information:\n\n\"There is not sufficient information in regard to the building site and it is requested that your Branch furnish a site plan and other information under the headings:\n\nDescription of site and conditions, orientation of building, nature of soil, drainage requirements and other particulars.\"\n\nThe above information should be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nIn your letter of November 2 you stated that the proposed site of the school is quite level but somewhat rough and will need grading. You also stated that the light brush with which the lots are covered can be easily cleared. Please let me know when this work can be done and if the Indians will do it free of charge. It will considerably reduce the cost of the building if the lots are cleared before construction starts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 24, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. WARDLE\n\nRe: Proposed Day School and teacher's residence,\nPemberton Indian Reserve,\nNew Westminster Agency,\nBritish Columbia.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of February 21 I enclose a copy of the sketch plan which you forwarded. This is quite satisfactory provided the building can be erected with the amount provided in our 1935-39 estimates; namely, $5,000.\n\nI am writing to the Indian Agent for the information requested in the last paragraph of your memorandum and on receipt of his reply you will be advised.\n\nDirector.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 24th of February, regarding the Site of the proposed Day School at Pemberton.\n\nThe proposed Site consists of Lots 3 and 4 Pemberton No. 10 Indian Reserve, as shown on Department Plan No. 119, File No. 37332-6. These Lots are bounded on the North West by the Right-of-Way of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway and on the East by the Government Road from D'Arcy to Pemberton. Creekside Station is almost directly in front of Lot 2. The flat on which the sub-division is laid out is level, with, of course, small inequalities here and there, which could be easily filled with a Scraper. The surface soil might be described as a sandy loam and the sub-soil as all river gravel. The Bakerhead River flows past about 300 yards from the proposed site. It is a swift river and I imagine protection work on a pipe intake would be fairly costly, as in addition to the necessary length of line to obtain a flow of water by gravitation, this intake would have to be well protected from erosion. I, therefore, suggested a well, to begin with at any rate.\n\nThe small brush and bush on the Lots will be easily cleared, and I have today been advised by the Band Secretary that the young men have promised to do so as soon as the snow goes, which will be in about ten days or so. This will be without charge. With the gravel sub-soil drainage should be good, and would require no attention other than for sanitary and house purposes.\n\nSo far as the orientation of the building is concerned, as the Lots front on the Pacific Great Eastern Railway Company's tracks, I think it would look better to have the School face that way also.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n9th March, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Proposed day school and Teachers' Residence, Pemberton Indian Reserve, New Westminster Agency, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 24th ultimo, an original estimate placed the cost of a building of Type A.1 with the addition of a screened porch, at between $7,000.00 and $7,500.00. This estimate was prepared from preliminary sketch plans before working drawings were started and was based upon the average cost of Indian School buildings erected by day labour during 1937 taking into consideration the location of the building in question.\n\nIt has since been found possible to reduce the cubic area of the building somewhat and it is probable that if carried out by contract the cost of the project would not exceed $6,400.00. Hence an additional amount of $1,400.00 would be required to be provided.\n\nI should be glad if you would advise what your Branch wishes in regard to this building.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HARDIE\n\nRe: Day School and Teachers' Residence,\nPemberton Indian Reserve,\nKamloops Indian Agency, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of March 9th, it is noted that you estimate the cost of the above-mentioned building at $6,400.00. Funds to this amount will be available in our 1938-39 appropriation and I would appreciate your completing arrangements for the erection of this building. With reference to the last paragraph of your memorandum of February 21 requesting certain information regarding the building site Indian Agent Daunt writes as follows:\n\n\"The proposed site consists of Lots 3 and 4 Pemberton No. 10 Indian Reserve, as shown on Department Plan No. 119, File No. 37532-6. These Lots are bounded on the North West by the Right-of-Way of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway and on the East by the Government Road from D'Arcy to Pemberton.

The flat on which the subdivision is laid out is level, etc., or course, small inequalities here and there, which could be easily filled with a Scraper. The surface soil might be described as a sandy loam, and the sub-soil is all river gravel. The Rickenhead River flows past about 300 yards from the proposed site. It is a swift river and I imagine protection work on a pipe intake would be fairly costly; as an addition to the necessary length of line to obtain a flow of water by gravitation, this intake would have to be well protected from erosion.

Daunt,\nSurveyor Agent,\nCity of Westminster B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nIt is after my experience to have to chase away animals away from the new school building. So that a fence would not only protect the school but it would serve as a school yard once the stumps are removed. I therefore ask you to make provision for a fence as soon as the weather permits.\n\nA well near the school house where the children could secure drinking water would be an inexpensive convenience. However, to secure water for household purposes one must travel a hundred yards in the snow to the storekeeper's well and then manipulate a temperamental pump.\n\nThe toilet provision for the school are at present taken care of by two outside toilets, one assigned to the boys and one to the girls. Because of the prevalence of tuberculosis the teachers cannot very well use these. So that I believe that an inside chemical toilet would be needed. To this end I add a sink and siphon tank for the disposal of kitchen waste. It is a long way from the kitchenette through the school vestibule down the steps to the level ground outside.\n\nThe above are more urgently needed because of the fact that your teacher will be married within a few weeks.\n\nI trust that you will provide for this at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.M. Barry.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 14, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the letter dated January 17 from the teacher of the Pemberton Indian day school please let me know the cost of erecting a fence at this school, also the cost of digging a well and supplying a pump. As funds are almost completely assigned it is impossible to consider these expenditures between now and the end of March but if you consider the above-mentioned improvements necessary funds will be available after April 1.\n\nYou may secure a chemical toilet for the teacher's living quarters. It is understood that this will be purchased at as reasonable a cost as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. O'N.

BAILEY\n\nI attach account amounting to $360.89 covering the cost of desks purchased from Anthes-Tait Foundry Limited for the Pemberton Indian day school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, Requisition for School Material received from J.W. Barre, Teacher of the Pemberton Indian Day School.\n\nWith regard to the stationery and books requested by him, I would recommend that these be supplied from the Government Stationery office.\n\nThe Teacher's desk and chair are certainly needed, and I would recommend that an order be placed for their delivery to the School.\n\nI have obtained prices locally for the following items shown in the requisition:\n\n| Item                        | Price |\n|-----------------------------|-------|\n| Cupboard and shelving       | $20.00|\n| Flag Pole                   | $15.00|\n| Thermometer                 | $1.10 |\n| Water Tank                  | $5.20 |\n| Two Door Mats               | $1.60 |\n| One Clock for School room   | $2.25 |\n| One Pail                    | $.50  |\n| Fire Extinguisher           | $1.25 |\n| Shovel                      | $2.00 |\n| Axe                         | $.30  |\n| Scrub Brush                 | $.70  |\n| Mop                         | $1.00 |\n| Two Pails                   | $4.00 |\n| Six Blinds for Class-room   | $4.00 |\n| One Dust Pan                | $1.00 |\n\nI have talked all these things over with the Teacher, and I consider that they are all necessary. It must be remembered that there is no running water in the School, so it is imperative that we have a sanitary tank to contain a supply for the children's daily use.\n\nWith regard to the item of kleenex, some provision must be made for handkerchiefs, hence the inclusion of this item, possibly paper towels would do, but they are very stiff, and kleenex would undoubtedly be better.\n\nMr. Barry also requests that a kitchen sink be provided in the living quarters. This appears to me to be absolutely necessary, as it is obviously unsanitary to throw dish water out around the building. I would, therefore,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\ntherefore, recommend that a sink be installed connected with a rock pit to drain the water away, and that a house force pump be installed on the premises. The prices, I have obtained locally are as follows:\n\n- House Force Pump ........................................ $6.50\n- 40 Feet of pipe in 4ft. lengths complete ............. $7.50\n- Sandpoint .................................................. $2.85\n- White enamel kitchen sink ................................ $5.50\n- Sink drop and collar ....................................... $3.20\n- Lumber to enclose sink .................................... $5.00\n- Labour putting up pump and sandpoint ................ $10.00\n- Labour re sink and cesspool .............................. $20.00\n\n$80.55\n\nThe School Lot should also be fenced, in order to keep cattle away from the building, as they roam wild through the woods, and hogs are also plentiful. The figures in connection with this are as shown below:\n\n- 70 Rods-medium weight stock fencing,\n  42 inches high\u2014(E.Gates & Stanley) ................... $75.00\n- 120 Posts, crosspieces etc. (made and put into the ground) .......... $30.00\n- Labour putting up the stock fencing .................. $30.00\n- Labour clearing the underbrush ......................... $25.00\n\n$160.00\n\nThe School should also have an outside toilet for the Teacher and his wife, the present arrangement merely taking care of the Indian pupils, and there certainly should be provision made for the Teacher. The cost of this will be $25.00.\n\nThe School Inspector wants a flag pole erected, and the cost of the pole erected will be $15.00. If this latter item is authorized, a flag should be sent to the Teacher.\n\nMost of the labour in connection with this work will be performed by the Indians.\n\nI may say that Mr. Barre appears to be shaping well as a Teacher, and I think his requests are entirely reasonable, so I trust that the Department will be in a position to grant them.\n\nThe total of these local expenditures will come to $334.45, as listed above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 1, 1939.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo the Department approves the following expenditures at the Pemberton Indian day school:\n\n- Cupboard and shelving ......................... $20.00\n- Water tank .................................. 5.20\n- Two door mats .................................. 1.60\n- One clock for school room ...................... 2.25\n- One pail ..................................... .50\n- Shovel ....................................... 1.25\n- Axe ........................................... 2.00\n- Scrub brush ................................... .30\n- Mop ............................................ 1.70\n- Two pails ...................................... 1.00\n- Six blinds for class room ....................... 4.00\n\n- House force pump ................................ 6.50\n- 40 ft. of pipe in 4 ft. lengths complete .... 27.50\n- Sandpoint ...................................... 2.85\n- White enamel kitchen sink ...................... 5.50\n- Sink drop and collar ........................... 3.20\n- Lumber to enclose sink .......................... 5.00\n- Labour putting up pump and sandpoint ....... 10.00\n- Labour re sink and cesspool ................... 20.00\n\n- 70 rods medium weight stock fencing\n  42 inches high -- 2 gates & staples ... 75.00\n- 120 posts, crosspieces etc. (made and put into the ground) ......................... 30.00\n- Labour putting up stock fencing ............. 30.00\n- Labour clearing the underbrush .............. 25.00\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nYou may also arrange for the erection of a flag pole but it is considered that it should be possible to have this erected at a much smaller cost than $15.00. A cheaper thermometer than the one mentioned in your letter should also be secured.\n\nYou may arrange for the erection of a new toilet at a cost not exceeding $25.00. A flag will be sent to the teacher from the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nOur Chief Engineer advises that certain work in connection with Indian schools could not be completed before the 31st March and requirements for completion are as follows,-\n\nPemberton - $106.25\nBella Bella - 191.25\nPort Simpson - 20.00\n\nI should be glad if you would advise if funds can be provided to cover accounts in connection with work necessary at these schools.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMay 15, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Pemberton Indian Day School\n\nI note from your memorandum of May 9 that an additional expenditure of $106.25 will be required at this school. I presume that you refer to the outside painting which you mentioned in your memorandum of February 22.\n\nIf you have made arrangements with the contractor to do the work for the amount mentioned please certify the account when received and forward it to me and a cheque will be issued. If no such arrangements have yet been made possibly it would be satisfactory to have the Agent supervise the exterior painting.

It is felt that the Indians should be sufficiently interested in the operation of the school to do a considerable amount of this work without expense to the Department. The Agent and teacher should be requested to encourage them to do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed is an application received from Mr. Indian Agent Daunt of the New Westminster Agency to expend the sum of $100 for removal of stumps and levelling of the school grounds at the Pemberton Indian Day School, in connection with which he stated that Mr. Spetch was the only man in the vicinity with the necessary equipment to do this work.\n\nI wrote to Mr. Daunt on the 14th instant requesting to be advised if this work could not be undertaken by Pemberton Indians, as per attached copy. I enclose herewith his reply of the 15th instant informing me that he took up the matter with the only Indian accustomed to this type of clearing but he declined to perform the work in view of the proximity to the school buildings and the necessity of using powder.\n\nIt would appear that the only other course to adopt is by the use of the heavy caterpillar tractor, Mr. A. W. Spetch apparently being the only person in the locality with such equipment. Under the circumstances, I would agree to the employment of white labor if and when the funds become available and would recommend that the application have favorable consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour Ref. No. 15/5561.\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 14th, regarding the removal of stumps and levelling of school grounds, at Pemberton, I beg to say that as I stated in my application, Mr. Spetch is the only person in the vicinity, with the necessary equipment to perform this work.\n\nIt was first put up to Councillor Baptiste Ritchie, who is accustomed to taking logging contracts, and to the heavy work incidental to land clearing. He refused to have anything to do with powder work so close to the school buildings, and I think he was right. Mr. Spetch's heavy caterpillar tractor is the only way this work can be done in a safe and satisfactory manner.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D.M.

This year, it is more imperative to have this extra space for winter use. For this purpose, we thought of a cheap material known under various trade marks such as CELLO-GLASS. As to the work of screening in the porch with this composition glass, I will be glad to do it so as to keep expenses down.\n\nMr. Geo. E. Simpson, local merchant, will send you the price on 24 lineal feet of glass; the amount needed to screen in the porch.\n\nHoping that you will find it possible to obtain this glass for us. The apartment must have been designed for a bachelor, it is very small for a family of three.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ.M. Barre\nJ.M.

Daunt\nIndian Agent\n\nEncs.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\nPemberton Indian Day School\nCreekside, B.C.\nDecember 27th 1941\n\nMr. A. O'M. Daunt\nIndian Agent\nNew-Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nAs I have had several chimney fires, I have asked the local carpenter, Mr. Gronseth, to give me an estimate on the cost of building a three section ladder to reach the chimney and roof. The lower section could be used to handle window screens and storm windows. We have no ladder for this purpose.\n\nBecause the roof shingles are weathered, the shingles are covered with fuzz which easily ignites from chimney sparks on dry frosty days. Such a ladder would make it possible to extinguish such fires, as well as fires which might be caused by forest fire sparks.\n\nSuch a ladder is deemed a necessity here as it would greatly minimize the fire hazards for this school. Please tell me what can be done regarding this matter.\n\nWith best wishes for a Happy New Year,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ.M. Barre\nJ.M. Barre, Teacher.\nCreekside, B.C.\nDecember 15th 1941\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nNew-Westminster, B.C.\n\nThe following is my estimate of the cost of building\na Fire Ladder for the Pemberton Indian Day School:\n\n42 foot ladder (lumber, nails, paint, & labor) $18.00\n\nJack Cronseth\n\nLabor, 16 hours @ .65 ----------------------------- $10.40\nLumber, 100 feet @ $.40 per thousand -------------- 4.00\nPaint, \u00bd gallon ------------------------------------ 2.80\nNails, 5 lbs @ .10 --------------------------------- 1.00\n\nTotal ------- $18.00\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No. 3-8-H\n\nOffice of the New Westminster Indian Agency,\n\nJanuary 5th 1942\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 704, amounting to $1.20 in favour of J.M.

Grist, the Teacher at the Pemberton Indian Day School, has applied to me for curtains for six windows in the Teacher's living quarters there. He informs me that the building is close to the road, and there is no privacy with people passing back and forth.\n\nWe have looked into the matter of price in connection with these curtains, and on sale in one of the Department stores here last week, was a very good material for ninety-five (95\u00a2) cents a yard. I had the bolt put away, as any other material would run too high, and this is very good material for the price asked, and should stand up well.\n\nThe following is the quotation given to me by the store:\n\n27 Yards Drapery @ 95\u00a2------------------$25.65\n6 Pairs making @ $1.00----------------- 6.00\n------------------------------------- $31.65\n\nIn view of the reasonable price asked for the curtains, and the fact that the windows are very bare without them, I would recommend that the sum of $31.65 be authorized for the purchase of these curtains for use at the Pemberton Indian Day School Teacher's quarters.\n\nJ.

This school is in the New Westminster Agency and is approximately 200 miles from the Seabird Island Indian Day School (reference our memorandum of similar date, file 165-5-5).\n\nWe have communicated with Major D. E. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, in this regard and he has answered, advising that Mr. W. Dunn, of Nelson, B.C., would undertake this work in conjunction with the proposed building at Seabird Island. Major MacKay also comments that Mr. Dunn is a well known contractor and builder and that he has done good work for us at both the Kamloops and St. Mary's residential schools.\n\nTherefore, would you have one of your officials go to the Remberton Indian Day School to survey the situation and prepare the plans necessary for the erection of a one-room addition to this school. It is suggested that your official should contact the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia and arrange to visit the school with Major R. F.

While the construction here should no doubt be carried out this year if found to be absolutely necessary, no action is indicated until a school survey has been completed.\nW.S.

ARNEIL\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER FOR B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: School Construction Program\n\nI am enclosing confirmation of my Army Signals message of today's date recommending certain transfers of funds for the proposed construction at Bella Bella and Pemberton.\n\nWith regard to Bella Bella, apparently $10,000 was provided in the Estimates, reference Mr. Neary's letter of June 21st and in my letter of July 6th I recommended that the $14,000 appropriated for construction at the North Thompson Reserve be transferred to Bella Bella, making a total of $24,000. This amount, with an additional $4,000 from the amount appropriated for construction at Hazelton, a total of $28,000, should I think be sufficient to meet the cost of erecting a two room prefabricated school with accommodation for the teachers.\n\nIn the case of Pemberton School, in Mr. Neary's letter of June 21st (file 1-1-5 E), it is stated that $10,000 was provided for an addition. $18,000 should be transferred from the appropriation for the construction at Hazelton and added to this amount, a total of $28,000, which will I believe be sufficient.\n\nThe balances remaining of the funds appropriated for various schools which we do not contemplate constructing this year are as follows:\n\nHazelton $18,000\nFort Babine 7,000 (approx. $1,000 transferred to Kitkatle)\nOur estimate of the cost of construction at Klemtu is in excess of the amount appropriated as is the estimate for construction at Anaham and other projects may cost more than the amounts specifically provided in view of which other transfers will likely be necessary at a later date.\n\nI may say I have hesitated to make a recommendation involving transfer of funds from the amount appropriated for construction at Hazelton but at the same time do not wish to delay construction elsewhere to find at a later date that construction at Hazelton will not be proceeded with because of some alternative for the provision of educational facilities for the Indian children or for any other reason. It is hoped that a decision may be reached in the near future with respect to the Department's policy at Hazelton but in the meantime I doubt whether it would be advisable to conserve the funds appropriated.\n\nW.

I do not think that we could do any better than secure a prefabricated building similar to that recommended for Bella Bella for erection at Pemberton and my recommendation with regard to Bella Bella applies also at Pemberton.\n\nWe anticipate delivery of the four one-room schools presently on order from Prefabricated Structures within a few days and hope that the order for a fifth one room building for erection at Metlakatla and the orders for the two buildings above referred to may be placed at a very early date as the Company will be in a position to give us prompt delivery with uninterrupted production of these school buildings.

Of the number attending the Residential School 30 could attend the Day School on the Reserve. Assuming that the same number of children of this Band are not in residence at Pemberton in the coming academic year the number of pupils who could attend the Day School if accommodation is provided is:\n\n- Attending Day School 1947-48 - 37\n- Attending Residential Sch. \" \" - 30\n- Pupils reaching age of 7 1948 - 11\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our efforts to interest a contractor have not proven successful and the rate of increase of the children on the reserve now warrants the erection of a two-room school. In fact there are 30 children attending the Mission Residential School because adequate day school facilities are not now provided at Pemberton Meadows. Inspector Davey has submitted a report, a copy of which is attached, indicating that the school age population will be 91 next year. Such an enrolment requires a three-room school.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Indian Commissioner Arneil has recommended that a prefabricated two-room school with attached teachers' quarters be ordered from Prefabricated Structures, Limited.

Of this number 37 were enrolled in the Pemberton Day School, 32 were enrolled at the Mission Residential School and 28 pupils were not in attendance at either of the schools and apparently were not living on the reservation. Of the number attending the Residential School 30 could attend the Day School on the Reserve. Assuming that the same number of children of this Band are not in residence at Pemberton in the coming academic year the number of pupils who could attend the Day School if accommodation is provided is:\n\n- Attending Day School 1947-48 = 37\n- Attending Residential school \" \" = 30\n- Pupils reaching age of 7 1948 = 11\n\nTotal = 78\nIn addition to the 78 pupils shown there are an additional 13 pupils who will be six years of age before the beginning of the coming academic year. It has been the policy in this Province to admit pupils to Day Schools at the age of six and this will apply at Pemberton. Including this number the school age population will be 91. Such an enrolment requires a three room school.\n\nR. F. Davey,\nDistrict School Inspector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nPemberton Indian Day School.\n\nFor the past two years we have included in our Estimates a sum for the erection of an additional classroom at this school. Our efforts to interest a contractor have not proven successful and the rate of increase of the children on the reserve now warrants the erection of a two-room school. In fact there are 30 children attending the Mission Residential School because adequate day school facilities are not now provided at Pemberton Meadows. Inspector Davey has submitted a report, a copy of which is attached, indicating that the school age population will be 91 next year. Such an enrolment requires a 3-room school.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Indian Commissioner Arneil has recommended that a prefabricated two-room school with attached teachers' quarters be ordered from Prefabricated Structures, Limited. This firm is now in the process of supplying us with four prefabricated one-room schools.\n\nThey have submitted plans and specifications which are satisfactory to our Education Division and have quoted a price of $9,750.00 F. O. B. Vancouver. I have attached a copy of their tender and specifications.\n\nA submission to Council has been prepared, covering the purchase of this building. I would recommend that the necessary authority be obtained.\n\nEncl.\n\nActing Director.\nPREFABRICATED STRUCTURES\n\nDIVISION OF SKEENA LUMBER COMPANY LIMITED\n\nMANUFACTURERS OF MULTIFLEX SECTIONAL HOMES -\nUNITED CAMP AND UTILITY BUILDINGS\n\nP.O.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your letter of May 31st re incorporating changes as suggested by Mr. Davey and myself, we take pleasure in submitting for your approval duplicate copies of blueprints, also duplicate copy of specifications.\n\nThe two roomed school as shown now would include 10' wall panels for the teacherage as well as the main school. If you require an 8' ceiling in the teacherage, we could quite easily build up the floor the 2' which would allow us to use the same 10' panels as on the school.\n\nThe total price of the above f.o.b. the plant - $9750.00, which would include all items listed in the specifications. If you would like to go into detail as to types or material used also window arrangements and general construction details in any way, do not hesitate to get in touch with us at 2256 Kingsway which will be known as the B. C. Sales Office as of June 15th on.\n\nI will forward on to you the phone number as soon as we receive same.\n\nThe information mailed to you May 22nd regarding the approximate time limit, costs of erection and also the possibility of us supplying men after the first school is built to carry on with the erection of the balance of the schools, should be sufficient and I hope that this answers all your questions for the time being.\n\nAwaiting your reply, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Superintendent Gillett contacted various contractors with a view to securing from them firm bids on the erection and completion of this building but the only tender received, that of Wallace Construction Company Limited attached, is in my opinion too high.\n\nWe have however, a proposal from Mr. R.G. Goodrich of Chilliwack regarding the erection and completion of the building on a cost plus 10% of labour for supervision basis. Mr. Goodrich in his letter of October 21st attached estimates labour costs on all phases of the work apart from clearing and excavating the site, to which estimate would have to be added the cost of additional building materials required and wiring, plumbing and heating equipment and materials.\n\nI would mention at this time that we have carefully considered what modern facilities should be provided at this school and inasmuch as the new building will provide along with the old school a three classroom set up at this point with three teachers, it is considered that arrangements should be made for the installation of a small generating plant and inside plumbing facilities in the teacherage portion of the new building. Although there is a water supply system on the reserve the head is not great enough to supply water by gravity to the school. The water table on the Pemberton reserve is...\nquite high and it is anticipated that water can be secured by digging a well at the school, which with an automatic water pressure system operated from the generating plant referred to above will permit of the installation of a flush toilet, bath, etc., in the teachers' room.\n\nIt will take some time to secure information with respect to the exact cost of the additional materials, plumbing, heating and lighting fixtures, the proposed lighting plant and the water pressure system and rather than delay a submission to Council pending receipt of this information, these costs have been roughly computed in this office. The following is a breakdown of the anticipated cost of erection and completion of this new school at Pemberton, some allowance having been made for an increase in the labour costs estimated by Mr. Goodrich, his estimate on the basis of our experience with prefabricated buildings being too low:\n\n(1) Excavation and clearing school site.................. $500.00\n\nI have authorized Mr. Gillett to have this work done with a bulldozer which is at Pemberton at the moment but will be returned to Vancouver in the near future.\n\n(2) Cost of prefabricated building.......................... $10,371.00\n\n(3) Labour based on Mr. Goodrich's estimate, which is considered to be low, plus $1,000.00.................. $7,000.00\n\n10% of labour supervision................................. $700.00\n\n(4) Plumbing fixtures and materials ....................... $400.00\n\n(5) Material for foundation, etc........................... $1,500.00\n\n(6) Wiring material and fixtures.......................... $400.00\n\n(7) Furnace, pipes, etc.................................... $500.00\n\n(8) Lighting plant for both schools. Cost of this item will depend entirely on the type and size of plant required which has yet to be determined but should not under any circumstances exceed $3,000.00\n\n(9) Automatic water pressure system ....................... $200.00\n\n(10) Freight, contingencies, etc............................ $25.00\n\n$28,500.00\nI would recommend that the Department's submission to Council be based on the above mentioned breakdown and would appreciate being advised at the earliest possible date if Mr. Goodrich's proposal is accepted and if the work may be proceeded with.\n\nW.S.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nPemberton Indian Day School.\n\nI have recently had an opportunity of discussing your letters of November 12 and October 28 with our Acting Director. We are agreed that Mr. Gooderich's tender seems fair and reasonable. However, after the receipt of your telegram of November 16, it seems evident that we will not be able to provide him with the materials which he immediately will require in order to start this project. As you are probably aware, the cement situation across the country is very poor. I would anticipate a delay of at least four to six weeks before we can provide the cement required. If, however, this cement is readily available in British Columbia, would you please advise by return airmail.\n\nWith regard to the preparation of an Order-in-Council for this project, I would suggest that we consider the painting of the school as a sub-contract. This will reduce Mr. Gooderich's tender by $550 and will thus bring it under the amount of $5,000.00.\n\nAs you are probably aware, we do not require an Order-in-Council for construction projects below this amount. We will expect to hear from you in the near future concerning this suggestion.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nDEPT.

Adomeit and Company, Smithers, B.C., covering the erection of the office and medical quarters at Hazelton. This work is progressing favourably and on January 29th we forwarded to Adomeit and Company a copy of the necessary Contract for signature and it is being assumed that the signed Contract will be in our hands within a few days.\n\nTo comply with the terms of the Contract, particularly under Schedule A \"Definition of Work\" you will note that Sections (j), (k) and (m) indicate that it is necessary that the approval of the Minister be obtained for certain expenditures. These expenditures cover the hiring of such items as power driven machinery not actually owned by the Contractor and involves the hiring of a bulldozer for one or two days at a per diem cost of $75.00, the hiring of a power saw for a few days at a very moderate rental, as well as the limited rental of a truck at approximately $3.00 per hour. These expenditures would also include the cost involved in housing and feeding of workers as well as the proportionate cost of the salaries of Adomeit's accountant and himself and such other items as our Treasury officials consider come within sections (j), (k) and (m) of Schedule A of this Contract.\n\nIn order to expedite this work could approval be obtained, please, to have these authorities signed by myself as representing the Minister for purposes of the Contract and to\ncomply with Treasury audit requirements. This entire expenditure should not involve an amount in excess of $1000.\n\nA similar approval appears essential to cover the recent Contract with R.C. Gooderich, 226 Wellington Avenue, Chilliwack, B.C., for the labour in erecting a two classroom school and attached teacher's residence at Pemberton, B.C., which Contract involves an amount estimated not to exceed $4600, of which amount only a few hundred dollars would come within the suggested approval.\n\nI trust that these approvals may be obtained in order to facilitate the completion of these Contracts and the payment of the contract prices when satisfactorily completed without undue delay.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIRMALL\n\nFebruary 15, 1949.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.

These applications are numbered as indicated and each one is required in sextuplicate. These applications from the contractor are then approved by the Director and returned for necessary action by the Cost Auditor concerned.

Pook, on the above-mentioned installations, it is regretted that our letter of January 25th did not point out that Mitchell Brothers' tender on the plumbing installation is much more complete than that of Mr. Pook, including, in addition to the items which Mr. Pook undertakes to install, the following items:\n\n1. One Duro Automatic Water Pump\n2. One #1 Steel Septic Tank\n3. Sewer connection to the septic tank\n\nIt is considered that these items will more than make up the difference between the two tenders and I would again recommend acceptance of Mitchell Brothers' tender on both plumbing and heating.\n\nfor W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nwide range between the price of it and the price quoted by Mott Electric, it would perhaps be advisable to secure the views of a competent authority.\n\nAs it is not long until the end of the fiscal year, it would be appreciated if a decision could be reached and an order placed at an early date.\n\nW.S.

If there are any accounts in connection with this school that can be forwarded in the near future, I would appreciate it if you would do so, as we are endeavouring to pay as many accounts as possible from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49. The time is rapidly approaching when this procedure will be stopped, and all expenditures will have to be paid from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nI feel certain that you will co-operate with us in every possible manner, both with regard to this school and other schools, in order that accounts dated not later than March 1st may reach us at the earliest possible date so that payment can be made from the 1948-49 appropriation.\n\nBernard F.

Goodrich Contract\n\nSuperintendent Gillett and Mr. R.C. Goodrich called here yesterday and we discussed with them the work necessary for completion of the above-mentioned school building. This work is detailed in the attached memorandum from Mr. Gillett and you will note that the estimated cost is $2700.00 for labour and $357.00 for materials, a total of $3057.00, in addition to which we have yet to pay from this year's appropriation for the lighting plant purchased from the Northern Electric Company, Limited, at a cost of $1758.25 and for the plumbing and heating installations which could not be completed prior to March 31st, at a cost of $472.00. It is apparent, therefore, that allowing for contingencies, we should arrange for the transfer of $7500.00 for completion of this building and I would recommend that this amount be transferred from the balance of funds appropriated for erection of the classroom block at Alberni.\n\nWith regard to carrying out of the work, Mr. Goodrich is prepared to complete the work under the same financial arrangement as was entered into for the erection of the building, that is, cost plus 10%, but it occurs to me that the Department may not be able to enter into such a contract this year, without first investigating the possibilities of securing firm tenders. Personally, I feel that we can have the building completed by Mr. Goodrich on a cost plus basis for less than a contract price.\n\nWill you please advise at the earliest possible date how you would like completion of this building handled and in the interval I should like to have authority for the expenditure\nnecessary for the clearing of brush from the school site as it is essential that this burning be carried out before the hot weather in early June causes a serious fire hazard. Mr. Goodrich estimates the cost of burning the brush at $480.00 but Mr. Gillett is of the opinion that we can have it done with Indian labour for less.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nNEW SCHOOL AT PEMBERTON.\n\nAttached is a list giving the estimated work to complete the School.\n\nThe building leaks, apparently in one of the valleys. It could be a case of having the shingles nailed too close to the valley, and thus have nail holes through the sheet iron.\n\nThe main entrance steps and platform will have to be reconstructed because the ground level is eighteen inches above the basement windows. The posts which support the rail on the sides of the platform should go to the ground as a matter of safety.\n\nThe cement floor is rough and not properly hardened. A layer of one inch of a finer mixture is required to make a smooth surface.\n\nI believe there should be facings on the inside of the basement windows the full thickness of the cement wall to give a neater appearance.\n\nLevelling the School grounds will require a bulldozer to push the gravel which was excavated for the basement to the cement walls and fill low spots. The ground level around the school will have to be lowered from 12 to 18 inches.\n\nThe two large piles of brush on the grounds should be burned. Some bulldozing is also necessary in connection with a road to the School.\n\nEstimated cost of work is as follows:\n\nLabour:\n- Reconstructing two platforms and steps, door into basement, fixing roof, layer of cement on basement floor, finishing toilets, kitchen sink and drainboard........... $600.00\n- Painting - exterior 3 coats, interior 2 coats, including floor.................. 550.00\n- Levelling lot and road work.................. 600.00\n- Excavating for septic tank, drain 200 ft. long, rock pit.................. 270.00\n- Digging well and cribbing same............. 150.00\n- Burning of brush............................ 480.00\n- Trucking material........................... 50.00\n\n$2,700.00\nMaterial:\n\nCement .................................. $100.00\nSand .................................... 12.00\nPaint ................................... 225.00\n\n$337.00\nESTIMATE OF WORK TO COMPLETE NEW SCHOOL AT HEMBERTON.\n\n1. Reconstructing platform and steps. Placing concrete blocks for steps and posts to rest on.\n\n   Requirements - 2 bags cement - 65 man hours.\n\n2. Platform and steps to Teacher's entrance.\n\n   Requirements - 2 bags cement - 40 man hours.\n\n3. Door into basement. Concrete wall has to be knocked out to make room for a door. The entrance to the doorway will be lower than the ground level. This will necessitate some excavating and concrete.\n\n   Requirements - 10 bags cement, door 3' x 6' and frame 9\u00bd\" wide - 100 man hours.\n\n4. Roof - to be fixed where leaks have developed. Eavetroughs should be tarred on inside.\n\n   Requirements - 20 man hours.\n\n5. Basement floor. Needs another layer of 1\" thick cement, of one part cement and two parts sand.\n\n   Requirements - 82 bags cement, 6 yards sand - 140 man hours.\n\n   Sand will cost approximately $2.00 per yard delivered.\n\n6. Basement windows. 12 panes of glass to be renewed. Windows will have to be taken out to be repaired. To make a better job I consider it necessary to have the facing on the inside.\n\n   Requirements - 25 man hours.\n\n7. Grounds. The ground level around the School will have to be taken down 18\" due to the fact that the windows in the basement are 18\" below the ground level. Brush, logs and stumps to be piled and burned.\n\n8. Bathroom. Some finishing work to be done in bathroom after plumbing fixtures installed. Difficult to estimate.\n\n9. Floors to be sanded. This can be done after the electrical equipment is installed. Placing of the kitchen sink and drainboard to be faced with masonite. Trimming to be put around edge of sink. Holes to be cut for cold and hot air vents.\n\n10. Outhouses - Holes to be dug and cribbed and outhouses to be set in place on top of holes. Doors to be made and hung on outhouses. Locks to be put on doors.\n\n   Requirements - 20 man hours.\n\n11. Painting - Paint job three coats outside, two coats inside.\nOttawa, May 25, 1949.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nPemberton Indian Day School.\n\nR. C. Goodrich Contract.\n\nThe following progress payments have been made to Mr. Goodrich:\n\nIn our contract with Mr. Goodrich we specified that payments would be made on a cost plus basis not to exceed $4,600.00. From reading Mr. Gillett's letter, it would seem that this contractor has not performed his work satisfactorily. In fact, several items now required to be done seem to be as a result of poor work or planning. I refer specifically to\n\n(a) Roof leaks,\n(b) Reconstructing platform and steps,\n(c) Door into basement (?)\n(d) Rough cement floor in basement - improperly hardened.\n\nThere is no reason to pay Mr. Goodrich on a cost plus 10% basis when we can arrange for a bulldozer to level the grounds on a straight hire basis. We should also be able to have the brush burned by Indians as suggested by Mr. Gillett.\n\nA requisition should be submitted for the paint and we can arrange to have the school painted by Indians or under a foreman-painter.\nIt would be appreciated if we could have your frank comments concerning the work done by Mr. Goodrich as we do not feel that his original contract has been performed in a satisfactory manner. You do not state whether Inspector Davey or yourself has checked this building to find out how much of the extra work is necessitated by the improper completion of the original contract by Mr. Goodrich.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 27th, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Pemberton Indian Day School\n\nWe have carefully considered your letter of May 7th with reference to certain additional work which you consider should be carried out by Mr. Goodrich.\n\nIn our contract with Mr. Goodrich it was stated that \"the cost of the work and the Contractor's fee will not exceed an estimated amount of $4,600.00\". Our records show that we have already paid Mr. Goodrich $5,993.03, which is approximately 30% higher than the estimate.\n\nFrom a review of Indian Superintendent Gillet's memorandum, it appears that this Contractor has not performed his work very satisfactorily. As a matter of fact, there are several items remaining to be finished that would seem to be the result of either poor work on his part or unsatisfactory planning. Particular reference is made in this regard to the following:\n\n(a) Roof leaks.\n(b) Reconstructing platform and steps.\n(c) Door into basement.\n(d) Rough cement floor in basement - improperly hardened.\n\nThere is no reason to pay Mr. Goodrich on a cost plus 10% basis. It could be arranged to\nhave a bulldozer level the grounds on a straight hire basis. We should also be able to have the brush burned by the Indians as suggested by Mr. Gillet.\n\nA requisition should be submitted for the paint and arrangements can be made so that it can be purchased through the Departmental Purchasing Agent. We feel that the school can be painted by Indians or under a foreman-painter.\n\nWe would like to have your frank comments concerning the work done by Mr. Goodrich, as we do not feel that the original contract was performed in a satisfactory manner. You do not state in your letter if Inspector Davey has checked the building to find out how much of the recommended extra work is necessitated by the improper completion of the original contract by Mr. Goodrich.\n\nBernard F.

The amount just mentioned included the cost of lighting, plumbing and heating in an amount of slightly over $4000.00. This would mean approximately $3200.00 for the other work.\n\nWe will have to have the Minister's approval before these repairs can be approved and we would like to know the approximate amount of the material and labour.\n\nWe would also like to know the name of the foreman and his address.\n\nAs soon as you reply the matter will be submitted to the Minister's office. In the meantime we are arranging to transfer the funds.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP: MMoN\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Pemberton Indian Day School\nYour File 865-5 (E.1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of May 27th, we are of the opinion that Mr. Goodrich performed his work in connection with the erection of the above mentioned school in a quite satisfactory manner, considering the time of year during which construction was carried out and the most unusual winter conditions which prevailed last year. I think we could conservatively estimate that construction costs were increased at least twenty-five percent by reason of our inability to authorize the commencement of construction at an earlier date.\n\nWith regard to the following to which particular reference is made in Mr. Phelan's letter, I would advise:\n\n(1) The roof leaks are in the valley of the roof where the flashing is nailed too close to the centre. This can be very easily repaired.\n\n(2) Reconstructing platform and steps - Due to winter weather conditions it was not possible to back fill and permanent steps and platform could not be constructed until the back fill was done.\n\n(3) Door into basement - The plan of the building did not show a basement door. Mr. Goodrich carried out instructions in accordance with the plan. This was an omission on our part - we should have had the plan changed.\n(4) Failure of the basement floor to properly harden was due to weather conditions. This can be remedied by laying a finish coat of sand and cement.\n\nI have requested Superintendent Gillett to arrange for completion of the building on a day labour basis and to requisition for the materials required. I should appreciate being advised when the funds required are transferred and if it will be in order for us to have the work proceeded with.\n\nW.S.

Eaton Company Limited, whose tender was the lowest. It is recommended that the Department authorize an expenditure of approximately $390.00 which will cover the items for which quotations have been received from The T. Eaton Company Limited and several others on which they were unable to quote.\n\nIt will be recalled that these furnishings are required for the new two-teacher accommodation provided at Pemberton.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAttached is a requisition for furnishings for the new teacher's residence at Pemberton together with tenders from the T. Eaton Co.

Basing the cost of these on the prices of the others, the total cost would still be considerably less. I would, therefore, recommend that Eatons be given the order.\n\nJ.

The need for artificial light is therefore greater in the old school than in the new school and it is felt that we should endeavour to make the necessary funds available for wiring the building.\n\nI might mention we have been unofficially advised that the B.C. Electric Company will have power available in the vicinity of the school, possibly next year, but there would appear to be no reason to wait until then as we have ample power available.\n\nW.S.

This results in increased fuel consumption, inefficient heating and a poor circulation of air.\n\nInstallation of the cold air return will cost $162.50 and I would recommend that an expenditure of this amount be approved.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nRe: The Pemberton One Room School\n\nThe cold air circuit in the building was not constructed to give efficient results. It does not take the cold air off the floor of the school room. In fact, any dust or smoke in the basement will rise to the school room from the cold air vents.\n\nThe pipes from the two cold air grills go down the walls within two feet of the basement floor. The open grill on the bottom of the furnace is expected to draw the air to the furnace. This does not happen, however.\n\nTo have the heat properly distributed through the school and teacher's quarters it will be necessary to have improvements made as outlined in the attached copy of a letter from Mitchell Brothers Ltd.\n\nI recommend that this be authorized.\n\nJ.

Therefore for a few years to come, as in the past, they settle on some good spot, and create a large Winter Camp. It is at these places that a Mission School should be created, not necessary every year in the same location.\n\nIn this way, with a capable teacher to watch over the Camp generally, and carry on a school for the children, the men folk will be able to get out, and moreover stay out, bringing back returns.\n\nHowever with the arrival of Inspector Pragnell, all the Indians concerned will be seen, and some definite action settled.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nThe matter of schooling for the Caribou Hide Band of Indians was taken up with Inspector Pragnell upon his visit here. He instructed that a requisition should be submitted, for aid, along the lines that Father Bonse' O.M.I., and your Agent thought best on their visit to these Indians last winter, and reported in the usual Monthly Diary. It is as follows.\n\nJim Moyess has given his \"hun\" for a School house. Desks and seats are made out of their own cut lumber. The school will receive about 15 Youngsters (all R.C.'s). The Cripple Jimmy, a member of their Band should act as School-teacher until the R.C. Mission can see their way clear to send a schoolmaster in for the winter months. That Cripple Jimmy should be allowed a set sum per month, and he will not then receive \"ations as he has been used to. The salary it is considered should be $20.00 per month\u2014period for 6 months. As provisions are very dear in price this seems the least that can be allowed.\n\nSchool material of simple form must be provided and sent in from Tadla Lake B.C. by the Two Brothers Mining Co.'s Plane which can ground on Netspan Lake, upon which is the Indian Camp.\n\nAll schooling matters to be under their Head-Man - Jim Moyess. Also 1 Doz sheets of Glass if supplied would give the extra light required in the already constructed School-house.\n\nFather Bonse' O.M.I. on his next visit would check up all operations.\n\nThe above is considered to be the very best, and least expensive, way of supplying the Band with schooling\u2014pro temp.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept.

It seems to be the only way, up to now whereby these youngsters can learn anything at all; it also helps to break down their wild nomadic ways. Two such places are really required. One for the Klappan Band of Indians and the other for the Caribou Hide Band.\n\nThe first Bands requirements have been gone into, and has now, after much trouble been reduced to supplying a teacher with school material, at their Big Camp on Kluechon Lake, all under the R. C. Mission of these parts. Father Bosse' O. M. I., in charge of such Missions here has written His Lordship, Bishop Bunoz, and requested him to supply a teacher. For such long winters work, and in so remote a place, a salary a little above the ordinary is expected. Upon the matter being investigated by Inspector Pragnell, shortly, a full and detailed report will be submitted to the Department.\n\nThe second Band - Caribou Hide. This Band is very remote, and the only possible action to take, is to supply the Chief - Jim Moyess, with full material, and he will instruct Cripple Jimmy, a very intelligent member of his band, to act as a teacher and supervise his work. In this event the teacher would be supplied with a monthly ration, with a very small salary for his services. Supplies for this Band would have to be sent to them, by the freighting planes of the Two Bros. Mining Company, who are operating within ten miles of the Indian camp. This also will have further attention.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nThe matter of schooling for the Caribou Hide Band of Indians was taken up with Inspector Pragnell upon his visit here.

The remoteness of the proposed location of the improvised school would appear to suggest that transport and other costs may prove considerable and possibly not commensurate with our customary economies and school requirements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. C. Perry.\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nSchooling for the children of the Caribou Hide Band of Indians - 200 miles about East of here, has been the subject of reports to the Department now and again. It is felt that some assistance should be given this very fine bunch of Indians, especially as they have Cripple Jim, who now conducts a school of his own. They have gone as far as using birch bark in place of paper.\n\nThe trouble is they are away off from any point. This summer some of their men are expected to come in, and therefore the following supplies are requested for their use:\n\n- **Pencils**: H.B. with rubber, 4 doz.\n- **Asst Colours**: Red Blue Green, 1 doz.\n- **Rulers**: 12 inch, 1 doz.\n- **Crayons**: Asst Colours Sm. Boxes, 3 doz.\n- **Books**: Spelling, 1.2.63, each, 1 Doz.\n- **Readers**: Copy writing, 1 Doz.\n- **Drawing Books**: No. 1, 1 doz.\n- **Arithmetic**: 1 st grade, 6.\n- **Scribblers Plain**, 2 doz.\n- **Scribblers Ruled**, 1 doz.\n- **Rubber Erasing**, 12 feet\n- **Chalk**: White, 2 Boxes\n- **Asst Colours**: Coloured Chalk, 2 Boxes\n- **Envelopes**: White No. 7, 3 Pkts.\n- **Brown stout**, No. 14, 2 doz.\n- **School Returns**, 1 doz.\n\nIn the yearly Estimates the sum of $60.00 was set down, but this was to cover the expenses of new roofing\u2014two windows and a door. The roofing (heavy oiled paper) with about 3 doz sheets of glass could possibly be allowed them, which could be taken out on the first fall of snow. All supplies should be directed to here and wait their arrival.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nThe Dept.

I must say that he is one man in a thousand that could trail out the 250 odd miles and get the Indians started on the new School House. This is rather rough work- in fact very rough work, for he will have to live on meat until the snow flies and he is able to come in again and take out supplies by Dogs. He has no bedding and cares nothing about the usual nice things that one obtains for a winter in the North. No way could this matter be started up cheaper, as the lad or rather man, has only requested the usual Teachers monthly pay. Other little help will have to be allowed him should the Department consent to his taking on this work. It is fully recommended by this Office and Mr Anglin is tough enough to carry it through.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

Much has been written regarding the needs of a school for this Band of Indians. The whole trouble in the way of this being accomplished, is the fact that these Indians live about 250 miles away from any place at all. The expense is very great in getting even flour out to these nomads. Bishop Coudret has not visited this Band, but did just happen to meet one or two of their members - and of course they wish a School at the Department's expense. This means a full load of a Plane, if not two runs. The Teacher would expect to be taken in, with his supplies. The matter could be considered, but is quite out of the question to fix up in any proper way, this Summer. Books have been sent out, and no doubt some good work could be done if a Teacher would go out and start up. Mr. Anglin now of McDames has offered to go, and perhaps with some extra pay allowance, would undertake the work this winter. But a school house should be built here, and that takes time. However, in this respect, during the last year an Air Mail Route is in operation up to Fort Ware (Old Whitewater) on the Finlay River, on the top end of which the Caribou Hide Band lives. It would mean \u00bd of an hour's run - extra or from Fort Ware to reach the Indians' location. These planes are run by McChonicky (?) of Edmonton, Alberta. Prices could be obtained if the matter is considered.\nOttawa\nMarch 10, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant with reference to the proposed Seasonal School at Caribou Hide.\n\nLast fall we corresponded with Indian Agent Reed regarding this school and he promised to report further to us early this year. As yet his report has not been received and until we have more definite information it is not possible to make a decision regarding this school.\n\nIn any case, our regulations would not permit paying the transportation of the teacher to and from the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The matter was up for consideration upon Inspector Pragnell's visit to these parts, but it was impossible to reach this very distant Band of Indians. This fall, the department has been kind enough to allow a supply of school material, which has already been forwarded to them. (Dept. letter - July 31-36 158-7-1) There is little doubt but what Father Bosse' will this winter pay a visit to these Indians and start up a little school. This should be able to run along until such time as correct arrangements can be taken up and settled. This is a very fine bunch of Indians and deserve help, but their location is about 200 miles from anywheres, and are obliged to stay where they are for trapping purposes. A teacher for this location will have to go in by plane.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\n31 MOFE 39 NL VIA Ashcroft, B.C.\nTelegraph Creek B.C., Sept. 20, 1937.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nOffice typewriter returned from Vancouver repairs found useless for winters work parts missing last boat leaves Vancouver Thirtieth may a typewriter be allowed please also may authority be granted inspection Caribou Hide Band with Doctor and School supplies delivered\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent\n\n205AM\nOttawa,\nSeptember 6, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 23rd, the articles requested in your letter of June 22nd for the Caribou Hide School were forwarded by freight on July 26th addressed to:\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nvia Barrington Transport Co.,\nWrangell, S.E.

Mr. Jas. Anglin, who had been nominated and accepted as the teacher for the Caribou Hide Winter Bay school, R.C. Mission, which is situated about 300 miles to the S.E. of Telegraph Creek, at last got ready to go, and left with the Pack Train on this date. He had to walk most of the way, and pack his own provisions, on the latter half. Much credit is certainly due to him, for the trail is by no means an easy one, and one he knew nothing about.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your wire giving authority for Teacher J. A. E. Anglin; late teacher at Mc Dames Creek, to be teacher for the Caribou Hide Winter Day School for the coming winter.\n\nMr Anglin has already left for that point\u2014250 miles to the south-east of here, packing his own blankets and a small supply of provisions. The trip will be a hard one and little white-man's provisions will be found when he reaches Caribou Hide. However he wished to undertake the work, and as stated he is really very fit to make the venture a success. Sufficient stationery is now out that way, and the Chief's House\u2014a very good lean-to, has been promised in which the school will make its start. I feel sure that within two weeks of Mr Anglin's arrival\u2014a real large school house, with a lean-to for Mr Anglin, will be set up and in running order.\n\nMr Anglin has been allowed a large sheet of canvass, to take the place of a tent, en route, also a small two holed collapsible stove with pipeing. Twelve sheets of glass has also been sent part of the ways along by trappers.\n\nIt is expected that he with some of the Indians will return about Xmas, bringing in their furs, and at the same time taking out their winter's supplies, it will then be possible to report on the matter, and to go into all future requirements.

For the past two years the Indian Agent has been urging the establishment of a school at this point.

Upon arrival at the settlement I there met some Indians about to leave for their traplines on the Spatzier river. These men kindly undertook to guide myself as far as the crossing of the caribou Hyde trail roughly four miles below Hylands Poston the Spatzier river.\n\nHaving placed me on this trail these men left me and I followed this trail a distance of forty six miles to Carribou Hyde settlement arriving there at the end of October. Nearly all the men of the camp had left for their traplines, however all their children were at the camp. The chief gave the teacher permission to use his house as a school.\n\nThe school supplies which you had forwarded were in the chief's house and were in good condition. November first being a holiday of obligation a day in which we had no school.\n\nAll the children were keen to go to school and I found that they are self taught in the elementary work of schooling. One girl has taught herself to read the first books of the Canadian and Highroads readers. In regards to figures every child could count but had no idea of the written numbers above the number nine. Likewise in writing, their work was of a very childlike scrawl, since opening school I have found a great improvement in all branches of their work.\n\nAt present there are eleven children of school age and quite a few below school age who will be ready for school in the future.\n\nOwing to the fact that I was late in getting here and as all the men of the camp had left for their trap lines and did not return until Christmas Eve we have up to the present only been able to get the logs for the future school building cut, after the men return from their pending trip to Telegraph Creek and the weather is suitable the building will be completed.\nNails and glass are absolutely nonexistent in this camp, but the chief informed that there was quite a number of nails and windows on the property of the Northern Gold Syndicate's property situated at McLaren Creek; he believed these could be purchased from this company. To ascertain if this was possible I went in company of the chief to this property and interviewed the watchman there.\n\nMy findings there was that there are considerable of part keys of nails and a number of windows about twelve and the watchman said he believed these could be purchased by applying to Mr O'Connell President\n200 Lancaster Building\nCalgary Alta.\n\nOr\nMr Faulkson Manager\n10 Broadway\nTacoma Wash.\n\nThese men could be contacted by wire from Telegraph Creek and if nails and glass could be purchased there it would be easier to haul them the seventeen miles from that camp than from Telegraph Creek.\n\nTo cover the roof with tar paper it will require (1350) thirteen hundred and fifty square feet of paper this will be sufficient to cover both the school building and the teachers quarters.\n\nHaving walked the whole way from Telegraph Creek to here I am of the opinion that it is economically impossible to ship school supplies to this place from that point to Caribou Hyde, as we have to consider the freight from Vancouver to Wrangell plus the cost up the Stikine river to Telegraph creek after that these supplies would have to be hauled by pack train or dog team a distance of two hundred and fifty miles to this point, the cost of that being (40\u00a2) forty cents per pound or ($800) eight hundred dollars per ton. Now sir, any of the commercial planes flying in British Columbia at present will take a full load of 1000 lbs. and I am sure that from Burns lake or Vanderhoof it would not cost any more than two hundred dollars to charter a plane to land school supplies at this point.\n\nThe school supplies which you sent although sufficient to start school are not sufficient to run until the end of May and could I please have a few more readers and other supplies of which I attach a separate list.\n\nHoping this finds you in the best of health and wishing you the compliments of the season\n\nI beg to\nRemain\nYours truly\nJAE Anglin\n\nIndian Affairs.

We do not know what the air rate from there to Caribou Hide would be but it should be very little in difference to the rate from here to there. There are ten mail trips a year by Plane to Fort Ware from somewhere south, as far as we know.\n\nWe could not undertake to deliver goods via Bear Lake as our Post at that point has been closed.\n\nIn view of the fact that there will be a Plane stationed at Telegraph Creek next summer, we would strongly recommend that your goods for Caribou Hide be shipped through this way so that you would have a complete check on same and also the freight rates total charges would be less than by any other route. Another consideration is that it would act as an excellent opportunity for the Doctor to visit Caribou Hide and give attention to this isolated camp.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSIGNED W. G.

Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDec. 15th 1938.\nReturns arrived this date.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit hereunder a Report on the new venture of a Bush-Day-School (Winter) for the Caribou Hide of Indians. Submitted herewith is the School Report as far as it has gone, and Mr Anglin, the school Teacher has been instructed to make same out monthly, for the future. Also is a rough out-line of work done and efforts intended for the future, made out by Mr Anglin; who is much better at his rough work, than making out a report on same.\n\nThe Department will no doubt remember that this excellent Band of Nomads are situated 250 miles to the south east of this Town, but have consistently demanded to be taught things. Supplies have been sent out and with these much good ground work was accomplished by their self elected teacher - Cripple Jimmy. It was thought that another school such as the Klappan Affair could be started here, with it is hoped the same good results. More Indian families are expected up from Bear Lake way and taken in all this band should increase in the very near future. Also it might be mentioned, as far as can be ascertained to-day the proposed Alaskan highway, or rather the Pacific Highway, is due to pass right through, or very near, this Bands front door step.\n\nActing on an Authority from The Department received by Wire, Mr Anglin walked out to this spot last Fall. His trip was very hard, and altho there was no trail in places, the time he made in arriving there was indeed good.\n\nHe is most keen to go ahead with this work, and as a start it would be hard to find a more suitable man. His data is not quite correct as to freight rates, so attached is submitted a copy of a letter on this matter received from the H.B.C., which your Agent agrees with entirely.\n\nThe matter of allowing Windows, and doors, with next winter equipment, which should include a Gas Lamp of some sort for the long winter days, is one that it is requested The Department considers, and if thought fit, an Authority is requested.\n\nIt is understood that this Teacher will carry on his duties at Caribou Hide until the end of May next, when, at His Lordship Bishop Bunoz's request, he will move over to Mc Dames Creek and act as the Teacher there, as he has done in previous years.\n\nChief Stikine Jim came in with Mr Anglin and this Indian wishes to thank the Department for allowing a Teacher for his Band and states that directly they get back, the new school house shall be erected.\n\nI am.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nJuly 15 - 1939\n\nMr Harper Reed esq\nIndian Agent\nTelegraph Creek\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAfter a long walk and much trouble I have just survived the trip through from Caribou Hyde to this place. As I stated when last I saw you I ordered a plane to come to Caribou Hyde to get me and told the pilot that I would wait until the Fifth of June but no longer; on the fifth I realized that my wait had been in vain. A telegraph told me that there was a radio transmitter at Fort Ware so I walked there in the hopes of getting a plane to bring me through but on arrival I found that the transmitter had been shipped out for repairs and as there was no hopes of getting a message out or a plane in.\n\nHaving promised the Bishop that I would come here I highered a guide and walked through from Fort Ware to McDames, the man that I highered had not been over the trail before but I could not have got a better man anywhere and we made the trip through in thirteen days. We had to build no less than five rafts on that trip besides crossing innumerable creeks every one in flood and on the whole trip I was wet through every day but I saw some wonderful country.\n\nBefore leaving Caribou Hyde I had made out the required materials for the school building, but those papers were spoilt in my pack sack, through having to cross the above mentioned Creeks and Rivers and I find that I have to make them all out again.\n\nThe first estimate of a building was impracticable as I found on looking the logs over which had been cut that there was not timber in that place big enough to construct a school thirty feet long and the longest log which had been cut was twenty two (22) ft so I told them to make the school square twenty by twenty (20) it is proposed to put a half pitch on the roof, and as near as I can ascertain the required amount of roofing paper is nine hundred fifty (950) sq ft. This will be sufficient to cover both the school and the teacher's quarters.\n\nWindows required are six (four for the school and two for the teacher's quarters). Doors three. Nails of different sizes about two hundred (200) lbs.\n\nDuring the past winter I was highly satisfied with the progress the children of Caribou Hyde made in the school work, every child there from the smallest to the biggest is keen to learn.\n\nMy salary received to date amounted to seven hun-\nDred ninety (790$) of which I paid out for food and transportation almost seven hundred (700$). This I think is a little steep for one teacher to have to bear. As I stated on the letter I forwarded to you in January of this year the only feasible method of getting things into this place is by air, and if the bishop wishes me to return to Caribou Hyde this winter that is how I intend to get the winter's supplies of food for myself and also myself in to that place. But to buy the supplies and pay for the plane myself will still be a steep proposition and I think I should receive some assistance from the department. I am quite willing to pay half of the charter of the plane.\n\nIn accordance with instructions from your office whilst residing at Caribou Hyde I went to the trap line of Chief Jim Moyez and there staked a quarter section of land the same to be set aside as an Indian reserve, this was done early in December of 1938, but I mislaid the papers of the staking and it meant making a return trip so during the Easter holiday I took one man and went and visited that place again, changing the dates on the post to the nineteenth (19) of April 1939. I enclose a copy of the notice which I left affixed to the corner posts on the afore said land.\n\nHoping the above meets with your approval and hoping to meet you again at some future date\n\nI beg to remain\nyours sincerely\nJAE Anglin\n\nINDIAN OFFICE NOTE.\n\nMr Anglin was written to\u2014 that at the end of August Month on Interior Inspection trip he would be seen and then arrangements would be made to help him along\u2014the best possible. It would be possible to lift in his winter's supply of provisions, but certainly he could walk in.\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nNOTE FOR FILE:\n\nJ. A. E. Anglin, teacher of the Cariboo Hide School, has been paid salary as teacher to May 15th, 1939.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter dated January 12th in regard to the Salary Cheque -for School Master duties- in favour of Mr J.A.E. Anglin, of the Caribou Hide School.\n\nA Voucher for two months payments -Vch-39- has already been submitted and a covering letter attached to same to show the reason for such action.\n\nHowever the Cheque mentioned in your last letter will be taken in charge of, by this Office, and held until your further advice is received on the matter.\n\nMr Anglin has returned to Caribou Hide and cannot be got in touch with until the middle of June next. Meanwhile we have a statement from Mr Anglin requesting that all salaries received be turned into the Hudson's Bay Co.'s keeping so that he will have a Credit at any Post he will be able to call at.\n\nIn this case also if the cash could be allowed the matter could be smoothed out at this point.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 23, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing report on the Caribou Hide seasonal school. I am pleased to note that Mr. Anglin has done very satisfactory work.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to let me have an estimate of the cost of any building material that you consider should be supplied and you should also state if this can be secured locally.\n\nMore definite information should also be supplied regarding the cost of delivering material to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nI beg to submit herewith the School Report for the above school covering months April & May. It will be seen that the attendance is not as large as can be expected, but it must be remembered that the school was started at the last moment, last Fall, when some of the families had already moved out their children unto their trapgrounds. This coming winter, all have agreed to leave the women folk behind in the school camp - and catch more fur. It is hoped this takes place. So therefore it is thought, if the Department will allow, that this school be tried one more winter when it should turn out as good as, if not better than, that of the Klappan Winter School.\n\nYour letter dated February 23rd 1939 requested to know the amount of equipment now required and the means of getting same out to that remote spot.\n\nThe Teacher has requested, as his letter attached will explain, 950 feet of roofing - 6 windows (6 panes to each) and about 150 lbs of nails would be sufficient. Hinges for doors and some few extras that will surely crop up, might come to another $30-00.\n\nThe Yukon Southern Air T/Port have a large plane visiting Dease Lake once a month if not more often, and they pass Caribou Hide, overhead. This plane will carry 1150 lbs travels at 100 miles per hour, and costs will be at $75-00 per hour. The distance to Caribou Hide from Dease Lake is 115 miles.\n\nIt was thought by arrangement that the school supplies now here could be sent to Dease Lake with the other equipment allowed. This, as above is short a heater and piping the cost of which would be around $16-00 (made over Gas Drum) Then by arrangement the Doctor with perhaps your Agent might meet the Plane at Dease Lake, and go over with the supplies. Perhaps it might be possible to take along the Teachers supplies also, but walking out to Caribou in the Fall, not too late should be an enjoyment and not a hardship.\n\nAll arrangements will have to be made ere the snow flies or otherwise it will all have to wait until after Xmas for good snow landings.

Co. Post at Whitewater on the Finlay River, and so as no report of his arrival at that point had been received, a wire was sent to His Lordship Bishop Bunoz, in Prince Rupert; to have the matter looked into. Later, of course, it turned out that Teacher Anglin had reached Whitewater, but finding the Radio set out of Commission there, had taken an Indian and trailed all the ways back to McDames Creek, through Sitton Pass, to open up the summer school at McDames Creek as had been arranged. In future he will report to this office when changing stations.\n\nHowever the Caribou Hiders were rather pleased with the school during the past winter months, and a real \"set-up\" is being made at the present time so that next winter can be as well conducted as the school of the Klappan Band of Indians. This matter has already been reported upon under separate cover and it is hoped that the suggestions put forward, might be carried out.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 15, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Mission School teachers arrangements, for moving to their various points met with a little delay at the beginning of the month. It was not known then as to if the Dease Lake Winter school would be opened or not. Later on it was decided not to open this school, so therefore Mr. Moran intended to take up his duties at the Klappan school, as in years past. Mr. Anglin had tried in vain to obtain a plane to carry him out to the Caribou Hide School site, which had he done so would carry the school supplies also, but this was not possible, owing to lack of planes. Therefore the only way out of this situation, was the use of dog teams and a pack train that was wintering out that way. On the 16th inst. both Mr. Moran and Mr. Anglin left Telegraph for their posts.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 26, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant arrangements are being made to issue and forward to Mr. Jas. Anglin, care of the Manager, Hudson's Bay Company, Telegraph Creek, B.C., a cheque for his services as teacher of the Cariboo Hide Indian Day School for the period October 17, 1939, to January 31, 1940.\n\nIn the past the Department has in some cases forwarded to the Indian Agent sufficient money to pay teachers' salaries but as it is so close to the end of the current fiscal year we do not wish to follow this procedure at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

Anglin was appointed teacher at this school at a salary of $110.00 a month and at the end of this month cheque should be issued in his favour for the period October 17, 1939, to January 31, 1940.\n\nThe cheque should be sent to him in care of The Manager, Hudson's Bay Company, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nI enclose copy of letter of appointment.

Evidently it has been the custom of the Department to send sufficient cash to the Indian Agent to cover teachers' salaries, and it would be appreciated if this could be done if not contrary to Departmental procedure.\n\nI would recommend payment of salary in this case, as from the date the teacher left Telegraph Creek, October 17th, 1939.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOffice of the STIKINE Indian Agency,\n\nDecember 31st, 1939.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 183,\n\namounting to $61.30 in favour\n\nof Indian Agent REED Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nfor Monies paid out on Agency Affairs - Freight & Wires.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Usual Routine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nI beg to submit herewith Teachers Anglin's Day School Return on the above School. It is not considered very good, and I am sure were a personal visit paid to this locality, the number of school children could be doubled. However Mr Anglin got out there late, and some of the families have moved out thinking that no school was to be opened this winter.\n\nIt seems that the Indians cut the logs during last summer for a larger school house than they were using, and then waited for the Teacher to come along and help. This it seems took up the month of November. Mr Anglin had to walk out there again, which was no light work.\n\nYour Agent was over in Atlin when the only indian from remote Caribou Hide came in to town, with the enclosed Report, and so of course he was not seen, and the \"news\" from that District was not obtained. Dr Meyer saw the lad and learnt that everything was all right, and that \"she\" i.e. the school was going good now. Even with the small attendance now, this school is doing good and should be continued for the rest of this winter.\n\nIt is thought that with the coming summer, planes will be flying directly over Caribou Hide, and if so, some supplies now here will be sent out, and it might be even possible for the Doctor with the Agent to visit this very fine set of Indians.\n\nIt is much regretted that more information cannot be submitted at this time, but no doubt some more Indians will arrive in on the first \"crust\" and a further Report on this school will be rendered.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nHarper Reed, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 1, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Caribou Hide Indian Day School\nNo. 866\n\nA return has been received showing that Mr. Jas. Anglin continued operation of this school during the month of February, 1940. Consequently a cheque for $110.00 should be issued in his favour and sent to him in care of The Manager, Hudson's Bay Company, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Caribou Hide Band - Day-school - 1940-1941.\n\nUnder letter dated February 23rd a short Report was submitted on the affairs of the above school. Since then it has been impossible to hear more news, but no doubt the school has run its due course to the end of its term.\n\nIt is certainly considered that this school should be re-opened for the coming winter; and that now they have buildings of all kinds created, very much better reports should be received for the future, than has been possible in the past.\n\nTo that end is herewith submitted a Requisition to cover such school supplies that are considered necessary, and it is hoped that same might be granted.\n\nMr Anglin, the Teacher, and for that matter the Indians themselves consider that some grant for cutting heating wood should be allowed this school. Last winter they were told that as they live at this location all the year around, they should supply their own cord wood. This resulted in Mr Anglin going out at odd times and cutting the wood himself, which of course he rather objects doing. It is considered that the Indians should supply their own fuel, taking into account the heavy cost of freight of school supplies to that point. However a ruling on this question, from the Department would be much appreciated.\n\nThis coming summer a private Plane will be established in Telegraph Creek, and then it will be possible to reach this remote school, taking along the Doctor, and his odd supplies now here, and such as the Department will allow for the future.\n\nIt is expected that Mr Anglin will again take charge of this school, over the proposed term 1940-1941. Winter.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\nApril 14 - 1940\n\nTo Indian agent Telegraph Creek\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn re your enquiries as to the school house at this point as you know the chief in the XXXXX name of his band promised that if a teacher was sent to this place these Indians would build a school house and living quarters for the teacher.\n\nDuring the winter 1938-9 whilst here I endeavoured to cut the logs of the building and was told that the Indians would skin them to the site during the summer and put the walls up leaving the finishing to be done upon my return to open school for the following winter.\n\nWhen I returned here I found that nothing whatever had been done to bring either to skid these logs or make fresh ones. One man only attempted to give me any assistance in constructing this place the size of which is 22ft by 20ft. Height of walls being 8ft6ins plus a gable of quarter pitch the roof is of poles ripped in half with whip saw and scoop on the top of that again, the length of the poles and scoop are 14ft6ins to allow an over lap of 1ft6ins.\n\nFor flooring poles again were used and ripped in half, their length being 11ft.\n\nThe teachers quarters are in the shape of a lean-to at the back of the school house size 16ft by 13ft this is also constructed with pole and scoop roof.\n\nNow as I said only one man volunteered to help me and for the amount of work to be done it would have meant that we two would have been working all winter at it but I came to teach a school and so I endeavoured to use the money which is paid to me as salary to get this place finished having paid out the following amounts for ripping and skidding these logs etc by dog teams a distance of over half a mile.\n\nRob Abesta Quack $50.00\nJoseph Leon Dennis $203.00\nAntoine Hunter $25.00\nPeter Lee Dennis $20.00\nWalter Leon Dennis $18.00\nAntoine Louis $10.00\n\nWages $196.00\nNails and glass $20.00\nTotal $216.00\n\nThis is the total amount which I have paid out in order to build this school house as far as I have been able to go.\n\nAccording to the plan which I drew up I allowed for five windows in the school house and two in the living quarters, but so far I was unable to obtain the glass for such a number and so I have two only in the school house and one only in the teachers quarters. For heating...\nthe school house I had to borrow a large stove from one of the Indians which came I have have to return at the end of the school term. For the teacher's quarters I have to do the best I can on an old tin stove which is too small. Hence it will require two (2) stoves for this place if this school is to run next winter.\n\nBefore leaving in the spring I intend to thoroughly chink this new place with moss and leave it ready for instant reposing in the fall leaving here some time in June for Telegraph Creek. Until I see you, believe me to remain\n\nYours very sincerely\nJAS Anglin\nschool teacher\nSir,\n\nRe:- Day School Returns- Caribou Hide.\n\nI beg to submit herewith the above day-school Returns rendered by Teacher Anglin, covering the periods of Months March - April - May & June, 1940.\n\nAlso attached is a letter from this Teacher in regard to the operation covering the month of June, as will be seen the teaching days were only 10, but Mr Anglin stated that he had on every occasion, and over several so-called holidays, maintained an open school. Such matters are very hard to check, but taking into consideration the affairs that have come about at this point it is thought that the June Month should not be considered for payment of a Teachers Salary.\n\nA letter from this Teacher is also submitted in regard to the forwarding of his Salary Cheques, yet to be paid him, and it will be seen that such are requested sent to the Hudson's Bay Co., Water Street, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\nCaribou Hyde\nB C\n\nApril 15 - 1940\n\nMr Harper Reed esq\nIndian agent\nTelegraph Creek B C\n\nDear sir,\n\nre your enquiry as to the closing of this school.\n\nUpon my arrival at Telegraph Creek in September of 1939 I received a letter from the department, this letter came direct and not through your office, which informed me that the school term was to commence on the Tuesday after Labor day. Also it pointed out the holidays allowed for Christmas and Easter and stated that the school was to close at the end of June, it was signed by the deputy minister whose name I read to be Mr Haite.\n\nAs near as I am able I intend to comply with these regulations.

Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C., June 10, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON STIKINE AGENCY FOR MONTH OF APRIL\n\nThe R.C.Mission Seasonal schools are nominally under the supervision of the Rev. Father Carpentier, O.M.I., and during the winter three such schools have been in operation viz. Klappen Day School - Dease Lake School, and that of Caribou Hide. Reports on all the above have been rendered to the Department whenever it was possible to do so. As this month sees the breaking of winter into the summer season, it is mentioned that three summer season schools will be in operation this year, viz., Thalton Reserve Anglican, as mentioned above. The McDames Reserve Day School, in the middle of the Cassiar and the Laird Post Day School, near the Yukon border line at which several Yukon children attend. The latter two schools being carried on by the R.C.Mission.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 11, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo our appropriation for the current fiscal year has now been approved and provision was made for an amount of $440.00 for the salary of the teacher at the Caribou Hide Indian Day School. This would permit the school to be operated for a period of 4 months during the winter season of 1940-41 and the teacher could be allowed the same rate as formerly; namely, $110.00 a month. Unless you are definitely of the opinion that this school should not be in operation I am inclined to feel that it should be again conducted during the coming winter.\n\nIf the school is operated it is definitely understood that the Indians will supply the wood without cost to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Caribou Hide - Winter Seasonal School.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 7th, in regard to the question as to if this school should open up again, next winter or not.\n\nTo report on this matter in September would not allow sufficient time in which to have same placed in operation for the following winter as it is over 250 miles south east of this point. A private plane might be here for hire, but most probably not.\n\nIt is really thought, considering that the Canadian Government is under huge expenses, just at present, that this Indian Band could go without a school this coming winter. They have been provided with very fine trapping grounds, and they should go out and build Cabins etc at the suitable points so to show ownership, and could take their families with them.\n\nAlso it is thought that having seen the advantages of a school; when it is resumed, they would then understand better the advantages they are being allowed under very heavy expenses.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 7, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo with reference to the Caribou Hide Seasonal School. I am not in a position to state definitely at the present time if funds will be available for the operation of this school during the winter of 1940-41. However, you might write to me again about September 1 and the matter will receive further consideration. In the meantime you should endeavour to obtain from the Indians a definite promise that in the event of the school being operated they will supply the wood that is necessary without cost to the Department. When writing to me again you should let me know if the Indians have made a definite promise in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nThere is in stock here at present a good heater for this building when it is possible to get same out there, but there was no reason why the Indians could not have gone a half days run, on the snow and obtained an empty Gas drum at the old Mining Camp of the Caribou Hide Mining Co., discarded material. The same applies to such glass or other odd material required. If the Indians had wanted it for their own use, they would have obtained same.\n\nIn all it looks to this Office that Mr Anglin was determined to fix up an R.C. Mission Building, first and foremost, and then this building might be used for a school. In this the Indians agreed of course, getting off on the best side as usual.\n\nAs stated elsewhere, it is high time this location was paid a visit by the Indian Agent, perhaps in the Fall, when the doctor could go along also. If the Department could not see their way clear to re-open this school this coming winter, then in the Fall visit the Indian Cripple Jimmy would be installed as a Teacher allowing him some Nations to so settle, and the school could run that way for that season. It would be the good effect of making the Band look after themselves for a time. However it is felt thatwere a Father to take charge of this Band over a winter or so matters would right themselves.\n\nOf course the Statement rendered is considered absurd, for if the small totals paid to these Indians cannot be given free by them for their children's education, it is a great pity that they are helped along at all. It is noted that Leon Dennis, the Church Head Man has been paid the largest amount.\n\nMr Anglin was asked to render Receipts for payments made, in the correct manner, which he knows well to do, but he stated that it was not a Claim for monies paid out, but simply a statement of facts.\n\nTherefore Sir, it is respectfully suggested that Bishop Coudray be requested to throw some light on this matter as of course he must have been acquainted with all Mission Affairs, when visiting that location last winter.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nRe: School Building - Caribou Hide.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a letter in regard to the above building, which it would seem has been constructed this last winter, under the supervision of Teacher Anglin, and for which labour he has paid out from his own funds, the sum of $216-00, without the necessary Authority.\n\nWhen this school was started, a very good building was obtained from the Head Man Jim Moyes, and it was understood that this would be used until the Indians with the supervision of the Teacher, constructed a new School House.\n\nA lot of supplies have been allowed at odd times to aid this along, some of which has gone out the 300 odd miles. Last fall all arrangements were made for the Teacher to go out by Plane, and take along the Heater Roofing paper etc that the Department had allowed. This was impossible as at the last minute a Plane was unobtainable. Mr Anglin went out on foot, but a pack train took nearly half-ways some of the supplies, but not the heavy material. It was understood that owing to the failure of the Plane, the school would be held again in the original House or Cabin but it seems that some disagreements took place, and Mr Anglin decided to build a School House.\n\nThere is no doubt but what the Band has \"split\" and Mr Anglin has obtained help, under promise of payment on his own authority, from the \"good\" members of his Church, as it is seen that most members are of the Leon Dennis Family. This family and the Father of same - Leon Dennis, are in disagreement with Jim Moyes, who was elected Head-man some years ago, and voted so by this very same Leon Dennis.\n\nMr Anglin was asked why he did not shut down the school, until they got busy and help construct the Building, to which question he had no real reply. Your Agent is under the impression that Mr Anglin wished to have a Church Building at that point, at any cost, and therefore the construction was erected.\n\nAgain, he was asked why when his Bishop was out there, the matter was not reduced to paper and sent in to here, and again no real reply was received. It is certain that Bishop Coudray knew all about the matter, but this Office was not advised, and nothing was known about this until Mr Anglin himself brought in this letter. Also he was asked why, when the Constable was out there, information was not allowed regarding this all-winter trouble.\n\nMr Anglin distinctly stated that he had no Authority, and that is what he did, and that if the Department does not pay him back he has no claim, and even does not \"Claim\" a re-payment. Also he admits this Office has done all possible under the circumstances to aid along such construction.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nAugust 2nd, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF JUNE.\n\nOn the 27th inst. Mr. Anglin, teacher of the Caribou Hide Day school (winter) arrived in from that point. He reported rather a hard winter's duties performed, and it would seem that some unrest has existed there over the winter months. This was quite a surprise to this office as the local Provincial Constable had paid that district, and that camp, a visit during the winter and no information had then been received. However, Mr. Anglin turned in his reports etc., and stated that as the \"war\" was still on, he considered it his duty to enlist, and he was proceeding outside with that object in view. A report on this matter has been forwarded to the Department, and as this much respected teacher is somewhat of a stormy petrel, perhaps it is better for him to try a different way of life. However we have to thank Mr. Anglin for the sincere and hard work he has accomplished on behalf of our nomads on the outside.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 17th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letters of the 4th instant reporting fully on conditions at Cariboo Hide. It is noted that the teacher has left the Reserve and it is unlikely he will return even though re-appointed. I am advising His Lordship Bishop Bunnell that it is not considered advisable to persuade Mr. Anglin to accept another appointment.\n\nFunds will be available for the operation of a school for a period of four months during the coming winter. I am advising His Lordship that he may nominate a teacher if he wishes to do so, at a salary of $110 a month.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to your report regarding the expenditure which Mr. Anglin claims he has made in regard to the erection of a building at Cariboo Hide. As you are aware, no authority was given for this expenditure and our funds are so limited that it would be impossible to consider making any reimbursement to Mr. Anglin.\n\nA cheque for the salary due him is being forwarded to the Hudson's Bay Company, Raw Fur Department, 325 Water St., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nOttawa, July 17th, 1940.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the operation of the Dease Lake and Cariboo Hide Indian Day Schools during the coming winter.\n\nIn letter dated June 8th Indian Agent Reed was informed that provision was made in the current year's appropriation for the salary of a teacher at Dease Lake for 3\u00bd months at $90 per month. No doubt you will nominate a teacher to take charge during the period mentioned above.\n\nWe have just received a very lengthy report from the Indian Agent regarding conditions at Cariboo Hide. The teacher, Mr. Jas. Anglin, has returned from the Reserve and from the information contained in the Indian Agent's letter it appears that he has no intention of returning to the school even though he were re-appointed. In view of all the circumstances I feel that it would be a mistake to re-appoint him.\n\nProvided a satisfactory teacher could be secured, the Department is prepared to allow an amount of $110 a month for a period of four months during the winter of 1940-41. If you care to make a nomination, please let me know the name and qualifications of the teacher whom you recommend.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt. Rev. E. M. Bunn, O.M.I.,\nBishop's House,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, July 15th, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY,\n\nRe: Caribou Hide Indian Day School\n\nA return has been received showing that Mr. Jas. Anglin conducted this school during the months of March, April and May, 1940. Mr. Anglin is allowed salary at the rate of $110.00 a month and consequently cheque should be issued in his favour for the months of March, April and May.\n\nThe cheque should be sent to him in care of the Hudson's Bay Company, Raw Fur Department, 325 Water St., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSir,\n\nRe: Caribou Hide-Seasonal winter School.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 17th, and the information with the instructions have been noted.\n\nHowever it is much regretted that a further consideration has to be given this subject, for the following reason.\n\nBob Abestia Quock, a member of the above Band, and mentioned on the list of payments made for work done last winter, by late Teacher Anglin - called at the Office today for medicine for his daughter etc and the matter of opening the school again this coming winter was gone into.\n\nThis Indian trailed in with Mr Anglin last Spring, the real object being a promise of guiding a Big Game Party, but this has not eventuated. He did however help in a Petchlach, understood to settle up the burial of his old Mother. In all he has had a very good time whilst in Town. Now he intends to return to Caribou Hide and is the last person going out that way this summer.\n\nHe was told that the Department would pay for a Teacher supply school material and other small odds, but they had not the money, as the war is on, to pay for the heating wood for the school. It was expected that the Indians do their share, which would be only about two days work for the man of the Camp, as the costs to the Department was heavy. He stated that he would not do this, as he had done enough, also ha thought that the others looked at the matter the same way as he did, and that they should be paid for cutting this wood. There is little doubt but what some person in authority has told them that the Government should pay for the school wood used, and they are holding out for this.\n\nThe Indian was also told that the matter would be reported to the Department, and perhaps they would not pay the school teacher for the coming winter, and then it might be there would be no school. This had no effect on the Indian, and so the matter was left.\n\nThis band made very good money last winter, and is expected to do so again during the coming season, and cutting this wood is a very small matter to them. It is thought that had a Rev.Father been in charge last winter, this wood supply would have been cut ahead. May this Agency be advised as to the Department's wishes on this affair, please.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs\nBranch\nDept Mines & Resources\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nAugust 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the Caribou Hide Seasonal School. It is noted that you anticipate some trouble in having the Indians supply the wood required for the school. Possibly the other Indians will not adopt the same attitude as Bob Quock.\n\nI am writing to His Lordship Bishop Bunoz advising him that you consider that a Priest would do better work as a teacher than a lay man.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nOttawa,\nAugust 19, 1940.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Reed in which he advises that he anticipates trouble in having the Indians supply the wood required in the event of the Caribou Hide School being in operation during the coming winter.\n\nIt is felt that the Indians should have enough interest in the school to supply the wood without cost to the Department.\n\nMr. Reed considers that in appointing a teacher for this school better results would be obtained if a Priest were appointed than if a lay man were secured. Please give this suggestion your careful consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. E. M. Bunoz, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of the Yukon,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 19, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant present regulations do not permit our paying transportation costs of the teacher proceeding to take charge of an Indian school. Under these circumstances favourable consideration cannot be given to allowing $100.00 toward the cost of the transportation of the teacher for the Caribou Hide School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 19th, in regard to the affairs of the Caribou Hide Winter Day School.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Bunoz was interviewed recently; and, whilst every effort will be made to obtain a teacher, yet the remoteness and expense of getting to this point, is a detriment that must be taken into consideration.\n\nBishop Bunoz requested that the Department be asked if they could graciously see their way clear to allowing the cost of a \"chartered\" plane, one way - which expense would be $100.00.\n\nWere this allowed, the School supplies would be forwarded at the same time as the teacher went in, but, failing such assistance, the school material would go in by dog team on the winter trail and the teacher would have to walk in, as the late school teacher, Mr. Angling, has done in previous years.\n\nHowever, as the season is now far advanced and the affairs of a teacher are far from settled, perhaps it might be considered correct not to open this school over the coming winter. In this latter event, Cripple Jimmy, the native school teacher, could carry on, as he had done ere this, and some relief or rations would be granted as a compensation.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Plane spoken of will be that of Mr. G.C.F. Dalziel, which is stationed here for the winter, and can of course make such a trip at a lesser charge than were an out-side plane called in, specially. In this case should the Rev. Fathers decide to open up this school this winter, a limited supply of the school material, now resting here, will be allowed to go out with the Teacher. The cost of such freight will be around 20\u00a2 per lb so that, it is considered about 150 lbs could be allowed to go out to that point. This would be ample material to carry on the school with, taking into account the supplies of last season, now there.\n\nFather Plain can well do this now, having been in the Agency for some time, and now acquainted with the Indians. He can well return with the Indians when they come in with their Spring catch of fur, either on the late \"crust\" or trail in with them, on foot, at a later date.\n\nIt is expected, however that this winter sees the end of the hardships in getting to this point. The new Highway proposed from the South to Alaska proper, is stated, as far as one can learn from this point, to pass right through this area of Caribou Hide, and if so Planes etc will be available at any time, with fares muchly reduced. During the last few days some large Pan-American Planes have passed over head, owing it is stated to the unreliable weather encountered on the S.E. Alaskan Coastal Sea-Route.\n\nThe non-operation of this school up to the present has shown the Caribou Hide Band of Indians what they are missing, in a way it is a very good event to come about, and with the re-opening of this school, better attention and assistance will be received from this rather independent, but admirable, set of Indians.\n\nA later Report will be submitted when the proposed interview with Father Carpentier, has taken place.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nRe: Caribou Hide Seasonal Day School, R.C. Mission.\n\nI beg to submit a Report on the non-operations of the above Winter Seasonal School.\n\nUnder Authority 156-8-1, July 17th 1940 permission was granted to operate the above school during this winter for a period of Four Months. The Salary allowed was at the rate of $110.00, arranged at this advanced rate on account of the inaccessibility of the school's location. The Teacher was to have been nominated at a later date. School supplies were granted and received at this point, and now await forwarding. Also some extras were allowed such as Fuel for light etc.\n\nMuch correspondence has passed on the affairs of this Bush School, perhaps for which its very remoteness is responsible. It will be remembered that Mr Anglin was the Teacher in charge during the winter of 1939-1940, and that owing to some general disorders, a new Teacher was requested. During the summer many attempts were made to definite secure the name of the proposed Teacher from His Lordship Bishop Bunoz, O.M.I., but up to the time of writing; all efforts have failed, and therefore the school has, as yet, not been opened up.\n\nThe location of this school is about 250 miles away from any trading post. This makes travel to such a point a matter for the use of the old Dog-team transportation, not only to arrive at such a point but to also keep oneself in meat etc and be able to move about, if necessary. It calls for an \"outside man of experience who is also a \"teacher\" and will take an unselfish interest in the Indians as a whole - such men are hard to find. His Lordship Bishop Bunoz certainly expects that the Department should send the school supplies in by Air, and at the same time allow the Teacher a free passage. This request was advanced to the Department but under a letter -156-8-1, it was decided that during the War period, and the heavy expenses now being born by the Department, it was impossible to comply with the Bishop's request.\n\nIn a letter recently received from Father Carpentier O.M.I. who is in charge of the Mission's affairs in these parts; and at present at Dease Lake with Father Plain as his assistant, it states that he will be coming into Telegraph Creek around about Xmas time, and then the matter of sending Father Plain out to Caribou Hide will be gone into. He also requests help with the cost of the plane Fare, if used.\nSTIKINE AGENCY\n\nTELEGRAPH CREEK, B.C.\n\nFebruary, 12th, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit, hereunder, a Report covering the Agency's activities over the month of December 1940.\n\nThree such Indians as mentioned above, came in from the Caribou Hide District\u2014200 miles away\u2014and meeting Father Carpentier at the Klappan School location, en route in, mentioned that as a school had not opened up out at their Camp, they were seriously considering coming in to the Klappan School; so that their children might attend that school. Father Carpentier, returning from his short inspection of the Klappan School over the New Year, stated that it would be better for him to send out Father Plain O.M.I. to Caribou Hide at once, as he could now be spared from assisting at the Dease Lake School,\u2014rather than have the Caribou Hide Indians mix up with the Klappan Band.\n\nAs such a movement as that proposed by the Indians is to be avoided at all costs, it was agreed to that Father Plain at once proceed to Caribou Hide and do whatever was possible over the end of this winter. It is expected that he will be able to manage a two and a half months term, at any rate, but will be able to prevent these Indians migrating. Were they to do so, all trapping arrangements would be seriously mixed up, and a loss of revenue result.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

Coudert O.M.I.,\nCoadj. of the Yukon & P.R.\n\nIndian Office April 12th, 1941.\n\nName of Teacher will be arranged during the summer, and then submitted. Harper Reed Indian agent.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Seasonal Day School (winter)\nCARIBOU HIDE, B.C.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a letter from Bishop Coudret, O.M.I., requesting that the above school be allowed to operate during the winter of 1941-1942. Name of Teacher to be submitted later.\n\nThis school's affairs were reported upon under letter dated November 6th, 1940. Since then Father Plaine, O.M.I., has proceeded to the location and opened up the school, from which no reports have yet been received. Also on February 25th, in Atlin B.C., Bishop Coudret was seen and the school's affairs talked over.\n\nIn spite of the difficulties of distance etc., it is considered correct to maintain a school at this point. Firstly, for the sake of the many children, and the decent small band they belong to. Secondly, that if a school is not allowed them, they will all move into the Klappan Day School. Should this come about then our Trapline System of Caribou Hide would suffer from no use, and perhaps taken away by the Game Dept. of B.C., which of course must be avoided at any cost.\n\nOwing again to distance, this school has not yet been properly outfitted - a large heater is required and several other little things that our schools are allowed. Some school material was taken out with the dog-team, but the quantity was small. Practically it calls for the use of a Plane to transport all the material, and perhaps the Teacher, at one and the same time.\n\nHowever, when the present winter season is completed, and Father Plaine comes in with the Indians from their Beaver Hunt, it will then be possible to again take the matter up, and make a further Report to the Department, as to what could be done. By then perhaps, several Planes, will be passing that spot, going either North or South.\n\nBishop Coudret considered this school might be operated in connection with that of the Klappan School, using only one Teacher. The first 3 or 4 months of the season being given to Klappan, and then after Xmas, the same Teacher would move out to Caribou Hide, per dog team. But it is still considered that the heavy material required should go out by Plane, to put this school on its feet, and in working order.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 26, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the Caribou Hide Seasonal School. It is noted that you will communicate with the Department later regarding the operation of this school next winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nRe Carbon Hitle School's need\n\nWhen I reached Carbon Hitle on 15th of February, in the school house, it was as cold as in a camp fire. Indeed the wind was coming from everywhere in the room, even the light was flashing through the walls, may be to help the little windows which do not give enough light inside. The people helped me to think, but it is not easy to keep warm in winter with an old heater kept by an Indian.\n\nTo put on fact the school, I think we need roofing paper; the school is 22 ft. by 20 ft each side of the roof is 22 ft. by 14 ft. The kitchen is 14 ft. by 11 ft. with a flat roof. To warm the room we need a big heater with 12 inches pipe in the school and a little stove with 8-6 inches pipe in the kitchen. To light the room we need 2 more big windows for the school, 2 little windows for the little shop - a gas lamp, a coil oil lamp. An assortment of nails 10 pounds about.\n\nRev. John J. Harris\nThe Department might bring to mind that when this school was originally started, that the Two Brothers Mining Company of Edmonton Alta., commenced mining operations at Two Brothers Lake - some 8 miles to the east of the Caribou Hide Village, and that whilst the mining company were in operation our Indians lived in very good style. However for the last 4 or 5 years the mining operations have ceased, and it would seem that the equipment that is left on their site, is really abandoned. The Indians report that there are a lot of good windows, not uncased, good supply of nails. Many empty Gas Drums. 3 Big Tents (6 stripe) hung up in the old buildings. Some cross cut saws, and a quantity of mattresses, although somewhat by mice, could still be sewn up and made use of. Also they report much crockery, and many odd tools. Whilst the old lumber buildings now falling down, could be used to great advantage, if they could be obtained. It is stated on behalf of our Indians that they have no power will not touch such property until the correct authority is obtained.\n\nHowever, were this possible, it would settle the whole matter in regards to the living conditions of this Band of Indians, and also place their school in very good shape.\n\nTherefore The Deputy Minister of Mines, for the Province of B.C. in Victoria B.C., is being respectfully written to, requesting to know as to the standing of the Two Brothers Mining Coy, and as to if this old property, with its equipment has been placed - up for sale.\n\nIf such could be obtained, or any portion useful, the Teacher would go out a month ahead of time, and keep a record of all material taken, and supervise its removal to the Village Camp.\n\nIt is considered that this school should be placed in operation again next winter, and the period should be for at least four months. The Teachers name cannot be supplied just at present, but with the arrival here of His Reverence Bishop Coudret O.M.I in the near future, this matter will be settled. Perhaps it will be possible to have the Klappen School operated before Xmas, and after that event, the same Teacher might move out-on a beaten trail to Caribou Hide; and finish the season there.\n\nSome freight assistance will have to be allowed to the Indians or who-so-ever can be obtained to freight the school supplies to that point, even if the heavier freight cannot be sent out. The suggestion is made, or rather offered, that the Yukon Southern Airways, now operating a large plane to Fort Ware on the top-end of the Finlay River, be allowed after ditching their Mail at that point; to continue on to here for a full load, with perhaps the Teacher also, and returning to Fort Ware, unload at the Caribou Hide Village, which is directly under their straight-line flight to here. In this way all difficulties would be ironed out.\n\nThe question as to who the Teacher shall be, will be taken up with Bishop Coudret, upon his arrival, and a further report submitted.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Caribou Hide. Winter-school. AFFAIRS.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 26th, 1941, and with the arrival back to here of Teacher Rev Father Plain C.M.I., after closing down this winter school; it is possible to report further details. Submitted herewith is a letter from the Rev Father, whilst his School Reports have been rendered under separate cover, in this mail.\n\nTo bring matters up to date it is mentioned that the Department have been kind enough to allow the following:\nThe yearly School teaching supplies, which have now arrived here, and will await the means of sending them to that far distant location.\nUnder Authority 158-8-5. April 29th 1941 the sum of $36-50 has been granted to purchase a Lamp and various other school building necessities - which are now being obtained; with also an allowance of $20-00 to create a suitable Heater for the School itself. This also is being made up from an Oil Drum etc.\n\nMuch correspondence has passed regarding this School, but with the return of Father Plain, backed by several of the Caribou Hide Indians; who came in to sell fur and obtain some provisions - it is now very evident that this school can be made into a worth-while project - if stood once and for all on its feet, and placed into shape as a going concern.\n\nAs the Department knows, the whole crux of this matter comes down to one of Transportation. It has been utterly impossible to have supplies sent out, so far away. The Indians that come in, have all they can do to move out the bare necessities of life, which comprise for them, some clothing - Tea & tobacco, with a little Flour and sugar. The Teacher, who-ever he is, simply exists on what he can take out on one sleigh, and has to live mostly on meat, as do all the others.\n\nThe Department's kind consideration is again enlisted on behalf of some assistance in the way of transportation and this is really necessary to have the school put in correct shape to operate. After it has once been placed so, then the Teacher can move out and in, by the trail and the little extra in supplies yearly can be taken out by Dog-teams.\n\nTo do this, either a Plane could be chartered, or Indians hired to make the trip by dog-team, but the latter could not transport a Heater or any very large equipment. The costs in both cases would nearly be equal, and run to $100-00 or slightly over.\n\nThe School House roof at present is made out of scolloped small timbers - not very good in cold weather. Roofing paper - Medium weight should be allowed to cover this building - it would be good for many years to come. The Rev Father speaks about some windows, and these also are a necessity. Up to now sheets of glass, set into the logs have done service.\nOttawa,\nJune 26, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant regarding the Caribou Hide Seasonal School.\n\nIt is noted that you have communicated with the Deputy Minister of Mines for the Province of British Columbia with a view to obtaining the material and equipment which was left at the site of the former mining operations on Two Brothers Lake. If unsuccessful in securing this you may purchase a heater and roofing paper. If it is necessary to transport this by plane you may do so although $100.00 appears a large amount to pay for articles which actually will cost much less than the expenditure required for transporting them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Missions arrived for his yearly inspection of the Cassiar. All matters were again gone over with him, and the various Seasonal schools were taken in hand and teachers and supplies arranged for. Later these were reported upon, but it is doubtful just at present if it will be possible to have a teacher go out to the Caribou Hide school. However the Department have been good enough to allow the sum of One hundred dollars towards getting the much needed freight out to that point, and the matter is now receiving attention as to the possibility of engaging a plane for such work. During the interview, some mention was made that a lot of local children were living within the Township during the winter, and did not attend the local Provincial school, and that if the local R.C. Mission could start up a small winter school at this point, many children would certainly attend. It was at once pointed out that should this be entertained matters in the Township would certainly become worse than they are at present; and the object of our Bush Winter schools would be entirely nullified. Eventually His Lordship agreed that such was the case, and it is hoped the matter is settled again, for some time to come. Telegraph Creek is certainly no place for an indian winter school.\n\nHarper Reed.\nIndian agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 26, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received your report dated August 5 and has noted its contents.

Mines & Resources\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 5, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th ultimo the Department will allow an amount of $110.00 a month for a period of four months during the coming winter to allow the continued operation of the Caribou Hide Seasonal School.\n\nI note from your letter that the teacher will be Rev. J. Plaine, O.M.I.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nRev. J. Plaine evidently proposes to operate this winter school the salary for previous years being $110.00 for four months. Agent Reed wrote the Department for authority on August 18th but to date September 27th it has not been granted.\nStikine Agency.\n\nAccording to Mr. Reed, this school was constructed by the Department in 1939 under the direction of the teacher J.A.J. Anglin, who on April 14th, 1940 according to the files made a claim of $195.00 paid out by him for Indian labour and $200.00 for material, a total of $395.00, without authorization, which was submitted to the Department on July 4th, 1940. The Department replying on July 17th, 1940 File 1687-6-1 that the claim could not be entertained for lack of funds. About this time Mr. Anglin enlisted, leaving behind him some unsettled accounts, it being suggested by Father Carpentier on July 14th, 1941 that the Department might entertain payment of the accounts and take over the school, regarding which no action was taken by the Agent. From this it would appear the Church consider that at least they have some claim on the building. I have requested Mr. Sampson to investigate the matter when he visits this outlying Band and report on the matter, with a suitable recommendation. It is presumed that any recommendation would not exceed the amount of Mr. Anglin's claim. I am not in favour of divided ownership of these schools and consider that any claims by the Church on the various schools in this agency should be carefully investigated and extinguished. The Agent should also secure signed resolutions by the various Bands transferring the land occupied, to the Department for the time the schools will be in operation.\n\nNo returns are available regarding attendance at this school and I am unable to make any comment on its continuation. Mr. Sampson will go into the matter carefully and will advise the Commissioner and the Department.\n\nThere are a quantity of supplies in Telegraph Creek to go out to the school. Transportation there is a serious and expensive problem, costing far more than the value of the material.\nIskut Lake Reserve - January 27-1943.\n\nTo Mr. Sampson\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nDear Sir\n\nI send you this present to advise you that I keep Father Plaine at Iskut Lake.\n\nI hate to see Father going to Caribou Hide because beside the hardship of the trip and the living conditions especially touch in an unfinished house, there is a systematic opposition from the chief and a few boys who told me that they don't want Father there and that they would not cut wood for the School, etc.\n\nHere, Father will be a good help for us, for we have to cut wood. I only got 2 cords from Jack Pete, that's all I can expect, and I am not going to spend any more money for wood. I rather like to see all the schools closing down.\n\nIf you ever get a chance to fly over to Caribou Hide, Father would go with you for missionary work, for except the chief and a few boys the rest of the band is the best people in the country.\n\nHere enclosed a letter from Bishop giving confirmation of my appointment as Teacher at Iskut.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Carpentier, C.M.I.\"\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to Departmental letter dated September 5, 1941, in which authority to operate the Caribou Hide Seasonal Day School was granted.\n\nFather Plaine, who was to teach at this school, now informs me that owing to the hardships of the trip in to Caribou Hide and while staying there, his senior priest, Father Carpentier, has persuaded him not to go in to Caribou Hide this winter. Copies of letters from the priests are herewith enclosed.\n\nThere are now only 3 children of school age at Caribou Hide and the attendance of two of the older boys would undoubtedly be poor as they go trapping with their fathers during the winter. Some families move away from Caribou Hide camp entirely when they go trapping and this also makes for poor attendance averages. It is also exceedingly uncertain that any person other than a Roman Catholic priest would be willing to teach at this isolated and distant spot. Under the circumstances I would respectfully suggest the school be kept closed for this winter at least.\n\nThe question of opposition to the teacher by the Indians, as reported by Father Carpentier, will be investigated when a visit is made to Caribou Hide.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR.M.S. Sampson,\nActg. Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nenc. 2\nOttawa,\nFebruary 20, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo in which you advise that the Caribou Hide Seasonal School will not be operated during the present winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson,\nActing Indian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nMONTHLY REPORT\nStikine Indian Agency - January 1942.\n\nCARIBOU HIDE SEASONAL SCHOOL\n\nRev. Plaine, O.M.I. who was appointed teacher for this school, reports by letter from Klappan that he will not be opening the school this season owing to the hardships of the trip, 225 miles by dog-sleigh, and the uncooperative attitude of the Indians. This matter has been reported on separately.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nActing Indian Agent.\nExtract from letter received from Bishop Coudert, dated September 23, 1942.\n\nCariboo Hide Winter Day School\n\nThe winter day school at Cariboo Hide could not be conducted last winter on account of the extreme difficulties of communication with that point and the lack of adequate accommodation. Father J. Plaine, O.M.I., one of our most zealous missionaries, was ready to undertake the task, but owing to inadequate means of transportation, I could not allow Father Plaine, who is not of a very robust health, to undertake again, as he did the previous year, at the peril of his life, a journey of 250 miles on foot in January, in order to reach his school. After the various attempts made during the past five years to conduct a day school at Cariboo Hide during the winter months, we came to the conclusion that no teacher will ever be found to go and teach at such a place unless proper housing accommodation is arranged by the Department and transportation is provided by airplane.\nOttawa,\nOctober 14, 1942.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nI desire to refer to that portion of your letter of the 23rd ultimo in which you mention the Cariboo Hide Seasonal School. Owing to present conditions it is not possible for the Department to consider erecting any buildings at this point in the immediate future. I feel certain that you appreciate the many difficulties under which we are working at the present time, but as soon as conditions improve I hope we will be able to give further consideration to the requirements at this point.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt.

These Indians are Roman Catholics, the number of children is 25.\n\n(Sgd.) Iver Fougner,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 20, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to that portion of your letter of the 3rd instant in which you state that the Indians of the Ulkatcho Band want a day school and that there are 25 children I have to ask you to be good enough to submit a full report upon this request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIver Pounger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of 20 ultimo No. 399275/1, I have the honor to say that the Ulkatcho Indians have expressed a desire to get a school in their village. This village consists of small log-houses and is situated 150 north-east of Bella Coola, on the mountain plateau.\n\nI visited the place in October; nearly all of the Indians, about 60 in number, were then away trapping. I then learned that there were 25 children, 14 boys and 11 girls under the age of 16.\n\nIt is my opinion that these Indians would take greater interest in a school than the coast Indians do; like the latter they are away from their village a great deal, however. They are devout Catholics and are visited once a year in the month of June by their priest, Father Thomas. I do not know how he feels toward the project.\n\nThe school-house ought to contain living-rooms for the teacher also. The houses must be built of logs which are plentiful in the vicinity; to build here would cost a little more than on the coast, as all the lumber needed will have to be sawed by hand labor.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSec., Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 4, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo reporting further upon the request of the Ulkatcho Indians to have a school established in their village.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted that you state that you do not know how the Priest who administers to these Indians, Father Thomas, feels towards the project. Before going any further into the matter it is considered advisable that you should communicate with Father Thomas and obtain his views.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHells Coola, B.C.\nWilliam's Lake Industrial School\n450 Mile House, B.C.\n\nTo Mr. Faugier Esq.,\nIndian Agent at Bella Coola\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour of answering your letter of January the 14th 1912, asking informations as to the project of an Indian school at Elgacho. My excuse for not answering sooner is that I have been away on a several months' holiday to Europe & just come back.\n\nWith regards to that project I think that it is useless to contemplate an industrial or boarding school at that above mentioned place on account of its situation, the nearest Indian reserve, Klastusy lake, being 60 miles away.\n\nWith regards to a day school, the two families able to fill the school live one 40 or 50 mile from Elgacho, at Abraham lake, the other 8 miles away. On a population of 50 souls nobody lives in the village during at least 6 months in the year, the people on account of their poor land & high altitude, having to be absent to make their living.\n\nI sent a few weeks on my annual visit to those people & expect to be amongst them on the 8th of June.\n\nThese are the informations I have the honour...\nWilliam's Lake Industrial School\n150 Mile House, B.C.\n\nTo forward you without any intention of influencing the Dominion Government. Making excuses for not forwarding these informations sooner.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nFather J.M. Thomas\n\nO.M.I.\n\nWilliam's Lake Industrial School\nWilliam's Lake, B.C.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of Jan 4, No.399275/I\n\nI have the honor to state that a letter has now arrived from Father Thomas, which letter is enclosed herewith.\n\nThe priest does not think that a school is needed at Ulkatcho. He will have a chance to discuss this matter with the Indians when he visits them in June.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nLee, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with enclosure from Rev. Father Thomas in reference to the establishment of a school for the Ulkatcho Indians.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Rev. gentlemen's remarks are noted and the Department will await a further report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nAugust 18, 1919.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, in reference to the establishment of a boarding school for the Indians of the Ulgatcho, Kluskus Lake and Ootca Lake Bands.\n\nIn reply to your enquiry as to whether this matter had ever previously considered, I would state that, as far back as 1911, the Indians of the Ulgatcho Lake Band asked for the establishment of a day school. It was thought well at that time to communicate with Rev. Father Thomas, their spiritual adviser, and in a letter dated April 27th, 1912, he stated that he considered it useless to contemplate an industrial or boarding school on account of the location of this reserve, and that a day school was not feasible. No further action was taken in the matter.\n\nAs you know the Department cannot consider any comprehensive extension of the boarding or industrial school system at the present time and it would appear that the missionary was right in stating at that time that a day school was not feasible. The Constable might be asked to report, through your office, as to a day school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nBella Coola B.C.\nJuly 3rd, 1919\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honour to submit my report for the month of June.\n\nChief of Band Ulgatcho, called me to a meeting and asked me to point out to you their urgent need of a school for their children. This band make their livelihood entirely by trapping (men and women alike). They claim that it is very hard on the children to be out all winter moving from camp to camp with their parents. They ask that you give this matter your attention as soon as possible.\n\nYours Faithfully\n\n(Sgd.) Charlie Tucker,\nDom. Constable.\nSir:\n\nI am attaching hereto a copy of a letter received from Constable Tucker of the Bella Coola Agency having reference to the necessity of the establishment of a boarding school for the Ulgatcho, Kluskus Lake and Ootsa Lake Indians. The Ulgatchos are an isolated tribe at the northeastern corner of the Bella Coola Agency close to the corner of the Stuart Lake Agency, where the Kluskus Indian tribe reside on Kluskus Lake. The Indians which Constable Tucker describes as belonging to Ootsa Lake would belong to the Francois Lake tribe, also in the Stuart Lake Agency, as there are no Indian Reserves on Ootsa Lake. These Indians are all Roman Catholics.\n\nI am not aware whether the establishment of a residential school in this section of the country has up to the present time received any consideration by you, but as the only school in the Stuart Lake Agency is located at Fort St. James it would appear that there is a necessity for educational facilities being provided for the Indians of the more westerly portion of the Agency where a large number of new reserves have been allotted by the Royal Commission of Indian Affairs.\n\nI have already written to Constable Tucker explaining that owing to the heavy expenditure incurred by the Government on account of the war the Department has not been able during the past five years to carry out any extensive programme for school construction.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you as to whether or not\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\nnot there is any likelihood of a school being built for the Indians mentioned in the near future in order that I may so inform Constable Tucker.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nBella Coola, B.C.,\nJuly 3rd, 1919.\n\nW. M. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have just returned from a trip to Ulgatcho and in connection therewith I beg to report as follows:-\nI endeavour to visit this place every June arriving there at same time as the priest (Catholic missionary from Williams Lake, who visits Ulgatcho annually arriving there on or about June 10th).\n\nEvery time I have been in the village the Indians have anxiously asked \"When will we have a school here?\" and they want to know what has been done about it.\n\nThis year I promised them I would write direct to the Government--hence this letter.\n\nThey claim that there should be a school for the children of Ulgatcho, Klahukum Lake and Notsa Lake, and a few other small outlying families of Indians, that when trapping (these Indians make their living by trapping) in the winter, it is very hard on the children and mothers, too, to be continually travelling and camping out in the intense cold.\n\nThey were told some years ago that an Agent would be stationed up there and that there would be a school for their children and medicine for them when they needed it.\n\nThere are approximately (according to their count) 75 children in the 3 places above mentioned, the nearest village (Ulgatcho) is 160 miles from Bella Coola and it is impossible to go in from here in the winter. Of course the trip could be made from here but it would mean quite an outlay for extra heavy clothing, snowshoes, etc.\n\nThe Indians feel however, that they should receive more attention and their children some training.\n\nQuite a number of the men are starting to buy cattle this year and they already own large numbers of horses.\n\nThey say their children are like Coyotee and do not know any more, and the older people say they would like to see something done for their children before they (the old ones) die. I have mentioned this matter (verbally) to Indian Agent Fouger and the Indians have (at my suggestion) talked to him about it and probably Mr. Fouger has referred the matter to yourself before, but I promised the Indians this time that I would lay the matter before (as they--the Indians--say) the real Tyee of the Department, asking that something be done for them in this matter.\n\nThey beg that you will interest yourself in this matter and they will be ever grateful to you. They thank you in anticipation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) Charles Tucker.\n\nDominion Constable.\n\nP. S.---The late Inspector Tyson told these people that there was to be an Agency established up in that country after the war.\n\nC. T.\nHagensborg, N.C.,\n6/24/20\nDept. of the Interior,\nIndian Dept.,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nIt has been pointed out to me repeatedly by the Indians of \"Alkatcho\" reserve and surrounding country that they really want to improve their condition. They want a school above all else, but it seems no one has taken this matter up in their behalf, so I promised to write and see what can be done.\n\nCan your Dept. supply them a teacher and school books?\nI know of several \"missions\" in Alta. and also of some in B.C.\n\nIn case you cannot supply these people with a Govt. school, what inducement would you give some religious organization to establish a school among them? These people are very anxious that they have a system of education. They are very industrious and have stock and horses\u2014some have 150 to 200 head of horses and a nice bunch of cattle.\n\nMay I hear from you on this subject? Yours faithfully\n\nJ.W. Hoben\nOttawa, November 16, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd ultimo in further reference to the request of the Indians of the Ulgatcho Reserve for the establishment of a day school for the children of their reserve I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Ditchburn, whom you were informed by official letter of July 8th, last, was requested to furnish a report regarding the matter, has, through press of other duties, been unable to do so. He is again being written to and asked to report on this matter as soon as possible.\n\nI might add that the Department is favourably disposed to the establishment of a school at this point, but, before taking any action, it will be necessary to have full particulars as to the expense involved. As soon as full information has been received you will be advised of the Department's decision in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Hober, Esq.,\nHagansboro,\nB. C.\nOttawa, November 16, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of July 8th, last, in which you were requested to furnish a report regarding the establishment of a day school for the Indians of the Ulgatoho Reserve and to ask if you have been able to obtain the information asked for therein.\n\nA further request has been received from Mr. J. W. Hober, Hagensborg, B.C., in which he states that these Indians are very anxious to have the school started. He furnishes a list of the several heads of families and the number of children of school age in each family, which shows a total of twenty-seven children of school age. He states that the Indians are prepared to supply a good house which can be used for school purposes. It would, no doubt, be necessary to provide the equipment required to fit up a class-room.\n\nThe Department is favourably disposed to this request, but, before taking any action, would be pleased to have a report from you as to whether you consider it advisable to comply with the request. You should also state the expense that would be occasioned to the Department in furnishing the equipment required and what alterations or repairs, if any, would be required to the building, and also what salary it would be necessary to pay to secure the services of a suitable teacher. I should be pleased if you would furnish a reply at as early a date as possible, in order that the Department can decide regarding the establishment of a school on this reserve. As this reserve is in the Bella Coola Agency you would, no doubt, be able to obtain full particulars from Mr. Agent Fouger, if you have not the desired information on hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, November 15, 1920.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nA request has been received for the opening of a day school for the Indian children on the Ulgatcho Reserve and vicinity. This is an isolated point at the north eastern corner of the Bella Coola Agency, close to the corner of the Stuart Lake Agency. These Indians are all Roman Catholics.\n\nApplications for the establishment of a school on this reserve have been received from time to time, and Mr. Inspector Ditchburn, in a report on the matter dated the 23rd of July, 1919, suggested that the children from this reserve might be sent to the Stuart Lake Boarding School. As, however, this reserve is a considerable distance from the site of the new boarding school that is being erected for the Stuart Lake Indians and also as this school is to accommodate 200 pupils and there are more than that number in the Stuart Lake Agency, it would hardly be possible to provide accommodation for the children for the reserve above mentioned in that school.\n\nThese Indians make their livelihood entirely by trapping and claim that it is very hard on the children to be cut all winter moving from camp to camp with their parents. J. W. Hober, who has forwarded the request of the Indians for a day school, states that these Indians are very anxious that a school be established and that they will supply a good building for school purposes. He gives a list of the heads of households and the number of children of school age, which shows that there are 27 children who could attend. At present they are receiving no education whatever.\n\nIf the request for a school at this point is granted it will be necessary to engage a teacher and pay the salary, as well as provide equipment for fitting up the building and the school material necessary.\n\nMr. Hober states that the chief is prepared to pay $30.00 a month for a teacher for his own children. He states that\nthat from this can be judged the anxiety of the Indians of this band to have their children educated.\n\nIn July, last, Mr. Inspector Ditchburn was asked to furnish a further report on the question of a school for this reserve, but, as it is located in an out of the way place, it has, no doubt, not been possible for the inspector to visit this point to make a report.\n\nI would suggest that the matter be referred to Mr. Agent Fougner to furnish a report as to the expenditure that would be required to be made by the Department in fitting up the building and putting it in a satisfactory condition to carry on the work of a day school. If the Indians can supply a suitable building and the cost would not be too great in fitting it up and for equipment, I would recommend that the request of this band for a school be granted.\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nSometime last summer I wrote you regarding a school for some of the Indians in the interior of B.C., i.e., the Indians of Alyatcho reserve and vicinity. Your reply was to the effect that you would send in an inspector to report on this as soon as convenient.\n\nThese Indians are very anxious to have a school established in their midst.\n\nThere was a movement on foot last summer to give the Indians the franchise but was turned down by the Indians\u2014I think the Indians showed good judgment by so doing. The average white man is not sufficiently informed as to the issues before them to vote intelligently so,\nHow can we expect poor ignorant Indians who can neither read or write to use the franchise?\n\nI know of several heads of families among these Indians who have been asking for a school for the past 14 years, but nothing done for them as yet.\n\nI am giving you a list of heads of families who are asking for a school\u2014\n\n| Squinn (Chief) | 3 boys | 1 girl |\n|----------------|--------|-------|\n| Toolin         |        |       |\n| Johnnie        | 3      |       |\n| Cohocker       | 2      | 2     |\n| Capover        |        |       |\n| Leon           | 1      |       |\n| Charlie        | 3      |       |\n| Stillis        |        |       |\n| Elspie         | 1      |       |\n| Turner         |        |       |\n\nTotal 15 27\n\nThese are only children in families and there should be included several young men and their wives that\nwant to attend.\n\nAll these Indians are very industrious and maintain they would be above the \"Coyote\" if they could have the benefit of a school in their midst.\n\nWhat can your department do for these people?\n\nThese Indians will supply a good school house in case of a school being granted.\n\nI feel it is up to the Indian Dept. to educate these people if we expect them to become citizens of our country and know and keep the laws of our land\u2014Don't you?\n\nyours in behalf of a neglected people.\n\nMr. Hobson\n\nP.S. Squint (chief) told me today that he would pay $30.00 per month for a teacher for his own children\u2014so you can see what they value schooling!\n\nJ.M.H.\nOttawa, July 8, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, in which you request that a day school be established for the Indian children of the Ulgatcho Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in the past similar requests were received, but it was, at that time, considered useless to contemplate an industrial or boarding school on account of the location of this reserve and that a day school would not be feasible.\n\nMr. Inspector Ditchburn is being asked to furnish a report to the Department regarding the establishment of a dayschool for the Indians of this reserve and, upon receipt of his report, the Department will then be in a position to again consider the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Hober, Esq.,\nHagensborg,\nB. C.\nOttawa, July 8, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nA communication has been received from Mr. J. W. Hober, Hagensborg, B.C., requesting that a school be established for the Indians of the Ulgaicho Reserve.\n\nPrevious requests have been received for the establishment of a day school for this band and on the 23rd of July, 1919, you furnished a report regarding this matter. At that time it was considered that a day school was not needed.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to have a further report as to the number of Indian children who would be likely to attend, if a day school were established, also whether a suitable building can be secured, or if it would be necessary to erect a building. As full particulars as possible should be given, in order that the Department may have full data to arrive at a decision as to whether it would be feasible to establish a school at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of 16th November, referring to the matter of the construction of an Indian day school on the Ulkatcho reserve, Bella Coola Agency, about which Mr. J. W. Hober, of Hagensborg, B. C., wrote you, I beg to say that from all information I have received on this question and taking into consideration the isolated location of the territory which the Ulkatcho Indians occupy and their nomadic habits convinces me that the establishment of a day school is utterly impracticable and I am of the opinion that the only sound method to pursue with regard to giving the Ulkatcho children an education is by having them placed in the new Industrial school at Fraser Lake as soon as it is opened, which will or should be some time next fall. This was mentioned in a memorandum dealing with the erection of residential schools in British Columbia which was sent to Mr. Scott on the 12th of October last, wherein I referred to the new school at Fraser Lake.\n\nAll correspondence I have had on this matter from late Constable Tucker and Mr. Indian Agent Fougeron go to show that what the Ulkatcho Indians really wanted was some sort of a boarding school in which to place their children while they and their wives were out trapping or hunting; and in a letter from Constable Tucker of 5th September, 1919, he stated that the Indians themselves said a day school would be useless. Agent Fougeron on 2nd September last also informed me that a day school would not be a success. It was at one time thought there were sufficient children in the Ulkatcho, Kluskus Lake and Ootsee Lake bands to warrant the establishment of a boarding school. The latter two bands are in the southern extremity of the Stuart Lake Agency. This was, however, before it was decided to build the new school at Fraser Lake.\n\nThe Ulkatcho village is over 120 miles from Bella Coola by trail. A large portion of the present reserve has been recommended to be cut off by the Royal Commission on account of it being considered to be of no practical use to the Indians and new and more favourable reserves have been recommended for different families scattered over a territory many miles distant from Ulkatcho. A glance at the map on page 284, Vol. I of the report of the Royal Commission, will give you an idea of how impossible it would be for the children to attend a day school at the old village of Ulkatcho if it were desirable to establish one there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6421, file 867-1, part 1)\nOttawa, Nov. 16, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Smith:\n\nYour letter of the 13th instant has received my attention. I have noted that certain Ulkatcho Indians whom you met this summer are asking again for a school and for a reserve in the Bella Coola valley.\n\nRelative to the possibility of securing more land for the Ulkatcho Band, I wish to state that the Department will communicate with our representatives in British Columbia, with a view to determining the merit of such procedure.\n\nI am convinced that a day school for the children of this group of Indians would be a failure, due to the nomadic habits of the tribe. We are making a serious effort to provide better educational facilities for the Indian youth in British Columbia; but there are several centres of Indian population where there is a more pressing need for a residential school than at Ulkatcho.\n\nI have noted that three of the men of the band would like a communication in this connection. I would be grateful if you would direct letters to them giving them the substance of my communication, if you know their post office address. For the time being their children will have to be sent to the Fraser Lake Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nHarlan I. Smith, Esq.,\nDepartment of Mines,\nVictoria Memorial Museum,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 13, 1922.\n\nDr. Duncan Campbell Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nOn July 28th I was near a camp of Indians from Ulkatcho, which was situated on Mud Bay in the Bella Coola valley, about 35 miles above its mouth. Head Chief Squinas of the Ulkatcho Indians, and Charlie West and Alexie, both of Ulkatcho, came to me and requested me to tell the head chief of all the Indians of Canada at Ottawa the following, which they said is what Captain Harry, Stillas, Ulkatcho Johnnie, and Ulkatcho Sill, who were all also of Ulkatcho, would wish to be said were they present. There is no school at Ulkatcho. There are more than 30 children there, some of them 15 years old, some 6, some 5, and some 20. There are also some children at Clasolas Lake. This would make about 50 altogether who would come to Ulkatcho if there was a school there, and more than that would come.\n\nThe land at Ulkatcho is barren and stoney, and soon the beaver will be no more. Every man wants one piece of land in the Bella Coola valley where he can make potatoes. We cannot\nmake potatoes up at Ulkatcho because they die because it is too dry, but we want to be allowed to continue to hunt at Ulkatcho. Each man wants about 40 acres or 60 acres where he can make potatoes and dry salmon and make a house. It is too cold for chickens in Ulkatcho, but in the Bella Coola valley they could be kept. We have tried to keep chickens and they were frozen at Ulkatcho.\n\nSquinas, Charlie, Alexie, Captain Harry, Sill, Sundayman, Ulkatcho Johnnie, Leon, Old John, Stillas, Phelix, 11 men in all, each want land, 440 to 550 acres in all. We want one big land and divide up inside for each head of family. All understand how to irrigate.\n\nWe don't want to send children to Chilliwack school. If we send the children to Chilliwack, the boys and girls get too high toned and think just like white people and don't care for us, and we want to see our children. We want to make potatoes, pigs, chickens, hay, apple trees, cattle and horses.\n\nWe want the head chief of all the Indians of Canada at Ottawa to write to us and send a copy of the letter to each of us three, telling us what he thinks of this matter.\n\nWe hear the fire has burned Charlie's mowing machine and his house and all his winter supplies, but we do not know yet. We want to work where we can catch a living. If we get a rich land and move to it we would not want a school at\nUlkatcho but at the new place. We don't want to have to stay in the potato land. We want to put horses where there is horse feed and hay at Ulkatcho. There is no good land for cattle at Ulkatcho. If we get good land we do not all want so many horses, just enough to work the land.\n\nWe are not the same as the Bellacoola Indians. The Bellacoola Indians have brush all around their houses. If we had such land we would clean it all and fence it.\n\nIf it goes on as it is, it will be the same as if you kill us\u2014no land, no moose, no beaver, we die. We want a place between Canoe Crossing and Stewie, because some of that land is good and not yet taken up by white men. We want enough so that when our children are married they can have land too.\n\nA copy of this letter has been sent to each of the three Indians above mentioned in accordance with my promise to them. They told me that sometimes they do not get their letters, but that if the letter was sent to all three certainly one of them would receive it. They also wish you to send your reply to each one of the three or if you write to me for me to send copies of your letter to each of them. They told me there was practically no white man in their part of the country around Ulkatcho who would write a letter for them to which they could be sure of getting a reply.\nI am also sending a copy of the letter to Mr. Fougner for his information. You and he will appreciate that it is difficult for me to understand exactly what the Indians want and for them to make themselves exactly understood.\n\nI have very kind and sympathetic feelings for these Indians who confide in me and expect my sympathy and help. I understand that they tell me pathetic things which they do not tell to white men as a rule. You will know better than I what can be done.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nHarlan Smith\n\nHIS/CAM\nOttawa, March 14, 1921.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nRequests have been received by the Department for the providing of educational facilities for the children of the Ulcatcho Reserve in the Bella Coola Agency.\n\nMr. Inspector Ditchburn at Victoria, B.C., in a recent report on this matter states that, from the information which he has received and taking into consideration the isolated location of the territory which these Indians occupy and their nomadic habits, he is convinced that the establishment of a day school is utterly impracticable and that the only sound method to pursue as regards giving these children an education is to have them placed in the new industrial school at Fraser Lake as soon as it is open, which it is expected will be sometime next fall. These Indians make their livelihood entirely by trapping and take their children with them.\n\nIt is considered that the best means of providing these children with an education would be to have them placed in the new industrial school at Fraser Lake when it is ready for occupation. I shall, therefore, be pleased if you will keep this matter in mind when the school is ready to open and arrangements can be made through Mr. Agent Fougner, Bella Coola, to have the children taken to the school. The Indians at this point are stated to be Roman Catholics, there being about twenty-five children of school age.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Allard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nFraser Lake Industrial School,\nFort St. James,\nVia Vanderhoof, B.C.\nOttawa, March 14, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 20th of January, last, with regard to the providing of educational facilities for the Indian children of the Ulcatoho Reserve I beg to say that a report on this matter has been received from Mr. Ditchburn, our Inspector at Victoria, B.C., in which he states that, from the information which he has received on this question and taking into consideration the isolated location of the territory which these Indians occupy and their nomadic habits, he is convinced that the establishment of a day school is utterly impracticable and that the only sound method to pursue as regards giving these children an education is to have them placed in the new industrial school at Fraser Lake as soon as it is open, which will likely be sometime next fall.\n\nThe Department considers that it would be useless to start a day school, as the Indians are away from the reserve for lengthy periods, and agrees with the Inspector that the best plan would be to have these children placed in the Fraser Lake Industrial School and the necessary instructions will be given to carry out this arrangement when the school is ready for occupation. The school at Fraser Lake is in course of construction and will provide accommodation for 200 children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nHelen I. Smith, Esq.,\nGeological Survey,\nDepartment of Mines,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 14, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Indians of the Ulkatcho Reserve have requested the establishment of a day school for the children of their reserve. This matter was referred to Mr. Inspector Ditchburn, who reports that, from all information he has received and taking into consideration the isolated location of the territory which these Indians occupy and their nomadic habits, the establishment of a day school is utterly impracticable. He is of the opinion that the best method to pursue with regard to giving these children an education is to have them placed in the new industrial school at Fraser Lake as soon as it is opened, which will likely be sometime this fall.\n\nThe Department considers that this would be the best means of providing for these children and I shall be pleased if you will keep this matter in mind. Should you visit these Indians this summer you should place this matter before them and endeavour to arrange with them to have their children taken to the new school after it opens. The school authorities are being informed that they are to provide accommodation for a number of children from this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIver Feugner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nOttawa, March 14, 1921.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd ultimo furnishing a report regarding the providing of educational facilities for the Indian children of the Ulkatcho Reserve, Bella Coola Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that the best course to be taken in the matter is to have these children placed in the new industrial school at Fraser Lake as soon as it is opened. It would be useless to establish a day school, owing to the nomadic habits of the Indians. Mr. Agent Fouger and the school authorities will be informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nP. O. Box 775,\nVictoria, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the question of providing educational facilities for the children of the Ulcatcho Reserve, Bella Coola Agency, which has recently been drawn to the attention of the Department by Mr. Harlan I. Smith of the Geological Survey, I beg to say that a request for the establishment of a day school on this reserve has been before the Department for several years.\n\nIn November, last, Mr. Inspector Ditchburn was requested to furnish a report regarding the matter. He states that, taking into consideration the isolated location of the territory which the Ulcatcho Indians occupy and their nomadic habits, he is convinced that the establishment of a day school is utterly impracticable. He suggests that the children of this band of school age be placed in the new industrial school, when it is completed, at Fraser Lake. The reserve is over 125 miles from Bella Coola by trail. A large portion of it has been recommended to be cut off by the Royal Commission on account of being considered to be of no practical use to the Indians. These Indians are all Roman Catholics and there are about 15 boys and 12 girls of school age.\n\nAs the Indians are away for long periods hunting and obtaining other means of livelihood, taking their children with them, it would be useless to establish a day school, and I think the recommendation of Inspector Ditchburn that the children be placed in the school at Fraser Lake when it is open would be the best means of providing for their education. The new school which is in the course of erection at Fraser Lake will provide accommodation for 200 children and the school authorities should be informed that they should make provision for taking in the children from the Ulcatcho Reserve. If you agree with this arrangement Mr. Smith, Mr. Ditchburn, Mr. Fougner and the school authorities should be informed accordingly.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG IC, Volume 6421, file 867-1, part 1)\nOttawa, March 8, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Smith:\n\nI have read, with much interest, your letter of the 20th of January, last, with regard to the educational requirements of the Indian children of Uleatcho. I have submitted the question to our Schools branch, for a report, and I may assure you that the matter will receive the most careful consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nHarlan I. Smith, Esq.,\nGeological Survey,\nDepartment of Mines,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 20, 1921.\n\nMr. Duncan Campbell Scott,\nActing Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nPooth Building,\nCity.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nWhile I was at Bella Coola last summer, Mr. Adolphe Christiansen, store-keeper, and one of the two leading men of Bella Coola, told me that the Indians of Ulcatcho were in need of schooling, and that sometimes when he was there buying furs and the weather was bad he held a little school for their benefit. He told me that something should be done about getting schooling for these Indians.\n\nI do not know exactly where these Ulcatcho Indians live, or how many are close enough together to be served by one school. There were a number of Indians generally known as Stick Indians, most of whom I believe were Carriers, who came to Bella Coola and stayed perhaps a month and a half. Some of them worked at haying while they were there for the white people, but I think most of them were concerned chiefly with getting their winter supplies, and incidentally perhaps making their visit long in order to escape the flies which are said to be very bad in their country in the middle of the summer.\nBy flies they mean to include mosquitoes.\n\nCharlie West, a very decent Indian who worked for me by the hour, and is known perhaps better under the names \"Handsome Charlie\" and \"Pretty Charlie\", told me several times that they wanted a school for their children. He asked me not to talk Chinook Jargon to him, as he did not understand much of it, and as he wanted to learn English. He told me several times he wanted me to teach him English. He said he came from Ulcatcho, but exactly where he meant by that I do not know, as I think the Indians who came to Bella Coola were from scattered places in the vicinity of Anahim Peak. It was pitiful to me to see how keenly he wanted to have schooling for his family, and I was told he was a very steady worker. He certainly was a good worker for me, and he asked me to employ him if I ever came there again.\n\nCapoose, who is supposed to be an Ulcatcho Indian, and certainly is a man of considerable wealth, also told me that his people needed schooling. He talked of this constantly, asking my advice as to how he could get appointed as a school teacher. He said he understood the Indians and was smart, and could teach them in a way so that they would learn in a very short time. He is a smart man, but I am not sure but what he may be a bit tricky. He is one of the most\npeculiarly smart Indians I ever met in a sly sort of way so much so that I suspect that he may not be pure blood.\n\nMr. Huber, who is the only man living at Firvale\u2014\nI do not know that there is a postmaster there now and believe they get their mail by rural delivery from Bella Coola, and mail addressed to him at Firvale or Burnt Bridge would reach him\u2014asked me what could be done about schooling for the Indians of the Interior who came to Bella Coola. He referred to these Ulcatcho Indians as I understood him. He wanted me to do whatever I could at Ottawa for them. He called to me especially for this purpose. He said it was a shame that these Indians who wanted education had no opportunity to get it.\n\nYou could get more exact information regarding the situation from these gentlemen or from Mr. Faugner, the Indian Agent at Bella Coola. I did not talk with Mr. Faugner about the matter. He would certainly give you his honest opinion and truthful information, although my impression is that he thinks the Indians are more or less hopeless.\n\nFrom what I saw of these Indians, I think they are rather better off than any other Indians I have seen in regard to economic conditions. They are apparently workers. I understand their country is one where ranching, cattle and horse raising will be rapidly taken up. I understand some of\nthese Indians have a large number of horses and considerable money. I trust a way may be found to relieve them in this matter of education for their children. I feel they do not know how to make their cry heard as far as Ottawa, and that they feel it is not much use asking the white man for things, although they would be quick enough to ask Christiansen and such other white men as they meet and know to be their friends.\n\nIf nothing better could be done, a school during the time that they visit Bella Coola at that place would at least give them something. I suppose Mr. W.H.Gibson at Bella Coola could give you full information as to what could be done for them there and about them, although I do not know that he has ever been up in their country, which is between one and two hundred miles away. I hope to continue work the coming summer at Bella Coola, and to again meet these Indians, and I should be very glad to carry them some good message in regard to this matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIS/CAM\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6421, file 867-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nMr. Marlan I. Smith of Ottawa has sent me a copy of a letter dated November 13, 1928, addressed to Dr. Duncan Campbell Scott, Deputy Sup't General, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nI will reply to this at once, as I shall be busier later on, and away from the office, on a lengthy trip up the coast.\n\nThe matter of a school at Ulkatcho has previously been thoroughly weighed by our Department; and the decision arrived at is that a day school at Ulkatcho would not be a success, as the Indians are at home in the village for only brief periods at a time. There are not enough children for a boarding-school, and arrangements have been made that Ulkatcho children be admitted to the Catholic boarding school at Fort Fraser. These Indians are all Catholic.\n\nIt is true that the old Indian reserve at Ulkatcho is practically all waste land. It is rocky highland plateau, mostly covered with jack pine, and at such an altitude that it is subject to summer frosts. This was pointed out to the Royal Commission for B.C. Indian lands, and this Commission cut away the greatest portion of the old reserve, and recommended several pieces of meadow land in its stead. We did not get what we wanted; but it was the best that could be done, under the circumstances, as the Government did not wish to buy land from private individuals or companies; only Government land was available.\n\nWhen these Indians now, through Mr. Smith ask for land, where they can grow potatoes, in the upper part of the Bella Coola valley, this may seem a fair and reasonable proposition. Whether it would work out well is problematical and unknown. We can to some extent see into the unknown, by looking at the nearest related known. Some years ago Frank Sill, and Capoose, two of the wealthiest, and most enterprising of the Ulkatcho Indians bought land from white settlers in this part of the valley. The land had houses, and clearings; the houses are not kept in repairs, and the land that once was cleared is growing up with brush. The land is used for pasture by the Indians on their travels between Ulkatcho and Bella Coola. We believe Capoose's wife has raised a few acres of potatoes on their land; these they carried up to Ulkatcho or neighboring country on horseback; here are no wagon roads. They camp at these places, and catch salmon for their winter supply.\n\nDr. D.C. Scott, Deputy Sup't General,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\nSome of these Indians are no doubt poor, and have received relief from our Department; one is totally blind, and our Department is supporting him. On the other hand some are quite wealthy. To support this, I can relate that in the summer of 1921, Frank Sill and his wife came into this office. Sill said he had some money that he wanted me to look after for him. I promised that, and his wife pulled out from her bosom the sum of $3000.00, and handed to me. Of this I deposited $1000.00 in the Bank of Montreal, and bought Saving Certificates for $2000.00. These amounts are yet untouched, and the bank pass book, and the certificates are kept in this office.\n\nAs to the concluding paragraph of the letter I may say that Mr. Smith is very much interested in the Indians, and kindly disposed to them. This feeling, no doubt is reciprocated by the Indians. But Mr. Smith is an archaeologist, and therefore it is not unreasonable to believe that he knows more of the dead Indians than of the living ones. Our Department has to deal with the living ones, and to do that in the best manner is not altogether an easy task.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola Agency.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of March 22 addressed to Indian Commissioner MacKay with reference to the erection of a school at Anaham Lake for the Ulkatcho Indians.\n\nIt was not found possible to include an item in our current year's appropriation for the erection of a school at this point. I might add that the last request that we received from the school for these Indians was made in the year 1923. At that time it was considered that the Indians were so nomadic that it was undesirable to attempt to conduct a school.\n\nI would appreciate receiving further information regarding this band stating the number of children of school age. Have any of them recently attended the Lejac Residential School or any other Residential School conducted under Roman Catholic auspices?\n\nWould it not be possible to secure the lumber, window sash etc. at some point closer to the site of the proposed school than Vancouver? On receipt of your reply the matter will receive further consideration and it may be possible to secure from some unallotted funds the amount necessary to erect the building this summer but no provision was made for the salary of a teacher. You might let me know what salary you consider should be paid at this point in the event of its being decided to open a school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.

The houses are poorly constructed, with little or no furniture. It is at this place that I hope to have a day school established. The Indians have agreed to make a start this year by getting out the logs. My chief reason for this visit was to select a site for the school.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nAgent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 1, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo with reference to the establishment of an Indian Day School on the Ulkatcho Reserve.\n\nIt is noted from the fifth paragraph of your letter that the Indians are willing to begin work on the building this fall. Provided they do so you may allow groceries at a cost not exceeding $100.00. These should be issued as ordinary relief and when forwarding the vouchers you should attach pay lists receipted by the Indians who do the work. These pay lists should show the number of days employed and the rate per day.\n\nIt is noted that when preparing your estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40 you will include the amount required for the necessary lumber and for the teacher's salary for the fiscal year 1939-40. You should make a special note in your estimates referring to the date and file number of this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: School for Ulkatcho Indians.\n\nSince writing my letter of March 22nd, I have had several meetings with the above mentioned Indians. They are very desirous of having a school, and after listening to their various arguments, I consider that Ulkatcho would be a more practical place for the school than at Anaham Lake, as previously suggested. Ulkatcho is the home reserve of the majority of the Indians of this Band. They are willing to cut the logs and erect a building 16 by 24 feet, if the Department can supply the lumber for floors, ceiling, shingles etc. They further agree to leave the children with their mothers at Ulkatcho for five months in the winter.\n\nThere are twenty-five children of school age at Ulkatcho, none of whom have been to any Residential School. There are also a number below school age. The Priest informs me that the teacher, who must be a man, could board with the merchant there, Mr. John Ward. In view of the high cost of living in that district, I would recommend that the teacher's salary be not less than $100 per month.\n\nThere are also fourteen children of school age at Anaham Lake who could not be accommodated in a school placed at Ulkatcho. I believe that later it might be possible to employ the same teacher for five months at Ulkatcho and five months at Anaham which is forty miles from Ulkatcho, if a suitable building could be secured there.\n\nI am writing Mr. Indian Agent Taylor asking if it would be possible to purchase the necessary lumber and material at Willows Lake, and the cost. I will advise the Department later as to this.\n\nThe Indians are willing to begin work on the log building this fall, after having. I recommend that the Department sanction this and also that they be allowed $100 worth of groceries, as their food supplies are very poor. If this can be done, I will make provision in my estimates for the necessary lumber etc., and teacher's salary, so that the school can be completed in the spring of 1939 and be ready to open in November, 1938.\n\nI shall be going in to Ulkatcho early in September, and I should like to be able to inform the Indians if the Department will give them food supplies so that they can begin to work this fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

F. MacKinnon will not be available this year for the operation of the above noted school.\n\nIf Archbishop Duke is able to select a fully qualified teacher for this school, preferably a man capable of providing vocational instruction, the Department will be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $100 per month. In addition to this salary, of course, the teacher will this year receive the cost-of-living bonus. I regret to state that it is not possible, under existing regulations, to pay the travelling expenses of a teacher to and from an Indian day school.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter dated April 25, 1941, received by the Department from Mr. MacKinnon. The subject matter of this letter may explain why we have this year lost the services of a very capable teacher. The delay, it would appear, in forwarding the cheque to which Mr. MacKinnon refers was due to his failure to send forward the return. This return, which came through the agency office, was not signed by the Agent until March 31. This is a matter in respect to which I have very deep convictions. I have simply no patience with rules or regulations that prevent the prompt payment of men or women serving the Department.\n\nEncl.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nin the outlying districts. I am anxious, therefore, that you should discuss this matter with Inspector Barry or with Inspector Coleman, or both of them, and let us have a recommendation in respect to ways and means whereby the return of these reports might be expedited. It is certainly not a source of satisfaction to me to be associated with administrative effort that prompts a teacher to write a letter such as the one received from Mr. MacKinnon.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn Departmental letter 162-17-1 of October 2, 1940, approval was given for the operation of a seasonal school under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church at Ulkatcho, Bella Coola Agency, for the period November 1, 1940, to February 28, 1941. Further, the appointment of Mr. Colin Francis MacKinnon as teacher of this seasonal school was approved at a salary of $90.00 per teaching month.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter No. 7-11-1 dated October 2, 1941, received from Mr. Indian Agent Christie with reference to the above seasonal school.\n\nOwing to the distance of Ulkatcho from Bella Coola or Williams Lake, the cost of living is considerable and I am inclined to agree with Mr. Christie that a salary of $100.00 per teaching month might well be allowed should it be decided to operate a seasonal school at that point for a period of four months from November 1, 1941. An allowance of $50.00 towards the travelling expenses of the teacher in getting to and from his school might well be considered by the Department.\n\nInspector Barry informs me that the services of Mr. MacKinnon will not be available during the next academic year. Should the Department decide to continue the seasonal school at Ulkatcho, a procedure which I would strongly recommend in view of the success of the school last year, His Excellency Archbishop W.M. Duke will be asked to nominate a suitable teacher to carry on the work so ably commenced by Mr. MacKinnon. I should be glad to have the Department's decision in this matter by air mail if possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nBella Coola, B. C.\nOctober 2nd, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn case no provision has yet been made for a teacher for the Ulkatcho Seasonal School, I would recommend that His Excellency Archbishop Duke is asked to provide a teacher so that school can start on November 1st, 1941 for a period of four months.\n\nLast year, when school opened here for the first time, Mr Colin F. MacKinnon proved to be a very successful and conscientious teacher and every effort should be made to obtain his services for the coming session.\n\nIt should be understood, however that the cost of living at Ulkatcho, where everything has to be hauled and packed for 200 or 300 miles from the nearest wharf or railhead, is much higher than at any other Reserve in this Agency. I would recommend that the teacher's salary at this point is raised by $10.00 per month and an extra $50.00 should be allowed to provide for part of the expenses he incurs for car hire and packhorses to get in and out.\n\nIf Mr MacKinnon's services can not be secured, no doubt His Excellency Archbishop Duke will do his best to secure a satisfactory teacher for Ulkatcho.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver, B.

Since then I have received neither a letter of acknowledgement nor the salary, now two months overdue.\n\nDo you really consider this a fair procedure? I am in mind of my difficulty all through in trying to get payment from you for a mere four months' work. You are, of course, aware that there is a deadline set for the federal income tax. One is subject to a fine, if the tax is not paid, or if insufficient care is taken in filling out the forms. It is the government which makes these regulations. Yet your department, part and parcel of the same government, with consummate indifference, allows a man's salary to go unpaid for two months, and in the face of requests for payment.\n\nI am afraid I do not understand your methods. It cannot be that you are not informed. I never before saw so much stationery used in the prosecution of a simple job. It would seem that your irregular way of conducting business reflects a disorderly house.\n\nOnce more I exhort you to attend to this matter. I would be pleased to receive a line acknowledging receipt of my letters.\n\nSincerely,\n\nC. F. MacKinnon\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. MacKinnon, reports the children bright, academically and that they have become much more presentable and clean since School started. The Anaham Lake Indians who form part of the Ulkatcho Band are becoming increasingly noisy about a school for their children and I consider it would be a worthwhile idea for the Department to run another 4 months School at this point. Mr. MacKinnon should teach at Anaham Lake after the school closes at Ulkatcho since the Anaham Lake Indians are better off and do not leave home during the summer months. A separate report has gone in on this project.\n\nWm Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

MacKinnon as teacher of the Ulkatcho Seasonal Indian Day School, Bella Coola Agency, I may say that Mr. MacKinnon has now received detailed instructions from Inspector Barry with regard to the academic work to be undertaken at this seasonal school.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of the above quoted Departmental letter, I would recommend that Mr. MacKinnon's salary cheque be forwarded to him in care of the Indian Agent, Bella Coola, B.C., at the end of each month.\n\nMr. MacKinnon has been instructed to complete and return the usual staff questionnaire in due course.\n\nI should be glad if the Department would forward direct to the Ulkatcho Seasonal Indian Day School in care of the Indian Agent at Bella Coola any text-books and school room material that may be considered necessary, if this has not already been done, having in mind that most if not all the children will be beginners in Grade 1.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

He should forward the usual returns showing the names of the pupils, days taught etc. You might let me know later if you consider his cheque should be forwarded at the end of each month or if we should wait until the conclusion of his term of employment.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaire which he should complete and return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer you to Departmental letter 162-17-1, dated July 17, 1940, with reference to the establishment of a seasonal Indian Day School at Ulkatcho, Bella Coola Agency.\n\nHis Excellency Archbishop Duke of Vancouver has suggested the appointment of Mr. Colin Francis MacKinnon, 4619 West 7th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C., as a suitable teacher for the Ulkatcho Seasonal School from November 1, 1940, to February 28, 1941.\n\nCaptain Barry informs me that Mr. MacKinnon is twenty-five years of age, has passed his Senior Matriculation Examination in British Columbia, having been educated at Vancouver College (Christian Brothers), and St. Mary's College, Brockville. He later spent two years with the Benedictine Fathers at Mount Angel, Oregon, and Ladner, B.C. It appears, in fact, that he completed his course in Philosophy during the present year but he has not made up his mind so far to proceed with a course in theology.\n\nWhile Mr. MacKinnon has not had the benefit of a Normal School training, he understands simple first-aid and can instruct in manual training.\n\nInspector Barry suggests that as the teacher at the Ulkatcho Seasonal Day School will only be required for a period of four months during the present academic year, the fact that Mr. MacKinnon is not in possession of a teaching certificate might well be overlooked. He appears to the Inspector to be otherwise well qualified for the work to be\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nundertaken at Ulkatcho and he has been highly recommended by the Catholic Church authorities.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that Mr. Colin Francis MacKinnon be given a temporary appointment as teacher of the Ulkatcho Seasonal Indian Day School. I should be glad to receive, in due course, the Department's decision in this matter and also confirmation of the salary to be allowed which, it was stated in the Department's letter above quoted, would be at the rate of $90 per teaching month for a four month period.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nGHB:GR\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 31st last, regarding the Ulkatcho School as a seasonal one for three or four months during the summer of 1940-41, I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter dated the 21st ultimo from Mr. Indian Agent Christie in this connection.\n\nI am of the opinion that it would be useless to attempt to operate the school during the summer months, as the Indians concerned are scattered over a very extensive territory in connection with their cattle and haying operations, and it would not be possible to bring the children together without impairing their means of livelihood, other than during the winter months when the cattle are on the winter grounds for feeding.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nfor D.

It is understood from your letter of June 6th that a school building has been erected and is now ready for occupation. It was understood also from letter dated August 10th, 1938, from the former Agent, Mr. Gillett, that when this school was opened it should be conducted under Roman Catholic auspices as the Indians of that Band are members of that religion.\n\nIn the current year's Appropriation it was found possible to include an amount of $360 for the salary of a teacher at this point. If you approve the operation of this school during the coming winter, please consult the Roman Catholic Church authorities with a view to obtaining a teacher. The amount of money available will permit the employment of a teacher for a period not exceeding four months at $90 a month.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Indian Agent Christie in order that he may be aware that the matter has been referred to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief Training Division.\n\nMr. D.

Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 20, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is noted that in your report for the month of October you refer to the establishment of a school on the Ulkatcho Reserve. In this connection I would refer you to a letter written by the former Agent, Mr. Gillett, dated August 10, 1938, also my reply of September 1, 1938. Please let me know if the Indians did the work that Mr. Gillett stated they were prepared to do.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Wm.

In my opinion, a school is very badly required, as very few of these Indians can read or write, and there has been much confusion in the past in their dealings with one another and white traders. A teacher in this community, of the right calibre, would be of inestimable help in many ways as he might easily be a much needed link between the agent and the native population, when it is only possible to visit this district once or twice a year, owing to the slow and expensive means of transportation.\n\nWm.

Penland, of 3960 West 36th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C., whom I am glad to recommend as a teacher for the Indian Day School at Ulkatcho.\n\nMr. Penland, while not an accredited teacher, has his High School and could teach the elements to the children at Ulkatcho very well. He will be very good at the vocational work, carpentry, care of boats and engines, gardening and painting, at all of which he has worked and has a practical experience.\n\nAt the present time it is difficult to find a man of this type available and I believe Mr. Penland will discharge the duties in connection with this position to the satisfaction of all concerned.\n\nWith kind personal regards, I beg to remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nW.M.

I will advise you later regarding additional payments.\n\nI attach staff questionnaire but National Defence Tax form and cost-of-living bonus form cannot be supplied at the present time due to the following information received from Indian Commissioner MacKay:\n\n\"These forms have been sent to him direct at Anaham Lake P.O., as to send them through the Indian Agent would involve an additional delay of two or three weeks.

Penland, teacher of the Ulkatcho Seasonal School, I enclose herewith Mr. Penland's letter of the 16th instant and cost of Living Bonus form which has been completed by him. It will be noted that this form has not been declared to. Owing to the remoteness of the school it would involve a very considerable journey on Mr. Penland's part, and probably the closing of the school for, at least, a week to enable him to reach the nearest person competent to take his declaration.

Detailed reports on the progress and teaching standards have been submitted to Commissioner MacKay. From reports received to date, there are no teachers in sight for either of the two rooms at Kitamaat or for the seasonal school at Ulkatcho. In connection with the latter, this building and the teachers quarters should be insulated before a new teacher is appointed.

Provision has been made to open two rooms at Bella Coola this fall, and negotiations to open a third room at Bella Bella are proceeding. The school at Upper Deen River is almost ready to open, that at Ulkatcho will remain closed. For Kitimat, we have the application of Gordon Robinson to teach this fall. He has Normal School this past winter and did very well indeed. His work at Kitimat will be watched with very real interest.\n\nP.

Holidays observed were Nov. 11th, and two half days when sickness was prevalent. These days were the morning of Dec. 4 and the afternoon of Dec. 22nd. The attendance is satisfactory, the aggregate being made by the majority of the students. They all understand English to a greater or lesser degree now and some are losing their timidity in trying to make progress. Progress has been arrested by the number of late starters who necessarily retard the class. Six pupils (x) are learning with fair success to read and write; more will follow them in a short while.\"\n\n**No. of pupils on Register**: 18\n\n**Aggregate attendance during Quarter**: 421\n\n**No. of school days in Quarter**: 46\n\n**No. of days in Quarter school was open**: 34\n\n**No. of holidays in Quarter**: 9\n\n**Average attendance during Quarter**: 12.38\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Marks for conduct: A, good; B, fair; C, bad.

C.\nFebruary 6th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to transmit the Ulkatcho Seasonal School Return for the quarter ending December 31st, 1940.\n\nMr MacKinnon's return was not filled out in accordance with the Department's instructions, since he is apparently somewhat confused regarding the number of school days in quarter. In the days absent column he apparently took into consideration the date each pupil started school.\n\nIn view of the fact that considerable time might elapse if I return this form for correction, I have taken the liberty of filling it out as it should be done. A copy will be sent to Mr MacKinnon pointing out his mistakes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm.

Six of them marked x can read a bit and can do the first 10 addition facts.\n\nThere is with the exception of two marked v can read very little and are just beginning to add. The two v are very backward as yet.

The lateness of opening was due to the difficulties of travel and transport.

It reads well and others are showing signs of keen interest and progress. All were eager but discipline was difficult in the beginning; this difficulty however was overcome. Much of the previous work had been forgotten, but it was regained and further progress made.

F. MacKinnon, teacher of the Ulkatcho Seasonal School, should be sent in care of the Indian Agent at Bella Coola, B.C.\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre Colin F. MacKinnon, teacher at Seasonal Indian Day School at Ulkatcho, B.C.\n\nI have just received a letter from the above-named Colin F. MacKinnon who is my son, and after talking with Capt. Barry, the inspector here, am writing regarding my son's monthly cheque.\n\nIt will be quite useless to send the cheques anywhere but to my address, 4619 - W. 7th Ave., Vancouver, B.C.; the reason being that where my son is teaching is sixty miles over mountain trail from the nearest post office of Anahim Lake. Even at Anahim Lake there is no Bank or other institution where he could negotiate his cheques. So if you send them here I can deposit them to credit of his own account with a Bank here. Meantime I have to keep him supplied with food, etc., which is practically unobtainable at Anahim Lake and absolutely unobtainable at his station, Ulkatcho.\n\nAs the authorities here are not at all conversant with this place, Ulkatcho, I imagine you are without information concerning it and may be glad to have something on file. It is not shown on any map, I think; but if you will look at the map you will find Anahim Lake shown about 75 miles inland (East) from Bella Coola which is on the coast and is a steamer port of call for Union Steamship Co., steamers running between Vancouver and Prince Rupert. Not far from Anahim Lake you will notice Kleena Kleene. Now the way to get into Ulkatcho (and the way mail goes in) is from Williams Lake via stage westward to Kleena Kleene, thence by another stage from Kleena Kleene to Anahim Lake where the postal service ends. From there it must depend upon a trapper or other person who may be passing through. Mail cannot reach the abovenamed places via Bella Coola; and Ulkatcho is inaccessible from Bella Coola.\n\nThe teacher informs me that, at date of his letter Nov. 24th, he was waiting for lumber, etc., for making desks and other equipment to come from Anahim Lake. He was using tarpaper for blackboards, and remarked it was quite serviceable. He remarked (and I think one can appreciate the truth of it) that it is \"no softie's job.\" He says the children are quite bright and already he has accomplished almost what the department lays down for the half year's work. Some of the prices of necessaries he mentions as follows: potatoes 10\u00a2 per lb.; condensed milk 25\u00a2 per can; coal oil $1.50 per gallon.\nOttawa,\nDecember 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the salary of your son who is teaching the Ulkatcho Indian Seasonal School.\n\nIn making payments to your son the cheques will be drawn in his favour and sent to the address given in your letter; namely, 4619 W. 7th Ave., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

MacKinnon - teacher at Indian Day School at Ulkatcho, B.C.\n\nI wrote you early in December with regard to the salary cheques for the abovenamed teacher (who is my son) sent to my home address, 4619 West 7th Ave., Vancouver. My letter was acknowledged by you.\n\nMy letter had reference particularly to cheques for months subsequent to November as I assumed the November cheque would have already been mailed. I now learn from my son that he has not received his first, or any, cheque. Neither have I.\n\nThe non-receipt of cheque for month November is causing great inconvenience to both of us; I have advanced monies to pay for supplies, food &c. in the confident expectation that I would have been reimbursed long ago. Will you be so good as to have a tracer started, particularly on the November cheque, but also on the December one which I believe should have arrived before now.

MacKinnon as teacher of the Ulkatcho Seasonal School. In the Agent's report for the month of November he stated that Mr. MacKinnon began duties on November 3.\n\nRecently I received a letter from Mr. MacKinnon's father -- F.J. MacKinnon, Merchandise Broker, 635 Richards St., Vancouver -- in which he pointed out that he was sending supplies to his son and requested that a cheque for his services for November and December be forwarded to Vancouver so that it could be deposited in the bank to his son's credit. A cheque for $180.00 is, therefore, being drawn in favour of C.F. MacKinnon and sent to F.J. MacKinnon at the above address. This amount covers his salary for November and December, 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

Penland, teacher of the above school.\n\nMr. Penland should not be paid after March 15, 1942, unless you receive further instructions from this Branch.\n\nWhile his salary cheque should be drawn in his favour, it should be forwarded to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Dunbar Street Branch, Vancouver, B.C., for deposit to credit of account P 584.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nNovember 19, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, the Department approves the appointment of Mr. Leo Marston as teacher of the Ulkatcho Seasonal School. He will be allowed salary at the rate of $100.00 a month for the period December 1, 1942, to April 30, 1943. You should forward the usual forms.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa,\nMarch 10, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Ulkatcho Seasonal School\nNo. 867\n\nMr. Leo Marston has been appointed teacher of this school and is stated to have begun duties on January 15, 1943, at a salary of $100.00 a month. It would be appreciated if you would pay him for the period January 15 to February 28, 1943, both dates inclusive. I enclose copy of letter of appointment.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nMay 31, 1943.\n\nMr. T.A. Levelton, Acting Indian Agent, Bella Coola, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, and it is noted that you are retaining the cheque which was sent in payment of Mr. Marston's salary as teacher of the Ulkatcho Seasonal School for the month of April. As soon as you receive definite information regarding the date on which Mr. Marston gave up duties you should return the cheque, if Mr. Marston did not teach for the full month of April. At that time you should state the exact date on which he closed the school and a new cheque will be issued for the amount due him.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 27, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Ulkatcho Seasonal Indian Day School, No. 667.\n\nIt was understood that this school would continue in operation until the end of April, 1943, and consequently it was requested that a cheque for the month of April be issued to the teacher. The school actually closed on April 8 and when the Agent received the cheque for the full month of April (cheque 058160) he returned it to your office. This should be deposited.\n\nAs the matter stands now, Mr. Marston has been paid to March 31, 1943, and there is still due him payment of two days' salary for the period the school was in operation during April.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| CENTRAL REGISTRY | P.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith the following Vouchers received from Mr. Indian Agent Christie, of the Bella Coola Agency, with regard to the construction of the Ulkatcho Indian Day School:-\n\nMaterial:-\nVr. 342 - Stanley Dowling.................. $60.50.\n\" 345 - Sam Sulin.......................... 9.00\n\nLabour:-\nVr. 348 - A.

Dowling account for $23.25 is for hauling desk material and could not be considered as unauthorized, as it was lumber, etc., shipped on order of this Office to the nearest point to the School.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nRegarding the balance of $171.90, it would appear to me that the point is that this material and labour were so obviously necessary that their need should have been anticipated and authority secured for the expenditure, as it is difficult to see how the teacher could have been expected to conduct a school in this wild and remote district without some semblance of living quarters. However, as the Department is aware, it involves a long and difficult trip with pack-horses for the Agent to visit this point and, consequently it is not easy for him to give these matters the close supervision that is possible with more accessible areas in his Agency.\n\nIf funds are available during the current fiscal year, I would recommend approval of the accounts, as this educational venture is already proving of considerable value, considering the comparatively small amount expended so far.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed are vouchers for material for Ulkatcho School, supplies issued to Indians for freighting and for construction of seats and desks.\n\nAlso enclosed is my letter in duplicate replacing former letter same file No. 71/7411. The Sullin account should be for 300 feet of lumber instead of 500 feet as formerly. It appears 500 lineal feet was supplied which amounts to approximately 300 board feet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nEnc.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour file 15/2/9641\nRe Ulkatcho Seasonal School.\n\nYour letter of the 16th instant with Mr. MacKinnon's letter to the Commissioner of January 3 enclosed is acknowledged.\n\nThe completion of the teacher's residence at Ulkatcho has given me some concern and it was my intention to ask for the necessary authorization to complete the building as soon as possible since the Priest's house was not a suitable building and in poor condition.\n\nAccordingly I made arrangements with the Indians to haul in this lumber but told them they would have to wait until they heard further from the Department, with the exception of one team to convey lumber for seats and desks which had already been delivered at Anaham Lake by Stanley Dowling.\n\nAfter my return from Ulkatcho I phoned Englebretson to get his quotation on the lumber but was informed that they had no lumber on hand and would not be able to supply any until March. In these circumstances there did not seem much to be done about it.\n\nHowever, while I was at Vancouver three Indians with sleighs came down to Anaham Lake and succeeded in getting 1,000 feet of lumber from Stanley Dowling, also a stove with a drum oven which is also necessary for the teacher.\nDowling phoned Mr. Levelton about supplying the Indians with food and some clothes which they required, in lieu of wages for hauling in these supplies. Mr. Levelton informed me that he did not give Dowling any such permission. Taking into consideration that these supplies to complete the teacher's residence were urgently required and also the fact that the Indians would have had over 120 miles round trip for nothing I am of the opinion that Dowling used good judgement.\n\nThe following expenses have been incurred:\n\n**From Stanley Dowling**\n- 1,000 feet of lumber F.O.B. Anaham Lake $30.00\n- 8 bundles shingles 10.00\n- 1 camp stove 13.00\n- 1 drum oven for stove 5.00\n- 10 stove pipes 2.50\n\n**From Sulin**\n- 500 feet lumber 9.00\n\n**Freighting**\n- To Dowling.\n  - For mdse. supplied James Jack 20.00\n  - \" \" \" Charlie West 20.00\n  - \" \" \" Frank Sill 20.00\n\n**Balonic Squinas**\n- To hauling 500 feet of lumber from Tougstan 20.00\n\n**A. C. Christensen**\n- Mdse. supplied James Jack for constructing seats and desks. 22.40\n\n$171.90\n\nIt is very much regretted that this expenditure has incurred in this irregular manner. That it is necessary cannot be denied for if a school is going to be operated there the teacher must have a place to stay and very few teachers would have undertaken the position of teacher at Ulkatcho under the conditions which prevailed when school was opened. It was realized by the Agent that there was some risk recommending these commitments by the Department.\nto the expense of a school at this point especially since this Band have been considered for the last twenty years to be too nomadic for a school to be feasible and it might reasonably have been assumed that the only way out was for these children to attend a Residential School. That these children had never apparently had the opportunity of attending a Residential School is another matter for conjecture, but it is quite possible that the parents may have objected to the children leaving home. The present Seasonal School will accomplish much more for parents and children and the total cost has not yet reached $850.00 spread over three years. Of this amount the Indians have received $424.40 in food and clothing for work and freighting. Considering that most of the material was transported from Vancouver by truck and sleigh over almost impossible roads and trails and that this includes school furnishings, the Department has received very good value for the money expended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm.

The Treasury Branch has raised the question regarding why you should be obliged to issue a voucher in favour of another Agent rather than have that Agent issue it himself.\n\nI am under the impression that, while the Ulkatcho School is in your Agency, it is easier to have supplies reach it from the headquarters of the Williams Lake Agency than from your headquarters. However, I should appreciate hearing from you in the matter.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of June 4th, No.162-17-5, re Voucher No.38 in favor of William Christie, Indian Agent at Williams Lake.\n\nMr. Christie forwarded the receipt for cost of cartage on a box of supplies billed to the Ulkatcho Seminole school and so there was no way of having this box delivered to the school, sleighing being all gone, he has kept the box at Williams Lake until there is a chance to have it forwarded to Ulkatcho.\n\nSeeing that Ulkatcho is in the Bella Coola Agency, Mr. Christie naturally assumed that this would be charge against this Agency, and consequently forwarded the receipt for cost of cartage to this office, so that the charge would be vouchered for and entered in our Voucher book.\n\nAll heavy articles shipped to Ulkatcho should be shipped via Williams Lake, as there is no way of transporting goods from this office to Ulkatcho except by pack horse.\n\nThere will be a further charge for cartage on this box, from Williams Lake to Anahim Lake, distance of 325 miles and then it will have to be taken from Anahim to Ulkatcho by sleigh, which will again bring other charges, so that by the time that it reaches Ulkatcho School, the costs of cartage will run pretty high.\n\nT.G.

Mr. Swartout in reference to the Day School for some time conducted by the Presbyterian Mission Society at Ahouset in connection with which a report dated 18th Feb. 1898, No. 41. C. 3. was sent to the Department from this office:\n\nI may say that in the recent conversation referred to by Mr. Swartout he seemed to think that the Roman Catholic missionaries were unduly favored and that his own society (the Presbyterian Mission) was harshly and inconsiderately treated. I assured him that such was not the case and endeavoured to explain that the Roman Catholic's had a prior claim, etc.\n\nMr. Swartout stated that his missionary\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nmissionary work had been very successful and that the Ahousets are a very headstrong and difficult lot of Indians, though intelligent, to work amongst, but that the Presbyterian Mission had been very successful.\n\nAll this I believe to be the case and I think that now that the Ahouset Band have been so far advanced in the way of education, etc., through much perseverance and pains-taking on the part of the Presbyterian Missionaries, it would be a pity to close the school and let them fall back into their old heathenish ways.\n\nI have much pleasure in testifying to the good work done by the Presbyterians in the different locations where they have established mission work. I also think that they are deserving of credit for their non-interference in places where other denominations have commenced operations.\n\nProvision has been made for the maintenance of a day school at Ahouset during the year 1898-'99 and I would in the interests of the Department\nDepartment and the Indians recommend that the grant be authorized from the 1st of July next.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt. Servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\nA W. Cowell Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nVictoria B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Atkinson School Grant\n\nReferring to our recent conversation & trust you will again lay this matter before your Department.\n\nWe feel that, as it at present stands we have some reason to complain.\n\nWe began work in Atkinson in December 1895 when no one else was there, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.\n\nMany years ago the latter had a school here for a season or two but to all intents and purposes had permanently abandoned the tribe a large and important one. Had the Roman Catholics been engaged in that field we should not have gone there. But for several years before they had not nor have they since done anything to give them any claim upon this field.\n\nUnder these circumstances to refuse us a school grant on the supposition that it is Roman Catholic constituency is hard to understand.\n\nNor does it make it easier to understand to say that the grant was transferred from Atkinson to Clayoquot.\n\nThere are two distinct tribes not even friendly to each other. We assume also the grant.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6422, file 868-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe grant was given to educate the Indians north at Ahuntsic and not to help any special religious work, and in any event after six or seven years any special right formerly possessed by the Roman Catholics would doubtless have been forfeited and not be a proper subject for conference over the heads of others doing the work which they had abandoned.\n\nSo that to refuse us a grant at Ahuntsic and subsequently to give one to the Roman Catholics at Chignecto does not from our point of view seem like treating us all the same. Personally I would prefer the Government would take the education of the Indian children into their own hands. But to leave them to grow up in ignorance receiving from the whites only their views cannot really be the policy of an enlightened nation.\n\nWe have been doing this work and until your Department arranges to take it over expect to continue it and trust we may have the partial remuneration usually given such work, and would be glad in fact to have the grant come the next year as well.\n\nI might say I think we have been demonstrated our ability to conduct and keep together day schools upon the reservations and while it may be better to establish boarding schools yet considering the inefficiency of the former methods and the good work...\nGood work that is doubtless being done,\nWe feel that day schools should be\nencouraged until at least the others can\nbe established.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nM. Swartout\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, 9th June, 1899\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nAn application for a grant of $500 to erect a school house at Clayoquot was made by the Roman Catholic church in 1896 and renewed in 1897 but was not acceded to, Mr Vowell being informed that the Department could hold out no hopes of a grant being obtained for this purpose then.\n\nMr Vowell was also informed that provision was only made for one Roman Catholic school in the West Coast Agency, but that the Department would not object to the grant provided for the Roman Catholic school at Ahousaht being applied to the Clayoquot school.\n\nNo school appears to have been in operation at either Ahousaht or Clayoquot between the years 1891 and 1896, when the Clayoquot school was re-opened in December quarter and paid for out of the grant provided for Ahousaht for two years as previously stated.\n\nThe grant for Ahousaht was dropped from the Estimates in 1898-9 and Clayoquot provided for.\n\nThe following is a copy of a Memo. re Clayoquot school which sets forth the arrangement with the Roman Catholic Church:\n\n\"OTTAWA 18th March 1897:-\n\n\"Memo.\n\n\"for the Supt: Genl: of Indian Affairs\n\n\"Re Clayoquot school.\n\n\"This school is in operation, and the teach-\nThe Minister says nothing can be done at present.\n\nJ.A.J.

If neither school was kept open is there any thing in\nMEMO.\n\nthe arrangement with the Roman Catholic Church which would affect their right to the grant, and what was the state of the re-opening.\n\nR.H. Campbell\nDepartment of Indian Affairs:-\nOTTAWA, 7th June, 1899\n\nThe Secretary:-\n\nMemo. re overture submitted to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Canada and transmitted to the Department through the Synod of British Columbia, by the Presbytery of Victoria, B.C., in regard to grants to Indian Mission schools on the West Coast of Vancouver Island.\n\nI. The Statement of the Presbyterian Church above referred to deals chiefly with educational matters in connection with the Ahousaht Band which, according to the last census, contains 276 members, made up as follows: - 80 Presbyterians, 80 Roman Catholics and 116 pagans. The Presbyterians claim that they opened a school at Ahousaht in Dec. 1895, but the first return received by the Department from their school was for March quarter 1896, and since then quarterly returns have been regularly received, the last return showing an enrollment of 47 with an average attendance of 24.\n\nPrevious to the opening of a Presbyterian school at Ahousaht, the Roman Catholics had been carrying on a school at that place, but no returns have been received from that school since 1891, when the school was apparently closed. Mr Vowell, in a letter of the 22nd Nov. 1895, submitting an application from Rev. Mr Swartout of Ucluelet for permission to open a day school at Maktosis (Ahousaht), states that the Roman Catholics had a school for the\nIndians of that Band some years ago, and that the name of this school has been entered in the Estimates for day schools from year to year, although returns had ceased to be received. He also states that the Roman Catholic missioners have a church and residence for the priest there, one room of which was formerly used as a school room and that it would be well to delay the introduction of a different sect of religion amongst these Indians until a vote of the whole tribe was taken on the question. Acting on Mr Vowell's recommendation, he was advised that the Department regretted being unable to comply with Mr Swartout's request, as no funds were available for the establishment of a Protestant school on that Reserve.\n\nAlthough the Department had not sanctioned the opening of a Presbyterian school at Ahousaht, nor promised any aid, quarterly returns were forwarded by the Agent, but no requisition was made for a grant as none had been allowed. Payment, however, was made for the first three quarter's salary, amounting to $225, such payment having been made in error and Mr Vowell was so informed. The grant included in the estimates was for a Roman Catholic and not a Presbyterian school at that place.\n\n2nd. The statement of the Church authorities as to the opening and payment of the Roman Catholic school at Clayoquot is correct in so far as it refers to the years 1896-7 and 1897-8, but it should be borne in mind that the Roman Catholic church authorities were given the option of keeping either one of the two schools open, and chose Clayoquot. Since 1898-9 Ahousaht has been dropped from the estimates.\n3rd. The priority of occupation claim of the Roman Catholic church is held by the Presbyterian authorities to be untenable for the reasons set forth in their memorandum, although acknowledged by the Department, for the reason set forth by Mr Vowell in his letter above referred to, and it is a question I do not feel competent to express an opinion upon.\n\n4th. An application was received last spring from the Presbyterian church for a grant to the day school conducted by that denomination at Ahousaht which was submitted to the Deputy Minister, who directed that the Rev. Mr Swartout be informed that it was too late to arrange anything then. The Deputy also added that no promise was to be made in the matter. I understand that nothing has been provided for this school in the estimates for next year; but as the Presbyterians have successfully carried on the work so many years, it would seem that they are entitled to consideration, but if a grant were made them, I do not think that they are entitled to payment from the time the school was opened, as they claim in the concluding paragraph of their memorandum.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. Swartout, Presbyterian Missionary at Thompson in the Cowichan Agency, renewing his application for a grant to the Indian day school at that point that has been conducted by his church for so many years.\n\nIn reply I am directed to request that you will be good enough to inform Mr. Swartout that it is too late to arrange to do anything for this school this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. MacLean\nSecretary.\n\nA. W. Howell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria,\nB. C.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n26th May, 1898.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nThis application from the Presbyterian Church for a grant to the day school that has been conducted by that denomination at Ahousaht in the Cowichan Agency, B.C., has already been considered and refused, on another file; but, as the letters hereunder from Superintendent Vowell and the Rev. Mr. Swartout, the missionary at the point referred to, throw new light on the subject, while it is too late to consider the application for the present estimates, perhaps the Department might go so far as to let the missionary know that if he will bring the matter up again before next session it will receive consideration again.\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen writing to you on the 16th instant I overlooked returning the papers in connection with the Overture from the Presbytery of Victoria which you left with me.\n\nI now beg to enclose them herewith.\n\nAs to the matter of the Roman Catholic school at Crooked Lakes Agency referred to in the letter from Reverend Mr. McLeod to Mrs. Jeffrey, I beg to say that the Department is not aiding the establishment of a Roman Catholic boarding school at the Crooked Lakes Agency, and that even if such a school were opened Protestant children would not be compelled to attend under the regulations.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Wm. Moore, D.D.,\nPresbyterian General Assembly,\nCentral Church,\nHamilton, Ont.\nMEMO.\n\nTo Mr. Maclean,\n\nThe Chippewa Camproot School Deputy in replying letter to Mr. Moore I overlooked stating that papers will be returned and also think overlooked commencing at Round Lake School. I am assured you please let me have papers again.\n\nR.H. Campbell\nOttawa, 18th June, 1929.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the Overture from the Presbytery of Victoria to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, which you handed to me some days ago, in regard to the matter of the Indian School at Ahousaht established by that church, I beg to say that the history of the school at that place is as follows:\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church is said to have done a great deal of work for many years among the Indians of the west coast of Vancouver Island and among the missions they established was the one for the Indians at Ahousaht and Clayoquot, these stations being considered as one mission. The grant for the school at this mission was made with the understanding that the school could be carried on at either of the points mentioned and the place chosen at first was\n\n(Ahousaht)\n\nRevd. Wm. Moore, D.D.,\nPresbyterian General Assembly,\nCentral Church,\nHamilton, Ont.\nAhousaht, the school being kept open until 1891. Although no returns from this school were received after 1891, the grant for a Roman Catholic school at that place was still provided, and on the opening of the school at Clayoquot in 1896 the grant was transferred to that school in accordance with the understanding above referred to.\n\nOn the 1st November, 1885, Revd. Mr. Shortt, on behalf of the Presbyterian Church, wrote to the Indian Agent asking that he be allowed to open a school at Ahousaht, and on this application being referred to the Department by the Inspector, who stated that the Roman Catholic missionaries had a church and residence for the priest there, one room of which was formerly used as a school room, and that it would be well to delay the introduction of a different sect of religion amongst these Indians until a vote of the whole tribe was taken, he was informed that the Department regretted that it would not be able to comply with the request of Revd. Mr. Shortt as there were no funds available for the establishment of a Protestant School on that Reserve. Apparently however the school was started by the Presbyterian Church without reference to the Department, and reports of progress having been sent in, by an oversight (payment\npayment of the grant was made to them for three quarters of 1896. As soon as this fact was noticed the attention of the Inspector was called to it and the payments were discontinued.\n\nI regret therefore that there appears to be no way of meeting the wishes of the presbytery for a grant to this school, as it appears certain that any arrangement that might be made with that object in view might create a good deal of difficulty.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nExtract from letter addressed by Deputy Supt. General to\nRev. Wm. Moore----7th February, 1900\n\nAs to the day school at Ahousaht, I am inclined to think that it will hardly be possible to do anything this year in this connection. The matter will have to be looked into in order that it may be fully ascertained as to whether this will clash with the other schools in the neighborhood, but in the meantime it will not be overlooked.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJas. A. Smart\n\nRev. Wm. Moore, D.D.\n\nO'Connor St.\n\nOTTAWA,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n12th February, 1900\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWith reference to the concluding paragraph of the letter from the Deputy Minister to Rev. Dr. Moore, which deals with the application of the Presbyterian Church for a grant for the school at Ahousaht, I beg to say that it is a difficult matter to determine here whether the recognition of this school would clash with the Roman Catholic school in the neighborhood which is provided for.\n\nMr. Bray has shown me the maps of the Reserves in the Barclay Sound and Clayoquot districts and from the notes made at the time of the survey, it would appear that the Roman Catholics alone had missions where Indian villages were shown.\n\nReturns are received from the school at Ahousaht above referred to, which show an average attendance of about 40 pupils for the past two years while the Roman Catholic school at Clayoquot has sent in no returns for over a year. The Department has not been advised that the Clayoquot school has been closed, but it would appear that the Presbyterian Church is very much alive.\n\nI think that it would be as well, as very little delay would be entailed, to ask Mr. Supt. Vowell for a report on this application.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6422, file 868-1, part 1)\nOTTAWA, 14th February, 1900\n\nSir,\n\nThe Presbyterian Missionary Society have renewed their application for a grant towards the school carried on by them at Ahousaht and they have been informed that the Department was not in a position to give them a definite answer until it was ascertained whether its doing so would in any way clash with the schools of other denominations in the neighborhood.\n\nThe Department would like you to report in this matter. It appears from the records on file here that the Ahousaht school is in operation with an attendance of about 40 pupils, while the Roman Catholic school at Clayoquot, for which provision is made, has sent in no returns for over a year.\n\nWhen reporting be good enough to indicate on a rough sketch, the relative position of these two schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nA. Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nSecretary\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6422, file 868-1, part 1)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 7th March, 1900\n\nMr McKenna,\n\nI send you files 116,620 (Numbers 1 and 3) and B34,628, relating to Alberni and Ahousaht schools in British Columbia.\n\nRe Alberni,- Provision is made in the main estimates for 25 pupils at $60 each for this school for the year 1900-1901, which will not be available until after the 1st July next, and the Rev. R.P. Mackay Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada has been so informed.\n\nRe Ahousaht,- No provision is as yet made for this school but Mr Supt. Vowell was asked to report whether the granting of a day school teacher's salary to this school would clash with the schools of other denominations in the neighborhood.\n\nThe Presbyterian school at Ahousaht is said to have forty pupils in attendance, while provision is made for a Roman Catholic school at Clayoquot, from which no returns have been received for over a year. I think it would be better for the Department to provide a salary for the Ahousaht school, as it would likely cause trouble if the Clayoquot grant were appropriated for that purpose.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Brown\nMemo: Deputy Supt. General,\n\nReferring to the attached memorandum, as the day school at Clayoquot is not running, and as there is, therefore, sufficient money available, the Minister directs that the usual day school grant be given to the school at Ahousaht, B.C., conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nEnc.\nOTTAWA, 16th March, 1900\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to my letter of the 14th ulto., respecting the renewed application of the Presbyterian Missionary Society for a grant to the school carried on by them at Ahousaht, I am directed to inform you that the usual day school grant of $300.00 per annum will be paid for this school from the 1st January 1900 upon your requisition therefor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

For five years previous to 1895 no Mission work of any kind had been done in that village. According to Mr. Russell's last annual report (1901-1902) sixty-four received instruction during the year. The largest number on the role in one quarter was fifty-five. The average attendance for the year was 12.9 as compared with 21.1 during the previous year.\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) R. P. MacKay.\nOttawa, January 10, 1918.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the payment of salary of Mr. VanderVeen for his services as teacher in the day school at Ahousaht during the September quarter last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque for $123.75 is being sent to the Treasurer of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, Toronto, in payment for 33 days at the rate of $750.00 per annum.\n\nNo return has yet been received from Mr. VanderVeen showing the attendance, etc., for the December quarter. Our agent will be requested to instruct Mr. VanderVeen to prepare and forward a return for that quarter and also, in future, to forward his returns of attendance promptly at the end of each quarter so that the amount of salary due can be paid promptly. The Department does not pay the salaries of teachers in the day schools until their quarterly returns have been received.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D.

(RC IC, Volume 6422, file S68-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, January 10, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to instruct Mr. VanderWeen, teacher of the day school at Ahousaht, to prepare and forward a return showing the attendance and days taught during the quarter ending December 31, last. You should also instruct him that in future he is to prepare and forward these returns through your office promptly at the end of each quarter.\n\nAs this school is conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church, all cheques for salaries will be sent to the treasurer. The salary of Mr. VanderWeen is at the rate of $750.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nChas. A. Cox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B. C.\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn a letter we received from you dated August 20th, you intimated that the Department would allow $750 towards the salary of Mr. Vanderveen on account of his work in the Day School at Ahousaht. I consulted with the Treasurer, and I found that no money had come from the Department for Ahousaht since the end of June. I then wrote Dr. Wilson, our District Superintendent of P.C., to ascertain how long Mr. Vanderveen has been in charge of the school.\n\nThe following is a quotation from a letter written by Mr. Vanderveen, December 24th:\n\n\"During the quarter ending September 30th there was no school at all. And during the present quarter I will only be able to get in 33 days out of a total of 59 school days. The reason of that is because in the first place the school supplies were slow in coming in and then when I did receive them the children were all away\".\n\nFrom this you will see that there is due us salary for Mr. Vanderveen for 33 days at the rate of $750 per year. As we have already paid Mr. Vanderveen in full, the cheque should be made payable to the Treasurer of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nEXTRACT FROM THE LETTER OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL OF AUGUST 20th, 1917, TO REV.

As soon as you are ready to accommodate a field matron at this point too a fair salary for such services will be granted, the understanding being that a graduate nurse will be engaged.\n\nYours very truly\n\n(signed) Duncan C.

B.

We have no record of Miss Nelson having been appointed as teacher of this school. The last correspondence we have had with you regarding the teaching services at Ahousaht was my letter of August 22, in which you were advised that in the event of a teacher being appointed salary would be allowed at the rate of $95 a teaching month, plus bonus. I should appreciate hearing from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the income tax deductions from the salary of Mrs. Waywell. As pointed out in my letter of the 19th ultimo, the action taken was the only course possible by the Treasury Branch in view of the income tax regulations.\n\nI am taking up the matter with the Income Tax Office in the hope that something can be done. In the meantime I trust that you will be able to persuade Mrs. Waywell to retain her position.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 159-36-1\n\nReplying to your letter of the 19th instant in respect to the complaint of Mrs. M.K. Waywell that due to her salary cheque for the period September 8th to December 31st, 1942, being dated January 1943, whereby she was penalized in income tax payment apparently to the extent of about Fifty-five dollars for the reason that the Income Tax officials insist that it was part of her 1943 income, thereby not only placing her in a higher tax bracket, but precluding her securing some rebate on her 1942 tax payments, I would advise that this teacher has now submitted the enclosed resignation on financial grounds.\n\nMrs. Waywell has proven a very capable teacher and as the teacher situation is such that it is extremely unlikely that we can replace her, I am writing her requesting that she reconsider her decision and have asked Mr. Bunt, Superintendent of United Church Home Missions, in Vancouver, to also use his influence with her. Meanwhile, I would recommend that the matter be held in abeyance.\n\nIf the Department is in a position to induce the Income Tax officials to make some adjustment on Mrs. Waywell's behalf, it would no doubt be of great assistance in the matter. We have been unsuccessful in our discussions with the local Income Tax Branch.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nKT\nEnc.\nCampbell River, B.C.,\nSept. 25, 1944.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if I could be released from my duties at Campbell River at the end of October or middle of November. I am sorry to ask to leave a school in mid-term but the experiences of the past three years have shown me very clearly that I must, myself, give personal matters first consideration.\n\nNo doubt you will ask why I requested an appointment when I find myself obliged to ask for a release so soon. It was an error in judgement influenced by financial exigencies. After all, when one receives a low salary, pays living expenses and traveling costs for remote areas, and then hospital bills in addition, one's financial reserves are not such as would encourage one to use good judgement in the matter of voluntary retirement.\n\nI am afraid that Ahousat has left me with a 'hangover' that renders it impossible for me to do satisfactory Indian work, and I trust that you will find it possible to obtain the services of another teacher for Campbell River School.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to payments made to Mrs. M.K. Waywell, formerly teacher at the Ahousaht School and recently appointed to the position of teacher at the Campbell River School.\n\nFor your information I enclose a copy of a letter dated April 27 which was forwarded to Mrs. Waywell by the Chief Treasury Officer. I am informed today that there is nothing that we can add to the letter of April 27, as it is felt that that letter fully covered the situation as far as we are concerned. We regret that we cannot take any further action in the matter, but it is one that will have to be adjusted between Mrs. Waywell and the Income Tax officials.\n\nR.A.

Apparently her salary for this period amounting to $418.67 was not paid until January 1943, and as a result it was, in accordance with the Income Tax Act, included with her 1943 earnings of $1,006.59 making a gross income of $1425.26.

I wish you would point out to Mr. Ashbridge that in the event of a teacher resigning or leaving a day school for any purpose he should write us a letter giving us all the particulars. On checking our files I find that Mr. Ashbridge mentioned in his January report that Mr. Glover had given up duties, but this particular report was not brought to the attention of the Training Division. Consequently the Treasury Branch was not notified to stop issuing cheques in his favour.\n\nR.A.

Arrangements were made to supply the school with fuel.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING MARCH, 1945, ON WEST COAST AGENCY\n\nSchools:\n\nAhousaht Day School has not had a very good attendance due to parents being away at the canneries. Miss Nelson appears to be a very good teacher, and the children are making progress. School is kept clean and tidy. A supply of fuel (wood) has been provided.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nSchools\n\nAt Ahousaht day school the attendance has been fairly good, and pupils are making good progress. School kept clean and in good order, but the grounds being chiefly rock and bush do not afford any playground. After the close of the fishing season attempts will be made to have the parents clear some space and effect general improvements.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nAlberni, B.C., March 30, 1946.\n\nMARCH QUARTER REPORT ON WEST COAST AGENCY.\n\nAHOUSET DAY SCHOOL\n\nAttendance at this school has improved due to the Canneries being closed and families having returned for the winter months. The building is in good repair, and considered adequate for its requirements; as a \"Winter School\". Ground work has been laid for education of Ahousat children at Provincial day schools at various points during the summer months when families migrate to the Canneries.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING SEPTEMBER 30th, 1945, ON WEST COAST AGENCY\n\nINSPECTION OF SCHOOLS:\n\nAhousat Day School on day of inspection had an attendance of only three pupils; two of whom could not read. This was partly due to families being away at the Canneries. On the whole this school was very disappointing, and I feel that the teacher is wasting her time.\n\nDay schools is emphasized. The school at Ucluelet should be re-opened if a teacher can be found. Season day schools also should be conducted at Noatka, Kildonan, and Ceepeecree, as the parents cannot leave their children behind when employed at the Canneries; and the residential schools cannot accommodate them. In consequence there are several over school age who cannot obtain an education.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nQUARTERLY AGENCY REPORT FOR PERIOD ENDING DEC. 31, 1945.\n\nAttendance at the Ahousat Day School has improved since the last report, and should remain good until the Spring. Recommendations were made in some instances to the Family Allowances Board to discontinue payments to parents whose children were not attending school, with good results.\n\nP.B.
