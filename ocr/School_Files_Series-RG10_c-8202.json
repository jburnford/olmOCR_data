When I was at the school, I went to look at the furnace, and discovered that the smoke stack has a complete \"U\" turn in it. This no doubt accounts for the smoking. I should say that the position of the furnace was not very carefully planned.\n\nOne of the locks on the door does not work and an ordinary hook and eyelet are used. This arrangement is far from ornamental.\nOttawa, June 30, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his visit to the Kaboni Indian Day School in May, last, draws attention to the condition of the furnace. He states that it smokes badly, owing to the smoke stack having a complete \"U\" turn in it, which, no doubt, accounts for the smoking. He also states that one of the locks on the door does not work and an ordinary hook and eyelet are used, and that this arrangement is far from ornamental.\n\nI have to request that you will make an examination of the smoke stack of the furnace, with a view to improving its condition and placing same in good order. Could not this smoke stack be straightened and a good draft obtained, in order to carry off the smoke. You should furnish a report regarding this matter, stating what you would recommend be done to overcome the present difficulty.\n\nYou should also arrange to have the lock on the door referred to by the Inspector repaired, or a new lock installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It may be the case that the furnace will have to be taken apart and new dampers installed, but before doing this an effort will be made to have them straightened by means of a blowtorch.\n\nThere does not appear to be anything wrong with the smoke stack, and during the past has had plenty of draft, and no doubt but it would have ample draft at the present time if the dampers were made use of properly.\n\nThe hook and eyelet which locks the door on the entrance to the cellar way will be taken off and a new lock installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n**INDIAN TRUST FUND**\n\n*The Department of Indian Affairs,*\n\nTo: J.

It is not possible to state the length of time that Miss Byrne, the present teacher, might remain at this school, and her successor might not possess a car. In that event, the garage would not be required. It is thought that Miss Byrne should make her own arrangements for the storage of her car during the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The Dept. refused to have this done.\n\nI am writing to ask for permission to have this building brought to Kaloni School, at my own expense.\n\nHoping you will give this matter your kind consideration, I am,\n\nGratefully yours,\n\nModesta Byrne.\nOttawa, March 27th, 1935.\n\nDear Miss Byrne,\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to your request to move a small shed from the old Wikwemikongising School to the Kaboni Indian Day School, at your own expense, for the purpose of providing a garage. Mr. Agent Lewis is being written and, on receipt of his reply, you will be further advised.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMiss M. Byrne,\nTeacher,\nKaboni Indian Day School,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, March 27th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nIn your letter of September 28th, last, you requested authority to expend $60.00 in the erection of a garage for the teacher of the Kaboni Indian Day School and you were informed in official letter of October 5th that the Department is not prepared to incur this expenditure.\n\nThe teacher, Miss M. Byrne, now writes requesting permission to secure a garage at her own expense. She states that a small shed from the old Wikwemikonging School could be moved to the Kaboni School.\n\nPlease let me know if the shed mentioned by the teacher is available and, if so, would you recommend granting her permission to have it moved to the Kaboni School at her own expense?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Rev. Chas. Belanger, S.J., in which he states that he can secure an organ for the Kaboni Indian Day School at a cost of $20.00 to $25.00. Father Belanger states that the present teacher is able to teach singing and that the organ would be of considerable benefit to her and the pupils. You should see Father Belanger on the occasion of your next visit to Wikwemikong and arrange for the delivery of the organ to the Kaboni School.\n\nA voucher can be submitted covering the cost of the organ to an amount not exceeding that stated above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nManitowaning, April 3rd, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Departmental Letter No. I9-2-5 of the 27th ultimo, in regard to the communication received from Miss M. Byrne requesting permission to secure a garage at her own expense at the Kaboni Indian Day School, and that a small shed from the old Wikwemikong School could be removed to the Kaboni School; I have the honour to report that there is a small building at the old Wikwemikong School which was in use as a woodshed. As this school has been closed for a number of years past and not likely to re-open again and for that reason the shed would be of no further use where it is at present so I would recommend that Miss Byrne be granted permission to have it moved to the Kaboni School at her own expense.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department that I had an interview with Miss Byrne recently concerning this matter. She thought that the shed could be moved for a trifle. I am of the opinion that the cost of moving and having it converted into a garage would be a considerable amount and she was advised to that effect, but as she is in need of a garage it would be well to allow her to carry out her project.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 8, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Department approves Miss M. Byrne, teacher of the Kaboni Indian Day School, moving the shed mentioned in your letter to the Kaboni School, in order to serve as a garage.\n\nIt might be well for you to again point out to Miss Byrne the probable cost in moving this building, in order that she may be fully aware of the expenditure that she will incur before the moving is started.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

W. Hinds, Manitowaning, Ontario, for 1 Galvanized Watering Pot furnished for use at the Kaboni Indian Day School.\n\nThis school has a small garden of flowers, vegetables etc., in connection with it; and as it is necessary, during the dry weather, to keep it watered occasionally, it was thought well to supply the teacher with a Watering Can. Therefore, I would recommend the payment of this account.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nManitowaning, July 2nd, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report to the effect that the furnace which has been in use for the purpose of heating the classroom and teacher's residence at the Kaboni Indian Day School is in a state of very bad repair.\n\nIt has been in use since the school building was erected twenty years ago, and has given satisfactory service in heating the building until the last winter past. It is now burned inside to such an extent that it is cracked and twisted and through these cracks the smoke escapes into the hot air pipes and fills the whole building with smoke. I had the firebox repaired and the cracks filled with furnace putty in order that it could be made use of until the warm weather set in, but it is again in a bad state of repair. On examining it recently I found that it is past further usefulness and should be replaced by a new furnace before such time as it will be needed to heat the building during the incoming fall.\n\nI asked a dealer in furnaces etc as to the probable cost of installing a suitable furnace similar to the one which has been in use, and he advised me that the approx. cost would amount to $125.00.\n\nI have to report also that the ceilings and interior walls of the classroom and teachers' residence of this building are now in a dismal condition and should be renovated with two coats of muresco, also the woodwork should have a coat of oil, the cost of having this work carried out will not exceed $50.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n19-2-5.\n\n1015-23.\n\nOttawa, July 12, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, regarding the furnace in use at the Kaboni Indian Day School for the heating of the classroom and teacher's residence. It is noted that this furnace is now past repairing and that you recommend that a new one be supplied, stating the approximate cost.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase and installation of a new furnace, of the type and capacity that would be adequate to properly heat the building. I enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure to an amount not exceeding $130 in the purchase and installation of the furnace. When the furnace has been installed to your satisfaction, you should obtain an account, in triplicate, stating in detail the type of furnace purchased. This account, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. Please state, on each copy of your voucher, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. A. No. 3466.\n\nRegarding the renovation of the ceilings and interior walls of the classrooms and teacher's residence, I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding $50 in the purchase of material and for the labour in giving the walls and ceiling two coats of muresco and the woodwork, a coat of oil. Indian labour should be utilized as far as possible, if satisfactory. You should obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the material and vouchers, in triplicate, for the labour. The numbers of days or hours employed and the rate paid should be stated.\n\nThe installation of the furnace and the renovation of the interior of the classroom and teacher's residence should be carried out during the present summer holidays. The Department will leave the above work in your hands. You should see that all is satisfactorily completed and at the lowest possible cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to Departmental Letter No. I9-2-5 of the 17th instant, in regard to the report of the Separate School Inspector on the Kaboni Indian Day School, I have the honour to report that a new flag pole should be supplied as the one which has been in use during the past had become in such state of deterioration that it is of no further use. A new pole, pulley and sufficient rope will cost $6.00.\n\nA portion of the piping which carries the water away from the eavestroughing is in a state of bad repair. The cost of having the necessary repairs carried out will not exceed $3.00.\n\nWith regard to the belfry, I have to report that this belfry has given more or less trouble since the school building was erected over twenty years ago. On different occasions it has been under repairs, and during the last spring past further repairs were carried out, but it is still in a leaky condition. The only solution I can see, is to have this belfry replaced by a new one, the cost of material and labour would amount to approx. $30.00.\n\nThe toilets require a few minor repairs, glass for three small windows and a latch for one door. The cost of placing these building in a good state of repair will not exceed $5.00.\n\nThe school yard fence is not in good condition. It should be replaced by a new one. If repairs to the extent of $5.00 were carried out on the old fence it would do for another year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 2nd, 1935.\n\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 26th, last, I beg to say that you may purchase a new flag pole, pulley and rope for the Kaboni Indian Day School at a cost of $6.00.\n\nYou may also arrange for the following repairs:\n\n(a) Pipe from eavestrough - $3.00.\n(b) Repairs to belfry - $30.00.\n(c) Repairs to toilets - $5.00.\n(d) Repairs to school fence - $5.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nPP/O'M.\nManitowaning, September 11th, 1935.\n\nSir:-\n\nWith regard to my letter to the Department dated July 24th last, in reference to a new furnace for the Kaboni Indian School of which the probable cost would amount to $125.00, and the Department authorized an expenditure of $130.00 for this purpose by E.R.No.3466; I have the honour to report that the old furnace has been removed in order to have everything ready to install a new furnace, and now I find that a large suitable furnace for this school, without casing, will cost $228.00 net, delivered on Manitowaning wharf, or one not quite so large delivered in Manitowaning $205.00, but the large one would be the most suitable for the Kaboni Indian School and residence. There would be an extra expense in transportation of the furnace from Manitowaning to Kaboni School and labour re-building the brick casing around the furnace, the cost will amount to at least $15.00.\n\nThe standard of a furnace which has been in use during the past is not made by the firm now, and the dealer who advised me as the approx. cost of a similar furnace to the one which has been in use at $125.00 made a error in his quotation to the amount of $100.00.\n\nAs it is necessary to have a new furnace installed in this school immediately on account of the cold weather being liable to set in at any time now, I would recommend that authority be granted to install the large furnace at a cost of $228.00 delivered in Manitowaning, and a cost of $75.00 for transportation from Manitowaning and labour in having it installed in the basement of the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6137, File 400-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, September 14, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the new furnace required for use at the Kaboni Indian Day School. It is noted that the cost of supplying a furnace that would be suitable to properly heat the building will cost $228 net, delivered on Manitowaning wharf; also that there will be the cost of transportation of the furnace to the school and labour in rebuilding the brick casing around the furnace, which will amount to $35. There is, therefore, an extra amount of $113 over the sum authorized for the purpose in official letter of July 12th, last.\n\nAs it is necessary to have a furnace of a size and type that will be satisfactory to heat the building, the Department will approve of your incurring the extra expenditure. It is noted that the total cost of supplying the furnace, freighting same to the school and the installation will amount to $243. We are obtaining an Encumbrance here for the extra amount required. You should arrange at the earliest possible date to have the furnace supplied and installed. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the furnace, transportation and labour, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nBesides the supplying and installing of the furnace, you were authorized to have the interior of the classroom and teacher's residence renovated, at a cost not to exceed $50 in the purchase of material and labour. Besides, in official letter of August 2nd, last, you were authorized to carry out certain repairs to the savestrough, belfry, toilets and fence. You should have all this work completed as soon as possible, forwarding properly itemized accounts, in triplicate, in the usual manner covering the cost of the materials and labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Through good work of the teacher, pupils and a few Indian neighbours living close to the school, they were able to extinguish the fire before much damage was done. Approx. ten feet square was destroyed to such an extent that it had to be replaced by new material, but it was given attention immediately and now it is in a state of good repair. During the excitement among the members working at the fire the handle bearer of the well pump was broken and had to be replaced by a new one.\n\nThe cause of this fire is not known as the chimney is a brick structure with the flue lined with glazed tile and is in first class condition. It is thought that a live spark from the chimney fell on the dry cedar shingles as there is not any other way this fire could have started.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n| Item          | Quantity | Price |\n|--------------|----------|-------|\n| Dolls        | 5        | $1.75 |\n| Games        | 2        | $0.30 |\n| Hair bands   | 2        | $2.00 |\n| Jewelry      | 1        | $0.95 |\n| Rogers       | 6        | $1.00 |\n| Books        | 6        | $3.00 |\n| Doll         | 1        | $1.00 |\n| Jap          | 13       | $1.95 |\n| Decorations  | 2        | $3.75 |\n| Garland      | 1        | $0.50 |\n| **Total**    |          | **$4.00** |\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Manitowaning $1.00\n\n**ADDRESS:** Manitowaning, Ontario\n\n---\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1937 | Authorized by Dept. letter No. 19-1-5 dated November 2, 1937 | |\n| Dec. 4 | Christmas treats furnished to the pupils of Kaboni Indian Day School | 4.00 |\n\n(Allotment No. 20-1499)\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVoucher No. 37-478\n\nDate: December 14, 1937\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

I should imagine that, in their present state, they are more or less dangerous.\n\nThe blackboards at this school have been ruined by having been painted over with some kind of surface-coating. It is quite difficult to write anything upon them that can be read legibly from the back of the room. I do not know what can be done with them, however, unless they are gone over with sandpaper.\n\n(Sgd.) W. J.

In this report he states that the pupils' entrances need repairing. If this matter has not received attention since the date of the Inspector's visit you should have these entrances repaired immediately.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the blackboards are in very bad condition and suggests that they be sandpapered and then re-painted. If you consider this would improve them you may arrange for this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. J.

I strongly disapprove of muresco, as it cannot be washed without a great deal of work, and must have a fresh application each time it is washed, while if the walls were painted, they can be readily washed and kept clean at all times.\n\nThe cost of the labour involved to renovate and redecorate is estimated at $85.00.\n\nThere is also a part of the basement from which the earth was never removed. The space is required for storing fuel, and the earth could be used to level a small swampy place at the rear of the school grounds, which breeds mosquitos. It is estimated this would cost approximately $75.00, and I would be pleased to receive an advance cheque for $160.00 to pay wages for this work, if the material can be supplied.\n\nFor convenience, I would recommend the material be purchased locally from C.

W.

Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing requisition for articles required at the Kaboni School. The Department approves the purchase of the articles shown on the attached requisition, with the exception of the expenditure for manual training supplies.\n\nIt is noted that for each of the schools in your agency you request a grant for manual training supplies for both boys and girls. While we are anxious to encourage the activity programme in manual training at all schools, we wish to be certain, before authorizing an expenditure, that the teacher concerned is capable of giving instruction in manual training to the boys and in sewing, knitting etc. to the girls. Please let me have a general report regarding the schools in your agency in this regard. I realize the amounts involved at each school are small, but at the same time there is no use in furnishing materials if the teacher is not sufficiently competent to carry out a proper programme.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDecember 8, 1944\n\nI wish to refer to departmental letter No.19-2-5 dated August 10, 1944, asking for a report as to whether the various school teachers in this Agency were capable of giving instruction in manual training work.\n\nI feel now that the schools are all supplied with teachers, that I can safely say they are all qualified to give instruction in this work, and would ask for authority that material be supplied to the following schools to the extent indicated below:\n\nKaboni School........ $20.00\nRabbit Island School.. 24.00\nSucker Creek.......... 24.00\nWest Bay ............. 25.00\nSheshegwaning......... 20.00\nBuzwah School........ 20.00\n\nAmounts have already been authorized for Wikwemikong and Birch Island Schools.\n\nC.

There are some broken windows to replace, door locks to install, and I have already had to get the furnace repaired, which altogether should not cost more than $10.00 or $12.00.\n\nThe former teacher moved out of the school about August 1st, going to Nobel, Ontario, where her husband is employed in a munition plant and left the school very untidy and dirty. I therefore had to employ some Indians to give the school a thorough cleaning, and also to cut grass and weeds around the school when the new teacher arrived. I have paid from my own pocket $12.15 for this work, and would be pleased to have authority for these expenditures.\n\nC. R.

This has been repaired already at a cost of $4.00 for labour, and $.47 for lumber, which was procured from L. A. Buck of Little Current.\n\nA new lock is required on one class room door, and would advise a heavy thumb latch and night latch, as ordinary locks do not give satisfaction due to frost action at this corner of the building.\n\nThe platforms at classroom entrances, and the toilets also require some repairs, which together with replacing broken windows will cost about $20.00 for labour.\n\nI would be pleased to have authority for these repairs at your earliest convenience.\n\nA requisition for material is enclosed, and with exception of the lumber, the prices are quoted by C.

She has had twenty-two years Provincial teaching experience and six years in Indian Schools. Her teaching methods are rather old fashioned but she certainly believes in keeping the children busy and well occupied throughout the entire school day. As a result she has brought some of these children along very well. Encouraging results can be anticipated. Her children tested quite well and I think we should retain the services of this teacher.\n\n- TEACHERAGE -\n\nThis building is fairly good but faces the wrong way. As a result the six windows are somewhat wasted and the room is dark. The teacher's quarters are quite good although a little old. Apparently the school was built about 1914. There is a very good furnace and the entire building is warm enough the year round. This furnace was installed in 1924. The big difficulty here is the lack of water. The well is dry and the water has to be brought from several hundred yards away. The matter of drilling a well is one that will have to be considered. A new roof will also have to be provided in two or three years. In ordering shingles for the other schools, we are using the same shade and type so that extra shingles can be sent to Kaboni for use next summer.

It would seem evident that we are always going to have difficulty in securing a teacher for this school until we provide for an adequate source of water.\n\nTherefore I would appreciate your having the well digger employed for the Lakeview School give us a report regarding the possibility of digging another well at or near the Kaboni School.

(RG 10, Volume 6137, File 400-5, part 4)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith requisition for supplies, in triplicate, for use at Kaboni Indian Day School.\n\nThe prices quoted were secured from C.W. Hinds, Local Hardware Merchant, and T. Eaton Company, Toronto.\n\nAs these supplies are all quite badly needed, I would recommend they be purchased at an early date.\n\nC. R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Kaboni Indian Day School\n\nWith further reference to obtaining a water supply at the above school, I have located three Indians who will undertake the work at .60\u00a2 per hour, $1.00 per hour for man and team.\n\nFrom careful study of dug wells in the vicinity, I would judge it will be approximately twelve feet to the rock. The soil is heavy clay and it is considered unlikely that we will locate any particular vein of water in this type of soil. I would consider therefore it is most important to have the well large in diameter as the condensation of moisture from the clay soil during the hot weather will be about the only source of replenishing the water supply.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate just what the cost will be but the Indians demand payment at least once a week. In this type of soil and for a well of large diameter, I would suggest the customary stone cribbing as most satisfactory and a cedar platform over the top.\n\nI would suggest $200.00 as a maximum figure and would be pleased to have an advance as early as possible.\n\nDuring Mr. Neary's visit to the Agency in May, it was agreed I believe, to have the classroom ceiling repainted and a wall-board of some kind\ninstalled on one room in living quarters. Miss Leblanc mentioned ten-test which I find difficult to secure here and would suggest Gyproc as superior to ten-test or Insul board and can be obtained locally from C.W. Hinds.\n\nThe materials have been included on a requisition already submitted and I would estimate $125.00 for labour on this work which may be included with advance to dig the well.\n\nC. R.

It has always been customary to supply the necessary dishes and cutlery for teacher's residence; mops, brooms, cleaning materials and tea towelling for the classroom. It is noted that Miss Leblanc did not specify the tea towelling was for classroom use during the winter when hot lunch is served.\n\nIt is also noted that wick and chimneys for Aladdin Lamp are allowed but not the mantles.\n\nA mouse proof flour bin is urgently needed and the galvanized container intended for garbage is the only thing available locally that would serve the purpose.\n\nMiss Leblanc will also be very disappointed at not receiving the usual allotment for manual training.\nI was under the impression the Department wished to encourage the teaching of Manual Training in their schools and I am sure the omission must be an oversight.\n\nI would therefore respectfully request that this requisition be reviewed again as there are several articles omitted that are most essential and unless there has been a drastic change in policy would not be supplied by the Teacher.\n\nC.

Johnston,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 3rd instant\nwith reference to requisition which you forwarded for\nsupplies for the Kaboni School.\n\nWe feel that there are several items\non this requisition which should be supplied by the teacher.\nHowever, in view of the good work done by Miss Leblanc,\nwe have decided to approve all the articles on your requis-\nition of July 16 which you consider are absolutely necessary.\n\nWe will also allow an amount of $25.00\nto purchase manual training supplies.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to refer to my letter dated July 22, 1948 with reference to digging a well and making some other repairs at Kaboni School.\n\nThe cost of the well was estimated at $200.00 and other repairs at $125.00. An advance cheque for $125.00 was received and applied on digging the well which is now completed with the exception of a covering and installation of pump. It would probably be advisable to have a concrete covering over the stone cribbing.\n\nThe well is costing more than was anticipated as it was considered we would strike rock at ten or twelve feet. The digging was very hard for the first ten feet and we did not contact rock until a depth of seventeen feet.\n\nThe cost of labour on the well to date is $253.20 and will cost probably fifty dollars more to complete the covering in addition to the pump.\n\nI would therefore be pleased to have a further advance of $200.00 to complete the well and proceed with renovating interior of the school at the earliest convenience.\n\nC.

Apparently, they had kept school open June 6th to make up for this. Possibly a good idea but one that should have been sanctioned by the local Superintendent.\n\nA walk consisting of large flat stones had been laid from the gate to the entrance. It was very rough and I would consider it dangerous. It would be preferrable to raise the walk out of the surrounding clay with either crushed stone or cement.\n\nA number of minor repairs and painting are required. This will be covered by Mr. Johnston.\nJuly 21st, 1949.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nRe: Kaboni Indian Day School\n\nIn a recent report received from Regional Supervisor Matters, he refers to the walk leading to the above school.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mrs. Neary,\n\nMay I ask you an advice? The men are here to paint the school. The lower part of the classroom floor, about four feet from the floor, is of beautiful B.C. fir and if varnished over would still be prettier. The men tell me that they have had orders to paint it color buff. I'm sorry to see them hide beautiful wood with paint color buff. I thought before they get to work painting it, may I ask you to give me permission to leave it as it is?\n\nI have something else to tell you. Last spring, I got the children to put flat stones from the gate up to the steps of the platform, leading to the classroom.\n\nIndian Affairs.

While we were away on a picnic in June, Mr. Montour and a Dept. man came to the school. His Dept. man told Mr. Montour that this stone walk was too dangerous for the children, they could fall and hurt themselves and that we should take all those stones away from there. Nobody got hurt yet. The men think they will be able to let us have a couple bags of cement after they are finished with their work here.\n\nI know how to prepare the cement and shall teach the children to do so if you let me do it. It is such a muddy place around the school in the spring and in the fall, I thought this walk could help keep the floor cleaner.\n\nI hope I'm not giving you too much trouble with this letter, and thank you very much in anticipation for everything.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEdith Leblanc\nMiss E. Leblanc,\nKaboni Indian Day School,\nKaboni, Ont.,\n\nDear Miss Leblanc:\n\nI have for answer your letter of October 1st and wish to advise that the Department is painting all the dark brown woodwork in its day schools a light green or buff colour.\n\nThis is being done on the advice of lighting officials who claim that this dark brown colour in the classroom has a darkening effect.\n\nMr. Matters has spoken to me with regard to the walk which you have placed leading to the school steps. The main point is that this walk must not be dangerous to the children. If you are careful in setting these stones evenly in cement then we are prepared to have the walk laid.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

They are talking about coming to an arrangement whereby one of them will draw off the reserve and leave it to one denomination, but so far there is nothing definite settled.\n\nIf such a thing should take place we have no knowledge of what they will do with their churches.\n\nI think the wish was rather to the thought as it would be more convenient for Miss Little to have the school close to her boarding house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nDeputy Super.

Little:\n\nMiss Little has been teaching at Kettle Point, in the northerly part of the County of Lambton on Lake Huron for the past two years and is paid a salary of $250 per annum from the funds of the Band. She is 33 years old and only holds a High School Entrance Certificate. Mr Public School Inspector Barnes visits this school semi-annually and his last report is sent herewith. In a prior report the Inspector says that the teacher is doing as well as he could expect her to. All the pupils of school age, -17- are enrolled and the average attendance for last year was 12.\n\nThe teacher attributes the want of greater progress to the lack of punctuality on the part of pupils.\n\nNo previous complaints have been received regarding this teacher, who is reported by the Inspector to be \"fairly satisfactory in her work as a teacher\".\n\nDeputy Supt: Genl:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nIndian Affairs.

English Esq:\nIndian Agent\nSarnia, Ont.\nIndian Office,\n\nSarnia, 30 March 1897\n\nThis is to certify that I was acting as interpreter at Kettle Point 18th February when the Indian Agent Mr. English was holding an investigation into the charges made by the school children against Miss Sittler, the lady teacher at Kettle Point Reserve. The two witnesses were examined under oath and other witnesses that were expected to give evidence did not appear on account of sickness.\n\nThere was no charge that was made against the teacher was not taken and it was this that she was seen by Sutton Shikkanee, a respectable Indian of the Reserve that Miss Sittler was making water in front of the store in the school room.\n\nP.S. Should think the charges that have been made were well established, and that she should be dismissed.\n\nW.W.\n\nMEMO.\nKettle Point 18th July 1897.\n\nMoses George sworn and said,\n\nMiss Little, the school teacher of this Reserve, dismissed the school before 4 o'clock in the afternoon about 3 p.m., this has been done frequently by the teacher.\n\n2. I have seen Miss Little washing her drawers in the water pail that we use to get our drinking water during school hours. This took place in the winter of 1896 and I saw her doing the same thing in the spring of the same year. She claimed that she washed at both times were white. The washing was done in the school room.\n\nDavid Shabwahno sworn and said,\n\nI have attended the Kettle Point School. The teacher dismissed the school generally at 3 p.m., and I saw her (Miss Little) washing her underclothing in the winter of 1896 and another time in the spring of the same year. We used the same pail to get our drinking water while at school.\n\nAlso Miss Little taking her drawers out of the pail with a stick.\n\nDavid Shabwahno.\n\nWitness\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She dismisses the school before 4 p.m.,\n2. She uses the water-pail provided for the school children to get drinking water to wash her under clothing during school hours.\n\nIf she is guilty of this 2nd charge she should not be retained as teacher.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nThomas George.\n\nTrue Copy, [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6138, File 401-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to little P. school, I beg to state that in my letter of 9th inst., I said that Miss Little would be giving up that school. On February 16th, I had an offer from Mr. George concerning her, but I believe little fell into habits and on February 18th I went up to little P. and took little Miss Warren back. I interpreted with her to investigate the charges and have Mr. George make out a charge on a definite form. There was one thing which the Indians complained that I advised him not put in the charge against Miss Little, and she did not. After the investigation was over, I asked Miss Little to send me her resignation which I fully expected she would do, after waiting a few weeks and not receiving her resignation, I sent Miss Little a letter requesting her to do so, but she did not think it worth her while to even reply to any letter until last week and then she refuses to give up the school. I wrote the feeling on 2nd inst., but tried to reason with her but she would not listen to me, and she makes all kinds of threats and says she will not give up the school until she is put out by force.\n\nDeputy Sect. Gen.\nIndian Affairs\n\nAttache\nI visited the school on 26th inst. The number of pupils in attendance were four boys. I asked to see the Register and the teacher told me she had left it at her boarding house. It is utterly insane to imagine that she has worked wonders in the school she says she does not want others to reap where she has sown. There is no doubt but that her influence in the school is gone and many of the children will not go to school while she is teaching. I thought by asking this little to resign that she would get away without exposing herself as I dislike to do any person harm if it is possible to avoid it and especially a woman. I might say that this little was not employed for and definite period of time. I herewith enclose a copy of the evidence taken in the investigation. You will please advise me on this matter by return mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

I have very little comment to make further than to explain why the school was only open for nineteen days. There would under ordinary circumstances have been two weeks in August and about 2 days in September but for the holiday season while I was up at Stony Point trying to get the foundation of the School house there ready for it to open at the right time. I watched on the case of small pox at Stony Point and immediately took steps to have it stamped out. Amongst precautions taken was the vaccination of all unvaccinated persons and all the school children were vaccinated and just when the school should have been opened they were laid up and the doctor said they were in an unfit condition to attend school so the council and myself and Doctor Patterson decided to let the school remain closed until the children were fit to attend. Besides this at first there was great excitement in the neighborhood especially at Upperwood Beach between Kettle Point and Stony Point where Dr. A.B. McCallum Principal Walter of Our College and a number of other London people with ministers of different churches were holidaying. In summer time it is quite a large village then) something had to be done to restore confidence and the fact that the schools were closed and the infected houses quarantined with a constable on guard and general vaccination enforced soon quieted things. At first Dr. McCallum and others wanted the two reserves quarantined also and all Indians penned in on their reserves but things are now in their normal condition and the schools are going on and the Inspector I think has made his visit. I also enclose a requisition for supplies from Mrs. George.\n\nFinding this is satisfactory I remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam Hackett\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 7, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that the outbreak of smallpox at Stony Point has been stamped out and that the attendance at the schools is normal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nWilliam Nisbet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGarnia, Ont.\nSarnia,\nApril 28th, 1911.\n\nReferring to yours of the 25th inst.,\n\nI found, while visiting the school at Kettle Point, a very small attendance indeed, which was accounted for from the fact that whooping cough and German measles are prevailing on the Reserve. Young and old, in many cases, are afflicted with these diseases which I trust will soon pass away and the school will take the usual standing.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. C. Palmer,\nAgent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAss't Deputy & Sec.\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith quarterly report of the Kettle Point school made out by Mrs. McKinnon and am sorry indeed to have to say that the conduct of Mr. McKinnon was such as to force his wife to give up her work at Kettle Point and the school is, therefore, now without a teacher.\n\nI saw Mr. McKinnon at the time his wife was engaged to take the school and he seemed quite satisfied that she should do so. She made provisions for him by arranging that he should take his meals at a house near their home and he would sleep at home but she had scarcely left town before he went off and got drunk. She came down on Saturday last to see how things were going to find him in the house in a drunken stupor. The neighbours report that he had had other drunken fellow in with him.\n\nShe of course was greatly exercised over the matter and came to the office and I scarcely knew what to say but was forced to admit that if he was going to act in this manner that I could not press her to carry out her agreement to teach the school. However, she returned to Kettle Point on Sunday morning early and in the afternoon who should put in an appearance but McKinnon and he simply stayed around the place refusing to come away without her.\n\nHe certainly has acted the part of an imbecile but there seems to be no remedy except for her to remain at home. She seems to have a very good control over him and he works well excepting when he takes drink but he very seldom does when she is around. The doctor holds out no encouragement to expect Mrs. George to take up her duties again before the first of next year and I do not know where to find a teacher.\nThe only one available is Edwin Menass. He applied you will remember at the time Miss Weaver did for the Stony Point school. Miss Weaver was given the preference.\n\nEd is a very nice lad and I am sure will do the very best he can but one difficulty is that he is without experience but I think it would be far better to have him undertake the work than to close the school entirely for the balance of the year. I will await your instructions. If you think well to have Menass go out please telegraph me so that he can commence on Monday next. Mrs. McKinnon was at some expense and put in some time which I think she should be settled with for as she is not really to blame for results and feels very badly over the condition of things growing out of the conduct of her husband.\n\nI will send a statement in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR. G. Palmer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAss't Deputy & Sec.\nOttawa, Ont.\nSEND the following NIGHT LETTER subject to the terms printed on the back hereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nOttawa, October 12, 1912.\n\nR. G. Palmer,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\nMay appoint Edwin Menass temporarily to teach Kettle Point School on the understanding that he is to give up position when qualified teacher is secured. Mrs. McKinnon should send in report for time she taught this school when Department will settle with her.\n\nS. Stewart.\n\nCharge to Dept. of I.A.\nOttawa, October 14, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to confirm the following telegram sent you on the 12th instant:- \"May appoint Edwin Menass te mporarily to teach Kettle Point school on the understanding that he is to give up position when qualified teacher is secured. Mrs. McKinnon should send in report for time she taught this school when Department will settle with her.\"\n\nIn this connection I beg to state, however, that it is to be understood that the appointment of Mr. Menass is only temporary and the salary for the time he is engaged will be at the rate of $300.00 per annum. It is to be hoped that Mrs. George will be able to resume her duties after the Christmas holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nR. G. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nNot being at my office I cannot refer to folio and date but trust you will have no difficulty in tracing the matter to which I am about to refer.\n\nOn reaching home from the hospital I was surprised to be informed that Edwin Menass who had been appointed to teach the school at Kettle Point on account of Mrs. George's illness, had not taught some two or three weeks and without intimating to me his dissatisfaction or his intention to give up, closed the school and went home. I cannot understand his conduct. My informant tells me that he thought it was something about the salary. I remember writing him as per your instructions, that his salary would be $300 not $360 as Mrs. George was receiving. It would appear that on receipt of this letter or very soon afterwards he gave up the school. Had he reported to me his dissatisfaction with the salary I certainly would have communicated with the Department and no doubt the little difference would have been paid rather than have the school closed. He has not yet come to me and I don't know when I will see him.\n\nI am, therefore, unable to send in any report; in fact a report for the quarter ending Dec. 31st would be almost a blank.\n\nHis conduct is such that he is really undeserving of any payment for the time he did serve, however one can scarcely deal with these Indians as they would with white people; they seem to be so strange in their make-up. You will decide this matter and instruct me in the same.\n\nMrs. George is getting along nicely and expects to take up her work at the beginning of the year.\n\nAwaiting your instructions,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6138, File 401-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. C. Palmer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAss't Deputy & Sec.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 7, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in reference to the Kettle Point School. In reply I beg to say that the Department hopes that Mrs. George has now resumed her duties and would be glad to be advised in regard to this.\n\nYou may forward a quarterly return covering the time that Menass was in charge of the school and, if found correct, the Department will make payment for the time at the rate of $300.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. G. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nReferring to yours of 7th inst.,\n\nI regret to say that I unintentionally omitted replying to the portion of your letter inquiring with reference to Mrs. George and would say that she resumed her duties at the beginning of the year and so far as I know is quite well and getting along nicely.\n\nEddy Menass called in yesterday; the first I have seen of him, and I found that I was misinformed with reference to the time he taught. He told me that he was in charge of the school until the early part of December. I sent a blank report some days ago to Mrs. George with a request that she would make up a return from the registry and let me have it as soon as possible.\n\nI am expecting it every day and will forward it as soon as I can.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. C. Palmer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAss't Deputy & Sec.\nOttawa, Ont.\nSarnia, Sept. 8th 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have already commented on Mrs George's application for a vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR.C. Palmer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa, Ont.\nReferring to your letter of above date would say that I will comply with your wish at the end of this quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nOttawa, August 4, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nAs a result of the inquiries made by Mr. MacKenzie of this Department into the suggested amalgamation of the Kettle Point and Stony Point Schools I beg to say that the Department does not consider that this would be practicable owing to the distance and want of suitable school accommodation. It has, therefore, been decided to continue both these schools and the services of the present teachers will be retained for the present.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to inform the parents that they must send their children regularly to school or otherwise the Department will have to resort to the enforcement of the Regulations, which provide for the commitment to industrial schools of children who fail to take advantage of the day schools in their vicinity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. Maxwell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. R.H. ABRAM ON THE KETTLE POINT DAY SCHOOL,\n\nThere are 43 pupils of school age on this reserve. The average attendance since January is 12. There were five present the day of my visit. The children at this school are more progressive than at the Stoney Point school, but they are not up to the standard according to their ages. This is due to the irregularity of attendance. The teacher, Mrs. George would get good results, if the children would attend more regular.\nOttawa, July 15th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. R.H. Abraham, recently, visited the Kettle Point day school, and he states that out of an enrolment of 43, there has been, only, an average attendance of 12 since last January.\n\nOn August 4th, 1915, you were instructed to inform the parents that they must send their children to school, or, otherwise the regulations would have to be enforced.\n\nApparently, there has been no improvement in the attendance, and, I have to request that you will at once point out to the Indians that by the Regulations the Department is able to enforce regular attendance at school, and that if they do send their children when the school reopens in the fall, these regulations will be enforced.\n\nAt the end of September, you should submit a report on the attendance at this school, so that the Department will be able to judge if the attendance is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nT.

Jan 24th, on account of an enteric disease said by the Doctor to be chicken pox - but it was thought best to close the school as the young man who had the disease had been working in Sarnia where there were some cases of smallpox on Jan. 14th & another family took the disease.\n\nThe school house is very cold and weather has been stormy.\n\nMrs. Angus George\nTeacher\n| No. | Name          |

Mrs. George (Teacher), reopened school again on Monday of this week, but none of her pupils came to school. He informs me that schools and churches in the white settlement adjoining the Reserve are all closed. I am writing Mrs. George advising her to close the Kettle Point School until the end of the present month.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your favorable approval, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, February 23, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant informing the Department that the day school at Kettle Point has been closed during the week ending the 14th instant and that you have instructed Mrs. George, the teacher, to keep the school closed till the end of the present month.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if you and the doctor consider it advisable, in the interests of the health of the pupils, this school may remain closed until the first of March, next. The teacher, in preparing her quarterly return for the current quarter, should give the dates during which the school is closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

You should instruct the truant officer that it is expected that he will see that the children attend regularly and there should be no reasons for the pupils being absent so many days during each month. It is expected that there will be a decided improvement in the attendance at this school after the Christmas holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos.

There will, no doubt, be vacancies after that time, and you might communicate with Mr. G. M. Campbell, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont., or Mr. Thos. McGookin, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont., with a view to a change after the summer holidays. There may be vacancies for teachers in their Agencies at that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I have been in communication with Mr. Conn, Public School Inspector, and up to the present time, he does not know of any teacher for this school.\n\nThere are two teachers living on the Kettle and Stony Point Reserve who have both taught school, Mrs. Robt. McKinnon, Stony Pt. and John Milliken, Kettle Point (both Indians or half breeds). I was in conversation with John Milliken a short time ago, and he consented to teach the Kettle Point School providing we could not secure a qualified teacher. I believe that he is quite capable and qualified to teach the Kettle Point School, and if no other teacher can be secured I would recommend the appointment of John Milliken until such time as a qualified teacher might be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 29, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, informing the Department that you have been unable to secure a qualified teacher to fill the vacancy in the Kettle Point Indian Day School, and recommending that John Milliken be appointed temporarily, until such time as a qualified teacher can be obtained.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the temporary appointment of John Milliken, to begin duties on September 5th, next, the date on which the schools re-open after the present summer holidays. It is to be distinctly understood that his employment is to be temporary. It is noted that he has had some teaching experience.\n\nThe salary allowed Mr. Milliken will be at the rate of $500 per annum, plus bonus provided by law. You may inform him of his temporary appointment and arrange for him to begin duties on the above date. You should, however, keep in mind the necessity of obtaining a qualified teacher and, if possible, one should be secured by the first of October, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nKettle Point Forest\n\nOct. 21st, 1924.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to thank you for your kind letter of the 17th inst., stating \"the Department have approved of an increase of my salary of $58.07 a year for teaching at Kettle Point Bay School,\" and I further beg to thank you and the Department for their kind consideration of this matter.\n\nI remain Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarold D. Watts\nI am taking this opportunity to bring to your attention the necessity for a new school building at Kettle Point.\n\nThe present school house is altogether too small for the number enrolled. The desks are crowded too closely together and it is necessary in some instances to seat three pupils at one double desk. The building itself is old and rather than spend any money on repairs it would be advisable to erect a new school with teacher's residence included.\n\nThe parents are taking more interest in sending their children to school and are anxious to have better accommodation.\n\nIn this connection it would be as well to give some consideration to a central school for the two reserves. From a casual survey of the situation, I think that this is a matter which Schools Branch should give careful consideration. There are never more than ten or eleven pupils at Stony Point School. This seems to be too few to warrant the expense of upkeep and teacher's salary. The Kettle Point school would be better situated if built up on the hill, near the church. This would bring it much closer to Stony Point reserve and an arrangement could probably be made for transportation of pupils daily to the school and return. I mention this only as a suggestion for consideration and not as a proposition, which has been given careful thought. I do, however, strongly recommend a new school for Kettle Point reserve and that the location be changed to a more central point.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI have discussed with Mr. Inspector Parker and Mr. Mackenzie, both of whom have looked into school matters at Kettle Point and Stony Point, and I believe that the present building at Stony Point should be used as long as there are sufficient pupils available to warrant the activity. At Kettle Point a combined school and residence should be erected at the first opportunity, on a site near the church. The Band Capital Account shows $44,912.08.\n\nMr. Parker informs me that they will be under heavy expense for roads, etc., during the next few years and he recommends that a Vote of Parliament be secured. I am trying to arrange to have the money provided for the building season of 1925.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNovember 25, 1924.\nKettle Point\n\nTo Mr. Judge\n\nWe, the undersigned parents and guardians of the Kettle Point day school do hereby request an Indian Dept. to place a qualified teacher in our school.\n\nWe find that our present teacher Mr. Wai is not the kind of teacher we would like to see teaching our children.\n\nLast spring he sent three of his students to the Muncey Institute. He told us that they had been very nearly passing their examinations, and that they would be able to pass in three months when they got the teachers' practical fine subjects which they never saw before, and they were very pleased at passing the entrance exam.\n\nAngus George thought he would not be able to teach children this far advanced in his school and he does not have those same three jobs.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI have discussed with Mr. Inspector Parker and Mr. MacKenzie, both of whom have looked into school matters at Kettle Point and Stony Point, and I believe that the present building at Stony Point should be used as long as there are sufficient pupils available to warrant the activity.

The teachers presented five subjects they had never seen before, and they were longways from passing the entrance. And he told Angus George that he would not undertake to teach children this far advanced in his school, and he does not like to have those same three go back to his school.\nIf the Indian Dept wishes to know how far advanced those three pupils were advanced they could get the reports at the Institute. At Muncy Oat he told them last Friday that all he would do is to send a telegram to the Indian Dept and they would be taken right back to the Muncy Institute.\n\nWithin the last four or five weeks he lets the school about 2 o'clock in the afternoon and goes to work painting the new School. He would rather paint than to perform his duty there are plenty of good painters around here that would be glad to take that work.\n\nLast Friday his pupils told him the people was saying he was making double money by letting the school out early and go painting and he got indignant and he told them what is mentioned above about sending those three back to the Muncy Institute and he knows very well that he cannot do it.\n\nSome of the parents are not sending their children to school because they only get a half day schooling on Fridays.\nthe younger children say when the older ones are not at school he runs the indian people down as if they were nothing at all, and most of the children say that they can do as they like in school during school hours and he does not make them mind.\n\nMr Beattie Greenwood tried to place his son Sammy Greenwood in a white school first he tried the Ravenwood School and the trustees told him that it was far worse work for to put his pupils right through the Entrance Examination and if he could not do it he had no business to be in any school trying to teach. He came we had the right to have a qualified in our school as well as any other school again Mr Greenwood tried another school and he got the same answer from the trustees.\n\nThe Walpole Island people told some the Kettle Point people they expelled Mr Watt from their school because he was no good\nand he was not teaching their children and we the undersigned hereby ask the Indian Dept. to have due consideration for our children it has been understood that the government would like to see the indian children well educated and the time has come for them to do as requested please answer at once\n\nChief Shawano\nBeattie Greenbird\nMrs. Beattie Greenbird\nThomas George\nMrs. Amos Shawano\nWilliam F.

With reference to discipline, I have visited his school quite frequently and find the discipline in Mr. Watt's School compares very favourable with the other Indian Day Schools. With reference to painting, the New School, Mr. Watt, has done this work after school hours, Saturdays, and Holidays, which the Labour Sheets will fully show. With reference to communication, I don't think that Ex-Chief Shawnoo has a child attending this school, and possibly many others are in the same position.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

I told Mr. Paul that if Mr. Watts was unable to resume duties by the 23rd instant, or for some time thereafter, he should engage a substitute. He stated that there is a Miss McIntyre, who has had two years' high school training, who should be satisfactory as a temporary teacher, and I told the Agent to use his own discretion, and, if he considers it advisable, to appoint her as substitute for a month, and that the Department would allow her $75 per month.

It is hoped that Mr. Watts will be able to resume duties at an early date, and, in the meantime, this school may remain closed.\n\nMr. Watts, in preparing his return for the current quarter, should state thereon the dates between which the school was closed on account of his illness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

D. Watts, teacher of the Kettle Point Indian Day School. It is now considered, in view of his advanced age and in the interests of the Indian children at this school, that a change should be made in the teaching services for the next school year, beginning September 1, 1933. While Mr. Watts has given faithful service, it is thought that the general tone of the school and advancement of the children would be improved if the services of a younger teacher, having the necessary qualifications, were obtained.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will inform Mr. Watts that his services will not be required after the end of the present school year, viz., the 30th instant. Mr. Watts should vacate the residence, moving his personal belongings, not later than the middle of August, next, after which time you should make an inventory of the Government property on hand and forward same to the Department. You should see that the school property is well secured until a new teacher arrives.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain a teacher to succeed Mr. Watts, and I would request that you take up the matter with the provincial school inspector with a view to nominating the services of a qualified teacher, one having at least second class professional qualifications. You will be aware as to whether it is preferable to engage a male or female teacher for this school. The name, qualifications and experience of any applicants received by you, with your recommendation, should be submitted to the Department in due time. It is considered, as our funds are limited, that the services of a fully qualified teacher could be obtained at a salary of $80 per teaching month, less the 10 percent during the present fiscal year. It may be that a fully qualified teacher could be obtained at a lower salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. C. McCormick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\nA. F.

I should be obliged to ask for these two days off if I am to write the examinations. That will leave only one more day of school.\n\nI have had a very large beginners class this spring (14) and getting ready their work day by day has kept me in the classroom till dinner time every night and very often long afterwards. For this reason, I have not had as much time as I should have liked to get my own examination work ready, and I am wondering if I might secure permission to close the school for the Summer vacation on the 21st of this month so that I may get a few extra days of 'cramming'. I have already finished the entire year's work with all the grades, and am at present reviewing their work, so that the children would not suffer in any way, and I MIGHT gain some advantage.\n\nI shall be grateful if you will give the matter your kind consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was away also from Feb. 10th to 19th inclusive. I was unable to get in touch with the Agent on account of his illness. The following days there was no school held, although I was present, the schoolroom heated and the bell rang both morning and afternoon: Jan. 23, 24 and 27, Feb. 4 and 5 and Feb. 20 and 21. This was attributable partly to an epidemic of measles and partly to the severe weather. You will see that they precede and follow my own absence. I phoned to the Reserve several times while I was away. I purpose teaching on Maunday Thursday as all the children on the Reserve are Protestants and there is no Service in either Church. I am quite willing to teach through Easter week also. I have not tried to make it up on Saturdays as I have found from experience that it is not satisfactory here. Half of the children do not attend and the work only has to be repeated the following Monday. I say there is no benefit - there is that of obtaining the number of days, but little of help to the children. However, I am ready to keep the school open Saturdays if you wish.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Naturally I am very pleased with the results, and I think that the whole training has had an excellent effect on the community life. The parents have co-operated to an unexpected extent and by their own efforts raised the money to clothe and transport the children. I am hoping that somehow or other I may arrange to have the instruction carried on for at least another year. Dr. Whitehead assured me privately that there was no reason why they should not make a good showing at the National Festival in London. This will be held in November. The children have readily agreed to come for music once a week through the Summer if I can arrange for the money to carry on the lessons. This, would, of course, be necessary if they are to enter the Fall Festival. In any event, we are grateful for the help already given.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Forest Fair Board have offered them a fee of fifteen dollars for three numbers together with a further amount of ten dollars to be divided between this School and the one at Stony Point for competition of Indian School work.\n\nNaturally, my reply was that I should have to consult the department. If there is no objection on your part I should like to complete this arrangement as in this manner I could realize sufficient funds to cover the musical instruction for the Dominion Musical Festival to be held in London in November and continue it through the year in an attempt to successfully defend the County trophy which they already hold.\n\nThe parents would, I know, be delighted to have the children do this work and their attitude toward the whole of the musical education has been most stimulating. They have already discussed various means of raising the tuition for next year amongst themselves, but I would prefer this method if possible. The principal thing as I see it is in the broadening of the child's outlook as well as an opportunity to appear before the public.\n\nI shall appreciate your kind consideration of the whole matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am anxious to do so again this year. It will be held in the afternoon, May 5th, in Sarnia. This necessitates a half-day away from the school and the part of the pupils and myself.\n\nI feel that the participation of the children in this Festival is a direct benefit to them. This year they have provided the funds for their instruction themselves. The test piece is difficult and they have already spent many weeks on it. Naturally, they are keen to defend the trophy which they won last year. I shall be grateful for the necessary permission.\n\nMy experience last year was that after singing both afternoon and evening and then driving home a considerable distance there was a very poor attendance the following day, and those who did attend were very tired. The thought occurred to me that I might be allowed to teach one extra day before Easter and then close the school the day following the Festival. Would this arrangement be satisfactory, and in that event should I transfer the attendance from this to the next Quarter? We already have one extra day in, but that was included in last Quarter's Return. Through a mistake school was held on the present King's birthday.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6138, File 401-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOn Monday a.m., October 11, 1937, I received a call from Alfred GREENBURG, (Indian) from Kettle Pt., Indian Reservation complaining that the above mentioned held a party on Sunday Night, October 10, 1937, in the Indian School house at Kettle Point. This Indian complained that George Dill had liquor in the school room and when he went to see what was going on, he noticed men and women inside drinking stout beer. He entered and was offered a drink of Gin. He claims that he does not drink but took the bottle and tried to get out of the School room with it as evidence of what was going on and was beaten up by two of the men in the party, namely Jack Shepherd and Herb. Wettlaufer.\n\nThat a.m., accompanied by Cst.H.A.Dawson, I patrolled per Pol.Chev.,Coach,Code #2385, to the Kettle Point Indian Reserve to investigate the complaint. First going to the Greenburg home, I found there were four of them claiming to have seen Herb.Wettlaufer attempt to hit Alfred Greenburg with a baseball bat - which they turned over to me. Alfred told me the bottle of Gin got smashed when they were trying to get it away from him.\n\nGoing to the School-house, we found the benches moved back, the doors open and Mrs.Grant Milligan (an Indian woman whom Greenburg claims he saw sitting in at the party with a glass of liquor in her hand) in charge of the place and cleaning up after the party. She informed me that she was Mr.Dill's house-keeper and denied any knowledge of the goings-on the night previous. Examination of the School-room showed signs of the party by stains and blood on the floor, bearing out the Indians claim of a fight. At the door leading outside were hanging strips of wood upon which was found a considerable amount of black hair. Alfred Greenburg claimed they held him by the hair and beat him at the door.\n\nA search of the place was made and while no liquor was found, there were a considerable number of empty beer bottles in the teacher's residence, which is built onto the School-house and is connected with the class-room by a door. At this point George Dill returned and readily admitted having a party there with liquor purchased on his Permit and having the liquor in the School-room, he did not remember seeing much of the fight. At the party was, Mrs.Nellie Mae FRANKS (white), Stratford,Ont., and at present living in her Summer Cottage at Ipperwash Beach. She was convicted here last Summer under Sec.42(1) of the Liquor Control Act and fined $100.00 and costs. With her was Herb.WETTLAUFER, who works for her and is said to be a bootlegger. There was also a Mrs.Maude HARRISON, from Chicago, Ill.,U.S.A.,now living with Mrs.Frank, Mr.and Mrs.Jack SHEPHERD, a well known bootlegger from Forest,Ont., was also there with his Brother Carl \"Pitty\" Shephord and Duncan BUTLER from Strathroy,Ontario.\n\nFile numbers must be...\nSarnia, Ont., Oct., October 13, 1937.\n\nReport, continued -\nRe: George DILL, (Teacher for Ind., Dept.)\nKettle Pt., Indian Reserve, Ontario.\n\n5.

Wettkaufer, who are being Summoned to appear in Court at Forest, Ont., on Friday, October 15, 1937.\n\n6. If this School-house is considered by the Indian Department to be on Kettle Point Indian Reserve land, then Dill is liable under the Indian Act for having liquor on the Reserve and several of his party for being intoxicated on the Reserve. Action is deferred owing to the fact that the Indian Agent here informs me he is not sure whether or not the Kettle Point School and Lot is part of the Reserve. Could this point be cleared up by the Dept., please and further instructions given. At this point it might be pointed out that if this land does not come under the Indian Act there is a very definite breach of the Liquor Control Act (Ontario) by having liquor in other than a private dwelling, namely in a Public School-house.

D.C.I.\n\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nJS/MD\nD.D. 25-10-37.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report that on Sunday evening, Oct. 10th, Mr. George Dill, teacher at the Kettle Point Indian Day School, held a Thanksgiving dinner and party at the teacher's residence at the Kettle Point School. At this party were 15 or 20 guests, white people. The tables were set in the class-room of the school and from reports received there was evidently liquor at the party and considerable noise. The liquor is alleged to have been kept in the school room.\n\nCorporal Chisholm, R.C.M.P., reported the matter to me on Monday evening, Oct. 11th, and Mr. Dill also came to see me the same evening, along with some of the guests at the party. I took them around to see Corp. Chisholm, so that he might interview them. I would say that from reports on some of these people they should not have been allowed on the Reserve, especially at a party at the teacher's residence.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Oct. 12th, Alfred Greenbird, and his father Beattie Greenbird, of the Kettle Point Band, called at the office and reported the party, stating that when Alfred Greenbird went to the School on Sunday evening to investigate the noise, he had entered the school room and attempted to seize a bottle of liquor there, after having been offered a drink. A fight ensued for possession of the liquor and Greenbird left without it. He later returned with his father, Beattie Greenbird, to the school to get the numbers of the cars, and claims he was attacked by one of the men with a baseball bat, belonging to the school. The Indians took the bat and later handed it over to Corp. Chisholm. Greenbird informed me he was laying a charge against two of the men at the party of assaulting him.\n\nAs Corp. Chisholm informed me he was making a report on the case, I decided to wait until the trial of the assault case, before making my report. The trial was held at Forest, on Oct. 15, and while the Magistrate dismissed the assault charge, he ordered\n\n--that all--\nthat all the guests at the party be summoned, to appear before his court on a charge of consuming liquor in an illegal place, and that the case would be tried, either under the Indian Act, if the school house was part of the Reserve, or under the Liquor Control Act. I am enclosing, herewith, a copy of the Sarnia Canadian Observer with an account of the trial of the assault charge and the party.\n\nI regret very much that this incident has happened. Mr. Dill called on me and admitted that the party had been held and that there was liquor in the class-room. He was evidently returning hospitality, which he had received during the summer, from the cottagers at Ipperwash Beach, but should certainly not have held his party at his residence or the class-room, nor on Sunday night, and one or two of the guests were people with whom he should not have any connection with, especially with regard to his position as teacher of the Kettle Point School.\n\nAs you will see, the matter has been given a lot of adverse publicity, not only for Mr. Dill, but for the Kettle Point School and Reserve as well. Mr. Dill is an exceptional teacher and has given fine service at this school. He has not only had the confidence and respect of the pupils, but of the parents as well. The Greenbird family were probably one of the few families who had anything against him. The school house was used as a community centre at nights by the residents of the Reserve, and the teacher was held in very high esteem. There is no doubt, however, this will lessen his influence over the children and his prestige on the Reserve.\n\nWhile this is a matter for the decision of the Department, taking into consideration the excellent record of Mr. Dill as a teacher at Kettle Point School, I would strongly recommend that he be granted all the consideration possible. He is a single man, young, living alone on the Reserve, and no doubt thought he could have this party without it becoming known around the Reserve. As far as the report goes, of his having parties there all summer, I have never had any reports or complaints, nor have the Mounted Police. No doubt he had friends call on him over the week ends.\n\nAny further information you may desire, I will be glad to forward.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent\n\nT. R.

The complaint arose because there was a noisy party being held in the Indian School-room. That he went in to investigate and the Teacher, George Dill offered him a drink of liquor. As he took the bottle to give to the R.G.M.P. as evidence, the defendant and John Shepherd of Forest, Ont., attacked him and smashed the bottle. Wetlaufer swore that he was invited to the party in the Indian School house by George Dill, that they had liquor to drink in the school-room.

This party was given in the School-room. The desks were moved back with liquor being served at the dinner and after and right in the class-room. As the students went into the Indian School to investigate, he said Mr. Dill offered him a drink of liquor and as he took the same he gave to the R.C.M.P., as evidence of the kind of party he had. Two men, Shepherd and Wetlaufer attacked him and he had the bottle. The only Defence witness called was Wetlaufer who admitted having a mix up with Alfred Greenbird and trying to get a bottle of liquor from him inside the Indian School, but denied having tried to hit him with the baseball bat outside the school.\n\nThe Magistrate said that the question he had was whether Greenbird had any legal justification for taking the liquor. If he had, then Wetlaufer and Shepherd could not be held responsible for assault. The Crown could not show where he had been assaulted so the case was dismissed. During the discussion His Worship asked Wetlaufer, \"Were there 15 or 20 people there?\" \"No,\" replied the witness. \"Was there a dinner in a class room of a school building?\" \"Yes,\" replied the witness. \"Was there an Department for the education of Indians?\" \"Yes,\" replied the witness. \"Was there any liquor being served?\" \"Yes, Sir,\" replied the witness. \"It is a most disgraceful state of affairs that this can happen.\" \"These 15 or 20 people,\" His Worship said, \"were there to see every one be in front of this Court. Why there was no excuse that it was in the teacher's living quarters. Even if it is not on the Reserve, they can be here in the school. I do not care whether it comes under the Indian Act or not. It is either the Indian Act or the Liquor Act (Ontario).\" \"I never heard of such a thing. Who is this teacher anyway? If Dill is carrying liquor, there should be an investigation and Indians sufficiently interested. They don't seem to understand how I feel about this movement, and I want to insist that it is in the order of things.\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Bldgs.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have been giving considerable thought to that unfortunate affair at Kettle Point. I am inclined to think that Mr. Dill has been the victim of a newspaper trial. At any rate, after making numerous inquiries from friends of mine who reside in the neighborhood of Kettle Point I believe that the story which he tells is substantially correct. He had a perfectly respectable dinner party\u2014nine white people. One of his guests, Mr. Duncan Butler, engaged Wetlaufer to drive him from Ipperwash to the school. When Wetlaufer called for Mr. Butler about 10 o'clock he came into the school and brought Shepherd with him.\n\nI doubt very much if he has ever had a drinking party in the school or in his apartments. People who are intimate with the people on the Reserve assure me that they had never heard a whisper of anything of that kind. And they feel that if rumors of that kind were in circulation they would have heard them.\n\nThe young man has succeeded in getting the Indians, both men and women, interested in the school. That the interest is real is evident from the fact that they have been paying out their own money to provide music in the school. They paid to provide transportation for the children to the musical festival and they are paying for a piano. I regard this as a very remarkable achievement.\n\nI have no desire to advise you how you should deal with the matter. I do not know what you ought to do. If he still holds the confidence and esteem of his pupils and of the people on the Reserve I presume you will have less difficulty in reaching a decision.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPublic School Inspector.\nWires 'You Birds All Wet' to 'Maggie' Cairn Sponsors\n\n\"Have Limb on Which He Hung His Britches,\" Says U.S.\n\n\"Sons\" Honor Poet\n\nSpecial to The Star\n\nHamilton, Oct. 30\u2014The \"Yankee bombastic\" Tennessee editor was honored today by the Native Sons of this city unveiled their memorial to George Dill, the composer of the old ballad, \"When You and I Were Young, Maggie.\"\n\nFrank Graham, editor of the Daily Post Athenian of Athens, Tenn., presented an account of officials of the Native Sons of Canada\u2014Hamilton branch.

Among those present were the teacher at the school and her husband.\n\nThe charges were laid as a sequel to the case in Fenelon Falls where Herbert Wettlaufer was accused of assault with intent.\n\nThe alleged offence occurred when Greenberg entered the school grounds and attempted to seize a bottle of liquor. The assault charge was dropped.\n\nMontreal, Oct. 30\u2014Announcement of the death of Mrs. Louise Vialu was made.\n\nThe woman's body was found on a dark street last night. Detectives quickly traced her to a nearby spot where she was struck by an automobile when they noted her shoes were dry. Apparently rain having fallen all evening. The woman's body was found near the spot, with contents apparently intact.\n\nThe 45-year-old mother of five children, Mrs. Vialu was known to police as a witness in a case when her husband was under detention as a crown witness in another case.\n\nVialu was being held as a material witness for the defense.\n\nDetectives believe the woman was thrown from an automobile. When they arrived at the scene suggesting murder, they called police.\n\nMontreal, Oct. 30\u2014Anti-Communist Mayor Adhemar Baraoult counted a short-lived victory today over the Friends of the Soviet Union.\n\nLess than three hours after the energetic little mayor had addressed a PSU meeting, Communist sympathizers went right ahead with another rally.\n\nEverything was quiet though, until word got out that Mr. Baraoult was going to court to defend his assembly-suppressing powers.\n\nSpeakers told the audience what they thought of supporting the mayor. Afterwards, everybody went home.\n\nMeanwhile, Victor Vakhontoff, minister general and Revolutionary communist general, said he was pleased at the meeting was similar to that of thick shoulders, he observed: \"I'm not even displeased.\"\n\nPREDICT NEWSPAPER COST WILL BE INCREASED SOON\n\nPublisher Says Pulp and Production Costs Higher Than Ever\n\nOUT OF PROPORTION\n\nNew York, Oct. 30\u2014Prediction that many newspapers may be forced to raise their circulation rates because of rising newspaper costs came today from W. G. Chandler, chairman of the board of directors of the American Newspaper Publishers Association.\n\nChandler already has asked publishers to protest to newspaper manufacturers for prospective price increases for the newspapers in more than 50 cities of the United States, taken to raise their rates recently because of increased costs, he said.\n\nCosts of newspaper publishing according to statistics tabulated here, have been recorded for out of proportion to increased receipts from advertising and circulation. Costs have jumped ahead of even the most feverish increase in expenses and from additional employment, while receipts have remained below the normal advance.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Police Magistrate criticized Mr. Dill very severely.\n\nMr. Dill has been in our employ for the past 8 years as he was first employed at the Sucker Creek Indian Day School and for the past 4 years at the Kettle Point School. As a teacher, his services have been quite satisfactory.\n\nHowever, in view of the publicity given this case and the further fact that he was convicted under a Section of the Indian Act, I feel that the Department has no alternative than to dispense with his services. If his employment is continued, it is probable that such action would have a bad effect, not only on the Indians but on other Indian school teachers. In addition, the Department is quite likely to be subject to criticism from outside sources.\n\nWith the above in mind, I therefore recommend that Mr. Dill be advised that his services will not be required after December 31, 1937, and I would appreciate receiving your concurrence in order that Mr. Dill may be so notified before the end of the current month.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, November 13, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nIn a letter dated November 5, 1937, from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, I am advised that Mr. George Dill, teacher of the Kettle Point Indian Day School (Electoral District of Lambton-Kent), Sarnia Indian Agency, was convicted on November 2nd for possessing intoxicants on an Indian reserve, under Section 130 of the Indian Act.\n\nThis was the culmination of a party given by the teacher in the Kettle Point School on Thanksgiving Day.

McMillan\nDirector.\nNovember 17, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, showing that Mr. George Dill, teacher of the Kettle Point Indian Day School, was recently convicted under Section 130 of the Indian Act. Other reports and newspaper clippings in connection with the party held at the Kettle Point Indian Day School on October 11th have also been brought to our attention.\n\nAll the reports in connection with this case have been very carefully considered and, as Mr. Dill has always been a successful teacher, the possibility of transferring him to another school received considerable thought. However, such action was not found possible, in view of the very wide publicity that this matter received. We have no alternative but to request Mr. Dill for his resignation, effective December 31, 1937.\n\nImmediately on receipt of this letter, I would appreciate it if you would interview Mr. Dill and discuss the matter with him. If you consider it advisable, you may show him this letter. You should advise the Department of Mr. Dill's decision by the 25th instant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nGeorge W.

Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOTTAWA, Canada\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 25th, it was expected that Mr. Dill would accept the opportunity accorded to him by official letter of November 17th to tender his resignation. As he has not yet decided to do so, it will now be necessary for you to advise him immediately that his services as teacher of the Kettle Point Day School will terminate on December 31, 1937.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Mr. Dill, but, as instructed above, you should also notify him regarding the Department's wishes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nGeo. W. Down, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ontario.\nForest, Ont.,\nNov. 22nd, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI have seen Mr. Down and have asked for time to communicate with you before giving him a reply.\n\nI have simply one request to make - that whatever action you take be withheld until the end of the academic year in June.\n\nMy principle reasons are:\n1. I have been carrying on experimental work, as you know, in social studies and the sciences. I have arrived at the stage where my results are giving the information which I need to standardize and evaluate the work. Naturally, an interruption at this point would mean a serious set-back to that work.\n\n2. The work and accomplishments of the Teachers' Association has been on the greatest interest to me. To this date I have carried on the Executive work practically alone because of the difficulty of distance between members. As I explained to you in my report of last month I accepted the Presidency for only one more year with the understanding that I should gradually pass the management on to the members of the Executive - especially to Mr. Daly who succeeds me as President.\n\n3. My leaving at this time would make it virtually impossible to go into another school and thus the only training that I have would be useless to me.\n\nI have given my work in the Department always as a work of devotion and have attacked it with every power and energy at my command.

However, he may improve and I hope to have a better report in February. The Stony Point teacher is very conscientious, clean and making every effort. I think he got into some little trouble in correcting one of the girls at the start, but after making enquiries I do not think it was very serious, and was able to get the child back to school. There has been a little more sickness this month with colds and such terrible roads, it has kept the attendance down some.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDR. MC GILL\n\nI submit herewith a brief report on a special interest pay trip, accompanied by Mr. George Conley, to the following agencies:\n\nKettle Point Indian Day School was visited.\n\nThere was a noticeable improvement in the cleanliness of the classroom from a previous visit. Everything was found in order, the classroom tidy and clean, and the school grounds very carefully attended to. The average attendance has been very good, chickenpox in some of the homes earlier in the year, brought the attendance down. One family had not been released by the medical officer at the time of my visit.\n\nThos.

I have been able to secure help so far from a source - but will not be able to count on this any longer.\n\nMy abilities are so limited that there simply does not seem to be an opening for me anywhere that I have tried. Then, too, my age is a hindrance in many places.\n\nI am wondering if you could see your way clear to having a talk with Mr. Hoey and seeing if there is a possibility of my getting back into the Department - either in the inside service or in the teaching field. After all that is the work that I know and where I have proven my ability. I think that I have paid the price for whatever mistake I may have made at Kettle Point, and apart from the means of livelihood, I should certainly like to return to the work to which I have given so many years and which holds so deep an interest for me.\n\nIf you could see Mr. Crerar himself it might be helpful. He knows my work, and I understood in the past that he was considering taking me into the Ottawa office in some capacity. Perhaps at this time he might give further consideration to that.\n\nI shall be extremely grateful for anything that you feel you can do, for I am perfectly in earnest when I say that my present situation is desperate.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.)

I am not aware of any position to which he could be appointed at the present time and having in mind what has happened in the past in connection with Mr. Dill I regret that I cannot hold out any hope for his future employment in our work.\n\nEnclosed is Mr. Dill's letter to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. A. McKenzie, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 7, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nInspector Conn, in his report on the Kettle Point Indian Day School, dated May 10, 1939, states:\n\n\"The average daily attendance for the first 4\u00bd months of this year is 17.4, as compared with 20 for a similar period last year. The percentage of attendance is 58% as compared with 67 last year\".\n\nI am anxious that you should discuss with the teacher and, if convenient, with the Inspector, the best ways and means of encouraging regular attendance at the Kettle Point School. The percentage of attendance at Indian day schools throughout the Dominion is far from satisfactory. I should like to see a joint attempt made by our day school teachers and Indian agents to improve the attendance at our schools where improvement is at all possible. You might consider the advisability of securing the cooperation of the Indian parents at Kettle Point.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nGeorge W. Down, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSarnia, Ontario,\nApril 4, 1941.\n\nPERSONAL REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, 1941.\n\nI have visited all schools in the Agency and will continue my reports on the progress as I find it. You will remember in my report for the month of February I said I was disappointed. I am still a little disappointed with Kettle & Stony Point Schools. I do not attribute this entirely to the teachers although I think sometimes they get a little discouraged. The percentage of children with any inclination to learn is small. The others show an utter disregard. I had a long talk with Mr. Howard, the teacher of Kettle Point School, and he tells me he has been taking a mental I.Q. of the Indians at Kettle Point School and he finds they have an average of sixty. Whether or not this is an excuse, I am not prepared to say. I am of the opinion that more effort should be made to memorize their work. It is appalling! You go over a lesson thoroughly\u2014you ask the class a question\u2014give them the answer\u2014review the lesson in the next five minutes and they can't answer.\n\nKettle Point was the dummy school for the month of February. Stony Point showed some signs of improvement although I think they had concentrated on Lambton Country the whole month. But even so that if progress can be made we are at least accomplishing a little. The children at St. Clair are so much more advanced and have a good knowledge of their lessons. With the exception of two or three, any question is readily answered although I am told the Provincial Inspector's report on St. Clair School is not very good. I am inclined to think there is a little vindictiveness in his reports. He and Mr. Smith have clashed on occasions. I thought of asking Mr. Howard and Mr. Tompkins to outline their lessons in the form of stories. It may help them to memorize, and instead of attempting a general knowledge, to concentrate on one subject until they have learned it thoroughly. What think you? Or would it interfere with the school curriculum as laid down by the Province? Reading and arithmetic can be classed about the same\u2014St. Clair quite good, Kettle & Stony Point fair to bad. The writing in all schools is exceptional. There are some beautiful writers. This only tends to strengthen my opinion on manual and vocational training. We see something through the eye and catch on quickly. Writing, painting, drawing, whittling with a jack knife or using tools of any kind are some of the things they love to do; but give them a mathematical or geographical lesson and they are not interested. Compared with February, I would say there is a little improvement.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nSARNIA, Ontario,\nJune 6, 1941.\n\nPERSONAL REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nAll schools have been visited and I am happy to report a decided improvement in all grades. It was my pleasure to meet Inspector Edwards of the Provincial Educational Department at Kettle Point School. After a short lesson with the children and a discussion with the teacher, it was decided a definite improvement had been made and the Inspector was very much impressed with the eagerness of the children to answer questions, although he seemed to emphasize the need for more academic training. I still question the advisability of this as far as our Indian population is concerned, and still question the assimilation of the subject matter rather than the memorizing of the subject. In fact, I think the greatest benefit to the greatest number of our Indian children could be achieved by a greater concentration on Manual and Vocational training. However, to carry on this type of work successfully one needs rather more than the allotted amount, also at least a part-time teacher qualified in the arts of Manual Training. But, I realize at this time the restricted funds available for this purpose.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nSarnia, Ontario.\nJuly 5, 1941.\n\nPERSONAL REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nAll schools have been visited and with the closing for the summer holidays, I think, perhaps, a short report on the term progress and management would be appropriate. The pupils and teachers together with myself have found our monthly lessons and tests of some benefit. Whether or not the benefits will be carried through the vacation period is another question. Three months is a long time for any child to be out of school and almost a calamity for an Indian. However, we can only hope to pick up from where we left off.\n\nKettle Point with Mr. Vivian Howard has shown at least one outstanding accomplishment, that is an appreciable increase of pupils. He now has 42 on the roll. This, in itself, until the young pupils adjust themselves, has a tendency to distract the attention of the other classes. The attendance at this school has fallen back during the last month. Mr. Howard thinks this may, in part, be attributed to the fact that we have dispensed with the Truant Officer. Just what is wrong at this school I do not know. The children are not disciplined and a lack of co-operation is very noticeable. This is not the fault of Mr. Howard. I think he has made every effort to co-operate with the children and parents but he has had occasion to check several of the children and in some cases send them home to be cleaned up. This, of course, has been resented. However, in the academic studies I think the children have made worthwhile progress. In manual and vocational training I do not think Mr. Howard is very interested. He claims to be a modern artist. Should that mean anything to our Indian school? I am not sure. Certainly the school is well placarded with art.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\nSARNIA, Ontario,\nJanuary 7, 1942.\n\nPERSONAL REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSCHOOLS, HEALTH AND RELIEF\n\nAll schools were visited during the month and I found nothing of a serious nature to report. The attendance at Kettle & Stony Point was under the average. This can, perhaps, be attributed to an outbreak of Whooping Cough. Otherwise, the health of our children and people generally is very good.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\nSARNIA, Ontario,\nJanuary 7, 1942.\n\nPersonal Report for the Month of December, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nCHECKING back over the months of 1941 and from my personal observations I would say the progress made is fair, at least, compared with other years and the type of pupil to work on. The children attending the St. Clair school on the Sarnia Reserve seem to be a superior type to the Kettle & Stony Point children. Why this should be I do not know. In discussing conditions and the problems of the Teachers one is led to believe that the teaching of Indian children is reserved for martyrs of the profession.\n\nHowever, throughout the year a steady program of the academic curriculum has been followed and wherever possible, under the limited facilities, manual and vocational training has been given.\n\nKettle & Stony Point continues to lag behind with a noticeable lack of co-operation between parents and teachers. The end of 1941 is no better than the end of 1940. The attendance and interest at Stony Point does not justify a school. This question was taken up during the summer holidays and a promise of regular attendance was assured. I am afraid it was an empty promise.\n\nVery little has been spent in the repair, and upkeep of any of the schools in the agency, but I am hoping some repairs can be arranged during 1942.\n\nGeo. W.

At Stony Point, the school is being operated on Eastern Standard Time; Kettle Point School is on Daylight Saving Time.\n\nOn taking the matter up with the teachers in these two schools, I was advised by them that it made little difference as to which time was used. Some of the parents, however, approached me requesting that the schools be allowed to operate on standard time. It would appear advisable to have a ruling from the Department as to which time is to be used so that the two schools would be on the same basis as far as opening and closing is concerned. In my opinion, both schools should be operated on Daylight Saving Time.\n\nYour early reply in this matter would be appreciated so that I may advise the teachers as to the Departmental decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nClerk in Charge.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nMWM:GF\nOttawa,\nMarch 17, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, the Department considers that all day schools in the Sarnia Agency should be operated on Daylight Saving Time. This time is being used generally throughout the country and consequently should be followed at all schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken,\nIn Charge Indian Agency,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSarnia, Ont., July 2, 1942.\n\nREPORT FOR MONTH OF JUNE.\n\nSchools were in operation throughout the month. Attendance at the St Clair school on the Sarnia Reserve was excellent. A very low attendance resulted at both the Stony and Kettle Point schools. This irregular attendance will be a very difficult problem to rectify as the parents offer very little co-operation. The Stony Point school will not be in operation next fall and its equipment has been moved to Kettle Point and stored in the school there.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nSarnia, Ontario,\nNovember 3, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttendance at the Kettle Point School has not been very good as many of the older children have secured temporary employment in celery gardens and similar work. Mr. Howard, teacher of the Kettle Point School, is dissatisfied with his salary and I would not be at all surprised if we receive his resignation at any moment. On account of the increased attendance he considers he should get an increase in salary. The attendance at this school is likely to increase due to the moving of the Stony Indians to Kettle Point. The enrolment cannot be definitely ascertained until all the families who lived on the Stony Point Reserve have been moved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nSARNIA, Ontario,\nNovember 24, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention: Mr. R. A. Hoey.\n\nI would beg to refer you to your letter 29-2-1 of March 17, 1942, advising that all Day Schools in the Sarnia Agency should be operated on Daylight Saving Time.\n\nMr. Howard, teacher of the Kettle Point Indian Day School, considers that the use of Eastern Standard Time would be more satisfactory during the winter months. The children have to leave so early in the morning to get to school on time that many of them are coming late and the parents are objecting as their children have to walk to school in semi darkness.\n\nIf the Department would allow us to revert to Standard Time for two or three months, I believe better cooperation would be secured from the parents. However, if it is the wish of the Department to continue operation of schools in the Sarnia Agency on Daylight Saving Time, we shall abide by the regulations.\n\nKindly inform me as to the Department's decision in this matter at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nT. N. L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nOttawa,\nNovember 26, 1942.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Indian Agent, Sarnia, Ont.\n\nRe: School hours\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 24th instant, in which you intimate that the teacher of the Kettle Point Day School is of the opinion that the use of Eastern Standard Time would be more satisfactory if adopted at our Indian day schools, particularly during the winter months.\n\nYou can readily appreciate the desire on the part of the Department to have school hours uniform throughout the Dominion. We have nothing on file to indicate that the present hours are not reasonably satisfactory to Indian parents and to our Indian day school teachers.\n\nIf, however, you are of the opinion that a change in the hours of instruction would be helpful from the standpoint of attendance, the Department can see no serious objection to this change being made. My personal opinion is that you should avoid, as far as possible, references to Eastern Standard Time and Daylight Saving Time. If you decide to make a change you should simply state that school will operate from 10 to 5 instead of from 9 to 4 as is now the case.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSarnia, Ont., Jan. 8, 1943.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF DECEMBER.\n\nThe school attendance at Kettle Point remains unsatisfactory. This situation is due chiefly to lack of co-operation between parents and teacher. Mr. Howard, the teacher, means well and is sincere but the Indian parents do not understand some of his actions. If all children of school age now residing at Kettle Point were to attend regularly, the accommodation at the school would be inadequate. Pupils attend the St Clair school on the Sarnia reserve quite regularly. School activities under the supervision of Mrs. Thompson, a newly appointed teacher, appear to be running smoothly. The new furnace previously ordered for heating the St Clair school has not yet been installed and natural gas is still being used for heating purposes. I have been advised by the firm authorized to supply the new furnace that such will be delivered early in January. Children at both Kettle Point and St Clair schools participated in the annual Christmas Concerts which were held in conjunction with Church activities.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nCopy sent to Indian Agent\n\nOttawa,\nJanuary 26, 1943.\n\nMr. R.V. Howard, R.R. No. 2, Forest, Ont.\n\nFrom the Indian Agent's report for the month of December, 1942, it is noted that the attendance at the Kettle Point Indian Day School is unsatisfactory. In similar cases it has been found that this condition exists through lack of co-operation between the parents and the teacher. It is possible that such a condition exists at Kettle Point. The Department cannot see any reason for unsatisfactory attendance at this school, provided all parties concerned are willing to co-operate in the manner in which they should. Unless there is a very decided improvement in the attendance at this school between now and the end of the current academic year, it will be necessary for this Branch to make a change in the teaching services before the commencement of the academic year 1943-44.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttention: Mr. R. A. Hoey.\n\nRe: Attendance, Kettle Pt. School.\n\nOn the date of my last visit to Kettle Point Indian Day School, Mr. Howard, the teacher, referred to Departmental letter 29-2-1 of January 26, 1943 which was addressed to him and a copy forwarded to this office. Mr. Howard gave quite a lengthy outline of the conditions giving rise to irregular attendance at this school. After thoroughly discussing the matter with him, I am convinced that he is earnestly endeavouring to remedy the low attendance. For some unexplained reason, there seems to be little or no cooperation from the Indian parents. In my opinion, it is not possible for Mr. Howard to overcome this merely through his own efforts. The children who do attend more or less regularly are making good progress.\n\nMr. Howard prepared a detailed report regarding attendance during the December quarter and I am submitting it for Departmental consideration.\n\nThe principal reasons for the poor showing in the attendance for the term ending December 1942 of Kettle Point School, were:\n\n1. Several of the children worked on farms and at the celery gardens during October and part of November.\n2. Six children from three families moved away in November--\nno attendance in December. They will probably all come back in the spring.\n\n3. Some of the families from Stony Point were late in moving and their children did not enter till November.\n\n4. One boy came for one day and because the distance from the Point was too far did not come again. They may move closer.\n\n5. The Milliken girls\u2014one spastic and the other mentally retarded\u2014come only when the mother could bring them in the car. One came two days and the other ten days.\n\n6. Many of the families start the children in the fall and then keep the younger ones out during the worst weather. There were an unusual number of stormy days during December.\n\nCauses for absence in Spring Term.\n\n1. Cutting wood\u2014So many of the fathers are working, the mothers have to cut wood and take boys or girls out to help.\n\n2. In the spring fishing\u2014carp\u2014one of my boys and his seventeen-year-old brother caught 1500 lbs. in one day. Prices have been rising steadily\u20145\u00a2 per lb. last Spring.\n\n3. Frogging\u2014This affects Edgar Shawanoo's family. He takes the children out to catch frogs to sell to restaurants. They make good money.\n\n4. Children of school age working on farms.\n\n5. Bad weather and cold mornings.\n\n| Name of Pupil       | Average Attendance December Quarter | Reason for Absence                                      |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Jackson, Ron        | 17-5                               | Worked in celery gardens to Nov. & went to Forest Dec. 1 |\n| Henry, Flossie      | 24.5                               | Worked in celery gardens to Nov. 14                     |\n| Henry, Nellie       | 22.5                               | Came from Stony Point in November                       |\n| Wolfe, Reg.         | 17                                 | Worked in celery gardens to Nov. 9                      |\n| Rogers, Walter      | 20                                 | Worked in celery gardens to Nov. 16                     |\n| Lunham, Raymond     | 16                                 | Worked on farm to Nov. 16                               |\n| Shawanoo, Angeline  | 9.5                                | Mother sickly\u2014had baby (deformed) milk leg\u2014is still in bed |\n| Name of Pupil       | Average Attendance December Quarter | Reason for Absence                                                                 |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| George, Cecil      | 26.5                                | Worked in celery gardens to Nov. 9.                                              |\n| Jackson, Norman    | 35                                  | Moved to Forest, Dec. 1.                                                           |\n| Bressette, Lawrence| 17                                  | Worked all Fall & cut all Dec., Father sick. 11 yrs.old.                           |\n| George, Leo        | 30.5                                | Looked after younger children while mother worked in celery garden.                |\n| Bressette, Audrey  | 33.5                                | Moved to Niagara Falls Nov 27.                                                     |\n| Bressette, Barbara | 31.5                                | Moved to Niagara Falls, Nov. 27.                                                   |\n| Jackson, Dean      | 29.5                                | Moved to Forest.                                                                   |\n| Henry, Dorothy     | 11.5                                | Late in coming from Stony Pt.

The teacher states that relations with the parents are very cordial and the attitude of the pupils is better than it has ever been.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nSarnia, Ontario,\nMarch 3, 1943.\n\nREPORT ON SARNIA AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1943.\n\nAt Kettle Point Indian Day School attendance was low due to stormy weather, illness, home help, and lack of cooperation by the parents who do not take the matter of school attendance seriously. The teacher, Mr. Howard, and myself have been earnestly endeavouring to improve the attendance at the Kettle Point School but we have not met with much success. I visited many Indian homes at Kettle Point and talked to parents who were neglecting to send their children to school. They agreed to send their children more regularly and did so for two or three days but soon reverted back into their former carelessness.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON SARNIA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, 1943.\n\nThe St. Clair and Kettle Point Indian Day Schools were open during March. Very little, if any, improvement in attendance was noted at Kettle Point School. This matter is being given constant attention by the Teacher and myself but we are not getting much cooperation from the parents. Many Kettle Point Indians state that they are not satisfied with the teacher. In some instances I believe this is merely an excuse to cover up their neglect but in other cases it appears as though Indian parents might send their children if a different teacher were in charge.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 3, 1943.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Indian Agent, Sarnia, Ont.\n\nIn your last agency report dated April 30, 1943, you refer to the attendance at the Kettle Point Day School and state:\n\n\"Many Kettle Point Indians state that they are not satisfied with the teacher. In some instances I believe this is merely an excuse to cover up their neglect. In other cases it appears as though Indian parents might send their children if a different teacher were in charge.\"\n\nMay I suggest that you discuss this matter more fully with the teacher in charge of this school. The officials here have had a feeling for some time that the services of the present teacher are in many respects far from satisfactory. In fact we feel that a change of teachers might contribute substantially to better attendance and greater progress generally at the school. The teacher might be prepared to resign at this time in view of the fact that he should experience little if any difficulty in securing a school anywhere in Ontario.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWe are dispensing with the services of the teacher at the Kettle Point Indian Day School. This school is in the Sarnia Indian Agency approximately 40 miles from Sarnia, Ont., and about 6 miles from Forest, Ont. There is an attendance of approximately 35 children and in connection with the school there are very comfortable living quarters for the teacher. Mr. Hoey mentioned to me that you thought Miss Joblin, who is now teaching at the Caughnawaga School and is giving up duties there at the end of the current academic year, might be interested in another school where living accommodation would be available where she could keep her father. The Kettle Point School offers suitable accommodation for this purpose. I should appreciate an early reply from you stating if Miss Joblin would be interested in this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Satisfactory progress is being made in all phases of the work at the St. Clair School. At Kettle Point, the attendance is still disappointing. In a recent letter from the Department I was instructed to discuss this with the present teacher, Mr. Howard. In all probability he will submit his resignation. We may experience considerable difficulty in securing a replacement as there is likely to be a scarcity of teachers next summer. Mr. Howard informed me that he has no certificate to teach in white schools in Ontario and if he resigns at Kettle Point it means that he will have to move to one of the western provinces where he is qualified to teach. Mr. Howard has this matter of resigning under consideration and I shall report more fully under separate cover when he has reached a decision.\n\nM.W.

The attendance at the St. Clair School was much lower than usual due to the measles epidemic. At Kettle Point the attendance remained about the same. Mr. Howard, teacher of Kettle Point School, was immediately informed of the Departmental decision to dispense with his services at the end of June. Pending Departmental instructions, no action has been taken to secure another teacher. In view of the great scarcity of teachers, I believe we are going to experience considerable difficulty in procuring a fully qualified one. In my opinion, this matter should be given immediate Departmental attention as later on all teachers will have obtained schools. The teacher of the St. Clair School on the Sarnia Reserve has not definitely made up her mind as to whether she will continue or not. She appears to be a very satisfactory teacher.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON SARNIA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1943.\n\nThe St. Clair and Kettle Point Schools were open throughout June. The teacher of the St. Clair School, Mrs. Thompson, is willing to continue as teacher of the School for the 1943-44 year. No teacher has, as yet, been secured to replace Mr. Howard at Kettle Point. In accordance with Department instructions, I wrote to Mr. Edwards, I.P.S., requesting assistance in obtaining a teacher for Kettle Point School but, to date, I have not received a reply. It appears as though teachers are very scarce and we shall be fortunate if we secure a qualified one at Kettle Point. The attendance at Kettle Point was unsatisfactory as many pupils remained home without cause. Others accepted employment without permission of the teacher or this office. The measles epidemic on Sarnia Reserve tended to lower the attendance at the St. Clair School. Both of the schools will need some repairs this summer. I shall report concerning this work under separate cover.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON SARNIA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JULY, 1943.\n\nI was pleased to learn that the Department has been successful in securing the services of a teacher for the Kettle Point School. After inspecting the School, I find that it requires only a few minor repairs such as replacement of a few broken window panes, etc. The former teacher, Mr. Howard, has vacated the teacher's residence. The school residence and garage were securely locked when he left but in spite of this some unknown person or persons gained entrance to the basement. No damage resulted and only a few jars of fruit were stolen. There is no Indian Constable at Kettle Point and I therefore asked a reliable Indian who lives near the school to guard the premises. There is a gang of exceedingly destructive and irresponsible Indian youths around Kettle Point who appear to take great delight in damaging and destroying property. It is practically impossible to apprehend them as they are very sly and Indians of the Reserve do not voluntarily offer any clues as to their identity.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON SARNIA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH NOVEMBER, 1943.\n\nDay Schools were open throughout the month. The attendance at Kettle Point has been excellent and the new teacher, Miss Fairservice, is doing remarkably well. In all matters connected with the school there has been a decided improvement and Miss Fairservice deserves a great deal of credit. The school is clean, tidy, and the pupils seem to have an entirely different attitude in comparison with last year. The teacher of the St. Clair School, Mrs. Thompson, submitted her resignation which is to be effective as from December 31, 1943. She has secured a school in the white municipality near her home where the salary is much higher and the attendance smaller. I have already written the Department regarding this matter. In my opinion, it will be very difficult to secure another teacher for the St. Clair School as teachers are very scarce at the present time.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON SARNIA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, 1943.\n\nThe St. Clair and Kettle Point Day Schools were open in December. Excellent results are being achieved by the teacher at Kettle Point. Christmas entertainments were held in the schools under the supervision of the teachers, and the Indian parents at Kettle Point were quite pleased with the performance of their children. The teacher of the St. Clair School resigned with effect December 31, 1943. On instructions from the Department I advertised for a teacher but no applications were received. To date the St. Clair School is without a teacher. Many Indians of the Sarnia Reserve blame the Chief of the Band as Mrs. Thompson would not have resigned if he had not criticized her to the extent of publishing his views in the local paper. The teacher did not resign wholly on account of this criticism but it did play a part.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON SARNIA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY, 1944.\n\nThe Kettle Point Indian Day School was open throughout January with a satisfactory attendance reported by the teacher. Parents at Kettle Point appear more interested in the progress of their children than they did last year. The improvement in the attitude and progress of the children is due almost entirely to the new teacher who is doing excellent work. The St. Clair Indian Day School on the Sarnia Reserve remained closed all month as no teacher was procured. About one fourth of the pupils who formerly attended the Reserve school are now enrolled in various city schools. The city schools are accepting new pupils on a temporary basis providing they pay $6.00 per month per pupil. If we secure a teacher, these pupils will likely return to the St. Clair School to save fees and transportation difficulties.\n\nRecently, an application was received at this office from Miss Elford, a qualified teacher who has had considerable experience with Indian pupils at other Reserves. I have forwarded her written application to the Department for consideration. If appointed, Miss Elford would not be able to commence duties until about April 1st, 1944.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAt the regular monthly Council Meeting of the Kettle Point Band held on March 9, 1944, the following Resolution was passed:\n\n\"Moved by Chief Milliken, seconded by Thomas Bressette that this Council request the Department to provide an additional classroom at the Kettle Point School as the present classroom is not large enough to accommodate all pupils.\" Carried.\n\nAt the present time, there is an enrolment of forty-eight at this school. Some members of the Band who have children of school age are working in white communities. If all of these families returned to the Reserve, the accommodation at Kettle Point School would certainly be inadequate. There is also one member of the Band living at Thedford who has children of school age. It is expected that he will be taking up residence at Kettle Point in the near future and if so the enrolment will exceed fifty.\n\nDuring the past year, the teacher has been forced to seat two pupils in many desks. This is an undesirable situation and works to the disadvantage of the pupils as well as the teacher. Miss Feirservice is of the opinion that the classroom at Kettle Point is overcrowded. After Easter, I understand that several kindergarten pupils will be beginning which will further tax the seating accommodation. It is quite apparent that an additional classroom is needed at this school. Kindly advise if arrangements might be made whereby an addition could be built to the school in the near future.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa,\nMarch 14, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Indian Agent, Sarnia, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to resolution passed by the Kettle Point Indian Council requesting provision of an additional classroom at the Kettle Point School.\n\nI discussed your letter with Inspector Arneil, who expects to visit Sarnia within the next month. At that time he will go into the matter more fully with you. In the meantime you might make some inquiries with a view to being able to tell Mr. Arneil the approximate cost of erecting a one-roomed school. For your information I may say that our estimates for the fiscal year 1944-45 were prepared, as you know, last fall and no special provision was made in them for a new building at Kettle Point. However, following Mr. Arneil's visit to the Sarnia Agency the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe St. Clair Indian Day School remained closed during February. A teacher has been obtained but will not be available for duty until about April 1st, 1944. Indians of the Sarnia Band are pleased that a qualified teacher has been secured. The Kettle Point School was open throughout the month. The attendance was lower as many children suffered colds and influenza. The teacher is very efficient. I regret to advise that, in all probability, Miss Fairservice will be resigning as teacher of Kettle Point School at the end of June as she has been offered another teaching position in Manitoba which she considers more suitable. She is alone in the residence at Kettle Point with the result that she finds it quite lonesome.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nSarnia, Ont., March 2, 1944.\n\nREPORT FOR MONTH OF MARCH.\n\nThe St Clair Indian Day school remained closed throughout March but I received word from the newly appointed teacher that she would be available for duty on the fourth of April. Attendance at the Kettle Point school during March was much lower than usual due to sickness, bad roads and wet weather. In every case instances of prolonged absence were investigated and parents urged to send their children regularly. The teacher at Kettle Point co-operates fully and is doing good work under difficult conditions.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 4, 1944.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Indian Agent, Sarnia, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, with reference to the resignation of Miss Fairservice as teacher of the Kettle Point School. We had already received a letter from her to the same effect. At the present time she apparently wishes another school in Western Canada and we are endeavouring to secure one for her.

Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nREPORT ON SARNIA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL, 1944.\n\nThe St. Clair Indian Day School was opened on April 4th by the new teacher Miss F. Elford. A few of the pupils who attended city schools when the Reserve school was closed are intending to continue their studies in the city as the parents do not think changing schools again would be in the best interest of their children. Many who attended city schools did return to the Reserve. The teacher of the Kettle Point School is resigning at the end of the June quarter as she found teaching fifty-seven pupils in one classroom too much for her. Having no car resulted in her being quite isolated and I believe this also influenced her decision. The attendance at Kettle Point school was not satisfactory in April due to measles, mumps as well as wet weather.\n\nM.W.

Forest, I may state, is on the Canadian National line, running between Toronto and Sarnia. This school has been until now the ordinary Indian day school with teacher's residence attached. However, we have made arrangements for the construction of an additional room and it is our hope that this work will be undertaken and completed prior to September 1.\n\nIn view of the acute shortage of teachers, we are naturally anxious to secure two teachers for this school, preferably a man and his wife. We would be prepared to pay $1,000 for the principal and $800 for the assistant, plus furnished residence, plus cost-of-living bonus in both cases.\n\nThese Indians, with limited land resources in a well settled district, usually find employment in industries in Canada and in the United States. The courses of study provided are somewhat similar to the courses of study provided in the ordinary public school in Ontario. We would like, however, to secure a teacher who would be able to provide worthwhile vocational courses.\n\nThis is a departmentally-operated school, that is to say, the teachers have not been, in the past, nominated by the church authorities. While we would be naturally anxious to secure your services for this school,\n\nRev. H.A. Meadows, B.A.,\nUnited Church Missionary,\nCross Lake, Manitoba.\n\np.t.o.\nwe would not like to take you from a task to which you have been assigned by the United Church. We make this statement, knowing how difficult it is for the Church to secure missionary workers in this critical period. It would be appreciated if we could have from you a reply at an early date.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSarnia, June 13th, 1944.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MAY.\n\nDuring May attendance at the Kettle Point school was very low due to measles and mumps which existed in practically every home. The attendance at St Clair school was fair. Inspector Arneil and Mr. P. Phelan visited this agency to investigate the matter of erecting an additional classroom at Kettle Point. More accommodation for school children at Kettle Point is quite necessary and a new classroom is to be built this summer if present plans materialize. We shall require two teachers at Kettle Point as Miss Fairservice, presently teaching, has resigned with effect from June 30th, 1944. Some repair work, alterations and installation of additional blackboard surfaces will be required at the St Clair school this summer and I shall report on this under separate cover at a later date.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nAgent.\nJuly 4, 1944.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSup't. of Welfare and Training Service,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour letter of the 15th ultimo concerning Kettle Point school to hand.\n\nI am interested in the position as you outline it, although the salary mentioned does not compare favorably with salaries now being paid in this province by schools which supply a residence. However I believe a school of this type offers a real opportunity to be of service in Indian work.\n\nIt is doubtful that Mrs. Meadows would be able to teach as we have two small children. It would however depend a good deal upon the physical set-up of the school and residence. Would it be possible for the Department to employ me as principal and an assistant other than Mrs. Meadows. I should prefer this, if it were possible.\n\nIf, with this information before you still consider that I may be of service to you, I would appreciate the following information which you may wish to have the local Indian Agent supply as it is of a detailed nature.\n\nIs the residence separate from or a part of the school? What is its size? What furniture is supplied; I should not wish to ship anything that is already supplied. Dr. Corrigan stated that fuel and light were supplied, is this correct?\n\nWould you be good enough to send your reply to me at '462 Bredin Drive, East Kildonan, Winnipeg', as I will be leaving here shortly. As soon as I receive your letter I will wire you, so that the matter may be settled as soon as possible. I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIt might be as well to make copy of your letter. In case I leave, I intend to leave before the end of next month but in the event that I am detained it will enable me to respond promptly with no delay.\nOttawa,\nJuly 18, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Mr. Meadows:\n\nYour letter of July 4 reached the office yesterday and Mr. Hoey requested me to answer it this morning, as he left for holidays last night.\n\nThe teachers' living quarters at the Kettle Point School are comfortable for a man and his wife, or for any two persons teaching school, but they are not sufficiently large for a family the size of yours. In addition, if Mrs. Meadows were not prepared to teach we would have to make room for another teacher.\n\nWe appreciate the interest you have shown in this school, but quite evidently it would not be wholly suitable to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. H.A. Meadows,\n462 Bredin Drive,\nEast Kildonan,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nCopy addressed to Cross Lake\nREPORT ON SARNIA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1944.\n\nSchool attendance was low at Kettle Point as quite a number of older pupils went to work in celery gardens near Thedford, Ontario. I tried to persuade the parents of these children that attendance at school was more important than the earning of a few dollars but in most instances they still neglected to send their children to school. The white man who employed these children did so without any permit. If he continues this practice in the Fall I intend to take appropriate action to prevent it. The teacher of Kettle Point school, Miss Fairservice, resigned at the end of June. She left the residence and school very clean and orderly. The proposed addition of another classroom at Kettle Point School will be started as soon as materials have been procured. I understand that the Department is endeavouring to secure two new teachers for Kettle Point. The St. Clair Indian Day School was open throughout June with a fair attendance. Miss. F. Elford will be resuming her duties at this school next September. Necessary repair work will be attended to during the holidays.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 31, 1944.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Indian Agent, Sarnia, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of the attached letter, applying for appointment as teacher of the Kettle Point School. Please let me know the age of the applicant, also what experience she has had. Do you consider that she would make a suitable teacher for Kettle Point? When replying you should return the letter.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nAugust 14, 1944.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Indian Agent, Sarnia, Ont.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th instant and also copies of letters relating to the vacancies at present existing at the Kettle Point School sent forward therewith.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances we are disposed to think that you might be well advised to engage Mrs. Clemens and Mrs. Schuyler for the positions of Indian day school teachers at this school. Salary will be allowed the senior teacher at the rate of $100 a teaching month, plus bonus, and the junior teacher at the rate of $95 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you interviewed these women and discussed with them somewhat fully the matter of accommodation at the school. In view of the fact that one of these teachers is an Indian it is not at all likely that they will be willing to share the available accommodation. This is a matter, however, that might be worked out amicably by the teachers themselves. You should also decide which one you want to place in charge of the senior room.\n\nWe are sending forward herewith the usual forms which should be filled in and returned to the Department at your convenience.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nSarnia, August 26, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 29-2-1\nof August 14, 1944 regarding the appointment of two\nteachers for the vacancies at the Kettle Point Indian\nDay School.\n\nAfter receiving your letter I personally interviewed\nMrs. Clemens. I outlined the situation regarding accom-\nmodation at the residence. Mrs. Clemens thinks that she\nand Mrs. Schuyler, the Indian teacher, will be able to\nwork out a satisfactory arrangement whereby both will\nshare the residence. Mrs. Clemens did not appear to have\nany objection to sharing the quarters with an Indian. Mrs.\nClemens is satisfied with the salary and will be reporting\nfor duty on September 5, 1944.\n\nAs Mrs. Schuyler's home is many miles distant from\nSarnia, I did not interview her personally. I acquainted\nher with the situation by letter and in reply she accepted\nthe appointment and will report for duty as teacher on or\nbefore September 5. No decision as to which teacher takes\ncharge of the senior room will be made until Mrs. Clemens\nand Mrs. Schuyler have an opportunity to discuss the matter.\n\nThe forms which you sent to be filled in by the two\nteachers will be completed and returned early in September.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nSarnia, September 9, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nWith further reference to your letter 29-2-1 of August 14 I am enclosing various forms which have been filled in by the two newly appointed teachers at the Kettle Point Indian Day School.\n\nI visited Kettle Point School on September 7 and discussed school problems with the teachers. A satisfactory arrangement has been made regarding accommodation in the residence. At the present time Mrs. Clemens is living at her own home and driving to the school each day. During the winter months she intends to occupy the residence along with Mrs. Schuyler.\n\nAt the time of my visit it was decided that Mrs. Schuyler would take charge of the Senior room. Mrs. Clemens will act as Junior teacher in the new addition.\n\nWe have been successful in obtaining all materials which are required for the new classroom. I expect that all work with the exception of exterior painting will be completed on or about September 13. Mrs. Clemens will commence teaching in the new classroom at the earliest possible date. At present only the Senior room is open for pupils from Grade 4 to Grade 8. The younger pupils are remaining at home until the new building is completed.\n\nIn your letter 29-2-5 of August 21st, you state that the blackboard is being supplied from the Government Stationery Office. To date this blackboard material has not arrived and it will be difficult to do much actual teaching until blackboards have been installed.\nWould you kindly investigate this matter and forward the blackboard to the Teacher, Kettle Point Indian Day School, R.R. #2, Forest, Ontario. I suggest that it be forwarded to Forest, rather than Sarnia, as it would be difficult to arrange delivery if it came to Samia.\n\nIn my opinion satisfactory work has been performed by the Indians in the erection of this building. There are various outstanding accounts for materials which will be submitted when received from the dealers who furnished same.\n\nM.W. McCracken\n\nM.W.M:FM\n\nM.W.

Fairservice, would give up duties at the above-mentioned school on July 1, 1944.\n\nThere is now a second classroom at this school and the Department has approved the following appointments, effective September 1, 1944:\n\nSenior room - Mrs. Virginia Pearl Schuyler -- salary $100 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nJunior room - Mrs. Noreen Clemens -- salary $95 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nI enclose copy of letter approving these appointments, also T.D. 1 forms and cost-of-living bonus forms. Staff questionnaires will be forwarded to you shortly.\n\nMrs. Schuyler is an Indian.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nREPORT ON SARNIA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, 1944.\n\nDay Schools of the Sarnia Agency were opened on September 5. Accommodation at St. Clair School is scarcely adequate for the increased number of pupils who are attending this year. The new junior classroom at Kettle Point was opened the middle of the month with about 30 pupils (Grades 1 - 3) in attendance. All phases of work on this new classroom were not completed in September but arrangements have been made to finish it at an early date. The teachers at the Kettle Point School entered their pupils in a school parade at the Forest Fall fair. Nine Schools participated and Kettle Point was awarded third prize. The two new teachers at Kettle Point appear to be interested in their school work and pupils are making progress.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nDay Schools were open throughout the month. Blackboards for the new classroom at Kettle Point arrived and were installed. The attendance at St. Clair Indian Day School on Sarnia Reserve was good and the teacher appears to be doing quite well with the large number of pupils who enrolled. Only one teacher, Mrs. Schuyler, used the residence at Kettle Point as the other teacher, Mrs. Clemens, continued to drive to and from the school each day. Towards the latter part of the month Rev. E.E.M. Joblin visited St. Clair and Kettle Point Schools in connection with the educational survey.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\nRe: Teachers -\nKettle Point Indian Day School\n\nEnquiries have been received from both Mrs. Virginia P. Schuyler and Mrs. Eldon Clemens as to what the prospects are for an increase in pay during the coming academic year. They state they could obtain higher pay elsewhere but would prefer to remain at the Kettle Point School if an increase were forthcoming.\n\nMrs. Schuyler informs me, however that if she returns next year she could not commence teaching until October 1st. In which event it would be necessary, of course, to engage the services of a temporary teacher for the month of Sept.\n\nI understand Mrs. Schuyler's services were not altogether satisfactory during the past year and believe it was Mr. McCracken's intention to recommend that a different teacher be obtained for the senior room if possible. I have discussed the forgoing with Bruce Milliken, Chief of the Kettle Point Band, and he informs me the members of the Band would like very much to have Miss Ida G. Fairservice who taught at Kettle Point during the year 1943-44, return. The last record in this office of Miss Fairservice's address is 137 Collier Street, Toronto, Ontario.\n\nI might point out that both teachers occupy the same quarters during the winter months - and consequently either two men or two women should be engaged.\n\nP.T.O.\nAn early reply would be appreciated as the present teachers are anxious to know definitely as regards arrangements for the coming term.\n\nC. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nCR:T\nOttawa, July 12, 1945.\n\nMr. C. Roberts, Acting Indian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant and note that Mrs. Schuyler will be unable to return to the Kettle Point School until October 1. With regard to the suggestion that the services of Miss Fairservice be again secured, I may say that we have just received her resignation as teacher of the Fort Alexander Indian Day School. I am writing to her today to ascertain if she would be willing to accept the appointment at Kettle Point.\n\nI note that Mrs. Clemens has asked for an increase in salary. At the present time she is being paid at the rate of $85.00 a teaching month plus bonus. We allow Mrs. Schuyler $100.00 a teaching month plus bonus. Do you think that Mrs. Clemens would be interested in an increase of $5.00 a teaching month?\n\nIf we secure Miss Fairservice we will be able to dispense with the services of Mrs. Schuyler. I will write you again as soon as I hear from Miss Fairservice.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\nI have your letter 29-2-1 of August 14, 1945, with reference to procuring a teacher for the Senior room at Kettle Point Indian Day School.\n\nMrs. Schuyler is being informed of the Departmental decision regarding her salary and we can, more or less, take it for granted that she will not wish to continue as teacher. I note that the Department does not consider it advisable to appoint Mrs. Selves and agree that her appointment might lead to difficulties between her husband and Indians. On the other hand, the scarcity of teachers should be taken into consideration, and it might be wise to give Mrs. Selves a trial rather than be without a teacher.\n\nI wish to refer to Departmental letter 29-2-1 of July 12th, regarding Miss Fairservice. If she is available the problem of securing a teacher for Kettle Point will be solved; but in the event that she will not return, I would appreciate your instruction as to what action should be taken as it is imperative that a teacher be secured.\n\nFor your information, I might add that an unsuccessful attempt was made by Mr. Roberts to secure a teacher for the St. Clair Indian Day School by advertising in Toronto, London, and Sarnia papers, and in view of this I do not think there would be much use of advertising for a teacher at Kettle Point.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 13, 1945.\n\nMr. M. W. McCracken, Indian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, you may inform Mrs. Schuyler that the Department is not prepared to increase her salary as teacher of the Kettle Point School. Consequently, I presume she will not wish to take charge of this school again. She will therefore be considered as having resigned.\n\nIn regard to Mrs. Verna Selves, it is noted that her husband would live with her in the teacher's residence. This would mean that at some periods of the academic year there would be three people living in the residence, and it is quite possible that Mr. Selves and Mrs. Clemens might not agree. Besides, we have found by experience in other places that it is never very satisfactory to have a teacher employed whose husband lives with her on the reserve, as, invariably, difficulties occur between the husband and some Indian. Under the circumstances, the Department does not consider it advisable to appoint Mrs. Selves.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 31st, 1945.\n\nMr. C. Roberts, Acting Indian Agent, Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th instant, it is noted that Mrs. E. Clemens is prepared to continue as teacher at the Kettle Point Indian Day School for the academic year 1945-46. Her salary will be increased from $95.00 a teaching month to $100.00 a teaching month effective September 1st, 1945.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nUpperwash Beach Forest Ontario\nAug. 1945\n\nMr. C.

I have my Elementary Certificate in Vocal Music which qualifies me for teaching Music in the Public & Separate Schools of Ontario.\n\nMusic is a subject which is being taught more and more in the schools of Ontario - it seems to be one of the subjects which children enjoy. Although some children cannot keep a tune when they start to school, it doesn't mean that they will never be able to sing, as singing with some children is something which must be taught to them.\n\nI have two schools in which I am to teach Music which are quite near the Indian Reserve school and I would be very much pleased if this application for the school would be accepted. I would teach for a salary of $75 a year for a one roomed school or $135 a year for a two roomed school - term from September 1945 to June 1946.\n\nKindly let me know as soon as possible whether or not you wish to hire me for the school.\n\nI am\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Neither of them are qualified to teach music and both think it would be of great benefit to the pupils, providing funds are available to pay a music teacher. Equipment at the school already includes a piano and no expenditure would be required in this respect. At the present time both teachers instruct the children in singing songs but they do not attempt to teach the fundamentals of music.\n\nWould you kindly give this matter consideration and advise if Miss Reid should be engaged to teach music in accordance with her application.\n\nM.W.

The school was reopened on September 4th with Miss Fairservice, a new teacher, in charge of the Senior Room to replace Mrs. Schuyler. The Indians of Kettle Point are very pleased that the services of Miss Fairservice were secured. Mrs. Clemens, teacher in charge of the Junior Room reports a large enrollment (about 42\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nBoth junior and senior classrooms at Kettle Point were in operation throughout the quarter. The senior teacher, Miss Fairservice, is giving excellent service. The teacher's convention was held at Kettle Point on October 13th. Four Public School Inspectors were present as well as teachers from Walpole, Moravian and Caradoc Agencies. Those attending the Convention expected that Mr. Phelan or Mr. Doucet would be present but were disappointed in this respect. The teachers at Kettle Point had their pupils put on a Christmas entertainment which was held in the Council Hall on December 22nd.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nAgent's Quarterly Report \u2014 Sarnia Indian Agency\nQuarter ending March 31st, 1946.\n\nWelfare and Training:\n\nThe St. Clair Indian Day School was open throughout the quarter. As the new Council Hall on the Sarnia Reserve was not completed, the arrangements whereby junior pupils attended in the morning and senior pupils in the afternoon was continued. A number of Indians and particularly Chief Adams blame the Department for not having provided adequate educational facilities for children of the Sarnia Reserve. Chief Adams is very bitter and openly and harshly accused the Department of inefficiency and neglect. Miss Florence Elford, junior teacher of the St. Clair School, is a staunch supporter of the Chief and encourages him to agitate and criticize. Attendance in both classrooms at this school has been quite satisfactory although in two instances I had the family allowance suspended because of absence from school without just cause. Mr. H. B. Readings, newly appointed teacher of the senior classroom, is doing splendid work.\n\nAt Kettle Point the Whooping Cough, Measles, colds and throat infections lowered the attendance throughout the whole quarter. No action to suspend family allowance at Kettle Point was taken as the children could not be expected to attend due to sickness. Miss Fairervice is doing excellent work as senior teacher at Kettle Point.\n\nMrs. Clemens, teacher of the Junior Room, is very lax insofar as discipline in the classroom is concerned. If a successor to Mrs. Clemens could be procured this coming summer I think it would be in the best interests of the school.\n\nM. W.

Those who have passed into Grade III and should be in the senior room as in other years, I feel should still be in school and must be in my room until such a time as a senior teacher can be found. With the fresh beginners, and those who are not able to return to Muncey, I hardly know just how many there will be. There has not been the room to allow them all back as yet. Do you think it\npossible, as a temporary arrangement, to divide the classes and have Grade I in the morning and Grade II along with those who have just passed from Grade I in the afternoon? The inspector seemed in favour of giving it a try.\n\nIf this meets with your approval I should like to start Monday September 23rd.\n\nYours truly,\nHelen Clemens\n(Mrs. Eldon Clemens)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAs you are aware there is no teacher for the senior room at Kettle Point Indian Day School.

In this connection I am enclosing a self-explanatory letter as received from Mrs. Clemens. I recommend that her proposed plan to teach beginners in the morning and grades 2 and 3 in the afternoon be approved. I have given Mrs. Clemens permission to carry on on this basis and if it does not meet with Departmental approval I would appreciate being advised.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nMWM/D\n\nEnc.\n\nM. W.

The Shaw Construction Company of Sarnia has been engaged to erect this building and actual construction on the present school site will commence in the very near future.\n\nThe schools on Sarnia and Kettle Point Reserves were opened on September 4th with a large increase of pupils, particularly juniors. The senior rooms at Sarnia and also at Kettle Point were not opened as teachers have not been secured. Efforts are still being made to procure two teachers but in the meantime senior pupils on both Reserves are remaining at home.\n\nThe Kettle Point School took part in a parade and entered school exhibits at Forest Fall Fair. They were awarded fourth prize in the parade and the teacher deserves considerable credit as twenty-three white schools participated.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of September 17th and Departmental reply 29-2-1 (W.T.l) of September 24th regarding pupils in the junior room of Kettle Point School.\n\nThe arrangement whereby Grade 1 pupils attend in the morning and Grades 2 and 3 in the afternoon does not appear to be satisfactory to the majority of Indian parents. Many of them are not sending their Grade 3 children as they do not consider it is worth while for half a day. Parents of children in Grades 1 and 2 are objecting to the fact that their children do not get a full day.\n\nAfter careful consideration Mrs. Clemens and I have decided to revert back to the original arrangement whereby children in Grades 1 and 2 attend all day and pupils in Grades 3 to 8 will have to remain at home until a senior teacher is available.\n\nPlease advise in the event that this arrangement does not meet with your approval.\n\nM.

As these children have been out of school for some time now, due to the shortage of teachers, it is possible that we could consider running this senior room during the months of July and August.\n\nIn the meantime I am writing to these teachers to find out when they will be available and hope to be able to replace Mrs. Shipley with one of them.\n\nBernard F.

McCracken,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nRe: File 225-8.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 13, please find enclosed my application form in duplicate, which I trust you may find in order.\n\nI should prefer the Kettle Point school, as I should like to take the children with me and have them attend the Indian School. The children's grades range from 1 to 9.\n\nMy husband is living and would accompany me wherever I might go until such times as I could get located satisfactorily, after which he expects to go north again. His work has been that of a prospector, miner, mine contractor and he has done forest ranging for the Ontario Department.\n\nTrusting that this may be the information you require.\n\n(over)\nIremain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMrs. Helen V. Fielding\nSarnia, June 23rd, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Teacher--Senior Room--Kettle Point School,\nYour file 29-1-1.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of June 13th and your reply of June 19th in connection with Mrs. Helen B. Fielding I beg to enclose a self-explanatory letter and application as received from this teacher.\n\nThe residence at Kettle Point is very small but the Junior teacher, Mrs. Clemens, definitely does not require the use of it and this would leave the accommodation solely for the Senior teacher. There are two bedrooms and I think Mrs. Fielding and her family could reside in the quarters without crowding. According to her letter Mr. Fielding is not likely to occupy the residence for any considerable period.\n\nThere is another point which causes concern and that is accommodating these white children in the Junior and Senior classrooms. No doubt you are aware that both of these classrooms are already taxed to capacity and it appears as though the situation may be aggravated without the addition of five white children.\n\nHowever, Mrs. Fielding's application is the only one which I have received for Kettle Point and this school may be without a teacher at all if her application is rejected on account of the size of her family. She is well-qualified and after careful consideration of all angles of the case I recommend that she be appointed as it would be very unfortunate if the Senior room remained closed a second year for lack of a teacher. I think we could, somehow, accommodate Mrs. Fielding and her family in the residence and also in the classrooms.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 4th, 1947.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Indian Agent,\nSarnia, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 23rd ultimo enclosing the application of Mrs. H.B. Fielding for the position of teacher at the Kettle Point School.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter and in view of the fact that Mrs. Fielding will have a family of five children living with her, we doubt very much the advisability of appointing her.\n\nIt should also be noted that her husband intends to live with her, at least part of the time.\n\nWe have had similar experiences at other schools in the past and invariably trouble arises.\n\nWith the above in mind we are not prepared to appoint Mrs. Fielding and it is hoped that you will continue your efforts to secure a teacher.\n\nBernard F.

In my previous letter I mentioned grades three to eight due to the fact that the junior room is crowded but I think the junior teacher could handle grades one, two and three inclusive.\n\nI cannot promise that the hydro will be in by Christmas as materials are very scarce. The Hydro Commission in Forest is prepared to erect a line when materials become available. The Department in Ottawa has already authorized the instalment of hydro and are very anxious to procure electric service for the convenience of the teacher. Until such time as hydro is available I feel certain that some satisfactory arrangement re renting or borrowing a battery radio could be made. The existing telephone line is about one-half mile from the school and I would have to investigate the possibility of extending the line to serve the teacher's residence. It is doubtful if the telephone company would erect a line to serve one customer, but I have no detailed information on this at the moment.\n\nThe residence is completely furnished and any sheets, towels, table linen, etc., which is required could be purchased immediately. The university student who taught this classroom from May until the end of August occupied the residence and left it in a clean and orderly condition.\n\nMr. Arneil is our Inspector and he visits this Agency quite frequently. I am sure he would be pleased to assist in delivery of your books but I do not know when he intends to make his next visit this way.\n\nIn the event that you accept the position you might contact me at my office on the second floor of the Post Office Building in Sarnia. The office telephone number is 540. I would meet you at the station if you care to call upon arrival.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nLancet Hill, Ont.,\nSept. 10/47.\n\nMr. W.W. Crocker,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Crocker,\n\nYour letter did answer a number of my questions and it is the first real information I have received.\n\nIn the mines I heard from Mr. Reay in Ottawa he said the enrollment was nearly 40 and I'd have grades 5, 6, 7, 8. In a 2-roomed school, that is the way the grades are usually divided.\n\nMr. Phelan sent me a questionnaire that I filled in and I should hear from him any time. I have asked for $1700.00 in place of the $1500.00 offered.\n\nI am glad the Hydes are being put in. Would it be possible\nto have it by Xmas? Until the Hydro is in, would I be able to rent or borrow a battery radio?\n\nIf I came, I'd want a telephone in the residence. Could you find out about that, too?\n\nAnd, too, I appreciate your offer to take me from Sarnia to Kettle Point. During the 35 mile drive you could give me what further information I'd need.\n\nWhen the residence is \"completely furnished,\" does that mean sheets, towels, table linens?\n\nIf the question of salary can be suitably arranged, I could reach Sarnia Sept. 19.\n\nIf Mr. Daniel, an Indian Affairs man living in Ottawa, were coming through to Kettle Point soon, I'd send my books with him. I know Mr. Daniel but he knows nothing of my teaching ability.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is a two-room school but the junior teacher, who is on duty now, does not require use of the residence as she lives on a farm about two miles from Kettle Point. The school is located on a good gravel road about one-half mile from a paved provincial highway. It is six miles from the town of Forest and about two miles from a country store called Ravenswood.\n\nThe enrolment in the senior room for the current academic year would be about thirty-five or possibly a few more. You would be required to teach grades three to eight inclusive.\n\nThe residence contains a fair-sized basement, kitchen, living-room and two bedrooms upstairs. It is completely furnished. There is also a separate frame woodshed with garage attached. There is no hydro in the school but we intend to have same installed as soon as materials become available. It does not have running water but there is a good well on the school grounds. The necessary coal and wood required to heat the school and residence is paid for by the Indian Affairs Branch. When and if hydro is installed it would be a 25 cycle service.\n\nTo get to Kettle Point from Toronto you could come to Sarnia by C.N.R. Railway or by bus. I would then be glad to transport you in my car from Sarnia to Kettle Point which is about thirty-five miles. There is train and bus service between Sarnia and Forest.\n\nAt the present time the senior room is closed as we have not been able to obtain a teacher. I trust that the above answers most of your questions regarding the school and residence but if further information is desired I shall be glad to furnish same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nLaurel Hill, Ont.,\nSept. 9/47\n\nMr. M. McCreath,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McCreath,\n\nI have had word from Mr. Phelan, in Ottawa, about the Senior Room at the Indian School at Kettle Point. I filled out a sheet giving information about my teaching experience \u2014 7 years High School work, 13 in Public School. I haven't had time to hear from Mr. Phelan about the salary.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm in Toronto today at the United Church Home Mission Office, & try to find out about Kettle Point. No one seems to know much.\nAbout it! But one gentleman, Mr. Tarry, suggested that I write you.\n\nMrs. Phelan has already told me there are furnished rooms for the teacher. Would you please tell me how much furnished they are, if there. Electricity and what cycle, who heats the living quarters, how do you get to Kettle Point from Toronto; what is the actual like, etc. There are dozens of questions I'd like to ask.\n\nI am not sure if I'll be in Kettle Point, as Mrs. Phelan and I are \"discussing finances.\" Please tell me about this school. I know very little about this part of Ontario.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Miss) Frances Pease.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEnclosed please find copies of self-explanatory correspondence between this office and Miss Irene Reesor who was interested in the appointment as teacher of Sr. room at Kettle Point Indian Day School.\n\nIt appears as though Miss Reesor was expecting definite word from the Department re increase from $1560 to $1700. Apparently the increase could not be approved so she took another school at Foleyet, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing a self-explanatory letter as received from Dora M. Orr, Foleyet, Ontario who is now willing to accept the position. I suggest that the Department correspond direct with her re the appointment. In my opinion she should be accepted as teacher of the senior room at Kettle Point at once as the senior room was closed all last year and the pupils are far behind in their studies.\n\nM. W.

Nisbet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\n[Handwritten note]\nPoor Copy\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of October 5th, 1907\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of said letter and to say in reply that I will forthwith make inquiries about deals in Forest and Shedden where supplies for that school are most convenient by obtained and I will get them placed in position without delay. It is quite possible they may not be in stock and may have to be ordered by the hardware men or furniture dealers from the manufacturers.\n\nWith regard to the teacher's chair they vary in price so much according to style that I am not prepared to give an exact quotation but I am going to toured on Monday or Tuesday at the earliest to pay salaries and pensions and will make what I consider a suitable selection and get the exact price and let you know. With regard to the closets at Kettle Point there must be some misunderstanding as we got the two closets separately about a year ago and now they are entirely apart as the instructions of the Kettle Point and Stony Point School are made at one time possibly it is the Stony Point school that is intended - it was objected to in that particular but just recently, since my last visit the new closet as per plan furnished has been completed which makes two closets entirely apart there as well. Your obedient servant,\n\nWilliam Hubert\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 12th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in reference to the teacher's chair required for the Kettle Point School, and in reply I beg to say that the Department will await the result of your inquiries with regard to prices.\n\nYour explanations with regard to the closets at this and the Stony Point School are satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSTEWART\nAsst.

On July 28th, last, you were asked to have the desks attended to, but apparently this has not been done. You will also obtain an estimate of the cost of a hardwood floor for this building and report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nWilliam Nisbet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nI might further report that I ordered the new seats - two in number - making room for four pupils (through Mr. Parsons a dealer here) from Walkerville and got notice that they and the teacher chair were shipped last week to my address in Port for the Kettle Point school. I will send an order up today so that the freight agent at Port will give up the consignment to the teacher. I have not yet had a notice from the railway of their arrival but I feel sure they will be along by today at the farthest.\n\nIt is undeniable that the seats and desks in this school are old and some of them are showing evidence of bad usage but they are not past being used yet, but I suspect you may hear occasionally from Mr. Brown until new ones are procured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam Hobbs\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 11th inst.\n\nI beg to report that with reference to the school work at Kettle Point, after the receipt of your letter in midsummer I got the walls all fixed up temporarily. The main thing that was wrong was that the boards were loose some at one end and come altogether. Mrs. Bessette did the work and I added $25 to her bill for cleaning the school to pay for her extra trouble - when I saw the walls last they were all right and with due respect to her work I do not think now there is very much wrong yet but Mrs. Bessette used old screw nails and I noticed some of them were not holding very well - I will get new screw nails and perhaps the teacher will put them in. I had noticed the roof was leaking a little and asked Chief Milliken to get the roof repaired. The shingles are there now. I expect it is done now but if not it will be directly.\n\nWith reference to the floor, it is worn through in spots around the stove and could be repaired for ten dollars by patching. There is a concrete foundation so that no wind gets in below but the plan you suggest of course would make a better job. From the teacher's platform to the door would be about 60 or 65 superficial feet which would cost thirty or thirty-five dollars for a good soft maple dressed floor.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nWilliam Hackett\n\nIndian Affairs.

Paterson,\nAgent\n\nJ.R.McLean Esq.,\nActing Deputy Secretary,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nRegarding that portion of the minutes of last council referring to repairs, addition and general improvements at Kettle Point council house, school house etc., I have made inquiry of parties capable of giving information as to the probable cost connected with same and now beg to submit the following estimates, which I think will cover the cost connected with the said improvements.\n\nKettle Point---\n\nAddition to Council House 12 by 16 with a cupboard built across one end of it estimated at ------------------------ $225.00\n\nPainting the whole of the Council House when addition is made-two coats ---------------------------------- 40.00\n\nTotal 265.00\n\nRoofing school house ----------------------------- $30.00\n\nPainting same ------------------------------------ 20.00 50.00\n\nPutting down and equipping well at school house 20.00\n\nRepairing culvert by putting in tile and filling with earth and stones 70.00\n\nTotal 405.00\n\nStoney Point\n\nReplacing the roof of school house # # # # # # $5.00\n\nPainting school house ---------------------------- 30.00 35.00\n\nGrand Total $440.00\n\nAs said above I think this amount will cover the necessary cost and will be a great improvement to the buildings and the culvert.\n\nThe ditch crosses the road at an angle which makes it difficult to keep a plank crossing in good condition and for permanent work I think it will be much better to put in the tile. The foundation of the\nSir,\n\npresent bridge curbing etc., are more or less decayed and regarded as unsafe hence the necessity of a thorough repair.\n\nYou will kindly advise me with reference to above at your earliest convenience. I think we will undertake the work connected with the school grounds and above repairs and improvements early in August so as to have everything in proper condition at the opening of the schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAss't. Deputy & Sec.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 24, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 18th instant submitting an estimate of the cost of the necessary repairs to the Kettle Point School-house and grounds I have to ask you to be good enough to state how you propose to have this work done. The Department must have this information before giving authority to proceed with the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nR. C. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReplying to yours of 24th inst., I beg to say that it has been on my mind to ask tenders for roofing the school house, building the addition to the council house and painting the two buildings. Of course I would ask separate tenders or a tender for the whole, not binding myself to accept any one but have in mind a selection of the best terms offered.\n\nWith reference to the culvert I thought it could be done best by days work. Ex. Chief Jacobs claims to be quite familiar with putting in tile of that kind and I thought it would be well perhaps to have him go up and superintend the putting in of this culvert.\n\nThe work of clearing the grounds, putting down the field tile and repairing the roof at Stoney Point, I think will also be done best by days work. I purpose being on the grounds as much as possible, especially while the days work is being done.\n\nIf this meets with your approval or if you will suggest that a different method be pursued you will kindly advise me at your earliest convenience that we may discuss it at the next Council meeting, which takes place on the 2nd of August.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAss't Deputy & Sec.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 16, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the matter of calling for tenders for a Council House and painting the school buildings in your Agency and also of the culvert have been dealt with.\n\nThe Department approves of your suggestion to have the cleaning of the grounds and the putting in of the field tile and the repairing of the roof at the Stoney Point School done by day labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. O. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have been endeavouring for some time to secure tenders for the addition to the Council house, roofing the school house and painting the two buildings at Kettle Point but so far can find no one who will undertake to do the work this Fall. Everybody seems busy. I asked for tenders at Forest and Thedford, the nearest points. I spoke to some parties in Sarnia but of course Sarnia is so distant from there that mechanics do not come to undertake the work and could not do so without a considerable advance over that for which parties resident at Forest or Thedford could. I have thought, therefore, that it would be best to undertake the work that is absolutely necessary to be done this year, that is roofing the Kettle Point school house and repairing the roof at Stony Point. The other work which was to be undertaken by days work has been begun and can easily be executed in good time. I would be glad if you would express your opinion in the matter before the meeting of the Council next Wednesday. We will then be able to fully decide.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. C. Palmer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. Mclean, Esq.,\nAss't Deputy & Sec.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, 8th September, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo, in which you report that you have not been able to obtain tenders for the work of building an addition to the Council house, roofing the school-house and painting the two buildings at Kettle Point and that you think it advisable to undertake only such work as is absolutely necessary this year, namely the roofing of the Kettle Point school-house and the making of repairs at the Stoney Point building and to have the same done by day labor. It appears to the Department that it might be well to carry out your suggestion in the matter. It is observed that you state certain other work referred to which was undertaken by day labor is already begun and can easily be executed in due time.\n\nThe account which you submitted from the Globe Printing Company is returned herewith, and is also the account from the Sarnia Observer, in order that you may attach thereto in each case a clipping of the advertisement published and charged for in the account. This is necessary in order that the accounts may be taxed in accordance with the usual custom by the King's Printer previous to payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. C. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6138, File 401-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReferring to your favor of 8th inst., I will notice the minute to which I refer and also to my communication of 8th inst.\n\nI am sorry there is so much shifting with reference to this little work but the circumstances seem to force me to change with a view of getting the matter out of the way, and I think after all, perhaps the days work system, being done by the Indians, will be as cheap and evidently very much more satisfactory to them, as they feel that they ought to have the privilege of doing the work on the reserve.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon that we may proceed, if it meets with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. G. Palmer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAss't Deputy & Sec.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nRe yours of the 15th ultimo, I was at Stoney Point and Kettle Point Tuesday last and while looking over the ground had a conversation with Wesley Shawkeence who is a carpenter, who was busy at Sutton Shawkeence's house which he is building. He seems to be quite competent for common work and says that he would be able to undertake the shingling of the schoolhouse, the addition to the Council house and the painting of the two buildings; says he can get help among his own people and that they can manage it nicely this Fall. He is willing to work for $1.50 a day and board himself and says that he would have to pay his help the same amount. I spoke of the matter at the Indian Council Wednesday and they seem quite pleased with the idea of having the work done by their own people and as intimated previously it seemed impossible to get tenders for the work as you instructed and I now feel that it would be a good thing to have this work completed as it is all planned for.\n\nWhen the minutes for the last Council meeting go down you will find a resolution to this effect passed.\n\nI delayed writing you this letter expecting to have the minutes ready to send but they are not quite ready yet and as it is important that this work should be begun soon as possible I am writing in advance and would thank you for an early reply as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.G. Palmer\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. Mclean Esq.,\nAss't Deputy & Sec.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, 16th September, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 8th instant, in further reference to the work required to be done to the school and council house, I beg to say that the said work may be done as suggested by you, but you should be most careful to see that the estimated cost of $500.00 is not exceeded. I may add that the Department relies upon you to see that all the work is performed in a thoroughly satisfactory manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR.C.

He also states that the water is not fit for drinking and that the bell is out of repair.\n\nYou may have the repairs made to the bell and also provide a granite or earthenware water tank with cover and faucet for this school.\n\nLast year it was the intention to enclose the grounds of this school, as stated in your letter of May 14, 1912, but evidently the work was not done. You should have this work undertaken, but before doing so you should give an estimate of the cost, as called for in official letter of May 21, 1912.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst.

Mr. Conn could not have visited the school very recently either, or he would have seen that the fence was all complete. If you refer to my letter of June 18th/15 you will find a full explanation and a requisition for cheques to pay the workmen for constructing the fence.\n\nCheque No. 265, issued about the 10th of June last for $24.65 paid for the wire, and the other cheques to which I just now refer for the work, issued about the 27th of June being No. 409--$12.00----410--$10.45 411--$8.75----412--$1.75----413--$3.00, making in all $60.60\n\nTrusting this explanation will be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAss't Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI am sending herewith minutes of first Council held for the present term.\n\nThe motion of Caleb Shawkeence to remove the water closets at the Kettle Point School, inside the enclosure and to have the well placed on the north side of the school house, is very important; one that I asked to have brought before the Council. I think I mentioned to the Department previously that the water closets are on the south side of the school house and that the well is also on the same side; that the grounds are low also, sort of a creek or swamp being not far south of the well, whereas on the north side the grounds are high and the well will be protected from the inflow of surface water.

Original on 152519/6.\n\nThe new well is not a success. The water tastes of vegetable matter and is unfit for drinking. Mr. George Smith has a good well about 400 yards away from the school. Mr. Smith says they could get good water at the school if they would sink a well through the clay. The cover on the first well is not very secure and as the well is nearly full of water it is a source of some danger. This well should be filled up.\n\nThe desks are much out of repair. I would recommend that 28 single desks be provided; seven desks each of sizes 2, 3, 4 and 5.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Public School Inspector Conn recommends that 28 single desks be purchased for the Kettle Point School, as the present ones are worn out.

CONN ON THE KETTLE POINT DAY SCHOOL... SARNIA.\n\nThe class room is 24 feet long by 15 ft. wide and the average height is about 11 feet. The air space, consequently, amounts to approximately 4000 cu.ft. The Ontario Education requires the trustees to provide 250 cu.ft. of air space for each pupil (based on the maximum daily attendance). Judged by this standard, class room of this school has air space for 16 pupils and there is an enrolment of 31. It is therefore evident that the school is greatly overcrowded.\n\nI note cement on the grounds for the purpose of putting a cover on the well. The old well should be filled.\n\nDate of Inspection - Sept. 26th, 1914\nOttawa, October 7, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Jenn in his report on the Kettle Point Day School states that the old well should be filled. In this connection I beg to refer you to official letters of December 15, 1913, and June 8th, last, in which you were instructed to have the old well filled up.

Maxwell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReplying to yours of the above date I might say that the reason the wells were not covered and the old well filled up was that the Indians I gave the job to did not do it as agreed. I let the work be done twice once in the spring and the second time in the summer holidays; the work was to be done before school started. Wells to be cleaned out, cement tops on and the old well to be filled a K.P., school and dirt all leveled around them and when up to see the schools when school started the Stony Point School well was done very well but the Kettle Point School was not done half such a job I never knew I told the man he would not receive me rent until he would do the work better both the cover of well and the leveling of the dirt and filling the old well so I am going up on Friday to pay the quarter pay and I will send it there so you will see that it was not my fault hoping this will be an explanation to you.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The cheque which was in payment of a voucher for moving out a building, grading well and fixing pump, etc., should have been drawn for $5.00 instead of $5.50. As an over-payment of 50\u00a2 has been made, I have to request that you will call upon George to refund 50\u00a2, which you should forward to the Department after you receive it from him. If George is an Indian and refuses to make refund the 50\u00a2 may be retained from his interest money when you are making the spring distribution, in which case you should return it to the Department with a note of explanation, quoting this letter and file number as authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT.

No unnecessary expense should be incurred in securing this cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nTimothy Maxwell, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nWith reference to the cover on the well I have had two covers on it but I think the pump is of no use, I have had it fixed twice. When it stops pumping they take off the top and then it gets lost.

There is much need of a new school there, not so bad in the summer as in the winter, when there must be a fire on, the scholars are so close to the stove that their cannot be enough fire put on to keep the rest in the school warm and therefore I would ask your impression in the matter and do what you can, by so doing you will oblige, T.M.\n\nTimothy Maxwell,\nAgent.\nTo the Secretary in Dept Ottawa,\n\nSir,\n\nIn case the Department gets the plans made before making the final arrangements for the building of the new school house at Little Point as per resolution passed at the last Council, we wish to say that it is desired that at least 3 rooms be added to the building for the teacher to live in, which would be very convenient for her as well as the school, and we would recommend that the said three rooms be added either over the school or at one end of it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTimothy Maxwell\n\nF.

The building is also inadequate in accommodation being 24' x 15' 6\" with 11 foot ceiling which only provides space for 16 pupils while there are double that number enrolled (32), and an average attendance of 18.\n\nA resolution of this band under date of September 6 last requests that a school be built at once, with a request from the Agent that living accommodation be provided for the teacher.\n\nIt is impossible to erect the building this year, arrangements should, however, be made for an early start in the Spring.\n\nThe plans prepared for Ryerson School provide the accommodation necessary for pupils available as well as for the teachers, and I would recommend that a print of this building be sent to the Agent for the band's approval if satisfactory and in the event of changes being necessary these can be made and specifications prepared at an early\ndate. A site on the school lot near the present building is satisfactory and will not interfere with the conducting of school in the present building while the new one is being erected.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, November 9, 1916.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 18th ultimo and in reference to the erection of a new school at Kettle Point, Sarnia reserve and in reply to inform you that blue print plans of a school erected at Parry Island and four other points within the past year are being sent you herewith under separate registered cover for consideration. The school building provides the accommodation necessary there and the living accommodation provides four rooms which is one in excess of that asked for in your letter.\n\nThe building is furnace heated and ventilated, and the estimated cost is about $3,500., being the average cost of four buildings recently erected from similar plans.\n\nThe plans should be submitted to the Chief and Mrs. George the teacher at this school, and returned to the Department with changes desired, if any, when plans will be prepared for your approval.\n\nThe site proposed is adjoining the present building but slightly west and north of the school and centrally on the highest ground on the site.\n\nIt will be necessary to raise the building higher from\n\nT.

I also showed it to the chief, and the Secretary, F.W. Jacobs. They were all well pleased with the plan if it can be carried out. I hope that it can be built as the old one is nearly done for school both in size and comfort.

I might say that the new schools will not come too soon for the old one is a very good for summer but not much good for winter the wind finds too many holes in it.\n\nRemain your obedient servant,\nTimothy Dewar\n\nDEPT.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThomas Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 10th inst., with reference to the erection of a school building on the Kettle Point Reserve, and Sarnia Agency in April, 1917. I would say that this school in my opinion could have been better built for less money in 1917, than it could now. I would recommend that the school be used for another year. In anticipation of building material and supplies being purchased at lower prices than they could at the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Scott:\n\nWith reference to Agent Paul's letter, hereunder, in which he recommends delay in building the Kettle Point school, I beg to say that I do not think it would be wise to delay construction any longer. The old building is in very bad condition and unsanitary in winter. It is beyond repairs and already too small for the number of pupils. Mr. Paul has only been at Kettle Point once since taking over the Agency and I do not think that he could have made careful examination of the school property or he would not have made such recommendation.\n\nI would recommend that tenders be called for in order that a new building be ready for the fall term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector Indian Agencies.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe Kettle Point school, Sarnia reserve, is of frame construction, old and in such condition that further repairs are unwarranted. The building is also inadequate, providing accommodation for 16 pupils where 32 are enrolled, and adequate accommodation is urgently needed.\n\nMinutes of Band Council, September 6, 1916, authoring erection of school from Band funds.\nPlans prepared and sent November 9, 1916, and approved and returned December 9, 1916.\nTenders advertised, April 30, 1917, but none received owing to war conditions.\nNo Order in Council obtained or asked for.\n\nEstimated cost in 1917, $4000.00\nEstimated cost in 1919, $5500.00\n\nArchitect.\nMarch 21, 1919.\n\nMemorandum:\u2014\n\nHon. Mr. Meighen,\n\nThe Kettle Point school on the Sarnia Indian reserve, which is of frame construction, is so old and dilapidated that it is beyond repair. The present building has accommodation for 16 pupils, while there are 32 enrolled.\n\nIt is proposed to erect a new building, sufficiently commodious to accommodate the pupils.\n\nIn 1916 we endeavoured to erect a new building, but received no tenders in response to our advertisement. The band has passed a resolution to have the amount taken from its Capital Funds, which now amount to $147,953.92. It is estimated that this school building will cost in the neighbourhood of $5,500.00, and, as it is absolutely necessary, I would ask your authority to have the expenditure made.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMarch 21, 1919.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nHon.

Only the quantity absolutely necessary should be obtained. You may also purchase a brush. It is noted that the teacher, Mr. Watts, will perform the work of painting. This work should be carried on at a time when it will not interfere with his regular classroom duties. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained, and the paint should be purchased from the firm quoting the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nTo the Indian Agent,\nF. Paul Eng., Toronto.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 9th, with enclosures.\n\nThe dimensions of the Black Board at the Kettle P't Way School are 13' 9\u00bd\" x 3' 0\".\n\nThere are two other smaller Bk. Boards on the side walls between the windows, they are not of much account or are hard to see, anyway, because of the light from the windows on each side of them; and they are seldom used. They are hard to get at too, on account of the desks. I would not recommend any expense being made on them. Their dimensions are, however, 3' 0\" x 4' 3\", 3' 8\" x 3' 8\".\n\nThe name of the manufacturer of the desks is The C.O. and S.F. Co. Ltd.\n\nPreston, Ont.\n\nThe size and shape of the ink wells are thus.\n\nThe amt. of paint required for the interior of the school room is 3 quarts. I can make a little of this darker myself for the trimmings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarold P. Watts.\nSir,\n\nInclosed you will find a letter from Mr. H.D. Watts, Teacher, of the Kettle Point School, in respect to supplies, which speaks for itself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

D. Watts, teacher of the Kettle Point Indian Day School, regarding the size of the blackboard required and the ink wells for the desks.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that an order is being placed with the Government Stationery Office to forward addressed to you a beaver plate blackboard of the dimensions stated in the teacher's letter, together with the necessary moulding and chalk trough, and also the ink wells. When the blackboard arrives, you should arrange to have it installed in the space on the wall as mentioned by the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6138, File 401-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nI am taking this opportunity to bring to your attention the necessity for a new school building at Kettle Point.\n\nThe present school house is altogether too small for the number enrolled. The desks are crowded too closely together and it is necessary in some instances to seat three pupils at one double desk. The building itself is old and rather than spend any money on repairs it would be advisable to erect a new school with teacher's residence included.\n\nThe parents are taking more interest in sending their children to school and are anxious to have better accommodation.\n\nIn this connection it would be as well to give some consideration to a central school for the two reserves. From a casual survey of the situation, I think that this is a matter which Schools Branch should give careful consideration. There are never more than ten or eleven pupils at Stony Point School. This seems to be too few to warrant the expense of upkeep and teacher's salary. The Kettle Point school would be better situated if built up on the hill, near the church. This would bring it much closer to Stony Point reserve and an arrangement could probably be made for transportation of pupils daily to the school and return. I mention this only as a suggestion for consideration and not as a proposition, which has been given careful thought. I do, however, strongly recommend a new school for Kettle Point reserve and that the location be changed to a more central point.\nNovember 25, 1924.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI have discussed with Mr. Inspector Parker and Mr. MacKenzie, both of whom have looked into school matters at Kettle Point and Stony Point, and I believe that the present building at Stony Point should be used as long as there are sufficient pupils available to warrant the activity. At Kettle Point a combined school and residence should be erected at the first opportunity, on a site near the church. The Band Capital Account shows $44,912.06. Mr. Parker informs me that they will be under heavy expense for roads, etc., during the next few years and he recommends that a Vote of Parliament be secured. I am trying to arrange to have the money provided for the building season of 1925.\n**Indian Trust Fund**\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo: R.J.

The funds of the Indian band will not be used for this purpose, as I am arranging for an appropriation by Parliament, which will be sufficient to complete the building programme. It is the intention to engage Indian labour for the activity.\n\nA suitable site is necessary and Mr. Orr has informed me that you are going to approach the Indian council at their next meeting, with a view to securing a proper lot. Please have them pass a resolution, setting aside at least one acre in the lots shown on the plan of the reserve as held by Wesley and Stephen Shawkense. Proper compensation will be allowed to the Indian owner of the site selected. I understand that you were acquainted with the best locations at the time of Mr. Orr's visit. You may assure the council that this lot will be used for school purposes only.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThos.

The Department will leave this matter in your hands to have the well dug by day labour or drilled, whichever method you consider the more economical and satisfactory to obtain a good supply of water. If the well is dug, it should be covered over with a cement top. A new pump will be required and you may arrange for the purchase and installation of the same. You should obtain competitive prices, if possible, before purchasing the pump and any pipe necessary.\n\nIn the digging or drilling of this well and the installation of the pump, you should endeavour to keep the costs down to the lowest possible point. When the work is completed, please forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos.

The room has insufficient light to meet the required standards, and it would help if the ceiling were painted, and the walls kalsomined. The walls are of beaver board, and would have to be sized first. Each of the ceilings and the walls would require two coats of paint or kalsomine. The ceiling is of tin, and I am inclined to think that the paint would be better.\n\nThe labor could be secured on the Reserve. If there is any possibility of having this done at this time, I should be only too glad to have an estimate of the work made, and to submit this estimate to Mr. Agent McCormick.\n\nI shall be grateful for your kind consideration of this matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I enclose the accounts for the screening of the verandah. This seems to be the only thing to do as Mr. McCormick is still not in his office, and they have been dragging on quite awhile. You will notice that I have already paid for the labor.\n\n2. I have hesitated to copy the OUTLINE IN SPELLING before I wrote to you again. There are seven pages as it stands now. I cannot reduce it unless I start rewriting it, and I am loathe to do that. Will that be alright? You can have it immediately if that is satisfactory, as it is ready to copy finally.\n\n3. I got a couch for the verandah. You ignored my previous reference to the matter. I didn't think that it would be wise to put the good one outside, and the wisdom of that has been proven on several occasions. This one cost $11.50. I haven't paid for it, but if you won't I will before I leave.\n\n4. I shall be around for a few weeks longer. Then I think that I will go home and have the operation on my throat. I will not be able to get away till mid-July though as I have just taken on some new work that will keep me that long. Tom is driving out West and I think that I will go with him and then I can recuperate at home. I plan to be back in the East by mid-August. May I have the awnings for the verandah? I practically live out there and it is horribly public for eating, sleeping, and what have you. Also I dislike having to get up in the middle of the night when it rains and move my bed. I gave you the cost once - seems to me that it was $16.00 inclusive of anything, and so on.\n\n5. While I am away might I let the local rector use the house. He is a married man with one child, and having a rather hard time of it, I think. He is quite persona grata with the Indians. Apart from trying to get some kind of a holiday for him, I had rather that there was somebody in the house & my books, pictures and things are all here and I rather hate to leave them.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6138, File 401-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI spoke of the matter to him, and he was quite keen. This church is at the extremity of the parish, but he said that he could work it as well from this end as from Thedford - the center - where he lives. He could also keep his eye on the extensive gardens that I have planted.\n\n6. You still have one requisition of mine. Will you please put it through for me so that I will be able to start at the material as soon as I come back. It seems to take so long to get books through these days.\n\nHere are six questions! Take time to write \"yes\" or \"no\" to each of them so that I will know one way or another what still remains to be done.\n\nThis all day rain ought to mean much to the Government tomorrow. I think that Howard Fraleigh is going back here.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They have submitted the following figures which are all inclusive. It is not only an estimate, but a guaranteed price.\n\n| Wiring | $220.00 |\n|--------|---------|\n| Fixtures | $75.00 |\n| Total | $295.00 |\n\nAs there were only two fixtures allowed in the residence, some lamps will probably be necessary there.

The second contract for five units is necessitated by the distance of the School from the nearest Hydro line, while the original contract is for a duration of five years; the additional one is for twenty years. However, should the Band later decide to put Hydro into the Council Hall, which seems a reasonable possibility, they would use the second contract which would automatically revert to the five year guarantee.\n\nIn as much as there will be several days work in the School room which had much better be done before the opening of the academic year, the local Hydro Commission have agreed to allow the wiring to proceed as soon as the contracts have been returned to their office here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent\n\nENCL.\nA.

Because of the lack of a cellar under the School, it would be impossible to use a pipeless furnace. The quoted price allows two hot and two cold-air registers in the class room and one in the residence.\n\nI would recommend that the Department give the matter their consideration, as this would mean that the School could be heated steadily, which would facilitate many projects that the teacher is carrying on during the winter months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. C. Trenouth,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.\nSec'y, Dept.

The Department is, therefore, not prepared to authorize the installing of the electric light service at the present time.\n\nI return herewith the applications from the Hydro-Electric Power Commission for the installing of electric light service.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

I would request that you advise the teacher accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. C. Trenouth, Esq.\nActing Indian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

C. Trenouth\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.\nSec'y, Dept. Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, Canada\nForest, Ont.,\nSept. 5th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the matter of installing Hydro service in the Kettle Point School, the Indian Agent has informed me that sufficient funds are not available for this at the present time.\n\nI realize that the quoted price for the wiring and installation of fixtures was a great deal and I have asked the Chambers Electric of Sarnia, the suggested electricians, for a quotation covering the minimum. They have quoted me a price of one hundred seventy dollars. This will allow for the required lights in the actual class-room and the teacher's residence. All outside outlets, cloakrooms, basement, attic and cupboard lights have been eliminated to secure this figure. The price will include six fixtures for the schoolroom at nine dollars each. The amount could be lowered by three or four dollars by putting all the classroom lights on one switch but I feel that this would be poor economy from the standpoint of the monthly bills for electricity as there will be numerous times when half the lights will answer the purpose of lighting there. Also included in the price will be one fixture for the kitchen and one for the hallway of the residence. The remainder I can supply myself for the time being.\n\nI shall be grateful if you will give the matter your further consideration. I have arranged a course in visual aid which I am anxious to test this winter and have planned extensive night work with the older boys and girls and the parents. Lighting facilities would be a great help in all this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As I mentioned in my previous letter I had estimates from two firms and in each case their quotation was more than double the price which I quoted you, namely $40.00.\n\nI am writing again at this time because if I leave the matter until June I shall not be able to secure the services of the Indian who has agreed to build it at this price. As soon as the Spring season opened his time is fully taken up by an employer from Detroit who has a camp here. Secondly, I am having to store material which should be filed in the attic. This is cold and damp and I am loathe to leave papers there any longer than necessary.\n\nI realise that it is near the end of the fiscal year. Could I not arrange to have the work done later this month so that the accounts would not reach you until after the first of next month?\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Pratt\nSecretary.\n\nEnclosure Apr. 15.\nOttawa, April 27, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Gray,-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of April 15th, with reference to placing new heating equipment in the Kettle Point Indian Day School and, also, installing electricity.\n\nThe estimate that has been received indicates that the total cost of the above work would be in the vicinity of $570.00. No provision has been made in our current year's appropriation for the funds for these improvements. I may add that the lighting and heating arrangements at the Kettle Point School at the present time compare favourably with other Indian day schools throughout the Dominion. I regret, therefore, that it will not be possible to consider any new arrangements regarding lighting and heating at the Kettle Point Indian Day School this year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRoss W. Gray, Esq., M.P.,\nChief Government Whip,\nSarnia, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Deputy Minister.\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Pratt's memorandum of April 26th, enclosing letter received from Mr. Ross W. Gray, M. P., in regard to the installation of lighting and heating at the Kettle Point Indian Day School.\n\nThe estimated cost of the installation of a heating plant in this school is $275.00; the cost of wiring and fixtures, if arrangements were made with the Hydro Electric Commission to supply the electricity, would be $295.00. This means a total cost of $570.00 and no funds have been specifically provided in our appropriation this year for this work.\n\nThe Kettle Point Indian Day School is in good condition and, at present, is heated by stoves. The teacher's residence is lighted by lamps. Artificial light is only required at infrequent intervals in the classroom. The provision for lighting and heating at the Kettle Point School compares favourably with other Indian day schools throughout the Dominion. It is not considered necessary to make an exception at this day school by providing electric light and, as far as we are aware, the heating arrangements at present in effect keep the classroom comfortable. As pointed out above, no provision has been made for any heavy expenditure at this school during the present fiscal year and, in consideration of this fact, I enclose a draft reply to Mr. Gray.\n\nDirector.\nForest, Ont.,\n30th April 1937.\n\nCHARLES MAY\n\nIn account with:\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n(Kettle Point School)\n\n| Date | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| April 5 | 6 quarts milk |\n| 6    | do          |\n| 7    | do          |\n| 8    | do          |\n| 9    | do          |\n| 12   | do          |\n| 13   | do          |\n| 14   | do          |\n| 15   | do          |\n| 16   | do          |\n| 19   | do          |\n| 20   | do          |\n| 21   | do          |\n| 22   | do          |\n| 23   | do          |\n| 26   | do          |\n| 27   | do          |\n| 28   | do          |\n| 29   | do          |\n| 30   | do          |\n\n120 qts. at .10 $ 12.00\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Charles May,\n\n**ADDRESS:** Forest, Ontario.\n\n**F.29-1-5 Oct. 14th, 1936**\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1939 | May 3   | To 120 qts.

I am of the opinion that there is no advantage in getting steel desks. The wooden chair desks put out by responsible manufacturers are exceedingly durable. And I have observed that, as a general rule, adjustable desks are never adjustable. Consequently I never buy adjustable desks. Desks made of wood are cheaper than steel desks and non-adjustable desks are cheaper than the adjustable type.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPublic School Inspector.\nForest, Ont.\nJune 3rd, 1937.\n\nDear Phil,\n\nI am in the middle of the spring cleaning and had certain things that I wanted on the requisition that I sent in at Easter time, and concerning which I had had no word.\n\nThe house is starting to need attention and I would like:\n\n- 4 packages of sarsaparilla\n- 3 yard of oilcloth for tables\n- paint - $6.00 would cover it (I am doing the kitchen)\n- linoleum for the kitchen floor (9x8)\n- Inlaid would be better in the long run but as it is more expensive would you indicate in your letter to the Agent?\n\nI shall be grateful if you can give this your immediate attention as I am in the middle of it all now and as this is the month when there is much coming and going of people I do not like to keep the house in an uproar any longer than I can help.\n\nWould you consider letting me have awnings for the four house windows if I get you an estimate on them? The place gets so desperately hot when the warm weather arrives that the nights are pretty bad and I plan on staying here again through the summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It looks to me as if green timber was used very extensively around the building, with the inevitable result the doors are leaving the frames and the casings are warping. This should be attended to before it goes too far.\n\nI also have to make a report with reference to the toilets. I think they should be moved to the north-west corner of the school-yard. At present they are facing the kitchen door of the residence which is not very pleasant and also very embarrassing for Mrs. Howard and the children, to say nothing of the unsanitary condition.\n\nSome painting is also needed around the buildings. I think the time to do these things is the spring of the year. If a building is worth building, it is worth keeping in repair.\n\nShould you approve of these repairs, I will obtain estimates on the work and forward same to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nINDIAN AGENT\n\nT.

If the material for the repairs will cost over $50.00 it will be necessary for you to forward full details in order that the information may be given to our Purchasing Branch, provided the Department finds it possible to approve the repairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6138, File 401-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDIRECTIONS\n\nThe Surface\u2014Before painting, walls must be cleaned thoroughly, removing grease spots and dirt. Old paint, kalsomine and paper must be cleaned, and the loose paint or paper removed. Damaged surfaces should never be painted. Cracks in plaster must be filled with plaster, and knots in wood covered with shellac.\n\nThe Paint\u2014Stir thoroughly from the bottom until the contents of the can are of uniform consistency. If too heavy, thin with turpentine only. If the color must be changed, tint Mellotone White with other colors by mixing in proper manner with each of the other tints or colors of Mellotone. It should be applied freely with a good wall brush.\n\nApplication\u2014To secure best results on large surfaces and overcome brush marks, be sure to use a full stock brush 3\u00bd to 4 inches wide. Mellotone should not be brushed out like a paint but should be flowed on freely and levelled off like an enamel.\n\nFirst Coating\u2014On common porous plaster walls, use a mixture of two parts Mellotone, using color chosen for finishing, and from two to three parts Sealcote, varying according to surface conditions. If the wall is very absorbent, apply first a coat of Sealcote, straight, then a coat of the Mellotone and Sealcote mixture. The latter process will need, in the majority of cases, only an additional final coat of Mellotone.\n\nOn hard, non-porous plaster walls, the best first coater is High Standard Liquid Paint because of its penetrating and binding properties. Use a color of High Standard corresponding to that of the Mellotone chosen for finishing. Thin with about one-half pint of turpentine to a gallon of High Standard Liquid Paint, and allow three days or longer for drying.\n\nBurned areas, or wood should be given a coat of High Standard Liquid Paint of a color corresponding to that of the Mellotone chosen for finishing. Surfaces repeatedly finished with Flat Wall Paints should be re-sized when necessary before re-painting.\n\nIf burned spots from the plaster show through the sizing coat of Mellotone, apply another coat of size over the spots, and let it thoroughly dry before putting on the next coat. Allow twenty-four to thirty-six hours after sizing for thorough drying and hardening.\n\nGlue size, gloss oil and similar cheap first coaters should not be used under Mellotone for the tenacity written up and give a good appearance to the finished work.\n\nFinishing Coats\u2014When the priming coat is uniformly dry, hard and glossy, apply the finishing coats of Mellotone allowing at least twenty-four to thirty-six hours between coats. While one coat may seem sufficient to give a solid color, two coats are strongly recommended. It is unreasonable to expect one thin coat of paint to withstand washing, cleaning and years of wear.\n\nTHE LOWE BROTHERS COMPANY Limited\nTORONTO, CANADA\nMontreal\u2014Winnipeg\u2014Calgary\u2014Windsor\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6138, File 401-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMELLOTONE\n\nA Flat Wall Finish\n\nMellotone is a durable paint ready for use\u2014not a calcimine or water finish. Its color effects are soft and beautiful, permanent, sanitary and washable.\n\nMellotone is equally good for walls, woodwork, steel ceilings, radiators, plaster, wood, burlap, canvas and board. It is easy to apply and covers 500 to 800 square feet per gallon, one coat depending upon the surface. Mellotone flat finish is intended for use in homes as well as public buildings, hospitals and institutions where refinement of decoration is desired. For complete directions see back of color card.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nIn selecting Mellotone colors it is important to know:\n\n(a) that the greater the mass of color, the deeper the shade appears to be, also\n(b) that the color effect from one wall on another greatly intensifies the color effect.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to make allowance for the influence of mass and reflection by reducing the color with White. For example, Rose Tint Mellotone matches the color in the case. When applied to a large surface however, it appears, for reasons mentioned above, much darker on the wall.\n\nFor best decorative results, we recommend the following colors be reduced in the proportion of one part of color to one part of White:\n\nRose Tint Blue Tint\nPrimrose Yellow Beryl Green\nOyster Gray Medium Blue Orchid\n\nThis is particularly necessary if the room is inclined to be dark. For large and very bright rooms, we recommend that the color in the case be reduced with 2 parts of color to one part of White.\n\nMELLOTONE SUPER SEALER No. 642\n\nMellotone Super Sealer is an exceptionally efficient primer and sealer which is especially adapted for two coat work on new walls\u2014or for special treatment on walls that are \"green\" or not thoroughly dried out.\n\nIts chief characteristics are to be found in its damp proof qualities; in its alkali resisting properties; in its remarkable efficiency; in its ease of brushing and in its ability to seal and prime the surface in one coat.\n\nNew and damp walls can be primed with Mellotone Super Sealer with a measure of safety and satisfaction, heretofore unattainable with any type of primer. In many cases the \"third\" coat necessary in finishing new work can be eliminated through the use of Super Sealer\u2014one coat of which serves both as sealer and primer coat.\n\nSuper Sealer is made in White only\u2014but may be tinted with any color except White at time of the finishing coat. It covers 400 to 650 square feet one coat to the gallon and in respect to general performance, service and economy is one of the outstanding developments in moisture proof; alkali resistant; sealer primers.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6138, File 401-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter dated April 8th, F.29-2-5, re repairs at the Kettle Point Indian Day School, I have gone into this very carefully and would estimate about six gallons of white paint, at a cost of $4.25 per gal; half gallon green paint, at $3.35 per \u00bd gallon; and half gallon of primrose yellow, #628 on enclosed colour sheet, for interior decoration, at a cost of $2.50 per \u00bd gallon. The latter I think is put up by the Lowe Brothers. Mrs. Howard would particularly like this colour.\n\nThe lumber in connection with repairs would cost about $10.00; making a total cost for materials of $40.35.\n\nI would estimate the labour would be $75.00 and this would include moving the out buildings. Making a total expenditure of $117.35.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nINDIAN AGENT\n\nenc.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes, Esq.\nSec'y, Indian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOTTAWA, Canada\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant in which you estimate that the cost of the material and labour for repairs at the Kettle Point Indian Day School will amount to $117.35.\n\nFor your information I may say that in the current year's appropriation we have found it possible to provide an amount of $150.00 only for repairs and improvements that might be necessary at the three schools in the Sarnia Agency. The present set up of our estimates makes it impossible to expend more than the amount specifically provided. Consequently before deciding on the suggested expenditure at the Kettle Point School I considered it advisable to write you again with a view to ascertaining if there are any repairs and improvements required at the Stony Point and St. Clair Schools. If expenditure will be necessary at these schools and the amount will probably exceed $32.65 ($150.00 less suggested expenditure of $117.35 at Kettle Point) it will be necessary to reconsider the repairs at Kettle Point. In this event possibly it would be advisable to defer the painting until next year.\n\nNo decision will be made regarding the Kettle Point School until we hear further from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo.

Several officials of the Department have visited the Kettle Point School in the last few years and all of them have considered the building was in first class condition. With the improvements authorized in this letter it should not be necessary to expend any money on this building for some time to come. At any rate it will not be possible to provide any further funds for repairs and improvements at the Kettle Point School during the current fiscal year. You should so inform the teachers.\n\nIt is noted from your letter of the 16th instant that the balance remaining from the amount appropriated, namely $32.50, will cover any necessary repairs or improvements required at the Stony Point and St. Clair Schools this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Vouchers show Ernest Bressette was paid $6.40 on July 30th.\n\nI am told there is more or less trouble with this well and it seems to me the only satisfactory way to correct this condition would be to drill a new well. However, I would also advise that the conditions in this particular locality might make it necessary to go down 100 feet before striking rock and there is, of course, always the chance of a dry hole. This information I received at an interview with Mr. Heal, driller, Petrolia.\n\nIt is quite evident something should be done with this well. To clean it out again would only mean boosting it perhaps for a few months, then again the same trouble. Therefore, I would recommend the approval of $175.00 for the purpose of drilling a new well. This amount will take care of the drilling and new casing for 100 feet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nINDIAN AGENT\n\nenc.\n\nT. R. L.

If so, he should not have followed such procedure. All expenditure in connection with Indian education is paid from appropriation and not from Band Funds. Consequently, if there is any matter at an Indian School that requires attention, the teacher should report it to you.\n\nYou will remember last May you were advised regarding the amount specifically provided in the appropriation for repairs and improvements on the three schools in the Sarnia Agency. In replying, you made no mention that it might be necessary to drill a new well at Kettle Point. Under these circumstances, it is practically impossible to provide funds this year for a new well.\n\nPlease visit Kettle Point as soon as you can conveniently do so, with a view to ascertaining if the present well could not be cleaned or possibly a few additional lengths of pipe would result in water being secured.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\n\nGeo.

I, also, think it is his own responsibility.\n\nNow he has had a piano tuner repair the piano to the amount of $5.50--this also without obtaining any authority.\n\nIt is quite evident to me, and must seem also to you, that this man must be checked. When I explained to him that he must have authority before incurring these expenses he was very aggressive and wanted to know if he should go on his hands and knees and say, \"Please God give me this\".\n\nShould I render these accounts or not? I am leaving this matter entirely with you for decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOttawa,\nNovember 5, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant Mr. Phelan did not make any definite promise to Mr. Howard that this Branch would allow payment for the cabinet he built in the bedroom of the teacher's residence at Kettle Point. It is impossible for the Department to keep expenditure under control if our authority is not requested before any disbursements are made. Mr. Howard did not secure any authority for the erection of this cabinet and under these circumstances payment cannot be considered.\n\nIf you consider that the piano needed repairs you may submit an account for $5.50. You should, however, point out to Mr. Howard that in future no payment can be considered for any expenditure for which he has not previously received authority.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Stirrett Co., Sarnia.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that the articles included on the account were purchased by the former teacher of the Kettle Point School in 1936. Why has the firm delayed forwarding their account? It is rather difficult for the Department to favourably consider paying the account due to the fact that there appears to have been no written authority given and so much time has elapsed since the expenditure was incurred.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nGeo. W. Down, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of November 9th, re the R. Stirrett account, I do not know why this account was not rendered before and Mr. Stirrett can give no explanation other than Mr. McCormick was ill at the time and the account was laid over; hence the delay.\n\nMr. Stirrett realizes it should have been presented before, but does not feel he should be the loser, owing to the fact the goods were purchased for the children in the school and not for Mr. Dill personally.\n\nHowever, it is left entirely with the Department for consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nINDIAN AGENT\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

Coultis & Sons, Thedford, Ontario, for the amount of $41.67 for material supplied the Kettle Point Indian Day School, for the building of a screened porch.\n\nI would refer you to Mr. Phelan's visit in 1938 to this Agency, when I showed him the screened porch in question. This I understand was built during the time of Mr. Geo. Dill's residence as teacher at this school; Mr. Dill did purchase this material without authority, thus making Mr. Coultis the loser.\n\nHowever, as the porch still stands today as a part of the residence, I do not think (nor did Mr. Phelan when I pointed it out to him) that Mr. Coultis should lose this account. Mr. Coultis reports to me that he has not received payment nor any reason as to why payment was not made. I think it only just, in view of the fact that all the material in question is still in use, that he should receive payment.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would recommend payment of this account. If such is not approved would you kindly advise this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo. W. Down  \nINDIAN AGENT\n\nTHE SECRETARY  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. Mines & Resources  \nOTTAWA, Canada\nOttawa, August 29, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, in which you state that on March 11, 1939, voucher No. 84 was submitted to this Branch, in favour of George Coulter & Sons, Thedford, Ont., for the amount of $41.67, for material supplied the Kettle Point Indian Day School for the building of a screened porch.\n\nThe officials inform me that they have made a diligent search of the records here and cannot discover on file at the Department the voucher to which you refer. If you will send forward to the Department a voucher for the amount quoted above, together with full particulars relating thereto, your request will be very carefully and very sympathetically reviewed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant the Department is not allowing any grant from the vote for Indian education in order to provide Christmas treats at Indian day schools this year. As our funds have been reduced this action is necessary. Please understand that no grant is being made to any Indian school in Canada for this purpose.\n\nIt is considered that the teacher should be able to arrange a concert before Christmas and either charge a small admission fee or take up a collection. By so doing sufficient funds should be raised to provide a Christmas treat for the pupils attending the school. In addition it should have a tendency to make the Indian parents realize that they have some obligations with regard to the education of their children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The steps on the porch on both sides of the school have loose boards which will have to be replaced and other repair work done to the railings on the porches. The roof on the school is in need of some shingles.\n\nMr. Howard, the teacher of this school, will be able to do the repair work as he had done in the past. He does this work satisfactorily and at less expense than if a carpenter were employed.\n\nThe total cost of material and labour is estimated to be $12.00. I would recommend that the Department authorize this expenditure. Accounts would be submitted to the Department for payment and no accountable advance Cheque will be necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. W.

I informed Mr. Howard of the Departmental decision.\n\nDuring our discussion, Mr. Howard mentioned that he had erected a wardrobe in one of the upstairs bedrooms in 1938. This structure is seven feet long and six feet high and is too large to be removed from the residence. Mr. Howard states that he paid for this wardrobe himself at a cost of $26.90. He is of the opinion that he should be reimbursed for this expenditure as it is a necessity in the residence. In this connection, I would beg to refer you to Departmental letter 29-2-5 of November 5, 1938 in which it was stated that payment could not be considered in view of the fact that Mr. Howard did not secure any authority for the erection of the cabinet. Mr. Howard maintains that Mr. Phelan authorized this expenditure in the presence of former Inspector McGookin.\n\nI informed Mr. Howard that I would write to the Department to ascertain if payment for the cabinet would be allowed. It appears as though the ruling given in Departmental letter of November 5, 1938 was justified and cannot be altered but Mr. Howard demanded reconsideration. A reply regarding this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa,\nJune 2, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Indian Agent, Sarnia, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the wardrobe erected by Mr. Howard in the residence of the Kettle Point Indian Day School. As you state in your letter, Mr. Howard erected this without securing any authority and Mr. Phelan has no recollection of having promised that we would pay for it.\n\nHowever, the Department is prepared to allow Mr. Howard an amount of $15.00 for this wardrobe, provided he can produce receipted accounts showing that the cost of the material used either equalled or exceeded this amount. If he can do so, you may prepare a voucher in his favour reading: \"To 1 wardrobe erected in the teacher's residence of the Kettle Point Day School.

When Mr. Howard was repairing the above mentioned buildings, I also authorized him to replace the fence post and restring the wire.\n\nPayment of the enclosed Voucher is recommended.\n\nM. W.

McCracken, Indian Agent, Sarnia, Ont.\n\nWhen Inspector Arnell and Mr. Phelan visited Kettle Point on May 25 it was understood that you would forward a requisition for the material required to erect the addition to the Kettle Point School. I have not yet received this and it would be appreciated if you would forward it at the earliest possible date, in order that the materials may be secured before the end of the month, at which time the Indian carpenter stated he could commence work on the addition.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 27, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nRe: Kettle Point Day School\n\nAccompanied by Inspector Arneil, I visited the Kettle Point School on Tuesday, May 23. You will remember that two proposals were discussed some time ago; namely, (1) an addition to the Kettle Point School; (2) erection of a new school at some other point on the reserve.\n\nAt the present time there are 57 children of school age registered at the Kettle Point School and 3 of these will probably not return for the academic year 1944-45, but there will be 6 younger children attending for the first time. This makes a probable enrolment for the coming academic year of 60. Of course, if any of the children from Kettle Point now attending the Mount Elgin Residential School were discharged and arrangements made to have them attend the day school on the reserve, this number would be increased.\n\nWe first checked very carefully the location of all the children of school age on the reserve and it was found that 4 children live between 2\u00bd and 3\u00bd miles from the Kettle Point Day School; 7 of the children live between 1 and 2 miles from the school; the remainder live within 1 mile of the school, many of them within only \u00bc or \u00bd mile.\n\nIn view of the above, Mr. Arneil, Indian Agent McCracken and myself consider that our best course of action is to add another room to the present Kettle Point School. This suggestion offers the further advantage that living accommodations for the two teachers are available in the living quarters at the Kettle Point School.\n\nThe Indian Agent had already located an Indian who resides very close to the Kettle Point School. This man is a competent carpenter and has erected several buildings on the reserve in a very satisfactory manner. We brought him to the school during the course of the afternoon and discussed the location of a possible addition. It is felt that an addition 24' x 24' on a cement base would be satisfactory. The Indian carpenter estimated the cost of the material at $900 and the cost of the labour at approximately $800. He, himself, expected to receive 75\u00a2 an hour as foreman-carpenter and he stated that he could engage other labour required on the reserve at the rate of 50\u00a2 an hour. He further stated that he could erect the addition within a five-week period starting July 1.\nAs there is no basement under the Kettle Point School it was not considered advisable to put a basement under the new addition. By using the two rooms alternately arrangements could be made for teaching domestic science to the girls and manual training to the boys.\n\nI instructed Mr. McCracken to forward, for our consideration, a list of the materials required at the earliest possible date.\n\nMr. Arneil, the Indian Agent and myself are satisfied that this addition will adequately meet the needs of the school population at Kettle Point and, as you will note from the above, the new classroom can be erected at a reasonable cost.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMaterials for Proposed Addition to Kettle Pt.

Phelan, I am enclosing a detailed list of the materials which are required for the above mentioned building. This list of materials was prepared by Wilfred Shawkense, Indian of Kettle Point, who is to be engaged as foreman.\n\nThese materials might be purchased from W. J. Travis & Son, Wyoming, Ont., Geo. Coultis & Son, Thedford, Ont., or R. Prout & Son, Forest, Ontario. I believe the Travis firm would have most of the materials on hand and their prices are usually quite reasonable although Wyoming is farther from Kettle Point than either Thedford or Forest.\n\nAs the work progresses it is likely that some additional lumber, hardware and other materials will have to be purchased but the enclosed list comprises most of the requirements as foreseen at this time.\n\nM.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSarnia, June 13th, 1944.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MAY.\n\nDuring May attendance at the Kettle Point school was very low due to measles and mumps which existed in practically every home. The attendance at St Clair school was fair. Inspector Arneil and Mr. P. Phelan visited this agency to investigate the matter of erecting an additional classroom at Kettle Point. More accommodation for school children at Kettle Point is quite necessary and a new classroom is to be built this summer if present plans materialize. We shall require two teachers at Kettle Point as Miss Fairservice, presently teaching, has resigned with effect from June 30th, 1944. Some repair work, alterations and installation of additional blackboard surface will be required at the St Clair school this summer and I shall report on this under separate cover at a later date.\n\nM.W.

I. D. School.\n\nOn Thursday July 6, the Clerk at this office informed me that Mr. Phelan telephoned regarding the securing of quotations for materials required for the addition to the Kettle Point school. I regret that I was visiting the Kettle Point Reserve and not available when Mr. Phelan phoned. Apparently the message was to the effect that George Coults & Son, lumber dealers at Thedford did not wish to quote and that Mr. Phelan wished me to obtain quotations on materials from R. Prout & Son at Forest and W. J. Travis & Son at Wyoming.\n\nOn July 7, I forwarded the enclosed list of materials to the dealers at Forest and Wyoming and asked them to let me have quotations at the earliest possible date. R. Prout & Son do not wish to quote on the materials and a letter verifying this is enclosed from Mr. Prout. After some delay I received a quotation from Mr. Travis although it is in a lump sum rather than quotations on individual items. Mr. Travis also advises that some substitutes will have to be made and that it is doubtful if he can supply hardwood flooring. He suggests that birch flooring be used as a substitute. I am enclosing the letter and quotation as received from the Travis Co.\n\nI suggest that the Department approve of purchasing materials from W. J. Travis & Son at Wyoming.\n\nWhen this work is in progress, various additional miscellaneous material will likely be needed and I suggest that I be authorized to purchase same locally when and as required. I also suggest that an advance cheque for $500.00 be forwarded to this office.\n\n(Over)\nto pay for labour. The above amount will not cover all labour costs and a further advance will be requested when first $500.00 has been spent.

Since that date good progress has been made. The foundation has been completed and a fair amount of the framework has been erected. The Travis firm in Wyoming who are supplying most of the materials advise that some items such as flooring are difficult to obtain. They have promised to make every effort to procure the materials which we need as soon as possible.\n\nUp to the present time no blackboards for the new building have been ordered. I called various firms in Samia but they do not handle school blackboard material and I was wondering if the blackboards required for the new school could be obtained through the Department. The new classroom will be 24' long and 24' wide. I suggest that slate blackboards be placed across the front of the room and along one side. If the blackboards were 3' 6\" wide we would need approximately 168 square feet. I suggest that the Department endeavour to procure blackboard material of some kind at an early date to avoid inconvenience and delay in opening the school.\n\n(over).....\nA box stove will also be needed in the new classroom. One which would meet our requirements would cost in the neighbourhood of $30.00. A local firm in Forest could order the stove for us if this meets with Departmental approval. Please advise if I am authorized to purchase the stove which would be about 32\" long and 15\" wide. I might add that the stove which was in the former Stony Point school was practically useless as the fire box was cracked in several places.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nMWM:FM\n\nM. W.

It would be appreciated if immediate attention could be given to this matter as the original $500.00 advance for labour has been expended with the exception of $3.25 and there is no money on hand to pay workmen for labour which they are performing at the present time.\n\nI do not believe the school will be finished by the end of the month as we cannot secure flooring. Several firms have the flooring on order but are not in a position to state when it is likely to arrive. Every effort is being made to procure the flooring at the earliest possible date. If the new classroom is not ready when school reopens I shall instruct junior pupils to remain at home until the building is finished. Kindly advise if this meets with Departmental approval.\n\nM. W.

A portion of the covering is cement and the balance is wood. The wooden part has rotted and portions of the cement have broken away leaving a hole into which small children might fall. The well is almost dry at the present time and it is dirty. I have already instructed an Indian to clean it as the water in the well cannot be used in its present condition. I suggest that a new top, built entirely of cement, be placed on the well at an estimated cost of $25.00 for material and labour. Would you kindly advise if an expenditure along the above lines will be approved and if so please forward an accountable Advance Cheque for $25.00 so that I may pay the Indian who performs the labour.\n\nNo Indian seems very anxious to undertake the job unless the money is actually on hand to pay him when he has finished.\n\nM.

J. Travis & Son, Wyoming, was authorized by purchase order #25703, dated July 20, 1944. The voucher which I am submitting does not correspond with this purchase order as quite a number of additional material was found necessary after the original order had been placed with Mr. Travis. Local purchase of additional materials was authorized in your letter 29-2-5 of July 28, 1944. Payment of the enclosed voucher is recommended.\n\nThis new classroom was opened on September 13. The teacher, Mrs. Clemens, is handicapped, due to lack of blackboards which have not yet arrived. However, she is carrying on as best she can. At the present time 28 children are enrolled, being Junior pupils, Grades 1, 2 and 3. We may need about six additional desks but the number has not been definitely ascertained.\n\nSome work still remains to be done on the school. Most of this is exterior painting and levelling, etc. The money which was forwarded for labour has been expended but as the work is not urgent I am postponing it until Inspector Arneil visits Sarnia Agency to inspect it and advise exactly how much more should be spent on the building.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nOn your purchase order No. 25703 dated July 20 you ordered materials required for repairing the Kettle Point Indian Day School. It was found necessary to purchase additional material as the work progressed and consequently the total expenditure amounts to $1164.53, as shown by the attached account. The total cost of the materials authorized on the purchase order mentioned above was $964.75. It will, therefore, be necessary for us to have a memorandum sent to the Representative of the Treasury authorizing the increased expenditure of $199.78. It would be appreciated if you would do this so that the account may be paid.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSarnia, September 29, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI beg to refer to my letter of September 8 and Departmental reply 29-2-5 of September 13, 1944 regarding repairs to the well at the Kettle Point Indian Day School.\n\nIn my letter I mentioned that no Indian was willing to do this work unless the money were on hand to pay him. I am beginning to believe that the sending of the cheque to cover expenditures has been overlooked.\n\nWould you kindly forward an accountable Advance Cheque for $30.00 at the earliest possible date so that we may have the work performed. It will cost $25.00 for labour and materials for the cement top and the extra $5.00 is for cleaning the well. At the present time the condition of the top of the well is dangerous for pupils. It would be greatly appreciated if funds could be sent immediately.\n\nM. W.

It would be appreciated if you would do this so that the account may be paid.\n\nR.A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nOctober 4, 1944.\n\nI visited the new classroom at Kettle Point Indian Day School last week and found that more equipment is necessary. The funds which were sent to cover labour were not sufficient to complete all phases of the work. The following is a list of work which is still required to place the classroom in good condition:\n\n- 30 Hooks for children's coats\n- 2 Shelves for lunches\n- 1 Coal bin\n- Applying second coat of paint to the new building\n- Setting up new stove and pipes\n- Installing blackboards\n- Levelling school grounds adjacent to the new building for drainage purposes\n- Insulating three rooms\n- Erection of shelving for teachers books\n- Providing three storm doors\n- 5 Window blinds\n\nAt the present time the blackboard which is being ordered through the Government Stationery Office has not arrived. This is urgently needed and it would be greatly appreciated if steps could be taken to have it forwarded without further delay.\n\nIn connection with the purchase of the stove authorized in your letter 29-2-5 of August 21, I would advise that box stoves to burn wood are not available. During the past few days the weather has been cold and the teacher needed some heat in the room. I purchased a Quebec Heater which was available and it will use coal instead of wood. I had to engage an Indian to set up the stove and he has not yet been paid for this labour. A storage for coal is required.\n\n..............\nThe total cost of materials and labour in attending to the above requirements will be approximately $125.00. $85.00 would be for labour and $40.00 would cover the materials. If funds are available I suggest that a further accountable advance cheque of $85.00 for labour be forwarded. The materials could be purchased locally and submitted to the Department for payment.\n\nAll of the above work is quite necessary and I recommend that expenditures involved be approved.\n\nM. W.

The desks which were in the former Stony Point School are being used but there is not a sufficient number.\n\nWe tried to borrow some desks from a neighbouring school in a white community but the trustees of that section requested a payment of $10.00 for the loan of fifteen desks for one year. In my opinion it would be better to purchase them if they are available.\n\nThose which are now in the school were made by the C. O. & S. F. Co., Ltd. I believe this firm is located at Preston, Ontario. The teacher suggests that 6 desks size 3 and 6 desks size 4 be supplied. Would you kindly arrange to order these desks and have them shipped to The Teacher, Kettle Point Indian Reserve, R.

I do not believe they have been cleaned for at least four years. I have found an Indian who will do the work. It has been customary to move each building and dig new holes four feet deep for the containers. If this were done it is expected that the toilets would not need cleaning again for at least two years. In moving the toilets a short distance from their present location two men and a team would be necessary. The Indian is willing to attend to the work for $15.00.\n\nI recommend that the Department approve of this expenditure. A voucher could be submitted for payment when the work has been completed.

The buildings were upset which resulted in sills, floors and side boards being broken. This damage will have to be repaired immediately and I have already instructed an Indian carpenter to perform the necessary work. As a result of the buildings being upset, very unsanitary conditions prevail at the present time. I could not persuade any Indian to work in these conditions unless one of the buildings is moved to a new location. The total cost of moving one outhouse and repairing both will be $12.00. The moving of the one building was more or less necessary as the two outhouses are too close thus causing confusion between boys and girls. I recommend that the Department approve of an expenditure of $12.00 to move and repair the toilets. When the work has been completed I shall submit a voucher to pay the Indian.\n\nThose responsible for upsetting the buildings have not been apprehended. Presumably it was a group of rowdy Indian youths who take delight in damaging property.

Upon examination I found that the stove was in fair condition and would be suitable for use in the Senior room of the Kettle Point Indian Day School. The stove which was in this class room was broken and had to be discarded. I decided to purchase the second hand stove from the church committee and have already taken it to Kettle Point. I took this action to save the expense of purchasing a new stove and consider that the one now obtained will serve the required purpose.\n\nIt is recommended that the Department approve of this expenditure and a check in favour of Telford Adams, treasurer of the church committee should be forwarded for delivery to him.\n\nM.W.

The parties responsible for the damage have not been determined at the present time, but the matter is still being investigated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. I have already instructed an Indian to reset and repair the building at an estimated cost of $10.00 for labour.\n\nIn addition to the above I suggest that funds be made available to make some minor alterations in the Junior class room. This room is quite crowded at the present time and more seating accommodation would result if a partition at the back of the room were removed. The material in this partition could be used for making a cupboard and shelves for school supplies. This should be done in the near future as storage space for supplies has been requested by the teacher. Coat hangers will have to be removed from the present partition and installed on the walls.\n\nScreen doors and window screens should also be taken off and replaced by storm sash.\n\nIt is estimated that $25.00 will be required to perform all of the above mentioned work and I recommend that an accountable advance cheque be forwarded for this sum at an early date so that I may pay the Indian who is doing the labour.\n\nM.

It is estimated that this would cost about $30.00--$20.00 for labour and $10.00 for materials. The teacher, Mrs. Clemens, has offered to do this work and I recommend that the Department approve. Vouchers covering the expenditure could be submitted when the work has been completed.\n\nCleaning toilets and repairing screens around them should be attended to during the summer vacation period. No materials will be required.\n\nIf funds are available I suggest that portions of the fence enclosing the school yard be repaired or replaced. I find that two spools of wire are required at a cost of $25.00. The posts and staples would be about $8.00. An Indian states that he will perform the necessary labour which is estimated at $50.00 making a total of $83.00. It would improve the appearance of the grounds considerably if this work were done. If the expenditure is approved an accountable advance cheque for $60.00 to cover labour for fencing and cleaning toilets should be forwarded at an early date.\n\nM. W.

Gibson had been engaged as Sr. teacher at Kettle Point Indian Day School with duties to commence on May 3rd. As you are aware this classroom has not been in operation since June, 1946 and some repairs are required to put it in satisfactory condition for the new teacher. New steps on the main entrance are necessary as they were completely destroyed by a rowdy group of Indian boys who congregated at the school at night. The pump in the well is not working and I suspect that it needs new leathers. About eighteen window panes have been broken by Indian children with sling shots. Mrs. Clemens, the teacher in the Jr. room, also requests that a small storage for books be provided.\n\nI have already instructed an Indian named Robert George to attend to these repairs at an estimated cost of $30.00 for material and labour. Would you please forward an accountable advance cheque for this amount to enable me to pay George when he finishes the work.

Cement steps to the Senior classroom were built and the labour in doing this along with repairs to window panes, pump, toilets, etc. amounted to $42.00. I paid the Indian $30.00 and we still owe him a balance of $12.00. I am therefore enclosing a voucher for this amount and recommend that it be paid. A credit voucher accounting for the $30.00 (advance cheque R-035053) is also enclosed.\n\nA voucher for the materials required for these repairs will be forwarded when received.\n\nI regret that the original estimate of $30.00 was far less than the amount actually required but the old wooden steps could not be repaired and the building of new cement ones involved a much larger expenditure.\n\nM.

A large part of any funds granted would be spent for sewing materials as both teachers and especially the new teacher, Mrs. Orr, are particularly interested in this phase of vocational training. When Colonel Neary visited Kettle Point School recently I believe he verbally authorized an expenditure of $25.00 to purchase sewing materials in the senior room. The junior teacher, Mrs. Clemens, is asking for $20.00 for the same purpose.\n\nI recommend that expenditures not to exceed $25.00 and $20.00 for the senior and junior rooms respectively be authorized for purchase of vocational training supplies for the 1947-48 academic year. Local purchases could be made and accounts submitted under cover of vouchers to the Department for payment.\n\nWould you kindly advise if this meets with Departmental approval?\n\nM. W.

I suggest that the possibilities of securing a priority be investigated immediately.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Hydro - Kettle Point School & Teachers' Residence.\n\nYou are aware that hydro has not been made available on Kettle Point Reserve due to scarcity of materials and insufficient number of Indian applicants for electrical service. Some Kettle Point Indians have applied and their applications have already been approved but to date the number of users per mile is less than the minimum required by the Hydro-Electric Power Commission to justify erection of a new line. The local Hydro official at Forest states that it is very unlikely that a new line could be built on Kettle Point Reserve in 1948 even if a sufficient number of Indian applicants were procured as many white applicants have filed applications and are on the waiting list.\n\nThere is little chance of hydro being available for Kettle Point School and Teachers' Residence this year unless priority over adjacent white localities is secured. If we fail to obtain hydro for the school and residence it may be quite difficult to get teachers next September.\n\nThere is an existing line running along the easterly boundary of the Reserve. To get hydro in the school only six-tenths of a mile of new line would be required. Possibly the Education Division could arrange some priority with the Hydro-Electric Power Commission to erect this length of line in the near future. Then the school and teachers' residence could be wired this summer so that hydro would be installed before September 1st.\n\nThe local manager of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission in Forest is quite willing to erect such a line if we obtain\nExtract from requisition dated May 15,\nfrom the teacher of the Kettle Point\nIndian Day School. (Junior Room).\n\nThe Teacher requests:\n\n12 Cups\n2 Brooms\nMay 28, 1948.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to arranging to have hydro installed in the Kettle Point school and teacher's residence.\n\nIt is noted from the third paragraph of your letter that there is an existing hydro line approximately 6/10th of a mile from the school.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would give us more definite information so that when we write to the Hydro Electric Commission in Toronto they will fully understand what we want.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nMay 28th, 1948\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to requisition of the\n15th instant, you may purchase twelve cups and\ntwo brooms for use at the Kettle Point School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter 29-2-5 (E.l) of May 28th, 1948, requesting more definite information regarding installation of hydro at Kettle Point Indian Day School and attached teachers' residence.\n\nIn this connection I have prepared a rough sketch of the Kettle Point Reserve. There is an existing hydro line represented on the sketch by a green line running along the easterly boundary of the Reserve. This existing line was built many years ago to supply hydro to a number of white people living adjacent to the easterly boundary of the Reserve. Our Indian Council Hall and United Church, which are both situated in the south-easterly extremity of the Reserve, secure electric power from the line marked in green. There are no white people living adjacent to the southerly limits of the Reserve which explains why a line has not been erected along that boundary.\n\nThe red line indicates the new line (about 6/10 of a mile) which would have to be erected to supply hydro as far west as the school. A few Indians living on lots between the Council Hall and the school may make application for hydro later on but at the moment they do not appear very enthusiastic which is no doubt due to lack of funds for wiring.\n\nThe Kettle Point Council have authorized electric service on Kettle Point Reserve and in this connection I beg to refer to Departmental letter 37029-2 of June 23rd, 1947 and my reply of July 12th, 1947.\n\nI trust that this is the information which you require.\n\nM.

Ross Sturges N.C.\nHydro Electric Power Commission\n620 University Ave\nToronto 2\nOntario\nJune 18, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Strike:\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch would like to arrange for the installation of hydro in the Kettle Point Indian day school and attached teachers' residence. This school is located on the Kettle Point Reserve, approximately five miles north of Forest, Ontario. In this connection, Indian Superintendent Mr. M.W. McCracken, Sarnia, Ontario, writes as follows:\n\n\"I have prepared a rough sketch of the Kettle Point Reserve.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nW. Ross Strike, Esq., K.C.,\nHydro Electric Power Commission,\n620 University Ave.,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\n\nPP/MGD\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, our Rural Service Department advises me that while the contract for the school and teachers' residence has not yet been received from your Department, it understands that the contracts are at present in your Department awaiting signature. Upon this understanding, the contract has been placed on the ready list.\n\nAs you probably know, we are making a very strenuous effort this year to catch up on our back-log of applicants for rural extension. This includes the construction of at least 3400 miles of line and the connection of approximately 35,000 customers. Despite all this activity, we do not anticipate catching up completely with the back-log, which will extend into 1949. In order to be as fair as possible with all our rural applicants, we have had to put each rural operating area on a quota basis. In your area we have a quota of 20.88 miles of line to be built this year with 54 applicants to be served.\n\nThe result is that unless we obtain extraordinarily good operating conditions it will not be possible to reach your application this year. As stated previously, however, your application is now on the list and if it is not reached in 1948, it certainly will be in 1949. I can assure you that there will be the least possible delay in giving this service.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. R. Strike,\nCommissioner.\nJune 25, 1948.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Superintendent, Indian Agency,\nSarnia, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of\nthe 2nd instant and previous correspondence\nregarding the securing of hydro power for the\nKettle Point School, I enclose for your information\na copy of a letter received from the Hydro Electric\nPower Commission.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nEncl:\nPP/HM.\nDear Mr. Strike:\n\nWe have received your letter of the 22nd instant regarding the supplying of hydro to the Kettle Point Indian Day School.\n\nWe have carefully noted the contents of your communication and we appreciate the kind and prompt attention that you have given to our request.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I understand that you also told him the situation as it existed at present and also some of the background as to why a strong teacher will be required. I would ask that arrangements be made to have the following repair work done during the month of August, under Mr. Claus' supervision:\n\n(1) Erection of two new toilets. (Mr. Claus has been given the blueprints for these toilets and will work out the bill of materials required to construct them. I have suggested that Insul Brick be used for the exterior finish).\n\n(2) The erection of a new wood-shed. (Mr. Claus will also work out a bill of materials for this wood-shed and will advise you also as to the amount of materials which we will have to order through the Purchasing Agent for Items 1 and 2.\n(3) Purchase of Cistern. (I would ask that you ascertain the type of cistern required at the school and if it can be purchased locally for less than $50.00, that you do so. If the cost is more than $50.00, please submit a requisition covering same for action by the Purchasing Agent.\n\n(4) Interior painting. (I am today placing a requisition with the Departmental Purchasing Agent for the following paint supplies:\n\n2 gallons light green Kem-tone or similar plaster paint.\n2 \" white Kem-tone or similar plaster paint.\n1 \" light green interior enamel\n1 Kalsomine brush\n1 2\" paint brush.\n2 Quarts Turpentine.\n\nI would ask that you extend every cooperation to Mr. Claus in this undertaking. While Mr. Claus will assume responsibility for the repairs to be carried out at the school during the month of August, I would ask that you do everything possible to see that the school is put into fit condition by the 7th of September. Please let me know also concerning the cost of placing a telephone in the school.\n\nBernard E. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nP.S. - I would emphasize that we are only guessing at quantities of paint required but wish to ensure that some paint at least is on hand when Mr. Claus arrives.

The building project was discussed and they informed me that they estimate the labour on the woodshed and garage alone will cost approximately $250.00. At this rate the cost of wages in building the two toilets will probably come close to $100.00.\n\nIn view of the above an additional advance of $150.00 will be necessary. I suggest that this extra money be sent at an early date so that the building work will not be delayed for lack of funds to pay wages.\n\nM. W.

However, it is hoped that you will keep in touch with the work at Kettle Point and make certain that the improvements are carried out at the least possible expense.\n\nWe have had an experience at the St. Clair school where the cost greatly exceeded the original estimate. We do not want this situation to occur again.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nAugust 13, 1948.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Supt.

Their letter of June 22nd,\nindicates that they have not received the contract.\nNo copy or memo of any kind appears on our files.\nWould you recall receiving this contract?

Sharpe, and he would like a blueprint or sketch of the line involved showing location, length, materials required and the estimate of cost. I, also, enclose a form termed \"Application for Authority to Install Additional Telephone Equipment,\" Appendix \"A\" - which should be completed for approval of the Deputy Minister.\n\nAfter approval of the Deputy Minister, it will be necessary to submit the form, etc., to the Telephone Investigator.\n\nKindly let me have the completed form and other information as soon as possible.\n\nW.

The telephone company's letter of July 20th gives the other details. This paragraph, however, refrains from giving any details except that \"The Department pays for the material 100% on its own property the same as all subscribers\". As stated above this is the portion we would like cleared up along with the sketch giving the distance to the school.\n\nKindly complete this at your earliest convenience and return to this office for attention.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nEncl:\n\nAJD/HM.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter 29-2-5 of August 13th, 1948 with regard to completion of contract to secure hydro electric service in the Kettle Point Indian Day School and teachers' residence.\n\nThe contract has been completed and in this connection I beg to refer you to your letter 37029-2 of September 16th, 1947. Four copies of the application signed by the Director were handed to the local manager of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Forest on September 25th, 1947. One copy was returned by them to this office for record purposes and is on file here at the present time. In other words the application for hydro service is already approved and we must simply await the erection of a line.\n\nI intend to discuss this matter with the manager of the Hydro Office at Forest to clarify matters re the contract.\n\nM.

Prout & Son, Forest, Ontario and George Coultis & Son, Thedford, Ontario covering materials as listed on the requisition which you returned. The cost of same is much greater than I expected.\n\nIn my opinion the building of a new woodshed and garage is not essential this year. The present structure could be put in a reasonable state of repair at a total cost of possibly $100.00. I recommend that the plans for erection of a new garage and woodshed be cancelled and authority be granted to repair the existing building.\n\nTwo new toilets are urgently required. I suggest that only materials which will be necessary for the toilets be ordered as per the enclosed bill which was submitted by Mr. Claus. The two toilets at Kettle Point School are in very bad condition at the present time. In fact one was upset and broken some time ago. As we intended to build new toilets I did not repair either of the old ones. School is commencing next Tuesday and for this reason I recommend that authority be granted for local purchase of the materials required so that the erection of these outbuildings may be commenced immediately.\n\nM.
