Explanatory letter follows.\"\n\nI beg to say that when the icebreaker arrived at Bersimis, there was still the painting to be done all the material being on the premises, and as Mr Amyot would have had to stay behind and pay very to get back to Ottawa in the winter, travelling up the North Shore, I asked him to be kind enough to look after this painting to be done. So in consequence I delivered him his last certificate, and he passed a contract with the painter for the completion of the painting of the building. With a week to ten days more everything will be completed.\n\nAs to the work performed by Mr Amyot, I must say that with my very limited knowledge of construction, I am of the opinion that the work was well done.\n\nThe contractor had to do the work under trying conditions at times specially during the last part of October up to the 15th of December, on account of the lateness of the season.\n\nAlthough, as far as I am concerned, I find that the work is satisfactorily done, it would, it seems to me, relieve me of a lot of responsibility, if either the architect or engineer of the Dept. inspected the building. But as before stated the work under the condition due to the late season could not be better done, according to me.\n\nThe final payment could be done, with the understanding that the building is not finally accepted, till the Spring, should the Dept. decide to send the engineer to inspect the work.\n\nTrusting that these explanations will be satisfactory, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Alf.

Cook stove. Concerning the cook stove, I must point out that as it is necessary to get every year some fir-wood to the amount of about $70.00 it would probably be better to get an oil stove which would only be used for meals, and a water tank oil-heater. The question of fuel would be thus simplified, but the initial cost would be higher; 2 kitchen chairs, one kitchen cabinet, one kitchen table.\n\nDining-room. One table and six chairs.\n\nCommunity-room. One center table and 4 or 5 five assorted chairs.\n\nFour bedrooms. Four single beds, springs and mattresses. Four dressers.\n\nA set of dishes, and miscellaneous cooking utensils which the Sisters will choose when they arrive at the School, and on which I can report further on.\n\nAll of the above presupposes that the Dept. will do the furnishing of the School, which is I think the only plausible way to entice the Teachers here as they have no furniture to move in or out.\n\nAn early reply on the matter will enable to rush things along, and any suggestions the Dept. might think of will be duly appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 14th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, giving a list of the furnishings required for the teachers' living quarters in the new school building on the Bersimis Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department furnishes a reasonable supply of equipment for teachers' living quarters, especially at the time a new building is erected. You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following, viz:\n\nKitchen: - A wood burning cook stove of the type and size required. It is considered that there would be a certain element of danger in installing an oil stove, and it is thought that there would be no difficulty in obtaining the quantity of firewood required for fuel if a wood burning stove is obtained. Besides the stove, you may purchase 2 chairs, 1 kitchen cabinet and 1 table.\n\nDining Room: - 1 table and 6 chairs.\n\nCommunity Room: - 1 centre table and 6 assorted chairs.\n\nBedrooms: - 4 single iron beds, with springs and mattresses; 4 dressers.\n\nA set of dishes and a supply of miscellaneous cooking utensils may also be obtained. A list of these should be obtained from the Sisters when they arrive.\n\nBefore making any of the above purchases, it will be necessary to obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers in Rimouski, or elsewhere, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. While articles of a serviceable type should be secured, it is not intended that any elaborate or expensive furniture be supplied. The Department will leave the matter in your hands to obtain the above equipment at the lowest possible cost. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded in favour of the merchant from whom you make the purchase. A memo. should accompany the vouchers showing the\n\nA. W.

I found that this well was made of timber about 13 years ago, the wood is totally rotten and on the verge of collapse.\n\nFrom the hygienic point of view it should be condemned; so much so that the children who are going to the school drink that water.\n\nIt would be necessary to remedy this state of affairs as soon as possible.\n\nI have personally estimated the cost of the rebuilding of that well, having no one competent to do it.\n\n| Item     | Cost   |\n|----------|--------|\n| Nails    | $5.00  |\n| Timber   | $55.00 |\n| Cement   | $100.00|\n| Labour   | $100.00|\n\n$260.00\n\nIf you authorize the expenditure I will have a competent mechanic to do the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. E.

It is considered that minor repairs only could be completed which would be sufficient to place the well in satisfactory condition for the coming school year. You should report further, stating the work that is absolutely necessary only, and give an estimate of the cost, when consideration will be given as to whether any funds for the purpose can be provided or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

S'livre l'eau manque.\n\nMaintenant le bois du fruit est pourri et donne mauvais go\u00fbt \u00e0 l'eau et rend cette eau impropre \u00e0 la consommation.\n\nIl faut donc refaire ce fruit.\n\nLe repaire en bois tel qu'il est, cela peut co\u00fbter environ $106.00 mais nous aurions un fruit qui manque d'ivres et bon seulement pour quelques ann\u00e9es.\n\nSi nous le repaisons d'apr\u00e8s les estim\u00e9s que je vous ai donn\u00e9es, il sera creux.\nde cinq pieds de plus; fournira de l'eau en quantit\u00e9, en tout temps. Et, \u00e9tant en ciment, il sera bon pour au moins 20 ans.\n\nDepuis que le fruit actuel existe, nos soeurs, pour l'Ecole, transportent \u00e0 la charni\u00e8re \u00e0 certains temps de s\u00e9cheresse. Il serait donc important de faire, une fois pour toujours, un fruit qui donne satisfaction et four longtemps carisez si r\u00e9paration pour 100 est suffisante.\n\nM. A. F. MacKenzie\nSec. Off. Yud\nOttawa\n\nAgent\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter dated June 20, 1933, regarding the well at the school which is made of timber and not deep enough. During winter there is no water in it. At present the timber is rotten and renders the water undrinkable.\n\nIt is consequently urgent to rebuild that well. To rebuild it as it is, in timber, would cost about $100.00; but we would still have a well that would run dry in winter and only good for a few years.\n\nIf we rebuild it according to the estimate I gave you, it will be dug 5 feet more, will supply water in quantity all the time. While being in cement, it will be good for at least 20 years.\n\nSince the present well yields our little cay water by the barrel for the school, during the dry season.\n\nIt would be important therefore to make, once for all, a well which would give satisfaction and for a long time.\n\nKindly advise me if I must spend only $100.00 for repairs.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.

(RG 10, Volume 6070, file 300-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 27, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the repairs and deepening of the well at the Bersimis Indian Day School. It is noted from the estimate which you submitted in your letter of the 9th instant that it would cost the sum of $260 for the material and labour in placing this well in good condition and providing an ample supply of water during the entire year.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that our Appropriation has been so greatly reduced that I regret we will have no funds to carry out repairs to the well. If the supply of water required cannot be obtained from the well in its present condition, the Reverend Sisters and yourself will have to make other arrangements for the supplying of the water required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This expenditure was incurred in connection with repairs to the motor at the Bersimis School.\n\nNo authority was given for this expenditure, and I wish to again draw your attention to the instructions which have been previously sent to you with regard to first securing authority before incurring any expenditure.\n\nPlease report fully, stating why it was necessary to incur this expenditure at the present time, also why you did not first write the Department for the necessary authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. Lavallee, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, P.Q.\nBersimis 3 Janv. 1934.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nRe: La votre No. 3-1-5, du 27 Dec.\nConcernant compte No.99.\n\nCette d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration du moteur est survenue accidentellement et d'une fa\u00e7on absolument impr\u00e9vue. Une courroie s'est rompue pendant que le moteur \u00e9tait en marche; ce qui a occasionn\u00e9 des d\u00e9t\u00e9riorations au moteur lui-m\u00eame.\n\nComme la r\u00e9paration \u00e9tait urgente parce que ce moteur sert \u00e0 fournir la lumi\u00e8re et l'eau \u00e0 l'Ecole, je n'avais pas le temps de demander l'autorisation sauf par t\u00e9l\u00e9gramme. Comme je n'avais aucun doute sur l'absolue n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9paration et de son urgence je n'ai pas cru devoir faire les d\u00e9penses d'envoyer un t\u00e9l\u00e9gramme \u00e0 ce sujet.\n\nB.A.V.\n\nM. E. Lavallee\nagent.\nSir,\n\nIn your letter No. 3-1-5 of the 29th day, concerning account No. 99.\n\nThat deterioration has happened accidentally and in an absolutely unforeseen manner. The belt broke while the motor was running; and that caused the motor to be damaged.\n\nAs the repairing was absolutely urgent because the motor supplies light and water at the school, I had no time to seek authorization except by telegram. As I had no doubt on the absolute necessity of the repairs and of its urgency, I did not believe it was necessary to incur the expense of sending telegrams about that matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDr. E.

Depuis quelques mois surtout, le plafond de la cuisine s'est laiss\u00e9 choir presque au complet. Cela prendra aussi probablement au moins $100.00 de r\u00e9paration.\nComme ces items ne sont pas mentionn\u00e9s sur mes estimations parce que non pr\u00e9vus alors, je tiens \u00e0 vous les mentionner d\u00e8s maintenant.\n\nB.A.V.\n\nM.

It would take about $100.00 to repair this.\n\nAs these items are not mentioned in my estimates as they were unforeseen, they I wish to bring them to your attention now.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

I note you estimate the cost would be approximately $100.\n\nYou might draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring, giving full particulars concerning the work required and the approximate cost.

Il s'agit donc de remplacer ce pl\u00e2tre aux endroits o\u00f9 il est bris\u00e9.

Two screen doors to be rebuilt; two other wooden doors to repair; they do not close any more. The veranda is falling down, the wood is rotten.\n\n2. $5.00 is too much for these repairs. I will see that only what is strictly necessary is done and I will not put the balance of the money in my pocket.\n\n3. At present there is no drinkable water at the school and that for one year past I have met you as before. For drinking the water is carried in pails. The present well, lined with wood can not be used except for ice and washing. The wood is rotten and gives a bad taste to the water. Furthermore this well gets dry every spring; it is not deep enough. It must be dug deeper, and to make a good job of it, it should be made with cement walls. I understand that it would be not my fault if the school is built on a hill and consequently the well has to be very deep.\n\nI can not understand a concern with 64 acres and 80 pupils without drinkable water. This is what has existed in the last years.\n\n4. I can not give you more explanation than I have done already. Tell you the interior of the Convent is finished in plaster and as this has been badly done it falls down. The plaster must be replaced where it falls down. Above the table in the dining room the ladies have stucked a sheet so that it does not fall in their dishes.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Nous nous sommes content\u00e9s de le vider et, pour le creusement, nous nous reprendrons plus \u00e0 bonne heure le printemps prochain avant la crue des eaux.\n\nAinsi la requisition pour le m\u00eame travail \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital ne sera pas utilis\u00e9e. Nous avons constat\u00e9 que les tuyaux d'\u00e9gout de l'H\u00f4pital se d\u00e9versent dans le puisard de l'Ecole; chose que j'ignorais car ces puisards n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverts depuis que je suis ici et personne ici ne se rappelait de ce d\u00e9tail. Alors en m\u00eame temps que les travaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s pour l'Ecole, nous en avons profit\u00e9 pour nettoyer les tuyaux de l'H\u00f4pital.\n\nAinsi les requisitions pour ces travaux s'\u00e9levant \u00e0 $ 70.00, n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es que pour le montant de $ 24.40 tel que comptes ci-joints.\n\nB.A.V.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. McKenzie\nActing Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the requisition for the cistern tank of the school amounted to $840.00, of which only $75.80 was used. We found after the tank was opened that it was not deteriorated; only the pipes were clogged, so it was sufficient to remove, clean and fit them again.\n\nFurthermore that of the residence has cost only $5.40 instead of $15.00 as requested, because the water had already reached a too high level and the digging was impossible. We only emptied it and for the digging, we will try to do it early next Spring before the high water time.\n\nAfter the requisition for the same kind of work for the hospital will not be used. We found that the sewer pipes of the hospital were emptying in the school tank, a thing I did not know at these tanks were not opened since I came here and no one here knew or remembered such detail. So that at the same time as the work was done for the school, we also cleaned the pipes from the hospital.\n\nConsequently the requisitions for this work amounting to $93.00 were only used to the extent of $24.48 as shown on the attached accounts.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs.

It leaks in two places, where the roofs of the side wings meet that of the centre portion of the building. The plastering of this building is in poor condition and falling off at several places. In the kitchen half of the ceiling has fallen down just over the stoves and plaster, dust, etc., fall in the soup of the community - to the great despair of the cook. The portion of the ceiling fallen down is about 6' x 12'. Two sheets of Bishopboard might be sufficient to repair the kitchen ceiling. The school is situated about fifty feet from the hospital and completely separated from it. The sisters live in one part of the school and have nothing to do with the hospital. There are 4 nuns, three of whom are teaching. There are three classrooms and a fourth will soon be required. There are 98 pupils during the month of June and 75 in winter.\n\n(sgd) Henri Fabien\nOttawa, August 29, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Fabien, of this Department, who visited the Bersimis Indian Day School, reports that the roof requires considerable repairs. It leaks in two places, where the roofs of the side wings meet that of the centre portion of the building. He states, also, that the plastering is in poor condition and has fallen off in several places. He refers especially to the condition of the ceiling of the kitchen and states that two or three sheets of beaver board might be sufficient to repair this ceiling.\n\nI would request that you furnish an estimate of the cost of the material and labour required in repairing the roof and also the cost of any plastering which you would recommend be carried out. Only the absolutely urgent repairs should be considered at the present time.

The best system of protection against fire would be first some chemical extinguishers that can be carried through the buildings belonging to the Department. The school, the hospital and the agent's residence; this would be for small fires starting in these buildings. This system allows rapid action and can stop a fire at the very beginning.\n\nDr. E.

J'estime beaucoup les crapauds, ces amis des jardiniers, mais je ne les aime pas au point d'en boire le jus comme nous avons fait durant plus de deux mois l'\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier.\n\nVu que tout reste toujours au m\u00eame point apr\u00e8s en avoir parl\u00e9 plusieurs fois \u00e0 l'Agent je me demande si s'en occupe r\u00e9ellement ou si c'est le D\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes qui ne veut pas voter l'argent n\u00e9cessaire. Je doute fort que l'Agent soit bien z\u00e9l\u00e9 pour cette cause surtout apr\u00e8s l'avoir vu hier donner ordre de faire une mani\u00e8re de cl\u00f4ture autour du puits laquelle ferait honneur \u00e0 Messieurs les Inspecteurs du Gouvernement s'ils le voyaient.\n\nPeut-\u00eatre serait-il bon de profiter de l'occasion des si-\nparations que n\u00e9cessite ce puits pour le faire creuser de quelque pieds pour que l'eau ne manque plus d'ici.\nCe n'est pas toujours agr\u00e9able avec une soixantaine d'enfants qui fr\u00e9quentent les classes, de manquer d'eau et de la faire \u00e0 chaudi\u00e8res chez les voisins qui malgr\u00e9 leur grande charit\u00e9 finissent par trouver cela en las-\nsant.\nD'autant plus que l'eau ne peut pas \u00eatre aussi propre \u00e0 boire charg\u00e9e par des hommes dont les habits sont sales, les chaudi\u00e8res sont souvent mises par terre pour ouvrir et fermer les portes pendant que les chiens viennent flaire la chaudi\u00e8re quand ils ne sont pas tent\u00e9s d'y boire.\nJ'esp\u00e8re que vous prendrez ma requ\u00eate en consid\u00e9ra-\ntion et que vous autoriserez notre Agent \u00e0 s'en occuper si-\nrieusement.\nEn attendant je demeure votre oblige\u00e9,\nPour Sainte-Jeanne, Sup\u00e9rieure.\nMr. A.T. MacKenzie\nSecretary of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen I wrote the annual report, I called your attention to the water. I prefer to wait to show the situation.\n\nFor six years that I have been here, we have always had no water every winter and for over a year it has been hardly drinkable.\n\nThe wooden walls of the well is completely gone, absolutely rotten, the top in the same way, so that it is dangerous to venture too near it, and through the holes in the planks small animals can easily pass. I like birds that are the friends of gardens but I hate to drink the water they take it, and that is practically what we have done for more than two months.\n\nAs we are always remaining at the same point after having spoken many times to the Agent, I am wondering if he is really telling the department what the situation is or if it is the department that does not want to allow the necessary funds for the repairs. I have doubts that the Agent is at all looking this up since he had a fence built around the well, which would be seen with disgust by the Inspector of the Government.\n\nI would be well to profit of the moment of the repairs needed to the well to have it dug a few feet more so that it would not be dry in winter.\n\nIt is far from being pleasant with about thirty...\npupils coming to school to be without water and have it carried by the pail from neighbors who in spite of their great charity find this annoying at the end.\n\nSo much more that the water can not be as clean to drink, carried by men whose clothes are dirty. The pails are often put down to open the doors and close them when dogs come and lick the pails or drink out of them.\n\nI hope you will take my request into consideration and will authorize your Agent to look this up at once.\n\nIn the mean time I remain yours respectfully,\n\n(Signed) Sister Sainte Anne Superior.\n| Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| Livrets & Aiguilles          | 20       |            | 17          |\n| VGS Broadcloth               | 1        | 35         | 1           |\n| VGS Flannellette             | 10       | 25         | 2           |\n| VGS Coton \u00e0 Drap             | 10       | 65         | 97          |\n| VGS Coton Jaune              | 10       | 97         |             |\n| Soie                         | 1        | 03         |             |\n| Laine                        | 1        | 98         |             |\n| \u00c9chelettes Soie              | 4        | 10         |             |\n| Commande C. 10712            |          |            | 7.50        |\n| Broches                      | 2        | 20         |             |\n| Doz Fil                      | 1        | 82         |             |\n| Des                          | 3        | 15         |             |\n| LB Vert 1/2 LB Rouge         | 1/2      | 78         |             |\n| Ciseaux                      | 2        | 50         |             |\n| Epingle                      | 1        | 05         |             |\n| Commande C. 10712            |          |            | 10.00       |\n\n**Note:** Les marchandises qui sont charg\u00e9es ne pourront \u00eatre remises qu'apr\u00e8s \u00e9ch\u00e9ance de cette facture et le paiement de votre ch\u00e8que pour les articles que cr\u00e9dit soit donn\u00e9 \u00e0 votre compte.\n\n**D\u00c9BIT** **CR\u00c9DIT**\n\n---\n\n**Indian Affairs.

E. Lovell\nAgent\nMonsieur,\n\nRe/ la votre No.3-1-5, datee du 5 Juin 1935.\n\nL'eau du puit est infecte. Absolument impropre pour la consommation et meme pour le lavage.\n\nIl n'est pas assez profond; actuellement, a une epoque ou les eaux sont hautes, il n'y a exactement que 16 pouces d'eau dans ce puit.\n\nCe qui veut dire que l'eau manque la plupart du temps. Encore une fois y eut-il de l'eau suffisamment, qu'elle est inutilisable.\n\nD'apres les derniers estimes, faits aujourd'hui, il en coutera environ $300.00 pour rendre ce puit en bonne condition.\n\nBois: Cedre, 4 pcs epaisseur, cadre................$130.00\nClou, 6 et 8 pcs...........7.00\nTuyaux.............50.00\nTemps des ouvriers....115.00\n\n$ 302.00.\n\nCes estimes sont approximatifs. Nous n'avons pas compte le louage de la pompe a moteur qu'il faudra, pour enlever l'eau au cours des travaux. J'esp\u00e8re que je pourrai l'emprunter de l'Ass. des Garde-feu, sans qu'il en coute rien; je n'aurai a payer que les deux hommes charges de son fonctionnement.\n\nJe croirais oiseux de donner plus de details, car depuis l'automne 1933, je demande ce puit. Et j'ai trois copies de lettres a vous adress\u00e9es, sur lesquelles il en est question. Il devrait y avoir en outre les rapports de Mr Parker, inspecteur, 1933; celui de Mr Fabien 1934; ce dernier meme, a eu l'obligeance de venir avec moi examiner ce puits tres attentivement; je ne doute pas qu'il en ait fait mention dans son rapport.\n\nJe vous fais remarquer que la construction sera plus difficile, plus couteuse a l'automne que maintenant, a cause de la crue des eaux.\n\nB.A.V.\n\nVous seriez bien aimable si vous daigniez dire a la Mere Superieure qu'il n'en depend pas de moi, si le puit n'est pas encore fait.\nLe travail peut \u00eatre fait par les indiens,\n\u00e0 la condition de mettre \u00e0 leur t\u00eate, un\ncanadien comp\u00e9tent.\nJe puis bien m'occuper de la surveillance\ndes travaux en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, mais je devrai\nmettre un homme comp\u00e9tent pour\nla direction.\n\nde Saville\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie\nActing Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nSir,\n\nThe water in the well is impure. Absolutely improper for drinking and even for washing.\n\nIt is not deep enough; at the present moment, when water is high there is exactly 16 inches of water in that well.\n\nWhich means that water is lacking most of the time.\n\nEven if there was sufficient water, we would not be able to use it.\n\nAccording to the last estimate made today, it would cost about $300.00 to put that well in good condition.\n\nWood: Cedar, 4\" thick, frame, $6.00\nNails, 6 & 8\", 7.00\nPipes, 50.00\nLabour, 115.00\n\n$232.00\n\nThese estimates are approximate. We have not mentioned the rental of the motor pump which will be necessary, to remove the water during the course of the work. I hope I can borrow it from the Fire-Department Association, without any costs; I would only have to pay the two men operating it.\n\nBelieve it is useless to give more details, because since the fall of 1933 I have been asking for that well. I shall send copies of letters addressed to you when this is mentioned. There must be also the reports of Mr. Parker, inspector, 1933; and that of Mr. Fabien in 1934; the latter has even had the kindness to come with me to examine that well very closely. I have no doubt he must have mentioned it in his report.\nI wish to remark that the construction will be more difficult and more costly in the fall than now on account of the rise of the water.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\n\nYou would be very kind if you would inform the Mother Superior that it is not our account of me if the well is not done.\n\nThe work can be done by the Indians on condition that a good man, a competent Canadian be appointed to supervise them.\n\nI can look over the work in a general way but I would need a competent man to direct it.\n\n[Signature]\nREQUISITION FOR ENCUMBRANCE CERTIFICATE\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nNOT VALID UNLESS SIGNED BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nREQUISITIONS WILL BE NUMBERED IN ONE GENERAL SEQUENCE IN THE ACCOUNTS BRANCH\n\nBRANCH: S.C.H.O.O.L.S.

You should state, on each copy of the voucher for payment of the labour, the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid. Please certify and forward these accounts to the Department for payment.\n\nThe varnishing of the floors should be completed before the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Couturier, Bersimis, for the supplying of a pump for use at the Bersimis Indian Day School.\n\nThere is a charge of $2 for express and also a charge of $1.20 for freight from Montreal. Before the Treasury Branch will pay the account, it will be necessary for you to obtain from Jos. Couturier receipts for the amount of express and freight charges. These receipts you should forward to the Department as soon as possible, in order that the account can be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

This work, according to Indian Agent Lavallee, will cost in the neighborhood of $500.\n\nThe work can be satisfactorily performed by the Indians under supervision of a competent white foreman, and with the assistance of the Indian Agent. Will you please advise me if it will be necessary to ask the Minister's office for the name of a man to take charge of this work, or if this can be left to the discretion of the Agent.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nJuly 24, 1935.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Buckard.\n\nThe Department is contemplating the repairing of a well to supply water to the Beresford Indian Day School, Beresford, Que.\n\nThe work, according to Indian Agent Lavallee, will cost in the neighborhood of $500.

There is one of $2.00 for which I obtained a voucher from Captain Jourdain, which is enclosed. This amount was paid to Mr. Jourdain for transportation of the old Bersimis pump to Quebec, and from Quebec to Montreal. Before purchasing the new pump, I have sent the old one to the Fairbanks Co., in order to know if it could be repaired.\n\nThe two hours work mentioned have been put in by the same Company, for examination of the old pump. With respect to the amount of $6.34 for freight, I think that the voucher was attached to the account. This amount represents transportation paid beforehand by the Company, Montreal to Bersimis, of the new pump, and of the old pump, which was returned because it could not be repaired.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) Dr. E.

This request coincides with a similar one made to me verbally by the matron of the hospital.\n\nI sincerely believe that this expenditure should be more warranted than the one for the school. At any rate, I believe that the request is very reasonable and I beg to recommend same.\n\nThree private families, here at Bersimis, have been using the gasoline Connor washing machine; excellent results have been obtained therefrom. The same machine could be used in both institutions.\n\nI have obtained information on this subject and the most practical model would be the Thermo 21 C. at $172.50. There is also a smaller model at $159.50.\n\nIf you take into consideration the strenuous work entailed by hand washing, you will readily understand why I recommend this expenditure, insofar as the same machine could be used for the school and the hospital.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Dr. E. Lavall\u00e9e,\nAgent.\nOttawa, January 18th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, you may inform the Mother Superior of the Bersimis Indian Day School that, owing to lack of funds, the Department is unable to consider purchasing the washing machine requested by her.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Please let me know if you had this work completed.\n\nAn advance of $200 to pay labour was forwarded to you on October 5th.

He said he explained to you how those rooms would need additional work so as to make them suitable for that purpose and for other purposes. According to his estimate, this additional work would require an expense of about three hundred dollars. I guess such expense should be sufficient to transform those rooms into a good recreation hall for the children, or into a good assembly hall which could shelter the Indians on rainy days, whenever the agent or some inspector would want to speak to them, or serve as an evening-hall for concerts and plays given once in a while by the scholars (indian just as well as canadian) drilled by their Nun-teachers or for instructive and interesting movies censured and given by myself and my assistant-priest, or some other purposes. Doctor Lavall\u00e9e told me lately he never had any answer in that concerning.....\n\nAs a matter of fact, those rooms have been almost useless ever since that indian school was built; at least until last Fall, when, with the agent's agreement, we started giving movies with Canadian Government 16 mm. films and other interesting films rented from companies. Yet those rooms are not very suitable for that purpose; but there is no other place. The total net profit of those movies, though very modest, is for the benefit of our church, which church has been in debt for over ten thousand dollars ever since the depression began. Still if you should decide that you can't favor us with the sum of three hundred dollars for the desired work, I would still be most thankful to you if you would at least grant us the sum of two hundred dollars for that purpose. I would try and pay the balance with our movies profit, although it might take us a year's profit to pay such balance.\n\nIn the meantime, waiting for a prompt and favorable reply, either to Doctor Lavall\u00e9e, your agent for Bersimis Reserve, or to myself, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nReverend Father Denis Doucet\n\"Head-Missionary\"\nBersimis, P.Q.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, our Appropriation for the fiscal year 1936-37 has been reduced, and the Department has, therefore, no funds with which to make repairs at the Bersimis Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Denis Doucet,\nBersimis,\nP.Q.\nOttawa, April 4, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Rev. Denis Doucet, requesting an expenditure of $200 or $300 in making improvements to the Bersimis Day School. Our Appropriation this year has been reduced, and we are, therefore, informing Father Doucet that we will have no funds for this purpose.\n\nWhen writing the Department, Father Doucet states that he has been using rooms in the basement of the school for concerts, and that moving pictures have been shown by using 16 mm. films.\n\nAs far as our files show, no permission has been given by the Department for holding movies, and the use of films, without due precaution being taken, constitutes a fire hazard. I regret that it is necessary to advise you that the holding of movies in the basement of this building must be discontinued, but the Department is obliged to protect its property.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Jeanne. Please let me have a report regarding her request, giving an estimate of the cost involved. You should understand that, owing to the reduction in our Appropriation this year, it will not be possible to consider any heavy expenditure at the Bersimis School. Please return the Rev. Sister's letter with your reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nE. Lavallee, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, P.

Lavallee, Indian Agent, Bersimis, P.Q., requests authority to proceed with certain repairs required at the Bersimis School and hospital.\n\nHis Estimates requested the following:\n\n$100 for exterior painting of the school,\n$200 for repairing recreation room in the school.\nOttawa, May 11th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th ultimo, the Department is not prepared, owing to lack of funds, to authorize the exterior painting of the Bersimis Indian Day School this year.\n\nRegarding your request for repairs to the recreation room in the school, please advise me fully what you consider should be done. In replying, you should state the approximate amount required for material and for labour. You should, also, advise why you consider it necessary to repair the recreation room.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. E. Lavallee,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, Que.\nCouvent des SS. de N.-D. du Bon-Conseil,\nN.-D. de Bethsiamite, April 6, 1936.\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSimultaneously with our annual requisition, I beg to submit the following. Our Convent has no attic but big cellars which are not of much use to us. They are always open and full of dust from the classrooms and from the heating plant. It is quite impossible to have a clean corner in which to store trunks, linen, etc. I believe it is not asking too much to request that a room be arranged in the cellar with large cupboards. This would not be very expensive and would be very useful to us.\n\nMoreover, all things that are in use finally wear out. We have thus no spare bed sheets. Could you let us have enough money to buy 4 or 6 pairs of flannelette sheets?\n\nWith regard to the teaching of domestic science, would it be possible to obtain a little money this year? The cotton bought last year has been made into shirts for the boys and aprons and drawers for the girls. You have no idea how useful to the children these lessons have been. This is, after all, the most important part of the programme in this place.\nHoping to receive a favourable reply, I am,\n\nYours gratefully,\n\n(sgd.) Sister Sainte Jeanne.\nMonsieur le Secr\u00e9taire,\n\nEn m\u00eame temps que notre r\u00e9union annuelle je me permets de faire une petite r\u00e9clame.

Je ne crois pas \u00eatre trop exigeante en demandant de faire une chambre dans la cave, avec de grandes armoires, ce qui ne serait pas tr\u00e8s dispendieux et nous serait d'une grande utilit\u00e9.\n\nSouscrire comme tout ce qui serait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 notre derni\u00e8re change de draps de lit je vous prie d'avoir la bonne de nous fournir la somme n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'achat de 4 ou 6 paires de draps de flanellette.\n\nEt pour l'enseignement m\u00e9nager ? Donnez-vous\nune petite somme encore cette ann\u00e9e? Le coton achet\u00e9 l'an dernier a servi \u00e0 la confection de chemises pour gar\u00e7ons, tabliers et cal\u00e8cons pour fillettes et nous ne savons encore combien ils profiteront des le\u00e7ons qu'ils re\u00e7oivent, et c'est bien cette mati\u00e8re qui leur est plus utile ici.\n\nEsp\u00e9rant \u00eatre exauc\u00e9e en mes petites requ\u00eates,\n\nJe me sousserai,\n\nVotre oblig\u00e9e\n\nS\u0153ur Sainte Jeanne\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, April 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the enclosed letter from Rev. Sister Ste. Jeanne. Please let me have a report regarding her request, giving an estimate of the cost involved. You should understand that, owing to the reduction in our Appropriation this year, it will not be possible to consider any heavy expenditure at the Bersimis School. Please return the Rev. Sister's letter with your reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nE. Lavallee, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, P. Q.\nMonsieur,\n\nRe/ la votre ci-attach\u00e9e:\n\nLes estimates sont d'environ $45.00 de mat\u00e9riel (bois et clou)\n$30.00 de travail\n\nP.A.V.\n\nThe estimates are as follows:\n\n$45.00 for material (lumber and nails)\n$30.00 for labour.\nMonsieur A.F. Mackenzie,\nSec.Aff. Indiennes, Ottawa.\n\nMonsieur;\n\nRe/ la votre No.3-1-5 du 11 Mai.\n\nCette salle fait partie du rez-de-chauss\u00e9e de l'Ecole et couvre un gros tiers de la superficie de toute la b\u00e2tisse; elle est pav\u00e9e en ciment et les murs se trouvent form\u00e9s par le salage lui-m\u00eame. Il y a fen\u00eatres, chauffage, lumi\u00e8re et W.C.\n\nPour que cette salle fut utilisable, il faudrait n\u00e9cessairement qu'elle eut un plancher en bois, un plafond en mat\u00e9riel l\u00e9ger, pas n\u00e9cessairement en bois; et que les murs en soient peintures.\n\nD'apr\u00e8s le plan initial de construction de la b\u00e2tisse, cet appartement \u00e9tait destin\u00e9 \u00e0 cette fin, mais il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9.\n\nSa principale utilit\u00e9 serait comme salle de r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation. En effet, les enfants n'ont aucun local pour cela. L'\u00e9t\u00e9 lorsqu'il fait beau ils sortent, mais l'hiver et les jours de pluie, ils sont entass\u00e9s dans les classes et y passent leurs r\u00e9cr\u00e9ations.\n\nCette salle servirait en m\u00eame temps de salle publique que les indiens utiliserait pour leurs s\u00e9ances de conseil ou leur caucus de tout genre.\n\nLe co\u00fbt en serait approximativement de $200.00 pour mat\u00e9riel et 50 \u00e0 $75.00 pour le travail.\n\nB.A.V.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6070, file 300-5, part 5)\nBersimis, May 18, 1936.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Your letter of May 11, 3/1/5.\n\nThis hall is part of the ground floor of the school and covers a full 1/3 of the floor space of the whole building. It has a cement floor and the walls are the foundations themselves. There are windows, heating and lighting and W.Cs.\n\nIn order to make use of this hall, it should have a wood floor, a ceiling made up of light material, not necessarily wood, and the walls should be painted.\n\nAccording to the original plan of the building, this hall was to be used for that purpose, but it never was finished. It could be used mainly as a recreation hall. In fact, the children are provided with no place for that purpose. In the summer time, when the weather is nice, they go out, but in the winter time and on rainy days, they are packed in the classrooms and that is where they spend their recreation time.\n\nThe hall could at the same time be used as a Committee hall where the Indians could hold their council meetings or their caucuses.\n\nIt would cost approximately $200. for material and from $50. to $75. for labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Dr. E. Lavall\u00e9e,\nAgent.\nOttawa, May 28th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to requests contained in letter from Rev. Sister Ste. Jeanne dated April 6th, last.\n\nIn view of the authority being granted to make improvements to the recreation hall, it will not be possible to carry out the other work requested by the Rev. Sister.\n\nYou may, however, arrange for the purchase and delivery of sewing material for the academic year 1936-37 at a cost not exceeding $10.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. Lavallee, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, P.Q.\nOttawa, May 28th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, you may arrange for the repairs which you consider necessary to place the recreation hall in the Bersimis Day School in good condition. The cost of these repairs must not exceed the amount mentioned in your letter, viz., $200 for material and a maximum of $75 for labour. The purchase of the material should be made from firms on the approved list, and Indian labour should be employed if at all possible.\n\nIt should be distinctly understood that this is all that the Department will be able to allow at the Bersimis School this year, and we are, therefore, depending on you to have the necessary improvements made at a cost not exceeding that mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE.

Our house, which was built in 1923, has not been repaired since then, and is in need of such repairs in many cases. The roof leaks and, in winter, the snow melts through in such fashion that since the middle of January, we have had to keep 6 or 8 containers on the window sills to catch the water which comes in through the windows. The outside walls are slowly crumbling away, and in many places where the bricks have fallen out, there is no longer any cement around the windows, all of which causes the house to be very cold. On some days, although the furnace gage varies from 150 to 160 degrees in our classrooms, the thermometer indicates only 60 degrees above zero.\n\nInside the house, the frost, each winter, has caused the plaster to fall in many cases, and I believe it would not be too much to ask that you renew the walls which have been blackened and yellowed by the winter leaking through the roof. There are also a few other necessary improvements which would require immediate attention. A few feet behind the Convent, they had to dig a drain before the building could be erected, and now, this drain is crumbling away each year and the solidity of the foundations will soon be imperilled. After snow melted, last year, there were large holes where the earth had fallen away and which we filled in with soft earth, but I do not think that should prove to be sufficient. In front of the entrance to the building, the sidewalk is practically all broken up, and a few of the boards we have laid across are all broken, and thus have become dangerous for the children. You must also understand that in a classroom of Indians, it would be very useful to spray some disinfectant at least a few times a week, especially in this case, seeing that for some time now the children have been suffering, in general,\nfrom the scabies and the itch, and that there is no other possible means of stopping the progress of infection. Lastly, I would request that you authorize us to spend the sum of $10.00 to renew small housekeeping articles.\n\nI trust you will take these requests into serious consideration, and I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) Sr. Ste-Jeanne,\nSuperior.\n\nN.B.- The Agent being absent, I have been unable to have him sign my requisition.\nOttawa, April 27, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the enclosed letter from Rev. Sister Ste. Jeanne regarding the Bersimis Indian Day School.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a small quantity of disinfectant and you may, also, expend an amount not exceeding $10.00 in the purchase of articles for the teachers' residence.\n\nProvision has been made in the current year's appropriation for an expenditure of $250.00 in repairing the Bersimis School. Please let me have a report, stating what work you recommend should be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. E. Lavallee,\nIndian agent,\nBersimis, Que.\nOttawa, April 27, 1937.\n\nDear Madam,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, the Department is authorizing the Indian Agent to purchase a small quantity of disinfectant and, also, to expend $10.00 in the purchase of articles for your residence.\n\nRegarding the repairs to the building, the sum of $250.00 is provided in the appropriation for the current fiscal year and Doctor Lavallee is being requested to report what repairs he considers could be done for this amount, which cannot be exceeded.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Sister Ste. Jeannie,\nSuperior,\nBersimis Indian Day School,\nBetsiamites, P. Q.\nMonsieur T.R.L. MacInnes,\nSec.Aff.Indiennes, Ottawa.\n\nMonsieur:\n\nRe/ la votre du 27 Avril faisant suite \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation de la Rvde M\u00e8re Sup\u00e9rieure, concernant les r\u00e9parations \u00e0 l'Ecole de Bersimis.\n\nSur mes derniers estim\u00e9s j'ai demand\u00e9 300.00 pour peinturage des portes et fen\u00eatres \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur et mastiquage des vitres; depuis 14 ans que la b\u00e2tisse existe, rien de tel n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Pas n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00eatre savant pour savoir que c'est n\u00e9cessaire.\n\nCe que dit la Rvde M\u00e8re sur sa lettre est malheureusement strictement vrai.\n\nLe trottoir qui entoure l'Ecole est en ruine.\n\nL'eau et la neige p\u00e9n\u00e8trent autour des fen\u00eatres et ch\u00e2ssis et le vent toujours du c\u00f4t\u00e9 ou il vente.\n\nLa b\u00e2tisse a \u00e9t\u00e9 excessivement mal construite. La brique menace de tomber de partout. L'on peut, \u00e0 la main, enlever les briques. Le mortier est en partie disparu de telle sorte qu'entre les briques il y a un espace. Malgr\u00e9 que la fournaise soit amplement suffisante pour chauffer la b\u00e2tisse, on r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 d\u00e9penser trente tonnes de charbon par hiver. Les enfants y gelent \u00e0 c\u0153ur d'hiver, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 o\u00f9 vient le vent, cependant que du c\u00f4t\u00e9 oppos\u00e9 au vent, les autres grillent.\n\nSur ma demande et avec moi, il y a deux ans, l'Inspecteur Fabien, a examin\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail la b\u00e2tisse et a pris note de la situation. Je n'en ai plus jamais entendu parler. Il est entendu que d'ici peu d'ann\u00e9es, les murs tomberont par pans, s'ils ne sont pas r\u00e9par\u00e9s.\n\nLa r\u00e9paration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la b\u00e2tisse qui s'impose est de mettre du mortier entre chacune des briques; cela veut dire autant de travail que de faire un mur neuf. Tous les murs int\u00e9rieurs sont d\u00e9labr\u00e9s et tombent en ruine, cela cause par l'eau qui a filtr\u00e9 de partout et un peu aussi parce qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mal faits. Alors pour r\u00e9parer l'ext\u00e9rieur convenablement et refaire l'int\u00e9rieur, je crois qu'une d\u00e9pense d'environ $1500.00 seront n\u00e9cessaires.\n\nLe toit aussi devra \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9; il est actuellement en bardeau; je suis d'avis qu'il vaudra mieux le recouvrir en toile; cela pourra repr\u00e9senter 4 \u00e0 500.00 au moins.\n\nAvec le $250.00 allou\u00e9 cette ann\u00e9e, \u00e9videmment, aucun de ces travaux ne peut \u00eatre entrepris. Ce que nous pouvons faire est de peindre les ouvertures, ce qui est urgent, autant de bloquer l'eau autour des fen\u00eatres en posant du mortier autour des briques qui les entourent.\nL'un ou l'autre de ces travaux coutera approximativement le m\u00eame prix. Pour faire les deux qui sont aussi urgents l'un que l'autre, il en faudra le double. Vous en d\u00e9ciderez comme il vous plaira.\n\nB.A.V.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6070, file 300-5, part 5)\nBersimis, May 15, 1937.\n\nMr. T.R.L. MacInnes,\nSec. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nRe your letter of April 27th., with reference to a complaint made by the Reverend Mother Superior, in connection with the repairs to be made to the Bersimis school.\n\nIn my last estimates I have asked for $300.00 to paint the outside doors and windows and puttying the glass; nothing has been done for the last 14 years, and no one need to be a learned man to know that the thing is necessary.\n\nMother Superior states the exact truth in her letter.\n\nThe sidewalks around the school are crumbling into pieces.\n\nRain, snow and wind filter around the windows and sashes.\n\nThe building was not at all well built in the first place. The bricks are nearly falling off; one can take them out with the hand. The mortar is partly fallen off, leaving open spaces between the bricks. Though the furnace is sufficient to heat the building it takes 30 tons of coal every winter. The children are suffering from cold on the side exposed to the wind, while they are burning on the other side.\n\nTwo years ago, on my request, Inspector Fabien and\nI examined the building in all its details and took note of its condition. I never heard about it since. It is understood that in a few years the walls will fall down if they are not repaired.\n\nThe general repairs required consist in fixing the bricks which is as much work as building a new wall. The inside walls need repairs because water filtering through and because they were not well built in the first place. Then a sum of about $1,500 would be required to conveniently repair the outside and inside walls.\n\nThe roof needs also to be repaired. Actually it is covered with shingles. In my opinion it would be better to cover it with sheet iron. That work would cost between $400 and $500.\n\nWith the $250 allowance that work could not be undertaken this year. The only thing that could be done would be to paint the doors and windows, which is urgently needed, or to attempt to stop the water from filtering around the windows.\n\nBoth works would involve approximately the same expenditure. Twice the amount would be required to do both jobs.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Dr. E. Lavall\u00e9e,\nAgent.\nOttawa, June 4, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 15th ultimo, with reference to certain repairs and improvements which you consider necessary at the Bersimis Indian Day School.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of April 27th, last, the sum of $250.00 is available during the current fiscal year for repairs to the Bersimis School. It is noted, from your letter, that this amount would enable you to prevent the water from filtering around the windows, and this work should be done. If this work does not require the total amount of $250.00, the balance may be expended in making whatever repairs you consider most necessary. The point to be kept in mind is that the total amount of the repairs and improvements at the Bersimis School must not exceed $250.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Depuis quelques ans au moins, ces \u00e9tudiants \u00e9coliers n'ont re\u00e7u comme prix de leur assiduit\u00e9 et de leur application que des bagatelles, que l'ing\u00e9niosit\u00e9, des bricolages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts de parents et d'amis; le Department ne s'y \u00e9tait pas rendu cette ann\u00e9e ces ressources nous manquent c'est pourquoi je voudrais vous demander de vouloir bien faire votre part aujourd'hui. $12.00 plus si vous le voulez, nous ferait grand plaisir \u00e0 ceux qui auront d\u00e9montr\u00e9 depuis nombre d'ann\u00e9es au milieu de ces pauvres enfants sauvages et \u00e0 ceux enfants dociles et appliqu\u00e9s.\n\nIndian Affairs.

For the last four years at least, these studious Indians have received as prizes for their application nothing but trifles which their teachers were able to obtain from parents and friends, the Department having furnished nothing. This year we have been unable to obtain nothing and so I would like to request that the Department do its share now. We who have devoted ourselves for quite a number of years to these poor Indians would greatly appreciate receiving at least $12.00 to this end, or more if possible.\n\nI trust you will give this your kind attention as you well understand that emulation and assiduity cannot be maintained without some form of reward. The Agent shares our view in the matter and judges the thing to be absolutely necessary this year.\n\nI, Sister Marie du Carmel, Superior and teacher here at Bethsiamits for the last twenty years can assure you that we have never taken advantage of the Department's favours neither for ourselves nor for our pupils. That is why I am confident of obtaining the small allowance requested this year.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) Sister Marie du Carmel,\nSuperior.\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant requesting a grant to purchase prizes to be given to the children at the end of June.\n\nWe have received similar requests from many other Indian Schools but owing to lack of funds it has been found impossible to favourably consider these requests. I, therefore, regret that the grant that you ask for for the Bersimis School cannot be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

It is difficult to believe that after only fourteen years such repairs should be necessary to this building; it is what I call a poor job, whoever made it.\n\nThe sidewalk about the school and hospital is all rotted and considered dangerous. It was built fourteen years ago and poor judgment used in its construction. It is four feet wide, eight 6\" wide 2\" planks laid lengthwise and close together. I suggest rebuilding it with six 6\" wide 2\" planks lengthwise with 1\" space between, which will prevent moisture and be plenty wide. It is 500' long and 5\" x 5 cross pieces under at three-foot intervals.\n\nInside: The plaster ceiling is falling off; I would recommend metal ceiling to replace plaster.\n\nLight repairs are needed to some of the walls in the following rooms; entrance hall, cloak room and Junior Indian classroom. All walls need whitewashing and all woodwork should be painted as soon as possible.\n\nThe furnace in the cellar is in very good condition and the place is kept very clean.\n\nElectricity is produced by a Canadian Fairbanks Morse Generator, 32 volts, connected to a 3 H.P. Canadian Fairbanks Morse gasoline engine and glass storage batteries. The batteries having been renewed in 1931, they are now practically obsolete. The system installed in 1924 is not giving satisfactory service for school and hospital. May I suggest, therefore, that this engine and generator with a new set of storage batteries be installed in the agent's residence at Seven Islands, where there is no electricity and such installation having been under consideration in the past.\n\nThere is also connected to this engine a water pump which is in very good condition, and giving\nsatisfactory service. This could remain here, but I would suggest the installation of a water pump at Seven Islands whenever this suggested change is made here.\n\nI recommend a more powerful installation to replace the actual one; 110 volts, 5 H.P. engine and generator, which should be sufficient to improve the lighting here, in the hospital, at the Agent's residence and the R.C.M.P. quarters.\n\nI hope sufficient funds are available to take care of this change in the very near future.\n\nJ.

This is a very simple operation and anyone can put paint on the blackboards in a very short time. If the cupboard in the kitchen is really necessary you may expend an amount not exceeding $11.00 for material and labour.\n\nThe Department is prepared to consider reshingling the building but it is considered that your estimate is altogether too high.\n\nI note that you mention that 45,000 shingles will be required and that these can be secured at $4.00 a thousand. Please let me know if these are first quality shingles and the name and address of the firm from whom you secured the quotation.\n\nYou mention that 100 gallons of shingle paint is required. How many coats of shingle stain did you intend to give these shingles? The Department estimates that only 30 gallons is required for one coat.\n\nYou state that it will require 2 men for 60 days to do the necessary work. I understand that a competent tradesman can lay 200 square feet of shingles a\n\nW. Barolet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, Que.\nday; consequently the 45,000 shingles should be laid by the 2 men in a period not longer than 12 days. This would reduce the charge for labour to $62.40 instead of your estimate of $312.00. Please let me know if you can get the work done in the period of time mentioned and also state whether it is your intention to employ Indians or white men. If white men are to be employed you should let me know the name and address of the person who you consider could do the work.\n\nThe replacing of the mortar or cement between the bricks appears to be necessary but your estimate seems extremely high. You mention that the following material will be required: cement - $12.00, lime - $7.50, bricks - $2.50, or a total expenditure for material of $22.00. To do the necessary labour, however, you estimate the cost at $520.00. It seems out of the question that the labour would cost such a very large amount in view of the very small amount of material that is being used. Please give this matter further attention and ascertain if the work could not be done at a much more reasonable figure.\n\nThe estimates for the other work which you suggest also appear very high and as no funds are available no consideration can be given to them at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I allowed for labour more time than I really expected it would take in case of being compelled to employ tradesmen from outside of Bersimis in which case the salary for each man would be no less than $7.00 per day, that is $5.00 per day for labour, plus $2.00 for board, besides the expense for transportation.\n\nI cannot say exactly how long two men would take to lay the shingles but I am sure that the work cannot be done in 12 days by men of this locality, that is including the removal of old shingles and the necessary construction of a scaffolding and its changing of places seven times at least.\n\nAs to shingle stain, my intention was to have shingles to stand in the stain, the shingles thus saturated with the stain ought to last longer but, of course, this operation requires much more stuff. I shall inform you of the price for first quality shingles as soon as I get quotation from outside trader.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAs for the replacing of mortar or cement between the bricks, I made my estimate from what had already been paid for the same kind of work. In 1937, $223.00 were paid for labour for about one third of the work which remains to be done; at that rate the labour would cost $446.00 for the projected work and I added some seventy five dollars for the scaffolding which has to be made to a large extent.\n\nIt is very hard to get accurate estimates for work of this kind as there is no real tradesman at Bersimis. I possibly could get Georges Deschenes, a tradesman from the neighborhood, to make estimates for such repairs; I beg to suggest that I be authorized to expend the sum of $15.00 for that purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilfrid Barelet\n\n(Wilfrid Barelet, M.D.)\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Requisition for School Material forwarded at the end of March, 1939, by Sister St. Michel des Saints, Bersimis Indian Day School, Bethsiamits, P.Q.\n\n- Original on No. 3-1-4 -\n\nSister St. Michel des Saints requests the following:\n\n4 chairs, folding, 17\" backs,\n2 tables, square or round, 24\" in. in dia.\n3 benches for the grounds\n\nalso\nsubscription of $10 for household science.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes\n\n3-1-5\n\nJUNE 15 1939\n\nDR H W MCGILL\nc/o DR GERARD BEAULIEU\nINDIAN AGENT\nSEVEN ISLANDS QUE\n\nWILL APPRECIATE YOUR REQUESTING MR ARMSTRONG TO INVESTIGATE\nAND REPORT ON REPAIRS REQUIRED BERSIMIS SCHOOL STOP AT THE\nAGENT'S OFFICE HE WILL FIND MY LETTER OF MAY SIXTEENTH AND\nAGENT'S REPLY OF MAY TWENTY FIFTH WITH REFERENCE TO THE\nREPAIRS\n\nR A HOEY\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

As I had some idea of what was required, I visited the School.\n\nIt appears that the building was erected in or about 1925 by a Hull firm. The Doctor says that the roof leaked the first year after it was built, so you will have some idea of the workmanship. Cedar shingles usually last more than twelve years.\n\nThe plaster inside is badly cracked, perhaps from frost heaving. In many places, especially the kitchen of the teacher's residence, the ceiling has been temporarily repaired with cloth. From observation, I would say that the ceilings of the rooms should be replastered or possibly they could be tinned the same as the class-rooms.\n\nThe ceiling near the walls shows water stains on one side and I would recommend that a patching job to the roof would be sufficient to meet requirements and could be carried out for a small fraction of the estimated cost of new roof. I would think that maybe $75.00 would be sufficient.\n\nThe sidewalk (plank) is in very poor condition. This walk is used by the Indians all the time and I think that it\n\n...........might be\nmight be taken up altogether and replaced by cinders, crushed stone or gravel. The first cost of which would be much less than a plank walk and the subsequent upkeep would be nil. If the plank walk were replaced by another plank walk, it would soon need repairs, as the spruce plank which appears to be used on the North Shore soon rots when placed close to the ground.\n\nThe Sisters complained of the grease trap in the kitchen; this is a barrel-like affair through which the water from the sink passes before going into the sewer. It was installed with the idea of obtaining grease to make soft soap. It has proved unsatisfactory and in warm weather is the source of a very bad odour. This trap might be removed and the sink waste-pipe attached directly to the pipe leading to the sewer. The cost of this change should be very small unless a plumber has to be brought in from Rinskowski or some outside point with consequent heavy transportation charges.\n\nGibson Armstrong,\nHead Clerk,\nWelfare & Training Division.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR.

You may therefore make immediate arrangements for the patching of the roof on the distinct understanding, that the total cost of material and labour will not exceed $75.00.\n\nIt is reported that the plank side-walk is in very poor condition. What remains of this walk should be taken up and replaced by cinders, crushed stone, or gravel. Please let me know what it would cost to secure one of the three materials mentioned.\n\nThe grease trap in the kitchen is proving unsatisfactory.

August 30th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 8th, regarding repairs to be made to the roof of the school building, the sidewalk and the grease trap in the kitchen of the school, I beg to report as follows:\n\n1- Mr. Eugene Miller, a tradesman, has examined the roof and said that it is not worth repairing; he himself would not take the job knowing that he could not make a satisfactory work. Mr. Miller suggests that the whole roof be renewed.\n\n2- About the sidewalk Mr. Miller says that it is hard even approximately to estimate the cost of removing and replacing it by cinders, crushed stone or gravel. He appears to be rather in favour of replacing it by gravel and making 5 feet wide in order to have a better chance to round it. The cost would not be less than $125.00.\n\n3- The grease trap has been removed and I am awaiting for a special pipe to make a connection with the sink waste-pipe and the pipe leading to the sewer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Wilfrid Barelet)\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 12, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to repairs at the Bersimis Indian day school.\n\nIn your letter of May 4 you estimated that it would cost approximately $770.00 to place a new roof on the Bersimis school. There are no funds available for such a heavy expenditure. I, therefore, consider that you should proceed with minor repairs to make the building habitable during the winter. It is understood, of course, that in making these repairs the expenditure must not exceed $75.00.\n\nIn view of the amount required for a new sidewalk the Department finds it impossible to provide the funds that would be necessary and consequently no action can be taken at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW.

Please let me know why you apparently require such a large number of bulbs. The quantities mentioned on your requisition appear excessive. You should also state why you require bulbs of different sizes. It is doubtful if the capacity of the electric light plant that is installed will satisfactorily use some of the bulbs that you request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. W. Barolet,\nIndian Agent,\nBersimis, Que.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant with regard to my requisition for electric light bulbs and to furnish you, in reply, with the following explanation:\n\nAt the school building there are 43 lights with bulbs of different sizes and as a bulb, at times, is liable to become useless within a few months, 20 spare bulbs for such a building do not appear to me to be excessive. Actually, there are bulbs missing in some rooms because they have been taken away to some other rooms where light was urgently needed. One cannot expect to have the bulbs interchanged from one room to another in proportion of the light needed. After replacing missing or burnt bulbs there will be but a few spare bulbs left.\n\nAt the agency house there are 28 lights and the same explanation stands for this building.\n\nAs to the hospital building there are but 10 lights and the number of bulbs requisitioned might be reduced to 20.\n\nI have to state that all the sizes asked for are actually used satisfactorily larger sizes being used where better light is needed. Of course, the capacity of the electric light plant would not suffice were all the lights used at the same time which case never occurs.\n\nHoping that these explanations will be found satisfactory I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. R.A. Heey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 2, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo regarding electric light bulbs for the school, hospital and agency residence at Bersimis you may purchase 21 electric light bulbs for the use of the school, 15 for the use of the hospital and 15 for the Agency residence. It is noted from the requisition that you were purchasing bulbs of 32 voltage. The Department understands that the plant at Bersimis is 110 volts. In purchasing the electric light bulbs authorized in this letter you should be careful to purchase exactly what is required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. W.

En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, cette ordonnance ne nous concerne pas directement, car nous demandons \u00e0 votre \u00c9tablissement, depuis 3 ans, \u00e0 ma connaissance, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s restrictives. Sans oublier votre recommandation, j'ose toutefois me adresser votre requ\u00eate pour la nouvelle ann\u00e9e scolaire esp\u00e9rant que vous ne refuserez pas de les remplir. M. l'Agent en a pris connaissance et il n'y a rien retenu. Il m'autorise \u00e0 me le adresser moi-m\u00eame.\n\nNotre ancien, qui est \u00e0 notre service depuis 17 ans, dit que les articles r\u00e9clam\u00e9s pour la fourniture et l'entretien de la maison n'ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9s, \u00e0 sa connaissance. Ce qui prouve qu'ils sont indispensables.\n\nComme nous devons aller en vacances pour quelque temps, pourriez-vous nous faire parvenir ces effets par le bateau? Une gruelette de transport vers la mi-juin afin que nous puissions les mettre en s\u00fbret\u00e9.\nJe dois vous dire que j'ai d\u00fb d\u00e9penser, pendant les 2 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, pr\u00e8s de $15., sur l'argent de votre Communaut\u00e9, pour des objets et des r\u00e9parations d'urgence.

Notre M\u00e8re G\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne conseille de nous faire conna\u00eetre cet \u00e9tat de choses, ce qui ne s'est pas encore vu; elle ajoute que le D\u00e9partement l'ignore, car il avait l'habitude de donner ce que r\u00e9clamaient les Institutions. Est-ce que vous ne pouviez pas nous autoriser \u00e0 acheter notre nourriture au march\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire et l'indispensable chez un de nos marchands ici qui pr\u00e9senterait ensuite le compte \u00e0 M. votre Agent?\n\nUn autre point, par le pass\u00e9, les rem\u00e8des nous \u00e9taient fournis gratuitement.

Directrice des Classes Indiennes.\nIndian School, Betsiamitsi,\nMay 6, 1940.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nI have received your circular letter requesting us to economize as much as possible. I do not think that these instructions apply to us particularly, as for the last three years our requests to the Department have been very reasonable.\n\nWithout overlooking your recommendation however, I am sending you our requisition for the new school-year, in the hope that you will not refuse to send us the items needed. The Agent has gone over this requisition and did not strike out anything, and he authorized me to send it to you direct.\n\nOur caretaker, who has been with us for 15 years, claims that as far as he is aware the articles requested for the furnace and for the upkeep of the house have never been renewed, which proves that they are absolutely needed.\n\nAs we are to leave on a few weeks holiday, could you send us these items by the freight boat \"Sept-Iles\" around the middle of June in order that they may be stored away in a safe place. I must say that in the last two years I was compelled to spend almost $75.00 out of the funds of the community for urgent repairs and needed articles. We had to do so as it is impossible for us to secure even a few cents here. Your house is falling to pieces and the ceiling in our apartments threatens to fall on top of us. Our General Superior has urged me to bring this situation to your attention. She commands that the Department must not be aware of the seriousness of the situation, as it has always in the past given what was required by the school-teachers. Could you not authorize us to purchase at least what is essential from local merchants who could then send the bill to your Agent?\nFurther, I wish to point out that in the past the medicine was supplied to us free of charge. Now, we must purchase with our own money what is needed. Has there been a change of policy in this respect? We should be obliged if you would reply to these questions.\n\nI trust that you will consider favourably the present request and I remain,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n(Sgd.) S. M. de St-Octave,\nSuperior and Director\nof Indian classes.\nOttawa:\nJune 3, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter dated May 6 the Sister Superior of the Bersimis School wrote to the Department regarding repairs and furnishings which she stated were necessary. In view of the decision not to operate this school during the academic year 1940-41 the Department considers it unnecessary to supply the articles requested by the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I am just making a mention of it, as I do not expect that much funds are available at this time, besides it would be too late in the season to make any repairs this year.\n\nAs you will see on the annexed photograph, the sidewalks which I had recommended to be rebuilt in 1939 are a menace, and I took it upon myself to order the removal of the whole thing to avoid any possible accident, as I feel it will be much safer to walk on the ground than on such a dilapidated sidewalk.\n\nThe Agent had quite a time deciding the sisters to go away after the school term, as at least one or two of them insisted on occupying the building, as they used to do in years previous to the change to a short term course; however when they were told that the Department would not heat the building during the winter, they decided to go. I believe it was a good economy to cut down the school term to four months. If the Sisters are not interested in short school term, they could be replaced by lay teachers. I have learned confidentially of certain things that happened at the school, which I do not care to mention in details, and it might be advisable to have a change in one or two of the past staff.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nQuebec Inspectorate.\nOttawa, October 31, 1941.\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nI beg to submit a report of a special inspection made October 10-17th at Bersimis Agency, with reference to a memorandum of October 2, 1941.\n\nGARDENING:\n\nThe Sisters have shown very little interest in domestic teaching and none at all in gardening. The teaching of gardening to boys and girls should receive a certain consideration. In 1939, I suggested that a certain piece of land, next to the Agency lot belonging to Indian Councillor, Malek Collard be used. This land was offered free of charge by Mr. Collard for a school garden. The Agent's wife has made a success of her own garden, and she has offered to take charge of such gardening course for the benefit of the Indian children, and without remuneration.\n\nThere are a few Indian gardens, more or less properly cultivated, and the young Indians should gain by learning better ways of cultivating a garden, which would before many years provide the Indian families with lot more vegetable food than they are getting at present. This Agency will never be a farming reserve, but there is no excuse for not having many more gardens.\n\nWhen looking over the boundary line of the two square miles of Indian fuel wood, accompanied by Mr. O'Hurley and Agent, they drew my attention on a price of land of about 8 or 10 acres in superficie which would only require a little drainage to make one of the nicest garden on the north shore; a couple of good ditches is all that it requires to drain it properly and in my opinion the cost would not exceed much over one or two hundred dollars, and could be made by hand by the Indians.\n\nReturning to the matter of school garden, next to the Agency lot, it would be eighty feet long and one hundred and ten feet long; part of the Agency fence would be moved for one end and there would be about two hundred feet of fence to build. The materials required to build the fence or rather, part of it, would be:\n\n- 20 round posts 6\" x 7' procurable on the Reserve\n- 30 pieces-spruce 2\" x 4\" x 12'\n- 300 slats - do 3\" x 7/8\" x 4'\n\nWith nails, labor and paint, it should not cost much over $50.00 however we could get prices during the winter for the studdings and slats, which would have to come from the outside, for delivery in the Spring of 1942. I recommend that the ploughing to be done this Fall if at all possible, as it is very important to do so if we intend to follow the suggestion of a school garden.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nQuebec Inspectorate.\nBersimis, Que. April 14th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn case of the eventual opening of the Bersimis seasonal school I beg to request that I be authorized to make the following expenses:\n\n- Monthly cleaning of school-classes: $15.00\n- 25 Electric light bulbs, 32 volts: $2.00\n- Laundry soap and brooms: $5.00\n\nTotal: $29.00\n\nBesides, there are school-supplies that the teachers might requisition.\n\nAs to the necessity to heat the building in May and possibly in September also, I must say that there is still enough coal in the bin for that purpose.\n\nAbout firewood for the use of the kitchen stove, I beg to inform you that the wood which was in the so-called hospital building has been transferred to the school building and can be used for this last purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Wilfrid Barolet)\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMr. T.R.L.

(RG 10, Volume 6070, file 300-5, part 6)\nDear Sir,\n\nIn regard to the school garden next to the Agency lot as suggested in your letter of April 23rd, I beg to inform you that the fence around the garden is now built. The expenditure for materials and labour amounted to $34.97 as shown in vouchers Nos. 857-858-859-860 and 861.\n\nThe painting remains to be done. The fence being the continuation of that of the agency house I beg to request that I be permitted to have the entire length, 500 ft., painted; two coats on the new fence and one coat on the old one. The work would require 3 gallons of white paint, one gallon of black paint and one gallon of boiled linseed oil.\n\nThe local traders being out of this material actually, I beg to suggest that you place an order for same with the Crown Diamond Paint Co. Ltd., of Montreal, Que., I note that their prices are much lower than those of Bersimis dealers.\n\nI estimate that one man can do the painting of the whole fence in 4 days @ $2.00 per day which would make the total expenditure for the building of the fence to about $55.00, including lumber, nails, labour and painting. This work can be done by Indian labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Wilfrid Barolet)\n\nIndian Affairs.

Napoleon Labrie, Vicar Apostolic of the Gulf of St. Laurence, interviewed Mr. Hoey and myself this morning with reference to the Bersimis Indian Day School. The Bishop pointed out that a number of the Indian families at Bersimis do not go trapping in the winter and, as a result, there are 30 or 40 children of school age who are not receiving any training. Consequently he strongly urged that arrangements be made to re-open the Bersimis School for the full academic period each year.\n\nMr. Hoey pointed out to the Bishop the reasons for only operating a summer school. One of the very heavy expenditures was the purchase of coal.\n\nAfter discussing the matter fully it was decided to have Mr. Dube, a contractor of Rimouski, make an estimate of the cost of insulating the present Bersimis School in order to conserve the heat and explore the possibility of cutting off part of the building for winter use. This would naturally involve less heating. The Bishop expects that Mr. Dube will be at Bersimis in either April or May and Mr. Hoey promised the Bishop that at that time Inspector Thibault would also go to Bersimis and be with Mr. Dube when he is preparing his estimate of what could be done to make the building habitable for the winter.\n\nThe Bishop also suggested that the Indians should be made responsible for supplying the wood required for heating the building and Mr. Thibault will be instructed to interview them with regard to this matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Bishop Labrie:\n\nWith reference to our interview on February 9, in connection with the Bersimis Indian Day School, I should appreciate your advising if you have any definite information regarding the date on which Mr. Dube the contractor will visit Bersimis. As it was agreed at the time of your visit, I hope to be able to have Inspector Thibault visit Bersimis when Mr. Dube is there.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. Napoleon Labrie, C.J.M., D.D.,\nVicar Apostolic of Gulf of St. Lawrence,\nBaie Comeau, Que.\nBersimis, Que. April 6, 1943\n\nMr. T.R.L. MacInnes, Secretary, Ottawa.\n\nMay I inquire if it is the intention of the Department to open the Bersimis Indian School this year the same as in 1942, that is to say from May 15 to September 15. If so, I beg to request that I be authorized to write to the Sisters of Notre-Dame du Bon Conseil, Chicoutimi, Que., and advise them to arrange to have two teachers to take charge of the School for that period at the same salary of last year, i.e. $60.00 a teaching month for the senior teacher and $50.00 a month for the junior teacher.\n\nIn case of the seasonal school being operated, I beg to request that I be authorized to make the following expenses for that purpose:\n\n- 5 Cords of firewood for the kitchen stove, including the cutting and the storing: $37.00\n- 25 Electric light bulbs, 32 volts @ 0.35 app.: $9.00\n- Monthly cleaning of school-classes: $15.00\n- Material for Domestic Science Class: $10.00\n- Laundry Soap: $2.00\n- Brooms and Sundries for cleaning purposes: $4.00\n\nThere are other school supplies that the teachers will most likely requisition on their arrival.\n\nAs to the necessity to heat the building in May and, possibly, in September, there is sufficient coal left in the bin for that purpose.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1943.\n\nDr. W. Barolet, Indian Agent, Bersimis, Que.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, regarding the re-opening of the Bersimis Seasonal School, the following expenditures are authorized:\n\n5 Cords firewood for the kitchen stove, including cutting and storing ........ $37.00\nMonthly cleaning of school classes ....... 15.00\nMaterial for domestic science class .... 10.00\nLaundry soap .................................. 2.00\nBrooms and sundries for cleaning ......... 4.00\n\n$68.00\n\nIt is noted that you ask authority to purchase 25 electric light bulbs. In 1942 and in 1941 you asked the same authority when this school was being re-opened. As the school is only in operation for a three-month period in each year, the Department cannot see any reason for the necessity of supplying new electric light bulbs every year. I realize that the expenditure for these bulbs is not heavy, but at the same time, if they have to be replaced each year, it certainly appears that there must be carelessness on the part of someone. I will await your reply before making a decision on supplying additional bulbs this year.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBersimis, Que. April 21, 1943\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the authority to purchase 25 electric light bulbs for the use of the seasonal school at Bersimis which keeps open for four months, I beg to report that there are still left at the school 10 electric bulbs in good order, 4 bulbs of 50 watts and 6 of 25 watts.\n\nOf course, Paul Rock, our Caretaker, goes to the school building every day all the year long to look after the lighting plant and he goes specially at night during winter to run the motor in order to keep the battery-room warm and avoid the freezing of the batteries. So he is using electric light every day during the whole winter.\n\nFifteen bulbs, however, might be sufficient and I beg to request that I be authorized to purchase same.\n\nWilfred Barolet,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 26, 1943.\n\nDr. W. Barolet, Indian Agent, Bersimis, Que.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, you may purchase 15 electric light bulbs for the Bersimis Indian Day School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMOA709 43 NL VIA QUEBEC QUE=BERSIMIS QUE 8\nJUDE THIBAULT= 1167\nINSPECTEUR DEPARTMENT DES AFFAIRES INDIENNES OTTAWA ONT=\n=VU RETARD COURRIER RECOIS AUJOURDHUI LETTRE DUBE CONTRACTEUR\nRIMOUSKI DISANT QUIL SERA ICI PAR BATEAU QUATORZE MAI\nPROCHAIN VOUS POURREZ LE RENCONTRER A VOTRE ARRIVEE RIMOUSKI\nSEREZ BIENVENU VOUS LAISSE SOIN AVERTIR AGENT REPONSE\nIMMEDIATE SI TOUT VOUS CONVIENT AVERTIRAI MR DUBE SALUTATIONS\n=PERE LUC SIROIS\n\nCome on Canada \u2014 Buy the New Victory Bonds\nCanadian National Telegram\n\nBERSIMIS, QUE.

Pointing the brick work at both ends and on the three walls of the inside court, and replacing all defective bricks; in addition, caulking with plastic cement all the openings. To all brick walls and to the cement foundations applying a coat of \"Aquaproof\" in order to waterproof the walls.\n\n2.

We used to purchase this coal at $17.00 a ton, making the total expenditure for coal $680.00. There was also a charge of $50.00 for hauling the coal from the wharf to the school. Approximately 15 cords of wood was also necessary each winter. This formerly cost approximately $7.25 a cord, delivered to the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nHudson's Bay Company.\n\nINVOICE\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMay 31st, 1943\n\nSupplied for Bersimis Indian Day School - By Order of Indian Agent.\n\nMay 15 Electric bulbs, 32 volt, 50 watt. .35 $ 5.25\n\nCertified correct,\n\nPost Manager.\n\nVoucher no. 1003.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The principal excuse for non-attendance is \"helping to bark pulpwood\" or \"someone sick at home.\"\nIt must be remembered that 56 children are on the Reserve during the summer months only and that the remaining 44 are more or less on the reserve for the balance of the year, often following the father working away from the reserve, or may be hunting occasionally a short distance from the Reserve, or else living at a certain distance from the school, all of these being excuses for not attending school regularly.\n\nConsidering also the high cost of operation of this school being kept opened the whole year, I do not feel justified to recommend much further expenditure on the building. Let us use the building as it is now, as a summer school, and later on, we might consider building a day school which would answer to the needs of the Reserve and at a much lower cost of operation.\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nRe: Bersimis Indian Day School\n\nThe above building was erected in the fiscal year 1923-24 at an approximate cost of $32,000.00. It was built by Albert Amyot, Contractor, Hull, Que., under the direction of Mr. J.D. Chene, who was then engineer of the Department.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 5, 1943.\n\nDr. Wilfrid Barolet, Indian Agent, Bersimis, Que.\n\nIn reporting on his recent visit to the Bersimis Agency, Inspector Thibault intimates that the white population at Bersimis is still using one of the rooms in the Bersimis Indian Day School for school purposes for the white children. No official authority has been given for the use of this room. In using it, they no doubt have to heat it, and in our opinion this constitutes a very definite fire hazard. You should therefore notify all parties concerned that the use of a room in the Bersimis Indian Day School for classroom purposes for white children must be discontinued immediately.\n\nI understand that they could obtain accommodation for the education of white children in a building formerly used as a hospital.\n\nR.

A new roof is absolutely necessary, that is, it should be reshingled, the rest is sound. As the roof is at present, in its leaky state, deterioration of the interior will be very rapid. It would be unfortunate to let this building go to ruin. It has a good foundation and with comparatively little cost three class rooms and two shops could be provided.\n\nI feel that the price quoted by Mr. Dube is rather excessive. His quotation is decomposed as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Replacing Shingles          | $750   |\n| Insulating ceilings         | 126    |\n| Painting (exterior)         | 446    |\n| Waterproofing brick         | 200    |\n| Caulking joints around openings | 100   |\n| Building porch              | 170    |\n| Pointing brick              | 470    |\n| **Total**                   | **2292**|\n\nPlus 20% profit etc.\n\nReplacing broken glass possibly $25\n\nThis was included in original quotation but was not itemized,\n\nGrand total $2775.40\n\nFrom the original quotation of $3412 there remains $636.60 to be accounted for!\n\nI would recommend:\n\n1. New roof $750\n2. Insulating ceilings 126\n3. Caulking openings 100 $1006\n\nPlus 20% $201.20 $1207.20\n\nI do not know if Mr. Dube would be willing to undertake the work for that amount. He might be asked for a price for that work.\n\nAs regard the increase in the length of the school term I do not see any advantage for it under the present set up. I will discuss this on my return.\n\nRespectfully submitted August 2, 1943.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I shall list with plastic all the openings for the sum of $1450.00 on condition that my proposition will be accepted as soon as possible on account of the transportation expenses and the scarcity of labour. It is impossible for me to do this work at a lower price.\n\nHoping that you will accept this proposition,\n\n(Sgd) J. Georges Dube.\nOttawa,\nAugust 13, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Bersimis Indian Day School,\nBersimis Indian Agency, Electoral\nDistrict of Charlevoix-Saguenay.\n\nThe Bersimis School was erected in the fiscal year 1923-24 at an approximate cost of $52,000.00. Because of the cost of heating it, we discontinued classes during the winter of 1940 and since that time we have only operated a seasonal school during three or four months in the summer.\n\nHis Lordship Rt. Rev. Napoleon Labrie, Vicar Apostolic of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, interviewed me on February 9 last and strongly urged that the building be repaired and he suggested that we engage the services of Mr. J. Georges Dube, Rimouski, Que., as the Bishop was using this man's services to repair the church at Bersimis.\n\nInspector Thibault visited the Bersimis Reserve on May 29 and submitted a report recommending extensive repairs to the roof, outside walls and windows. The contractor mentioned above, Mr. Dube, also visited the school and on June 3 submitted a quotation of $3,412.00 to do the work that he considered was required.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, previous to Mr. Doucet's departure for the Restigouche Reserve, I interviewed Mr. Jackson, who approved of Mr. Doucet's visiting Bersimis.\nand inspecting the building. In a report dated August 2 Mr. Doucet stated that he had visited the reserve and, in his opinion, the school is greatly in need of repairs and, if these are not carried out at once, Mr. Doucet is of the opinion that the building will go to ruin. He stated that the foundation is good and recommended:\n\n1. A new roof\n2. Insulating ceilings\n3. Caulking openings\n\nMr. Doucet considered that on the basis of the previous quotation of Mr. Dube the latter should be able to do the work just mentioned for $1,207.00. Mr. Dube was written to on August 7 and asked if he would do the work for the amount just stated. In a letter dated August 11, which has just been received, Mr. Dube offers to do the work for $1,450.00, giving as a reason for asking more than estimated by Mr. Doucet that labour is scarce and the transport of men and material to Bersimis expensive.\n\nIn view of the reports that we have received, both from Inspector Thibault and Mr. Doucet, I feel that if this building is to be maintained at all it is necessary for immediate repairs to be made. As mentioned in the first part of this memorandum, Bishop Labrie strongly recommends Mr. Dube as a competent contractor.

S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\nEnclos:\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n165 Sparks Street,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nBersimis, May 11, 1944.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\netc.\n\nA few days ago, Mr. Roy, our present agent, communicated to me the contents of your letter with respect to the space in the convent which served the purpose of a parochial hall, under certain circumstances.\n\nI am deeply grieved at this decision which deprives us of a hall so useful on certain occasions, and which helped us obtain a little revenue for our Church while serving recreational purposes for our Indians.\n\nThis hall was converted during the time Father Doucet was there, and at the sole expense of the Fabric, to be used as a recreational hall for the pupils of the Convent during the bad season. It also served, though rarely, for amateur theatricals. When the inspectors of the Department visited us, they were pleased to have such a hall for the meetings of Indians. The floor, the stage, the electrical lighting and chairs were supplied and paid by the Fabric. For my part, I certainly did not abuse the privilege of using this hall, because since my arrival at Bersimis we have had only one performance prepared and presented by our Indians and Canadians. The danger of fire is almost nil because the lighting is with electricity and, moreover, we do not allow smoking in this hall. When we had meetings, I stayed there myself to inspect the hall after each reunion.\n\nWhen your letter arrived, we were organizing an amateur play for the month of June. We were all anxious for the success of this performance, probably the only one of the year. Useless to mention our deception and our regret. It seems to me that you could allow us to hold that performance since the arrangements are quite advanced. I have no doubt that you will kindly grant my request.\n\nI therefore await your consoling reply by return mail. Dear Mr. Director, it has always been far from my mind to abuse of your kindness on my behalf; on the contrary, my motto has always been to work with you and the Department for the greater welfare of our Indians. I am devoting myself body and soul to our Indians; to make good citizens of them so that they will later be a pride to the Department.\n\nI had the great pleasure of meeting you when I was a missionary along the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Your courtesy and kindness to me on this occasion remain as a precious memory. We understood and liked each other. I would be very glad to meet you again so that we might talk of mutual problems. Let us hope that this may happen soon.\n\nI remain, Mr. Director,\n\nYour devoted servant,\n\n(Sgd) Luc Sirois, C.J.M.\nDear Father Sirois:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the building built by this Department and used for Indian school purposes on the Bersimis Reserve.\n\nWhen the building was originally erected the auditorium, or hall, could be entered from the main portion of the school and in addition there was a door on the opposite side of the room which led outside.\n\nMy information is that without any authority from the Department someone arranged to close the door leading from the school to the auditorium and as a result there is only one narrow door leading from this room to the outside.\n\nDepartmental officials who have inspected this building definitely feel that in its present condition there is a serious fire hazard should a fire occur when the auditorium is occupied. No doubt you have read of the appalling loss of life at other places where fires have occurred recently and it was for this reason that the Department felt that until more suitable arrangements could be made to provide proper egress from this auditorium it was in the best interests of all parties concerned to discontinue its use for public gatherings.\n\nIt is my hope that a Departmental official will have an opportunity of visiting Bersimis in the near future and at that time I will make arrangements to have him interview you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

It is hoped to have a departmental official visit Bersimis within the next month or so with a view to determining what additional repairs are necessary and at that time arrangements will be considered for more effective means of exit from the building.\n\nR.A.

Phelan\n\nRE: Bersimis Indian Day School grounds\n\nI have just received correspondence from acting Indian Agent, Pierre Blouin, regarding different matters, one of which refers to the above.\n\nBehind the school, the sewer ends in a gully and every year it washes away, the sides and end specially due to the amount of snow gathering at that point and coming from adjoining land; to avoid danger of school children from falling in and making the place more sanitary, there seem to be no alternative but filling the bottom with a few feet of coarse stones and covering up with earth, which would yet allow the sewerage to run through to the road ditch and prevent any accidents.\n\nAgent Blouin estimates that it would cost between seventy-five and one hundred dollars to make a good job of it. Being aware of the situation, I recommend such improvement to be made as soon as possible, by Indian labor, providing funds are available.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nOttawa, May 15, 1945.\n\nMr. Pierre Blouin, Indian Agent, Bersimis, Que.\n\nInspector Thibault has reported that improvements are required to the grounds around the Bersimis Indian Day School. He states that the cost of this work will be between $75.00 and $100.00. An expenditure not exceeding $100.00 is authorized. When the work is completed, you should advise this office and send a voucher for the amount expended. If possible, the cost should be kept below $100.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**Hudson's Bay Company**\n\n**INVOICE**\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, April 30th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\n---\n\n| Date | Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------|------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| April 4 | 3 Lbs.

Desjardins, Acting Indian Agent, Bersimis, Quebec.\n\nAs these are for a school and as sanitary conditions at present, are very unsatisfactory we would appreciate it if you would ship these at the earliest possible date.\n\nKindly submit your account in triplicate, and send it to the Acting Indian Agent who will verify reception of the goods and forward it to us for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nThe Crane Company Limited,\n148 Bank St.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 11, 1946.\n\nMr. A.E. Desjardins, Acting Indian Agent, Bersimis, Que.,\n\nI am confirming by this letter, the orders that Mr. Doucet gave you while in Bersimis some time ago.\n\nHave the handy-man of the Rectory, disconnect the excessive radiation in the improvised Community Hall. See that the furnace is thoroughly cleaned every week when in use and purchase the necessary steel brushes to do this efficiently.\n\nA gun and five gallons of caulking compound have been shipped from Ottawa. You will, no doubt, receive these in a short time, then, you will proceed to have the bricks pointed.\n\nTwo toilet bowls have been ordered but shipment is uncertain. As soon as you receive these, have them installed. Use them to replace those that have been removed from the Community Hall. This will require semi-partitions made from lumber. It will be necessary to pierce a door so that pupils can go from the present toilet room to the new installation.\n\nIt is understood with Reverend Father Langlois, O.M.I. that his handy-man will do this.\n\nSend us the account for labor in the usual manner.\n\nKindly let us know if you have found a fireman for the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 12, 1946.\n\nDear Father Langlois:\n\nI have reason to believe that the organization of the school as we have discussed will be adopted. I wish, however, Right Reverend Bishop Labrie would let us know his views in this matter. You will recall that we wired him but to date I have not received a reply.\n\nI hope your handy-man is able to disconnect the surplus radiators as we discussed. I have written to the Agent asking him to make a recommendation for the services of a fireman. You know whom we have in mind. I will be able to pay him $15.00 a month for twelve months. I wish he would begin to do the repair work before he takes up his duties as fireman, because due to Treasury Branch regulations we would be unable to pay him for repair work as he would already be receiving a salary. His salary would begin on October 1st.\n\nWith kindest personal regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nRev.P.

In order to be sure to do not run short of coal, he promised us to send 25 tons.\n\nWe did not receive anything yet and Mr Desjardins, acting agent, tells me that he has been sent a note that the coal for his own house had been ordered, but nothing was said about the school.\n\nSo I thought of writing you a word about it so that you would arrange that the school gets its coal in time before chilly weather.\n\nMr Doucet had also told us to order single desks instead of the double ones the children are using up to now. So I enclose this requisition of new desk-chairs. I thought of sending you this remission now instead of later as you will judge yourself when it is suitable to order them.\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nPaul Langlois O.M.I.\n\nMr Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Desjardins,\nActg Agent.\nOttawa, September 24, 1946.\n\nReverend Father:\n\nAt the time of my visit last June, I was under the impression that we had decided to appoint a janitor in the person of your handy-man. It seems to me that I mentioned this in a subsequent letter to you. If you go back to the letter written on July 12th, you will notice that I made a definite offer at that time. The file does not show an answer to the July communication.\n\nI am now in receipt of a letter from the Acting Indian Agent which states that you are not interested in looking after the heating of the school.\n\nThere are several improvements that should be made before the opening in October. I would be interested to know how we stand as far as the repairs that were to be done and also in regard to the janitor.\n\nA reply at your convenience will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J.

DESJARDINS\nACTG AGENT,\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nRe\nletter D\nOct 23/46\nOttawa, 23 October 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Requisition No. 26604, dated July 10, 1946.\n\nAttached to this requisition was an account for $18.50 payable to Rev. Sister St. Anselme of Les Escoumins, Quebec.\n\nIn a letter dated the 12th instant, which we have just received, we are advised that the cheque has not been received in payment of the above account and we would appreciate it if you would arrange to have payment made immediately.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nSuperintendent of Stationery,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\n18th October, 1946.\n\n(1) There are no sewing machines, no tables, chairs, cooking stove and utensiles for the teaching of domestic arts.\n\n(2) Moreover, there is absolutely nothing in the way of weaving machines, spinning-wheels and other articles necessary to teach the girls the art of weaving.\n\n(3) There is really no library and on that account, the children are not taking any interest in reading. The purchase of one hundred volumes might be a good investment for this school, but before doing so, I think the Sisters ought to be consulted as there are stores in the Province of Quebec that make a specialty of providing useful and instructive reading for children.\n\n(4) There is no typewriter and the Sister Superior is very desirous of securing one. Her claim is that it would be very useful in the preparation of special class material.\n\n(5) I do not know whether it has been the practice of the Department to supply Gramophones or radio sets for day schools; but in a place as far away from civilization as Bersiamits is, such an instrument would certainly help a great deal in the conducting of classes and in creating in the minds of the Indian children, an interest in their work.\n\n(6) The Sisters would also like to teach music to the boys and girls that have a talent for it, but there are no band instruments of any kind and there is not even an harmonium to use for this purpose. I noticed sometime ago that you were considering supplying some band instruments for a residential school. Why could not a day school, the size of Bersiamits, be gratified or given a sufficient number of instruments, so that the teaching of music would become a daily feature?\n\nThe above is submitted in the hope that you will be able to meet at least some of the wishes of the Sister Superior.\n\nThanking you in anticipation I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOTTAWA, 18th October 1946\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Bersiamits Indian Day School.\n\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nAs mentioned over the phone, I am just back from a visit to the Bersiamits and Pointe Bleue Indian Day Schools. Both these institutions are in fairly good condition and are providing suitable education for the Indians that are attending them.\n\nThe Bersiamits Indian population is still very nomad and more than half of the people spend almost nine months in the bush, either working as woodsmen or hunting, trapping and fishing. This means that all the children in each family follow their parents and are therefore deprived of the educational benefits which they might otherwise receive by attending the Bersiamits Day School. Still, there are about fifty children who are in attendance and during the summer months, the Indians that wintered in the woods, come back to the village and for the summer period, some of the children attend school. As I have already stated in a previous letter, the only means of educating all these Indian children is the establishment of a residential school which would receive the children of the families who winter in the bush. For this purpose, a school with a maximum pupilage of one hundred would be quite sufficient.\n\nSeveral improvements could be made in the present day school and I think that you will want to co-operate with the Sisters in this matter:\n\n2......\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Bersiamits Indian Day School.\n\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am enclosing requisition from the above school for two complete Progress printing sets.\n\nI am informed that these are wanted by the Sisters to help in the preparation of teaching material.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[F.D. Plourde, O.M.I.]\nOttawa, October 31, 1946.\n\nDear Father:\n\nI have your letter of September 30th. I have not answered it sooner because I was absent from my office and was unable to get a definite answer on the appointment of a janitor. Treasury regulations will not allow us to pay on a monthly basis without establishing a position through the Civil Service. We will, however, pay Mr. S.M. Doucet $200.00 a year quarterly. This means that he will receive $50.00 in December, $50.00 in March, $50.00 in June and $50.00 in September. I hope that this arrangement will prove satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor, Training Division.\n\nMost Rev. U.Langlois, O.M.I.\nBishop of Grouard,\nMcLennan, Alberta.\nOttawa, November 1, 1946.\n\nDear Father:\n\nWill you kindly submit Mr. Doucet's bill to the Agent so that he may send us a voucher for payment. I am sorry that I am somewhat late in notifying you of this but I have been away at Pointe Bleue and other points in the last few weeks.\n\nBest personal regards.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMost Rev. U.

FREDLAN.\n\nRepair to Bersimis Indian Day School.\n\nI interviewed Mr. St. Laurent and discussed with him the condition of the Bersimis School. I also interviewed Mr. Brochu, who is the Canadian representative for colorcrete. I visited some of the work which was done with colorcrete. I was especially interested in a hospital in Quebec city which has been covered with this material for five or six years. The officials of this hospital \"L'Hopital Enfant Jesus\" are preparing to have other sections of the building covered with colorcrete in the near future. To me this indicates complete satisfaction with this process. I am satisfied that if the walls of the Bersimis school were covered with colorcrete the unsatisfactory condition as existing today would be rectified. I would suggest that the contract be given to Mr. St. Laurent. In his letter of September 7, 1946, he estimated the cost of covering the exterior of the school at $2200.00.\n\nTo renew the plaster of the exterior of the school Mr. St. Laurent submitted a price at $2380.00. His plan was to replace all the plaster. Apparently these were the directions he received. However, Mr. St. Laurent admits that the plaster could be repaired satisfactorily without being so drastic. I suggested to him that this should be left in abeyance until the school could be gone over with him before he undertakes the repair of the interior plaster. I believe that I am safe in estimating\nthat the repair of the plaster in this school would not exceed $500.00. May I suggest that this arrangement be confirmed in an official letter to Mr. St. Laurent.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor, Training Division.\nOttawa, May 13th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Bersimis Indian Day School,\nBersimis Indian Agency, P.Q.,\nElectoral District of Charlevoix - Saguenay.\n\nExtensive repairs are required at this school and Mr. Doucet of the Welfare & Training Division recently interviewed Mr. St. Laurent, 98 St. Marie St., Rimouski.\n\nMr. St. Laurent offers to do the work that Mr. Doucet considers necessary for $2,200. Mr. Doucet considers that this price is reasonable. Actually, the price is lower than we expected due to the fact that Mr. St. Laurent intends to do certain other work in the vicinity of Bersimis and has consequently been able to give us a reasonable quotation.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would appreciate it if the Minister would approve awarding the work to Mr. St. Laurent.\n\nIn connection with this man I would refer you to Mr. Pratt's memoranda of March 5th and March 20th with which were enclosed letters received from Mr. Gleason Helzile, M.P.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/MGD\nMay 8th, 1947.\n\nRequisition for the Bersimis school.\n\n16 large size movable desk-chairs\n24 medium size movable desk-chairs\n30 small size movable desk-chairs\n\n3 book cases: height: 60 inches\nwidth: 36 \"\ndepth: 12 \"\nMay 8th, 1947.\n\nRequisition for the Bersimis school.\n\n16 large size movable desk-chairs\n24 medium size movable desk-chairs\n30 small size movable desk-chairs\n\n3 book cases: height: 60 inches\nwidth : 36 \"\ndepth : 12 \"\nMay 8th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr Phelan,\n\nOn August 23rd, 1946, I wrote you to ask for desk-chairs and book cases for the children of the Bersimis school, according to Mr Doucet's suggestion.\n\nIn his reply, five days later, Mr Neary had asked me to wait until this year, because it was impossible to secure them.\n\nAs conditions are now improved, I thought of sending you again, this spring, the requisition for these desk-chairs and book cases, hoping to have them for the new academic year, beginning on October the 15th.

PHELAN.\n\nRe: Bersimis Indian Day School.\n\nWith further reference to my memorandum of May 9, 1947, I have interviewed Mr. St. Laurent and together we visited the school premises. There is considerable repair to be done to the plaster in the classrooms and in the teacher's quarters. This should, however, not exceed four hundred square yards of plaster. Mr. St. Laurent is ready to undertake this work at a cost of $1.25 per square yard. It is rather difficult to set an exact amount of yardage as in demolishing the damaged plaster more or less is liable to require replacement. I would suggest that the agreement should read that Mr. St. Laurent be awarded a price of $1.25 per square yard for approximately three hundred and fifty square yards.\n\nWe have revised the prices for colorcrete and have come to an agreement with Mr. St. Laurent that he will undertake the work for $1990.00. This will comprise of two coats of colorcrete to the brick siding and two coats of paint on the trim and windows.\n\nA further expenditure will be necessary to decorate the entire interior of the school and teacher's quarters. Mr. St. Laurent is agreeable to give the entire inside one coat of sealer and two coats of paint for the sum of $500.00.\nYou are aware that this is a three-room school with two hallways and a teacher's residence which consists of a kitchen, dining-room, living-room, four bed-rooms and a bathroom.\n\nThere are insufficient toilet accommodation for the pupils of this school. There are but two toilets for ninety-six pupils. Mr. St. Laurent can obtain the material required. Two toilet bowls complete and a wash basin should be installed where they had been before removal many years ago. The equipment will mean an expenditure of about $150.00.\n\nI would suggest that Mr. St. Laurent be awarded this contract and be so advised as soon as possible in order that he may make the arrangements necessary to have this work completed before the re-opening of the classrooms in October.\n\nA.J.

It comprises seven rooms for the living quarters and three large class rooms, plus halls, etc.\n\nIt was found that the school needed interior plastering and repairing and after discussing the matter thoroughly with Mr. Doucet, Mr. St. Laurent offered to do the plastering and decorating the interior and fixing the chimney for $1,990.00.\n\nOriginally Mr. St. Laurent requested $4,530.00 for both the interior and exterior repairs and subsequently reduced this tender to $4,190.00. Of this amount $2,200.00 has already been authorized.\n\nWe would appreciate it if we could have your authority to pay the balance of $1,990.00. Previous authority was not obtained for this amount as we were not certain that the work was definitely required until Mr. Doucet went to Bersimis.\nDeputy Minister\n\nJanuary 16, 1948.\n\nMr. St. Laurent was doing other work in the neighborhood and consequently it was felt the urgent repairs should receive immediate attention as otherwise it would have been impossible to secure anyone to do the work.\n\nThe Indian Agent states that the school is now in first class condition and should not require further repairs for some time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\nRimouski le novembre 1947\n\nM.

These revised regulations will go into effect immediately.\n\nDirector.\nPara 203. Page 64. Delete last sentence, in parenthesis, and substitute the following:\n\nStanding advances, which are provided certain Agencies to take care of monthly expenses, will be repaid or accounted for by the end of the fiscal year. Payments during the year will be vouchered for as often as necessary to provide sufficient funds on hand at all times.\n\nThe Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, Section 32(2), directs that accountable advances outstanding at the end of the fiscal year (March 31) shall be either repaid or accounted for within fifteen (15) days thereafter.\n\nThe fifteen days' grace in April is to allow time, if needed, to prepare the credit vouchers and to settle each advance. No further disbursements will be made during April from March 31st advance balances. The unexpended balances of accountable advances on hand at March 31st will be listed on Receiver General payments, Form 1.A., 527, and will be remitted direct to the Chief Treasury Officer.\n\nPara 205. Page 64. Delete first paragraph, beginning \"Credit vouchers which\" and ending \"practical every two weeks\", and substitute the following:\n\n205. Credit Vouchers.\n\nCredit vouchers will be prepared in triplicate on Form 1.A. 501. Two copies with relative attachments will be submitted to the Branch and the third copy will be retained for Agency records. When the projects involved are more or less continuous, credit vouchers should be submitted monthly or, if practical, every two weeks. The practice of waiting until a project is completed or until the end of the fiscal year before submitting credit vouchers will not be allowed in future.\n\nPara 235. Page 78. Delete last paragraph beginning \"Transfers debiting\" and ending \"is being charged\" and substitute the following:\n\nTransfers debiting the account of an Indian and crediting another Indian's account must be supported by a signed order of the Indian whose account is being charged.\n236. Reconciliation Statement.\n\nAs indicated under Monthly Returns (Para. 234), Agents are required to complete and forward Bank and Cash Reconciliation Statements at the close of each month. For guidance, specimens of the three types now in use are given herewith, Appendix \"A\" being for the Prairie Provinces, Appendix \"B\" for the Eastern Provinces and British Columbia, and Appendix \"C\" for Agencies having no bank account.\n\n237. Ledger Balances.\n\n(a) Monthly lists of ledger balances should be prepared in a uniform manner as per specimen, Appendix \"D\", attached. The several divisions are in accordance with the usual grouping of Agency ledger accounts. Compliance with this procedure will facilitate the work at Ottawa and the Agency.\n\n(b) It will be appreciated by all concerned that funds in custody of an Agent are provided for specific purposes and, if the ledger accounts are kept posted up to date, a proper control of the balances will be maintained. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that under no circumstances will an account be overdrawn. If a payment is indicated on one account, but an insufficient amount is available to meet the payment, it will be incumbent upon the Agent to procure sufficient funds before the transaction can be completed and he will not be permitted to borrow from one account to pay another.\nAppendix \"D\"\n\n......

Kindly state to what band of Indians they belong and whether the information given by Meness as to the number of families and children is correct, and also whether you consider it advisable to open a school for their benefit. You should state whether these Indians reside at Brennan's Lake permanently, or whether they are there for the hunting season only. If there is a white school at this point would it be possible to arrange with the school board to provide for the tuition of the Indian children, provided this Department pays a fee for their tuition? If there is no white school, kindly state whether a suitable building could be obtained for school purposes. The Department conducts several schools during the summer months only in northern Quebec, and, if a building could be obtained for this purpose, the same arrangement might meet the needs at this point.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give as full information as you can regarding the above particulars asked for and any other information will be appreciated.

There are at least nineteen families with thirty-three children and twenty-one of school age.\n\nThere is no white school within thirty miles of here and there is no building suitable for a school room that I know of.\n\nThe Indians belong to the Algonquins tribe and I would strongly recommend opening a school for the children as they are bright and intelligent kids and I am sure the parents would see that they took advantage of the school. If necessary they are all willing to pay their share towards expenses.\n\nThere is quite a nice settlement here and you would be surprised to see what nice clean houses they have. They all have gardens and this year are...\nCleaning more land. They all speak very fair English and I am sure would be very apt people.

This request was made by Joseph Miness, an Indian, who stated that there are thirteen families with thirty-three children, eighteen of whom are of school age.\n\nThere is no Agent at this point and Mr. A. W. Young, General Merchant, Gaudette Post Office, Que., was written to with the request that he furnish full information regarding the situation at Brennan Lake. He states that the information given by Miness is quite correct. He says there is quite a nice settlement at Brennan Lake and that the Indians have nice clean shacks. They all have gardens and this year are clearing more land. They all speak English and are permanent residents at that place. He states that there is no white school within thirty miles and that they are receiving no education whatever. He also states that there is no building suitable for a school-room.\n\nSchools are conducted for the summer months only at several points in the Kippewa and Temiskaming districts.\n\nIn this case it would be necessary to provide a building in which to conduct the school. Mr. Young strongly recommends the opening of a school. He states that the children are bright and intelligent and that the parents would see that they took advantage of the school, should one be opened. There is no reserve at this point. He does not state to what band these Indians belong. Some arrangement should be made for the education of these Indian children and it will first be necessary to provide a school building. I will be pleased to have your instructions regarding the request for a school for the benefit of these children.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary.\nJuly 26th, 1920.\n\nTo The Secretary of The Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 10th Inst., regarding the establishment of an Indian school at Brennan Lake, I found the statement that there are thirteen families and eighteen children of school age to be correct. They are all full blood Indians and are one of the Algonquin bands. Brennan Lake is known on the map as Sairs Lake. A man named Sairs, long ago, lived there, and the lake was named after him. After, when the late J. B. Latour lumbered in that district, his agent was a man named Brennan and the lake has since been known as Brennan Lake. The McLaughlin Brothers of Amprior have a farm and Depot there. I made inquiries there about the erection of a school building, and was assured by Mr. Lindsay, agent for the McLaughlin Brothers, that he would assist them by providing free teams in getting out logs for their building and in other ways. I think if they had a school during the summer months, say six months in a year, it would be sufficient.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa the last of this week, and will call on you and take a map with me and show you the exact location of Wolf Lake and Brennan Lake. I may say, however, there is no accurate map of that portion of northern Quebec.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. James\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nDr. James of Mattawa, who was in the office yesterday enquiring about the establishment of a school for the Indian children at Brennan or Sairs Lake, stated that these children were all Indians, their parents residing permanently at this point. The Indians are employed mostly by the McLaughlin Brothers who have a mill and large timber limit at this point.\n\nHe states that the lumber company and the Indians will erect a suitable building and provide desks, stove and fuel. I told him that when the building was ready the Department would be prepared to pay the salary of a teacher and furnish the school material required. He stated that he thought that if the school were conducted six months each year, from the 1st of May until the end of October, that that would be sufficient, at least until such time as would be seen how the attendance kept up and what success was met with. He will arrange with the lumber company and the Indians for the completion of the building and getting it ready for occupation.\n\nThe map of the district showing the location of the proposed school was left by Dr. James and is hereunder for file.\n\nA school is required at this point as the children at present receive no education. I was unable to consult either yourself or Mr. McKenzie in this matter, it being lunch time when the doctor called, and I hope you will approve of the action taken by me. The salaries paid the teachers in the summer schools in the Kippawa District is $75.00 per month and we would likely have to pay the same in this case.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Evain when this school would be ready for occupation and that she was to commence duties when she received instructions from him. She informed the Department by letter on October 5th, last, that she had been instructed by Father Evain that the school was ready and to proceed to take up duties. The understanding with her was that she would be engaged from the time the school was ready for her to start work.\n\nThe salary allowed Miss Sauve is at the rate of $350 per annum, the same amount that she received while teacher of the Hunter's Point school, and besides salary she will also be entitled to receive the bonus provided teachers of Indian day schools during the present fiscal year.

We will, therefore, not require your services as teacher for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Agnes Robinson,\nHunter's Point,\nNorth River, Que.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to official letter No.35-6-1 of the 4th inst. in reference to the school at Brennan Lake, I beg to report:\n\nThe work on the building of this schoolhouse was commenced last summer, at the time when the missionary priest made his visit to Brennan Lake. After the priest left the work stopped, and was not recommenced till he made his visit this summer. The building is of hewed pine logs, with mortised corners, and is 20 ft. wide by 30 ft. long, and when finished will be a good substantial building. Last summer the walls were partially built, and there remained about 4 rounds of logs left from the required height. I reached Brennan Lake a couple of days after the departure of the priest, and upon my arrival I found that the walls of the building were completed, ready for putting up the rafters for the roof. The lumber required for the roof and floor is on the ground, also the doors and windows, and the roofing felt. There are 8 windows 3 for each side, and 2 for the front, one each side of the door. There were 5 or 6 Indians working at the building during my visit, and they claim that they will have the school ready for occupation on the 5th of September, but I am very doubtful whether they will or not. The Indian in charge of the work is Jee Tenassie, and he is to report to me on the progress of the work, and to let me know when the building is completed, as I have informed them that there will be no teacher sent to Brennan Lake till they have a school ready for her to teach in. There is no excuse for any delay in the building of the school, as all that is required is the labour, and the materials required are all on the ground and the priest had left a sum of money at McLachlan's Depot, to pay these working on the building at the rate of $2.00 per day, and there are quite a few Indians around there doing nothing. The horses and the rigging required are furnished by the McLachlan Lumber Co., free of charge, as also was the lumber, and their Agent has promised to send a carpenter to work on the school for a few days to put in the doors and windows, and other skilled labour required, also without any charge. So if the Indians of Brennan Lake do not soon have a good school-house built, it is because they do not want one.\n\nThe school was conducted during the last school year at the house of one of the Indians, and it seems that from information given me while at Brennan Lake, was far from satisfactory. The school teacher must have put up with a lot of hardship and inconvenience, and did well to stay there till the end of the term. The scholars made fine, clear progress during the year, many of them being able to read and write fairly well. I visited all the Indian homes in the vicinity and saw most of the children's schoolbooks, and I must say that for one year they did remarkably well.\nThe Indians are pleased to hear that Miss Sauve is going back again, and I have succeeded in getting a better boarding place for her. I have arranged with Joe Monasse to board her this next year, and she will be better there than she was last winter. It is no use of the teacher proceeding to Brennan Lake until the school is completed, and I think it would be better to advise Miss Sauve not to go until she is notified by me that the school is ready for occupation.\n\nRegarding the equipment for this school I beg to say that with the exception of the blackboard shipped last winter, there is none on hand. To equip this school there would need to be provided an outfit similar to the one authorized in official letter No. 35-6-5 of the 6th of Sept., 1921 for the school at Hunter's Point, the only difference being that 15 desks would be sufficient, and the blackboard has already been provided. I will make a further report on hearing from Monasse, and I made it very plain to the Indians that they must finish the school house at once, and that the teacher would not arrive until it is finished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 22, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, furnishing a report regarding the Indian Day School at Brennan Lake, and stating the progress which the Indians are making in the erection of the building.\n\nWhen this building is completed, it will, no doubt, be quite satisfactory for school purposes. It is noted that the Indians promise to have the building ready for occupation by the 5th of September. It is hoped that they will continue the work and rush it to completion. This rests with the Indians themselves, and there would not appear to be any excuse for delay in finishing the building. We hope it will be ready for occupation on the date mentioned.\n\nWe are informing Miss Sauve that she is not to proceed to the school until she receives definite instructions from you. Her address is Chapeau, Que., and, as soon as you are aware that this building is ready, you should inform her accordingly, in order that she may begin duties as soon thereafter as possible.\n\nIt is noted that you have arranged for a suitable boarding place for the teacher.\n\nRegarding the equipment required for the school, I beg to say that, if possible, we would like to be informed as to the sizes of the desks that are needed. If you are unable to give this information, please state approximately the ages of the children for which they are desired. Full shipping directions should also be given. We will be prepared to supply this equipment and any other supplies necessary, as soon as we hear definitely what is needed.\n\nIt is noted that you intend making a further report on hearing from Joe Menasse, who is in charge of the work of erecting the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, Que.\nOttawa, August 22, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has received a communication from Mr. W. H. Lewis, Indian Agent, North Temiskaming, who recently visited the school at Brennan Lake. He states the Indians are busy erecting a new school building which, when finished, will be quite satisfactory for school purposes. They hope to have this building ready for occupation by the 5th of September.\n\nThe Agent requests that you do not proceed to the school to take up duties until you receive definite word from him to do so. He will let you know when the school is ready, and it is hoped that you will then resume duties as teacher for the next school year.\n\nMr. Lewis states that he has succeeded in getting a suitable boarding place for you for next year, in the home of Joe Menasse, which will give you much better accommodation than you had last winter. You will, therefore, be good enough to await instructions from Mr. Agent Lewis, before leaving your home to go to Brennan Lake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Mary Sauve,\nChapeau,\nP. Q.\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to withdraw my application for teacher at the Bruman Lake school.\n\nI am sorry if I have put you to any inconvenience on my account, but I find that the outlook for school at Bruman Lake is not very good. They have given up working on the school building & it is not nearly done. The houses here are not built to be at all convenient for school, for which I am sorry.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nAgnes Robinson\nAs far as I can learn\n\nMiss Savoie commenced about\n\nOct. 1, 1922 in the new Rdg.\n\nR.

I would be satisfied to re-assume duties if you would raise my salary One Hundred Dollars for the next academic year.\n\nI would suggest that you would have a ceiling put in the school-room and have a stove sent before the commencement of the term otherwise I will be unable to teach as I almost perished in the school last term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMary Sauv\u00e9.\nOttawa, June 30th, 1924.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, requesting an increase in salary for the next school year as teacher of the Brennan Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I would point out that you are in receipt of salary and bonus to the amount of $700 per annum. You have no professional qualifications, having only attended high school for two years. There was an average attendance last year of only about ten children. It is, therefore, considered, in view of the qualifications which you possess and the small attendance, that you are in receipt of the full amount of salary that can be allowed. If you do not care to accept the position for next year at the same salary, please advise the Department as soon as possible. I might add that we have no vacancy in any other school to which you could be appointed.\n\nWe are corresponding with Mr. Agent Lewis regarding the putting in of a ceiling in the school room and the supplying of a stove.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

The only difficulty that I can see is that it might be hard to get another teacher to stay at Brennan Lake as there is very poor accommodation for a teacher at that point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

It is noted that you closed the school on June 11th. Please advise your reasons for closing the school on this date. The Department expects all Indian Day Schools to be kept open until June 30th.\n\nI note that you state you taught on several holidays during the year. Was this done with the permission of the Indian Agent? No authority was given by the Department.\n\nOn receipt of your reply, we will be in a position to decide what amount of salary can be allowed you for the period you taught the school during the June quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

In reply I wish to inform you that my reasons for closing the Brennan Lake day school on the 17th of June are as follows.\n\nFirst of all I must state that I have taught during the holidays the past two years and closed school at an early date in June as I have this year. Afterward was then opened. He considered it alright therefore I did not consult Mr. Cozy about same this year as I did not think it was necessary when the other object did not object to me teaching in this manner before.\n\nHonestly I have taught the first days in full as you will note by the following statement. In the month of Sept. I taught Twenty days.\nIn the Dec. quarter Sixty-three days.\nIn the Jan. quarter Sixty-one days,\nand in the June quarter Fifty-five days.\nI taught during the holidays throughout\nthe term in order to be able to close\nschool on the 14th. Had I not closed\nschool on the above date it would have\nbeen impossible for me to reach Nipawa\nas the ice would have prevented naviga-\ntion.\n\nIf you would like to look over my\nregister let me know definitely and I will\nmail same to you.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nMary Sauv\u00e9\n\nMr. Russell T. Fierie,\nDept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 6th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nWhen the June quarter return of the Brennan Lake Indian Day School was received, it was noted that the teacher had closed the school on June 11th. As the Department had not given any permission to her to do this, we wrote to her and requested her reasons for doing so.\n\nShe replied and stated that she kept the school open during the Christmas and Easter holidays, also on Labour Day, King's Birthday and Empire Day. She further stated that if she had not closed the school on June 11th, it would have been impossible for her to reach Kipawa as the logs in the river would have prevented navigation.\n\nThe Department does not favour having the school open on recognized holidays and would prefer that this procedure be not followed but that the school be kept open until June 30th. Please let me have your views in the matter and state if it would be difficult for the teacher to get away from the school if it were kept open until the end of the school term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell H. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nZ. Casa, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, Que.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to official letter no 35-6-1 of the 6th instant, I beg to inform the Department that the only information I can get as to whether the teacher could have left her school after the 11th of June is from Miss Honan the school teacher of Temiskaming Indian Day School. She tells me that it happens some years that navigation is delayed by logs. I expect to make a trip in that part of the country soon and will be able to make a report to the Department about this year's navigation from Brennan to Kipawa.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa\nDear Miss:\n\nI am writing to you in order to know if you will permit me to teach during the Christmas & Easter holidays in order to close school earlier in June. The pupils are satisfied to attend. They prefer having longer holidays in the summer as well as I do myself. I have always taught during the holidays since I have been teaching in this school. No person has objected to me doing so yet.\n\nI will be much obliged if you will give me a definite answer at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMary Louie.\n\nMr. Russell C.T.

In this connection, I would refer you to official letter of July 6th last and your reply of July 15th.\n\nPlease let me have your views in the matter as soon as possible.

I beg to inform the Department that I am of the opinion that the Brannan Lake Indian Day School should be kept open until June 30th.\n\nThe teacher of the Huntes's Point Indian Day School has to on the Kipawa Lake also to reach Kipawa, and no doubt that if permission is given Miss Sauve to close her school early, she would ask the same privilege next year. It does (but very seldom) happen that the logs on the river will prevent navigation for a short time, but it is impossible to know so far ahead at what time of the summer it may be.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D.

You should, therefore, close the school for the regular periods at Christmas and Easter, and the school should not be closed for the summer holidays until the end of June, next.

According to informations given to the Reverend Father, this girl is insupportable; she does not get along with anybody. Mr. Graham, Manager of the McLaughlin Bros., told him that he forbid her to enter his house for four months. I know that there has always been complaints that she is very cross. I believe she has been corresponding with the Department about her sister whose services for the Hunter's Point School were refused last year.\n\nI told Reverend Father Evain that these complaints were coming too late as Miss Sauve is engaged to take charge of the school the 1st of September; he tells me that if she is going back to Brannan, the Indians will not send their children to school.\n\nThe average assistance to Brannan Lake School has always been poor and the reason given by the parents is that the teacher is too cross. I understand that Miss Sauve is making her home in the school also because she cannot get along with the people.\n\nI am informing Miss Sauve that strong reports against her have been sent to the Department and that I do not know what the result will be.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D.

They are very much vexed against the teacher, and I believe they have reasons for it.\n\nI have seen Mr. Coggs, last night, who also has received a similar request, and he also thinks that a change must be done immediately. He and I are looking for a new teacher. So we think that it is no use to keep that school opened with a teacher who has not will have no pupils at her school. Mr. Coggs is writing to you, some of these days. In such a situation, I think that you can notify at once Miss M. Dowd, to quit teaching, and to let her go home.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nSt. Evans.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Evain regarding the services of Miss Mary Sauve, teacher of the Brennan Lake Indian Day School. We have also received a petition from several of the Indians at that point requesting that her services be immediately dispensed with. Father Evain reports that he recently visited the school and found only two pupils in attendance. He has also requested that an immediate change in teacher be made.\n\nI have to request that you will forward a report stating whether you would recommend that the services of Miss Sauve be dispensed with or not. It may be difficult to obtain a teacher to succeed her at this season of the year. In the event of your recommending that Miss Sauve's services be dispensed with, could either you or Father Evain nominate the services of a teacher having the necessary qualifications? I would point out it is necessary, if a new teacher is appointed, that she be qualified to carry out the classroom instruction in English. Your early reply giving the information asked for above is requested, as, if a change in teacher is made, it will be necessary to give Miss Sauve sufficient notice. Please take this matter up with Rev. Father Evain.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nZ. Gaze, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNotre Dame du Nord,\nP. Q.\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is necessary now to write you a letter of our school. Things are going worse than ever before. We have put up with our same teacher for seven years. It is impossible to try and keep things going as it should go. These people have moved away from Brennan Lake to North River on her account to send their children to another school. Miss Sauve taught school at North River. But they would not have her back the second year. But it seems that we have to put up with her. Father Brown made a complaint that children did not know or answer a word in their catechism. William Jawbon gave her a chance\u2014sent his 14 children to school on Nov 5 and on the date of Dec 12 Miss Sauve took her key and locked the school door and beat up one of them all over the head and body and attempted to beat the rest of them who was crying with fright. And now Jawbon has taken his boy out of the school again. My boy who has been going regular come home one day in bed with bruises across the back of his hand with the edge side of the ruler. But I continued on sending him to school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Roman Catholic day school has been very irregular during the past and is yet.\n\nFr. Evans visited this locality the last of January. I regret to say that he acted in an unjust way towards us whilst here. In my presence he requested the Indian parents to send their children to school. Behind my back in their house he listened to their false stories wrote out a petition and\nI got them to sign it in favour of another teacher. I have proof of same. Had he commanded them to fulfill their duty & send their children to school they would have done so.\n\nHe did not hold an examination whilst here nor even question me with regards to education or the like. I requested him to look over the school register. He would not. He said that it was not his business but the agent's instead.\n\nI sent a telegram to Mr. Caza the following week requesting him to come immediately that his assistance was needed. He did not come but wrote me instead.\n\nHe has only visited my school.\nonce in three years.\n\nIn the month of July you engaged me to come up here to the wilderness to teach.

He informs me that the teacher he expected to get has changed her mind. There is another one from Chapeau who is to send in her application but it is getting late and I am afraid it will be necessary to wait until the opening of navigation on Kipawa Lake; it would mean that the school would be closed for over a month.\n\nI understand from Rev.

I understand that Rev. Father Evain O.M.I. had to pay her expenses to have her come back. Miss Conroy has a first class elementary diploma and ten years' experience, it is her intention to teach during the month of July to make up for the lost time. I am enclosing a letter in which Miss Conroy states what books are needed and I think it advisable to send these by mail to Gaudet Que. via Kipawa Que., otherwise it will take a very long time for these books to reach her.

The Department cannot pay any part of her travelling expenses, but will allow her salary from the date she left home to proceed to the school.

The reason why Miss Conroy is not going back to Brannan Lake is that the parents of the girl she had with her last year refused at the last moment to let her go this year.\n\nThe teacher who goes to Brannan has to make up her mind to be the whole year with Indians only and can not get away from Brannan Lake even at Christmas.

Please let me know the number of children of school age in each of these families. When this school was first established in 1920, the Department understood that all the children that would attend it were Indians. In view of your report that the majority of the children are half-breeds, it is doubtful if the Department should continue this school.

As soon as I will hear from her, I will send her application to the Department.\n\nRev. Father Martel informed me that he was expecting news from Chapeau about a teacher for Brannan Lake but it is I believe very doubtful and if it was possible to get a teacher it would be advisable not to wait any longer. Mr. Duquette has given good satisfaction at Brannan Lake while he was there.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nR.A.

You should discuss the vacancy at this school with Rev. Father Martel. It is just possible that he may have in mind a teacher who would be prepared to take the position.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I also taught during the Easter holidays from Good Friday Easter Monday, and the remainder of the week following Easter Monday.\n\nThe reason why I taught during those holidays was to put in the time I lost during the month of Sept.

The returns received from you show that from October, 1921, to June 30, 1922, the school was in operation for 176 days. This would make the amount due you 176 x $1.75 = $308.00. The Department has already paid you $315.00. There is, therefore, no further amount due you. In fact, as you can see from the above, you have been overpaid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

It is noted that she has a first class elementary diploma and has had ten years' experience in teaching.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of her appointment, with salary at the rate of $75 per teaching month. It is noted that she intends to teach during the month of July to make up for the time lost through the closing of the school and the difficulty she had in travelling to the school. The Department cannot pay any part of her travelling expenses, but will allow her salary from the date she left home to proceed to the school. If Father Evain advanced any money to pay her expenses, he should look to her for repayment.\n\nThe Department is placing an order with the Government Stationery Office here to send, at the earliest possible date, the textbooks asked for by Miss Conroy in the letter which you forwarded.\n\nIt is noted that you have authorized the teacher to purchase a broom, pail and soap. You should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure, when payment will be made.\n\nIt is hoped that Miss Conroy will meet with every success in her work at the Brennan Lake School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You should point out to the teacher that free books and other classroom supplies should only be given to the recognized Indian children. The half-breed and white children attending this school must supply their own books and other school requisites.\n\nThe classroom supplies considered necessary, with the exception of the Corona Readers, will be forwarded to the teacher's address in due course. Please have the teacher forward another requisition for the Corona Readers that he requires. They are published as follows:\n\n\"Happy Days\" (new Primer for Grade I)\nFirst Book (Grade 2)\nSecond Book (Grade 3)\n\"Tales to Tell\" (new Grade 4 Reader).\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Z.

The cover is flush with the top of lid, and books, slates, etc., can be moved over the surface without noise or interruption.\n\nThe Shield\n\nWhile our desk is the strongest made, and needs no bracing, we decided to add strength where we knew it was required. The shield protects the seat in front from being marred or rubbed by the occupant of desk in rear. Boys cannot place a pin in their shoes and \u201celectricify\u201d the studious pupil in front, and neither can they fold the seat down when once up. The shield braces the desk latterally, supporting the castings where the leverage is the greatest when leaning against the side of the desk.\n\nThere is no uncertainty in dealing with us. Any banker will tell you all about us, and our responsibility makes our every promise good. When we say a thing is so\u2014it IS so. If you are undecided, write us. If in need of anything in our line, examine our goods and get our prices.\n\nThe selection of our furniture will save you lots of worry in the future. There is no guess work in the construction of our work. Every device offered by us has been thoroughly tested and tried. The highest grade of product is our goal. We aim to make each year\u2019s work more perfect than the preceding year\u2019s. Our price is no more than is charged by others for inferior work. Don\u2019t buy experiments or deal with experimental concerns. Be sure\u2014and in dealing with us you are sure\u2014that everything is right. Our name and reputation reaching around the world, is a guarantee that it is so.

No sliding in and out of this seat. Pupils do not slide into the aisle before they rise up as in other seats. Some manufacturers of the double desk with separate seats, the demands for double desks with separate seats, have put in a centre leg to make the separate seats, for which they charge you from 50 to 75 per cent extra, and which are no better than a double desk with nothing but an entire seat. Can you fold one of their seats in the school-room without getting into the aisle first? You might as well have their entire seat, for you cannot fold their double seat with separate seats; they are not detachable. The convenience of this seat is noticeable in singing, breathing, reading or calisthenics, where a large number of the pupils are engaged simultaneously.\n\nOur arrangement virtually gives both occupants of a double desk a separate seat. Also room with less floor space than any desk made.\n\nWe also make a Double Desk with an Entire Seat which is less expensive.\n\nAutomatic Double Desk with Separate Seats\n\nOur New Desk Top Joint\n\nThis represents a section of the new joint we are now using on all of the backs, seats and tops of our desks. This is a new wedge dovetail joint\u2014the best in the world.\n\nGuard against trouble with joints of tops opening up by purchasing our school desks.\n\nAutomatic Double Desk with Entire Seat\nQuotations for School Desks.\n\nReceivable until noon Sept. 14, 1922.\n\nThe Purchasing Agent\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOTTAWA, September 16th, 1922.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nPURCHASING COMMISSION OF CANADA.\n\nTenders have been received for the supplying of 15 double desks and 3 rear seats required to be delivered at Kippewa R.R.

The accounts for this material are satisfactory, and the above amount will be paid.\n\nIn connection with the accounts for the material used in the construction of the Brennan's Lake Indian Day School, I beg to say that we agreed to pay accounts for material and freight to date to the amount of $136.93. This included an amount from Molay Brothers, of Arnprior, to the amount of $130 and freight $6.93. This account was sent to Father Evin, with the request that he obtain from this firm an itemized statement, in duplicate. The Rev. Father states that he has not yet received the account, and we are therefore unable to pay the above amount until the statement asked for is received. I shall be pleased if you will request Father Evin to forward the itemized account of Molay Brothers in duplicate, as soon as possible, when payments will be made of the above mentioned amounts, viz.: $228.05 and $136.93, for the material supplied the Hunter's Point and Brennan's Lake schools, respectively.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In regards to the cost of same I am unable to make an estimate right away as I will have to ascertain the cost of getting the necessary material into Brennan Lake which will be the biggest item as this school is about 55 miles from the railroad. I also wish to say that in my opinion the attendance at this school during the term just closed, does not warrant any additional expenditure at this point.\n\nI am writing to Joe Menasse who appears to be the leading man in the Brennan Lake Indians to find out what their intentions towards sending the children to school more regularly next term, and also to find out what would be the cost of the transportation of lumber from Kipawa Station to Brennan Lake, and as soon as I receive a reply from him I will make a further report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

I regret that the school is in the same condition as it was last year. There is no ceiling in it and no stove to heat it properly.\n\nI fully understood when you engaged me for this term that you would have the school ready for occupation when I would arrive here. I would ask you to kindly take an interest in this matter and have the school completed at the earliest date possible.\n\nYours,\n\nMary Sauv\u00e9,\nLaundette P.O.\nQue.\nOttawa, September 20, 1924.\n\nMadam:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 6th instant, I beg to inform you that we are again requesting Mr. Agent Lewis, North Temiskaming, to take early action to have the ceiling installed in the classroom of the Brennan Lake Indian Day School, and also to purchase and have installed a stove of the type considered suitable to heat the building properly. We, therefore, hope that the Agent will have the ceiling put in and the stove supplied before the extreme cold weather sets in.\n\nI may say that the great difficulty is in arranging to have the above material sent in from Kippewa Station to Brennan Lake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Mary Sauve,\nTeacher, Brennan Lake School,\nGaudette P.S.,\nQue.\nOttawa, September 20th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of July 2nd, last, and you reply of the 4th of the same month regarding the new ceiling which the teacher of the Brennan Lake Indian Day School requests be put in the classroom in order to make it more comfortable for the winter months. You stated in your letter that you were making enquiry as to the cost of getting the necessary material into Brennan Lake.\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Miss Sauve, the teacher, stating that this work has not yet been completed, also that the stove which she requested be supplied has not yet been obtained. Please give these matters your early attention and arrange to forward the material required for the ceiling and to have the work of putting in the same completed as soon as possible. You should also arrange for the purchase and delivery of a stove of a type suitable to meet the requirements. You should endeavour to arrange for the purchase of the material required for the ceiling, for the freight on same, and for the labour in performing the work at the lowest possible cost. It will be necessary, if possible, to obtain competitive prices in the purchase of the ceiling material and the stove. We are anxious to make this school as comfortable as possible during the coming winter, and I have, therefore, to request that you will give this matter your early attention and have the ceiling completed and the stove installed as soon as possible. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost of the ceiling material and the stove, also the freight on same and the cost of putting in the ceiling.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear as to what arrangements you are making to carry out this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming,\nP.Q.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nI was on a visit to Brennan Lake Indian mission last week, which mission is served by Rev. Father Evans O.M.I., Indian missionary, and myself, and I found the school there in very poor condition. The teacher Miss Mary Daniels tells me that she has letters from you re this school, so I am writing you to see what can be done to improve matters.\n\nThe school when built from timber was used, so that now the plaster used to chink the building is all falling out because the timber has dried and leaves large cracks, and one can see daylight through the building. The interior has never been finished, and a ceiling is needed as it is impossible to heat the building as it is. Speaking of heating there never was a stove sent to this school.\nSo they have been using second-hand\ntext by some of the Indians, and at\npresent are without one. So you can see\nthat if matters are not looked into in the\nnear future we will be obliged to close\nthe school for the winter months, which\nwould be too bad, as success is about\nin sight for this school.\n\nI have another mission, Kipawa,\nwhich is in need of a teacher. There are at\npresent 10 Indian children ready for school,\nand a number of younger ones for future\nyears. We have a good school built there\nwith desks installed, a gift of some Indians\nwho took pity on these children. So if you\nwould give me the authority to engage a\nteacher for this school, and the Govt. send the\nbooks required, it would place our Indian\nmissions in very good condition.\n\nPlease let me know soon a possible\nwhat can be done at these two missions, as I will\nbe returning to visit them about 15th Oct. and\nwill be in a position to arrange matters.\n\nI remain, Yours Truly,\n\nRev. E. A. Litang.\nOttawa, September 25, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to the condition of the school building at Brennan Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. W. H. Lewis, Indian Agent, North Temiskaming, has been requested to have the building made comfortable for the winter months. He was instructed to have the material forwarded and arrange for the work in putting in a ceiling in the classroom and any other repairs required was also to be attended to.\n\nThe agent was further instructed to purchase a stove of a type suitable to meet the requirements. He was informed that the Department was anxious to make this school building as comfortable as possible for the teacher and the pupils during the coming winter and requested to have the work done as soon as possible. It might be advisable for you to consult Mr. Lewis and ascertain what steps he has taken to have these instructions carried out.\n\nYou will be advised later as to the decision arrived at regarding your request for the establishment of a school at your mission at Kipawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

There is required however about 100 ft. b.m. of shiplap to complete the ceiling of the school house. I purchased a quantity last fall for this purpose, but as it has to be handled so many times in transit some of it got broken and lost, and as I forwarded just the quantity required, it left them a few boards short. The cost of this lumber would be $5.50 and the transportation about $3.00. The teacher also requested me to ascertain whether the Department would authorize the purchase of enough paint to cover the floor and ceiling of the school-house, and also the window frames. This would take about 5 gallons of paint, and would cost with transportation about $25.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst.

It was shipped in time to be taken to Brannan Lake 3 weeks before the closing of navigation. The trouble was that the boat of Capt J. Cunningham that use to make a weekly trip to Red Pine Chute, 15 miles from Brannan Lake stop running altogether.\n\nMiss Conroy asked Jos Robinson to get this lime with his gasoline boat. This man had no money and bought gasoline at the name of the teacher and at the same time he bought material to be mixed with the lime. This cost $1.26 and was paid for by the teacher, this was not authorized but they claim it is necessary to make a good job.\n\nIt would have been more in order for Miss Conroy to fix a price for the transportation of this lime and get a receipt from J. Robinson and have nothing to do with the gasoline but he did not tell her that he had no money before he left and it was certainly not her fault, I suppose this Indian thought also that he was doing well in getting the material to be mixed with the lime. The cost for transportation is not too high for the distance from Kippawa to Red Pine Chute is 45 miles and from there is a portage and 15 more miles on the river to Brannan Lake. There was no bad will on the part of any one and I would recommend that the amount of $4.14 be paid to Miss Conroy and I will advise her how transportation should be paid for in the future.\n\nA.F.

Lippen's report on the Caughnawaga schools.\n\nI consider that the experiment of opening a new school at the place called the \"Bush\" has been successful beyond every expectation, and that Mrs. Bovey, who has ten years experience as a teacher, and knows the Iroquois language, is the right person there. You will see on page 10 that several pupils between 14 and 16 and above 16 frequented that school; their chief object was to learn arithmetic and reading, and they behaved very properly. Also the general attendance was very fair under the circumstances. So I hope you will build there a good spacious, hygienic school house for the month of September next.\nTo the Secretary,\nSchool of Indian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nReverting to the disappointment of the Bush people, especially myself, at not having the school and dwelling houses built erected this year, I beg to acquaint the Department that I endured some hardship and discomfort during last winter so much so that I then made my mind that I\nwould not on any condition pass another winter in the upper school house, but, owing to heavy pressures from the Bush people on several occasions and the two men came forward and offered to give the Department a school site if I remained with them. Under these circumstances I consented to continue the school.\n\nI have only two rooms for my use, one is a kitchen, living and dining room combined and the other a bed-room.\n\nThere is another unmistakably disagreeable and that is the foul air from the class-room to the upper rooms.\nI am compelled to have our rooms opened until we felt the effects of the cold air from without. I think Mr. Benson can vouch for my words. He knows the small space I and my family have to occupy.\n\nTaking it altogether, I would ask the Department to grant me an increase in salary, and I pray that my request will be favorably considered.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nAnnie Beausoleil.\nOttawa, October 14, 1907.\n\nSirs\u2014\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has decided to increase the salary of Mr. Beauvais, teacher of the Bush school, from $300 to $350 per annum from the first of the current school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

I think she is well entitled to some recognition for her services.

Mr. Ogilvie, who was requested to obtain a list of the families interested, reports that there is no other school available within a reasonable distance. For this reason I consider that they should be allowed to attend the school.\n\nIt is for you to say whether their parents should pay a tuition fee for them or not, as they reside on the reserve. Apparently Mrs. Beauvais' objection is made for the purpose of exacting a fee, but if you decide to make a charge the money would have to be paid to the Department.\n\nMEMO: DEPUTY SUPT. GENERAL.\n\nI think the children of the white tenants on the Caughnawaga Reserve should pay a reasonable fee for attending the Indian School.

I did so, and the result has been her complaint.\n\nApart from this I have another reason, personal, why I do not wish Miss Phillips back at school. It is the fact that her mother has Phillips tells her neighbors who are willing to admit it, that her daughter Mary only came to school as a spy.\n\nNow it seems to me that this is quite unnecessary, and altogether intolerable.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nA. Beaudry.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Ind.

If the Department is going to intervene in connection with Mr. Dubuc's claim it should have an itemized account of the $111.77, being made up of $94.73 debt and $17.04 for interest. If Mrs. Beauvais admits her indebtedness and expresses her wish to pay Dubuc I think that he should be willing to have the debt liquidated by installments, as I do not consider that she is in a posi-\ntion to pay $100.00 at one time. The Department has never held itself responsible for the collection of debts from Indian teachers and I do not see why an exception should be made in favour of Mr. Dubuc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The lumber, the cost of which should not exceed you estimate, of $80.00, may be purchased and delivered by Joseph Dubuc of St. Isidore. You may also purchase a sufficient quantity of paint at the price stated in your letter, namely, $10.50 per hundred pounds and the necessary oil at 90\u00a2 per gallon.\n\nYou should forward certified accounts in duplicate at the end of each week for the labour and you will be good enough to see that the work is done as quickly as possible, so that the school may re-open on time.\n\nIt would be well to request Mrs. Beauvais to let you know whether the work is being done as expeditiously as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

St. Jean for use at the Caughnawaga Bush School; and in reply I beg to say that the explanations furnished with regard to the advance in prices, namely from $8.35 to $10.00 and from $6.65 to $10.55, are not satisfactory. Mr. St. Jean has stated that the change in prices was consequent upon the fact that the lady teacher choose double desks to match those in the school. The prices originally quoted according to your letter of the 6th August were $8.35 for small double desks and $6.65 for large double desks. I may therefore say that if the teacher choose double desks prices on such articles had already been quoted. It may also be stated that the Department received quotations of prices from another firm whereby small double desks would be furnished at $8.20 and large double desks at $8.50, which prices covered delivery. In view of the fact that the articles required could have been obtained at the prices stated, Mr. St. Jean will understand that the Department would not be justified in paying him $10.00 and $10.55 when articles, such as required of equal quality to those which he provided, could be obtained at the prices above shown. I may also say it is expected that when an order is given to a firm, the said firm will abide by the prices which they have quoted, and not advance them when delivery of goods is made. In view of the foregoing the cheque No. 1311 drawn for $34.00 is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M. Brosseau Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Esau became a hunter and a husbandman but Jacob was a shepherd. One day Isaac told his son Esau to go into the fields to get him a savory dish to eat. But Rebecca heard what they were talking about and told Jacob to get two kids that she might cook it; first and Jacob would give it to his father so as he would get a blessing. Isaac called Jacob and said the voice is the voice of Jacob but the hands are the hands of Esau. So he blessed Jacob and ate the savory dish which Rebecca had cooked. When Esau returned back from the chase he had caught something and when he heard what had happened he became very angry and told his brother it would happen to him something. Jacob took Esau's birthright and now his blessing. But Rebecca told Jacob to go and stay with her brother Laban until\nEsau's anger would be gone.

Mary Phillips vous donnant les renseignements exig\u00e9s dans votre lettre.\n\nPermettez-moi d'ajouter que lorsque Mme. Phillips a enseigner \u00e0 Caughnawaga, Reverende Soeur M. Rose-Alma qui \u00e9tait dans le temps Sup\u00e9rieure des Ecoles dans la R\u00e9serve en faisait beaucoup de louanges, et je me rappelle que Soeur M. Rose-Alma m'avait dit ces paroles, \"si toutefois vous auriez besoin des services d'une institutrice qualifi\u00e9e pour enseigner dans vos \u00e9coles de Caughnawaga je ne crains pas de vous recommander cette dame Phillips autant sous le rapport de l'enseignement que de sa bonne r\u00e9putation\".\n\nApr\u00e8s en avoir caus\u00e9 de nouveau avec Reverende Dr. M.

Rose Alma, who was at that time Superior of the Schools on the Reserves, complimented her highly, and I believe that Sister M. Rose Alma told me that \"If, whenever you need the services of a qualified teacher to teach in the Caughnawaga schools, I do not hesitate to recommend Mrs. Phillips, as much for her teaching ability as for her good reputation.\"\n\nAfter having spoken again to Reverend Sister M. Francis, the present superior of the Caughnawaga Schools, I believe I am justified to recommend the appointment of this Mrs. Mary Phillips for your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Lorenzo L\u00e9tourneau,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Dept.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 27, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, relative to the application of Mrs. Mary Phillips for the position as teacher of the Bush School on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the regulations do not permit the employment of a married woman. It is noted that Mrs. Phillips' husband would live with her if she were employed. The Department considers that this arrangement would not be suitable, and we are, therefore, not prepared to approve of Mrs. Phillips appointment. It is considered that the services of an unmarried, professionally qualified teacher should be obtained for this school. Please advise Mrs. Phillips accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nL. Letournesu, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nJuly 9, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nMrs. A. Beauvais, who has taught for the Department continuously from September, 1895, has been retired as from the 30th ultimo. It is desired to deal as generously as possible in her case.\n\nPrior to 1924, three teachers of Indian day schools, who had given long service, were superannuated under the Calder Act. The provisions of this Act are no longer effective. In addition, seven teachers were given from three to six months' retiring leave, and, as far as I am aware, these payments were not questioned.\n\nThe Superannuation Act of 1924 evidently changed the situation. You will remember that the Department decided it was not proper to admit our teachers to the privileges enjoyed by a permanent Civil Servant. This action was taken for good and sufficient reasons, which still obtain. In 1925, however, when we granted four months' retiring leave to Levi Doxtator, the Auditor General wrote: \"Retiring leave with pay may be granted only by the Civil Service Board and must not extend beyond 60 days. I shall be obliged if you will let me know the authority under which this payment to Levi Doxtator has been made.\" The Department replied in part: \"I regret that I can find no authority in this connection\". I believe the only adequate authority would have been a special vote.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1927, several teachers of Indian day schools, who had served the Department faithfully, received two months' retiring leave. These were not questioned. I now believe, however, that these payments of two months' gratuity from 1924 to 1927 were really without adequate authority. Section 73 of the Civil Service Regulations makes no provision for retiring leave in the case of those who have not been given permanent status.\n\nPursuant to an Order in Council in June, 1927, concerning superannuation regulations, I find that there was an additional Order passed on July 4th of that year (P.C. 5/1316). This gives authority for retiring leave to \"temporary employees who have been employed in permanent positions under departmental authority since prior to the 24th of May, 1916, but whose permanent status has never been confirmed\". The retiring leave mentioned is as provided by Section 73 of the Civil Service Regulations as extended by the Order in Council. Section 73 allows 2 months' retiring\nleave, and, in the case of persons who are being re-\ntired under the provisions of the Superannuation and\nRetirement Act, 1906, or under the provisions of\nSection 5, Subsection a I and a II, of the C. S. S. A.,\n1927, retiring leave as follows:\n\n10 to 15 years continuously - 3 months,\n15 \" 20 \" \" - 4 \" ;\n20 \" 25 \" \" - 5 \" ;\n25 years or over \" - 6 \" .\n\nI believe it is quite in order, under authority\nof this Order in Council, to give retiring leave of from\none to six months to teachers of Indian day schools who\nhave been in our employ prior to May 24, 1918. With\nyour concurrence, I propose to allow Mrs. Beaureais six\nmonths' gratuity. She has taught continuously for 36 years.\n\nIn the case of those teachers who were not\nemployed before May 24, 1918, but who now or in the\nfuture have given 8, 10 or 12 years' service; there\nappears to be no authority for even 2 months' retiring\nleave, but, as we have always granted such without\nofficial criticism from any source, I think we can\nsafely continue the practice for worthy teachers.\n\nRussell T.

Beauvais,\nBox 106,\nCaughnawaga,\nP. Q.\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI took information as requested: it seems that both brothers drink. The families concerned would not like a man in charge of the school.\n\nWhy not give to the R.R.S.S. of St. Anne's control over this school like over all others? It seems that Reverend Sister Superior is very sorry that in years past the R.R. sisters did not take this school under their supervision when the Department moved the question.\n\nI personally think with R. Sister Superior that at present the best choice would be that of Mrs. Phillips: the fact of being married does not seem in her case to be an obstacle to her teaching.\n\nI am respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMissionary.\nSt. Constant, P.Q.,\n3 juillet 1931\n\nMonsieur,\n\nRelativement \u00e0 la question d'engagement d'une institutrice pour enseigner \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole Bush dans la r\u00e9serve de Caughnawaga, j'ai l'honneur de vous informer que Madame Stephen Lafleur, de Caughnawaga, d\u00e9sire faire application au D\u00e9partement pour enseigner \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole durant l'ann\u00e9e scolaire prochaine. \u00c0 part son mari, Mme.

Besides her husband, Mrs. Lafleur has two children of school age. She tells me she has a teacher's certificate. I do not know at all if this person has the qualifications required to teach.\n\nMay I take the liberty to refer to your letter of the 24th last month concerning Mrs. Mary Phillips and to ask you to kindly reconsider your decision by recommending that the appointment of Mrs. Phillips be favorably considered. I am perfectly satisfied that by hiring Mrs. Mary Phillips to teach at the Birch School, the department will be glad of having taken that course. In this case, I thought recommend that Mrs. Phillips be placed under the supervision of the Reverend Father of the Caughnawaga Schools, in the same way Miss Regis is for the St. Antoine road school.\n\n(Signed) Lawrence Levesque\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

After discussing the matter, it was agreed that she should visit the school in September and October if the roads are passable and again in May and June. In the intervening months, Sister Mary Francis considers that it would be sufficient to have the teacher call on her a couple of times a month.\n\nWith your concurrence, instructions to this effect are being given to Mr. Letourneau.\nOttawa, May 18th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to the last paragraph of official letter of July 22nd, last, in which you were instructed to have the teacher of the Caughnawaga Bush School report to Reverend Sister Mary Francis.\n\nThe Department understands that, owing to the bad condition of the roads, Sister Mary Francis finds it extremely difficult to visit the Bush School every month. It has, therefore, been decided that, during the academic year 1932-33, Reverend Sister Mary Francis will go to the Bush School in September and October if the roads are in good condition, but will not visit it again until the following May and June.\n\nIn the intervening months, the teacher of this school should call on Sister Mary Francis at the nuns' residence at Caughnawaga at least twice a month and report fully to her regarding attendance and general conditions at the Bush School.

Phillips, R.R. Station - Adirondack Junction, Caughnawaga, Providence Quebec, Canada, for $13.00 covering purchase of books from our client the MacFadden Book Co.\n\nMrs. Phillips signed a legal and binding contract whereby she was to pay each month until the purchase price of these books was paid in full. The books was delivered to her in good faith, she has accepted them, and has definitely ratified the contract and acknowledged this as a just debt. Under no consideration could our client accept the return of the books at this late date in partial or full settlement of the amount she owes, as the contract she signed is unconditional and not subject to cancellation, and they are compelled by health laws to send out only new and unused books.\n\nIf she is unable to pay the entire balance of $13.00 at one time, we are willing to accept one half or $6.50 at this time and then the balance of $6.50 within 30 days. We understand she is steadily employed and we can see no reason why settlement on this basis should not begin at once.\n\nWe would greatly appreciate it if you would take this up with her. Possibly your influence would induce her to meet this obligation squarely and promptly and without the necessity of taking any legal action against her, which would only cause her added trouble, expense and embarrassment.\n\nWe thank you in advance for any assistance or information you may be able to give us which will enable us to bring this account to a satisfactory close.\n\nYours truly,\n\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOLS & PUBLISHERS, Inc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMANAGER, Collection Dept.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make all checks or money orders payable to J.F.

The older pupils have on several occasions, lately, tried to fight the teacher. They refuse to come to the School on time and at recess they enter the class when they feel like doing so regardless of how long they have been out. Lately some of the pupils set fire to some books and copybooks etc., and have done so many other bad tricks that it would be too long to describe same in a letter.\n\nI would suggest for the future that either a male teacher be appointed at this School or that it be closed and that the children be compelled to attend the Village Schools. The latter suggestion would likely be preferable as with the completion of the new Montreal-New-York Highway, which will be kept open during the winter, the distance from the Bush School will be of about two and one half mile from the Village.\n\nThe above School has for the past few years been a black spot for the local Schools.\n\nYours very truly\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMay 30, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th instant with reference to the Caughnawaga Bush School.\n\nMr. Phelan intends to visit Caughnawaga on June 22 at which time he will discuss the matter further with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Fences would have to be taken down and it would certainly be a long and expensive job. The railroad underpass is too small to allow the passage of any of the buildings, and in my opinion, the location of the buildings on this side of the underpass could not be considered as favorable for our purpose.\n\nThe only alternative is, to carefully demolish the two buildings and use the lumber to build on the space in front of the school, near the Indians agent's office, and a little on the side so as not to obstruct the view of the school and as close to the Highway as possible, in order that all tourist passing the school gate, could come and see the Indians at work; a small office on the ground floor could also be used for exhibiting finished goods and sales could be made right there.\n\nAware of the mentality of the Indians in that section of Bush school, may I suggest that immediate steps be taken to demolish the two said buildings, otherwise we may soon find that these people would begin to break in and remove windows, doors, etc., as they may require them to repair their own houses.\n\nFor the spending of a few hundred dollars, here is a chance to improve our handicraft business without great expense, besides filling a long felt need to divide the teaching and commercial ends of our enterprise and give it a further expansion, for the benefit of the girls who have learned their trade while at school.\n\nChanges in the personnel of the school has caused a different situation, and conditions are not what they were two years ago, and I feel that we should grasp the opportunity to use materials already paid for, which would only deteriorate or disappear in the very near future. Let us take this opportunity to improve condi-\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle,\nDirector,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nI am attaching hereto memorandum submitted to me by Mr. J. Thibault, Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Quebec. The subject matter of this memorandum, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be possible to secure the services of an architect to make an inspection of the buildings referred to as the Bush school and teacher's residence at Caughnawaga. We are urgently in need of a suitable building for the weaving class at the Caughnawaga village, hence the suggestion that these buildings be demolished and used in the construction of a building suitable for weaving and handicraft projects.\n\nIf Mr. Buck or Mr. Dudley is available the officials here would like to have an opportunity to discuss with either of them the proposal contained in Mr. Thibault's memorandum.\n\nActing Director.\n\nEnclosure.\nSeptember 22nd, 1941\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Proposed Handicraft Building, Caughnawaga Indian Agency, Quebec.\n\nWith reference to your notation dated July 31st last, on the memorandum to you dated July 28th from the Acting Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, and attached memorandum from Mr. Thibeault, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Quebec, I may say that as requested the matter was discussed with officers of the Indian Affairs Branch by our Architect.\n\nFrom the discussion it was learned that commercial weaving and Indian handicraft is now carried on in basement classrooms of the senior school at Caughnawaga, which accommodation is not sufficient, and consideration is being given to providing an independent building for the work, which would include living quarters for the Supervisor and a shop where finished articles might be placed on display for sale to the heavy tourist trade passing through Caughnawaga.\n\nIn Mr. Thibeault's memorandum it was stated that by dismantling the Bush school and teacher's residence, both of which were closed, he felt that sufficient material could be made available to provide a new building on a site adjacent to the present agency office.\n\nOn the basis of the information provided, a preliminary sketch design was prepared, and submitted to the Acting Director of Indian Affairs for consideration. A blueprint of the sketch is attached for your information.\n\nThe sketch shows the accommodation requested by the Indian Affairs officers, in a frame building with partial concrete basement. The building would be provided with electric wiring, plumbing fixtures, electric tank, water supply and hot air heating, on which basis, under usual site conditions, the estimated cost would approximate $7,750.00. This cost would be reduced by the value placed on salvaged material, to which later reference is made.\n\nWe were requested to have our Architect inspect the site, the Bush school, teacher's residence, and while in Caughnawaga investigate whether a suitable building could be found in the village which might be adapted to the needs of the Department.\n\nMr. Buck.....\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6072, file 303-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Busk carried out the inspection on August 21st and 22nd last, and reports conditions to be as follows:\n\nThe site selected by Indian Affairs Branch officers for the proposed building lies between the existing Kathery School on the east and the agency office building on the west. It is bounded on the north by the Montreal-Melune New York Railroad and on the south by the remnants of the masonry walls of old Fort St. Louis. The area is sufficient for the demands of the proposed building, but is part of a solid rock formation having a shallow covering of sandy soil; boulders and outcroppings of rock are visible at points. The proposed building will require excavation for partial basement, septic tank and water supply, and it is considered that construction on the site selected would prove an expensive undertaking. The village has no sewage disposal system or water supply, and those services would have to be provided independently.\n\nSewage disposal could only be provided by tapping the sewer line installed at considerable expense about 1927, which carries sewage from the senior school to the St. Lawrence River. This sewer line is approximately 100 yards distant from the area where the new septic tank would be located, and the trench along with other excavation work would require blasting operations. It is estimated that in all site conditions would entail an additional expenditure of approximately $1000.00, raising the total cost of the building to approximately $8,750.00.\n\nFrom an inspection of the quarters in the senior school where weaving and artcraft work is carried on, it was observed that the equipment was crowded and that storage space for unworked materials and finished articles was insufficient. Under existing conditions no display of articles for sale appears possible.\n\nThere is no building in the village which, even by remodelling, is considered adaptable to the needs of the Department.\n\nOn inspecting the Bush school and teacher's residence, they were found to be frame buildings erected approximately 40 years ago. They are located approximately 4-1/2 miles outside of the village, and will no longer be used.\n\nExamination of the material with which the two buildings have been constructed, indicated that structural material such as joists and rafters are in good condition and could be re-used. Doubtless much of the wall and partition studding is also in good condition, but it could not be seen. No siding, shiplap, flooring or roof-boarding could be re-used. These materials are aged and weathered and would not resist dismantling.\n\nWindows have...\nWindows have only the lower sash fitted for pulleys, and the sash and frames would not be satisfactory for re-use. The exterior doors are in poor condition, and interior doors, with two exceptions, are too small for general use in the proposed new building. Before an accurate estimate of the amount or value of material for re-use could be obtained, the buildings should be dismantled and the materials inspected. Under the most favourable conditions however, salvaged materials would only constitute a small part of what would be required for new construction, and it is considered would not reduce costs by more than $500.00.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, it is recommended that:\n\n(a) The Indian Affairs Branch officers give serious consideration to an alternative site for the proposed new building, which would materially reduce the cost.\n\n(b) In order to prevent destruction by vandals or fire, the Bush school and teacher's residence be dismantled, and the material stored under cover until disposed of.\n\n(c) That provided authority for construction of the proposed new building is granted, work should be carried out on a contract basis, setting a time limit for completion, and stipulating that parties tendering on the project shall make allowance for salvaged material on hand.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.S.

This step I cannot claim as being entirely responsible for. While Miss Horne reported to me the condition of her school, she spoke for attendance and the damage they had caused to school supplies, by burning pads, pencils, books, etc... & addressed her to notify Agent Breslin, which she did. He and Constable Jocks viewed the situation after which the former sent me a report to Ottawa, so he told me... and the consequences were the closing of the school.

Following these notifications the parents of all the children called at this office in delegation and requested me to communicate with you in order to request that the school be reopened. They claim that for the past three years the teachers appointed at that School were not experienced enough and had no control over the pupils. They further stated that they are all in favour of their children attending school but that it will not be possible for them to take their children to the Village regularly, owing to their work and the road condition. They claim that there are 19 children in school age in that district and are requesting that a male teacher be appointed there. They also stated that the first school in that district was built by the Band and that they see with regret the closing of that school.\n\nAs an alternative they asked that if it were impossible for the Department to reopen the School that transportation be provided for their children although their first suggestion would be more satisfactory for them.\n\nWill you let me have your views in the matter and at the same time advise if the Department would consider to pay for the transportation of these pupils.\n\nYours very truly\n\nR.A.

At the time of Mr. Buck's inspection the house in question was not available, as arrangements had been made to sell to an Indian who has since left the reserve.\n\nIf this building is purchased, extensive repairs and remodelling will be necessary, but the location is good and we understand the price of the property is reasonable.\n\nIn view of the fact that our handicraft work at Caughnawaga has been suspended owing to lack of a suitable building, we are anxious to have Mr. Buck undertake an inspection of the house in question at the earliest possible date. The Indian Agent, Mr. Brisebois, is also Acting-Agent at Oka, but arrangements could be made for him to be in Caughnawaga on Monday, November 24, to meet Mr. Buck.\n\nDirector\nDear Sir:\n\nI am hereby making an application as teacher of my old school, East Bush school. I have been urged to help my people to try to reorganize said school, to give very sternly needed discipline to the children of said locality to prepare their minds for the future teacher; therefore, I would be only willing also capable to do such duties until such time the Department finds a suitable teacher; it is a pity also a serious disadvantage for little children to be deprived of what little learning they could avail themselves in first years of their school age, there are enough pupils to have a day in-teresting school, I believe the average age of teachers for that school was too juvenile if you could consider this plea, I would gladly step aside as soon as possible.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMrs Annie Beauregard\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIn response to your request, I have been trying to find you a suitable teacher for the bush school of the Caughnawaga Reserve. Thus far, I am sorry to say, I have been unsuccessful.\n\nThere is a real shortage of teachers. In former years, there was a waiting list in Montreal; but now we are forced to use student-teachers and recently married teachers for supply work.\n\nI have communicated with one of the regional inspectors, who has promised to get in touch with his district inspectors. I have asked him to get the name of any suitable teacher in the vicinity of Huntingdon or Valleyfield, where there would ordinarily be a small number of English-speaking teachers available.\n\nI will continue to try and I will let you know the result of my inquiry as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. E. Wescott,\nInspector of Schools.\nNovember 19th, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Building Inspection, Caughnawaga.\n\nI have discussed with Mr. Mills, Chief Engineer, and Mr. Buck, our Architect, the possibility of the latter making an inspection at the earliest possible date, of the stone house that would be available through purchase, for a handicraft building, providing it was reasonably suitable.\n\nOur Architectural staff is so depleted that Mr. Buck has only one Architect with him, and who was recently recalled to help with urgent architectural work, which includes a fish hatchery building to be constructed this fall and early winter in Jasper Park. As you know, Mr. Buck was away the greater part of last week, on the inspection of the Doctor's residence at Brantford, which was gutted by fire. In order that there may be no undue delay on this matter, he must complete certain sketch drawings before he again leaves the office. He must also leave the preparation of bills of materials for the refrigerating plant at Norway House, and the specifications for the refrigerating plant at Kamloops Indian School, at a stage where progress can be made on these while he is away. Consequently, he will not be able to leave for Caughnawaga before the latter part of next week. I hope to advise you definitely a week from today, so that your Indian Agent will have sufficient notice of the date of Mr. Buck's visit. Even this date will involve the postponement of work on two other projects which have been outstanding for some time.\nApart from preparing plans, bills of materials, and specifications for specific projects, Mr. Buck has to deal daily with verbal inquiries on various matters, some of which, as you will appreciate, take a good deal of time.\n\nIt is unfortunate that because of shortage of staff, we cannot deal more promptly with requests from different sources, relative to engineering and architectural matters, and I consider from the viewpoint of the interests of the Department, our architectural staff is now inadequate.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of this memorandum to the Deputy Minister for his information.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, November 29, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing our recent visit to Caughnawaga, I think for the present we should plan to rent the store now occupied by Mr. Leduc. This store will of course require repairs and decoration.\n\nWill you please ascertain the rental at which this store could be secured for a few months, and also discuss with some Indian workman such as Joe Curro, the cost of papering the upper part of the walls; lining the lower part of the east and north walls with some material such as Gyproc; repairing the base-boards; cleaning and oiling the floors; replacing broken window panes, etc.\n\nIt would be well for you to ascertain the cost of Gyproc, wallpaper, paint, oil, etc. These materials should be purchased wholesale wherever the best price may be obtained.\n\nMiss Moodie will write you more fully in this connection but I shall be glad to know as soon as possible what arrangements can be made in connection with this store.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt., of Welfare and Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nReverend and dear Mother:\n\nThe Bush School on the Caughnawaga Reserve is situated a few miles outside the village. Owing to difficulty in getting a teacher who is able to control the pupils we did not re-open this school on October 1. At one time we contemplated bringing the children to the Village School. However, in view of the recent destruction by fire of the senior school strong representations have been made to us to re-open the Bush School.\n\nI understand from the Indian Agent that arrangements can be made to have the road ploughed from the village to the Bush School.\n\nIt would be appreciated by this Branch if you could arrange to have a member of your Order teach this school for the balance of the academic year. In view of the fact that we could arrange to have the road to the school cleared I thought it might be possible to have a Reverend Sister in charge of this school as she could be driven to the school each morning and brought back to the village residence in the evening. I should be glad if you would give this matter your immediate consideration and I trust that you will find it possible to let us have a favourable reply. We would be prepared to allow salary at the rate of $80.00 a teaching month plus the cost-of-living bonus of 11%. Of course you understand that from the amount just stated the National Defence Tax would be deducted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of welfare and Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nIn reply to yours of January 22, I wish to state that it is impossible for our Community to take charge of the Bush School on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nAt this particular time of the school year, we have no available teacher who could be sent to the Bush and besides, the problem becomes more complicated by the fact that it is contrary to the regulations of our Institute to send a Sister alone to any mission whatever. A companion Sister is always required and her presence would be especially necessary in this instance where little protection is assured.\n\nIf a suggestion of mine can be helpful to you, I might mention that Miss Charlotte Bush, a resident of the Reserve and a graduate from our High School, in Rigaud, would perhaps take the responsibility of the school. At present, she is in need of financial help. She was a very good scholar, perhaps she might also prove to be a good teacher if she were given a trial.\n\nWith best regards, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperior General\nOttawa,\nJanuary 28, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to official letter of the 3rd instant and previous correspondence with reference to securing a teacher for the Caughnawaga Bush School.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of January 28th reached my address while I was in Quebec. Since my return, I have tried once more to find you a teacher for the Bush School of Caughnawaga. I regret to say that I have been unsuccessful.\n\nAs I told Mr. Phelan in my letter of November 21st, there is a real shortage of English-speaking teachers in Montreal. Those who did not have permanent positions have sought and obtained employment elsewhere.\n\nIn any case, those who would ordinarily be available in Montreal would not be suitable for your need. They would probably be young teachers without sufficient experience.\n\nI agree with the opinion expressed by Mr. Phelan in his first letter, namely, that the teachers who have been employed in the Bush School in recent years have been too young and have lacked experience. I should like to find you a teacher with some few years' experience in rural schools.\n\nFor this reason, I asked some of my colleagues of the rural districts to find me a teacher. Thus far, they have not been able to do so. As you probably know, there are few English-speaking schools in the rural sections of Quebec. For this reason and because of the low salaries in the rural schools, very few girls in these districts become teachers. Those who do qualify for teaching try to place themselves in the larger centres.\n\nIf you should decide to wait until next September to reopen the school, I may be able to find you a suitable person. It would be preferable to offer the teacher a contract to be signed on June 1st, as it is at that time that engagements...\nare made for the following school year. I have in mind a certain teacher, a widow, who has several years of successful teaching to her credit. I am not sure that I can get her, of course; but it may be possible if I can give her definite assurance before June 1st. If neither the School Corporation nor the teacher gives notice before that date, the teacher's engagement is automatically renewed for the following year. If this particular teacher should not be available, she may be able to help me to find another suitable person.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. E.

The current academic year is so far advanced that it has been decided not to re-open this school this year. Under the circumstances, I regret that your services cannot be accepted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. Annie Beauvais,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is some time since I received your last letter on the subject of the re-opening of the Caughnawaga Bush School for the academic year 1942-43. I want you to know that I have not been inactive. However, I must confess that it is rather difficult to persuade a teacher of the right type to come in from outside and live in this lonely part of the Reserve.\n\nAfter studying the question from every angle and investigating local conditions, I came to the conclusion that it would be better to have a teacher who would be experienced in Indian schools. I decided to interview Mrs. John Bush (Mary Stacey) of Caughnawaga. You will remember that she taught in your schools for some eighteen years. She resigned last year after her marriage. I asked her if she would be willing to teach in the Bush School next year, if your Department would consider it advisable to waive the rule against the engagement of married female teachers.\n\nNaturally, I was not authorized to tell her that she would be engaged; but I told her that I would write to you and that I would ask you if it would be possible to depart from the usual policy of the Department regarding the engagement of married women. I respectfully suggest that you waive your general rule in the present instance. It is my considered opinion that this person will be able to handle the difficult situation in this school district better than any outsider and better even than an unmarried person at the present time. Mrs. Bush and her husband are very well respected on the Reserve. From confidential information which I obtained, I should judge that their moral life is above reproach.\n\nIf your reply is favourable, I shall immediately inform Mrs. Bush and ask her to make formal application\nfor the position. For your information, I may say that I told the lady that the salary offered would be $80.00 per month plus cost of living bonus for nine months.\n\nWhile I was in Caughnawaga, I visited the site of the school. I could not enter the teacher's residence as it was locked. From what I could see through the window, the interior seems to be in good condition. It is unfurnished at present. I presume that you will furnish what is reasonably necessary as you do elsewhere. The interior of the schoolhouse should be painted and the desks varnished.\n\nPlease let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. This suggestion is made in the belief that it is the most practical solution of the peculiar problem of the Bush school district. It may be made clear to all concerned, including the people of Caughnawaga, that this is a wartime expedient and not a precedent. If, however, you do not find it possible to accept this suggestion, I will do my best to find you a teacher from outside.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. E. Wescott,\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa,\nMay 20, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the last few months I have had correspondence with Mr. A. Wescott, Inspector of Schools, with a view to obtaining a teacher for the Caughnawaga Bush School for the academic year 1942-43.\n\nHe has just written to me again recommending the appointment of Mrs. John Bush (nee Mary Stacey). He considers that she would be able to handle this school in the proper manner. The Department is inclined to agree with him but, before making a definite appointment, I thought it advisable to have your opinion. Please let me hear from you as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant dealing with the appointment of a teacher for the coming academic year at the Caughnawaga Bush School.\n\nIn reply I wish to say that I take pleasure in approving the recommendation of Mr. Westcott, Inspector of Schools, for the appointment of Mrs. John Bush (nee Mary Stacey) who used to teach school at the St. Isidore Road School. Mrs. Bush is a reliable person whose past services have always been satisfactory who discontinued teaching at that school when she married.\n\nIt is considered that Mrs. Bush will have the cooperation of the parents of the children and will have, owing to her experience, good authority on them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.

Father Melancon, and Mr Delisle, teacher of the boys school, I drove over the eastern portion of the reserve, where there are 30 heads of families living all engaged in farming, who have children of school age to the number of 56 who, under the present school arrangements are unable to receive any education, all the schools being situated too far for the children to attend. This settlement is quite compact and we were able to find an empty house which with a small outlay could be made suitable for a temporary school. It could be had for the repairs and if the Indians would furnish the material they could do the necessary work. The building is 25 ft. by 13 ft. and would need to be sheeted inside and re-clapboarded for about half the dimensions and supplied with four new sashes. There is plenty of wood in the neighborhood and the Indians would furnish the necessary supply for the winter. It seems to me that it would cost about $75 to equip the school.\n\nMrs Beauvais, the assistant teacher at the Girls school is quite willing to take charge, provided\nshe is paid at the rate of $300.00 per annum, her present salary being $250.00.\n\nThere is another vacant house in good repair quite convenient to the school site mentioned, which could be utilized as a residence for Mrs Beauvais and her family. I am quite of opinion that it would only be fair to these Indians to give them another school. They are all permanent residents in the locality mentioned and remain at home with their families all the year round. The heads of the families, a large number of whom I met, expressed their desire to have their children educated and guaranteed a good attendance and said that if the attendance did not prove satisfactory, they were willing to have the school closed.\n\nThis is the most suitable place on the reserve for the establishment of a new school, should the Department decide to give them another one, as there are only a few Indian farmers on the other portions, whose children are near enough to attend white schools. From what I saw of these Indian farmers I think the Department would be quite justified in making the experiment if funds can be found.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The land that will be granted for this purpose is two or three arpents from the present school.\n\nYour, &c.,\nJ. Blain,\nI. A.\nOttawa, June 12, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nA petition has been received from the members of the Caughnawaga band living outside the village for the erection of a school-house in the school section lately established. This school was started last fall in temporary quarters with an enrolment of 38 pupils. Last quarter they had an enrolment of 44 with an average attendance of 31. The average attendance for the nine months has been about 30.\n\nThis school is certainly doing good work and should be encouraged. A letter has been received from Agent Blain stating that the Indians are willing to grant two or three arpents for a school site and a suitable school building is badly needed, as the present one is a mere shell without any proper accommodation for the teacher who has to reside on the premises.\n\nBefore this school was opened the children in this neighborhood had no opportunity of receiving any education, as they are too far distant from the village to attend any of the schools there, and if the Department wants to continue the good work now carried on it will have to provide a new school building and accommodation for the teacher. If the Department could afford it, I would suggest that a school-house and residence should be put up, as a teacher would be much more inclined to stay on permanently if a suitable home were provided. I do not think that this suggestion would cost much more than one large combined building and there will be plenty of available ground for both houses. Mrs. Beauvais, the teacher, informs me that unless something is done she does not see her way clear to remain another winter, as the present quarters over the school-room are so uncomfortable.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6072, file 303-5, part 1)\nReferring to your letter of the 6th inst. re school site for the Bush settlement, Caughnawaga reserve, I beg to say that I have selected a very nice site indeed upon Lot 330, being the one offered by John Philips. Quit claim deed therefor is attached.\n\nPhilips was only willing to give 15,000 sq. feet but when he found that 30,000 sq. feet were required he very generously offered to grant 20,000 and sell another 10,000 for the nominal sum of $20.00.\n\nThe quit claim is drawn accordingly and if my selection is approved a cheque should issue in his favour at once to make his further agreement effective.\n\nThe site chosen furnishes good drainage and a nice aspect. It is close to the bank of a creek with sloping shores and a bottom some six or eight feet below the level of school site.\n\nAt the chosen site good water can easily be had. At the rejected site it is believed that it would be hard to obtain it.\n\nThe digging of a well should be arranged for.\n\nAs building sites there is no comparison whatever between the two offered. Lot 330 is so much better than Lot 312. Its location with reference to pupils homes is, too, far the best. Eleven children would be equally suited by either site. Lot 312 is nearer for 13 children and Lot 330 for 38 children.\n\nFrom the selected site none of the 13 children\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt., General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nwho live closer to the rejected site are further distant than 1 1/6 miles from the selected site, whilst from the rejected site some children are distant 2 miles. Average convenience is unquestionably best served by the selected site.\n\nAttached is a plan showing this and further showing that 16 houses now without occupants are distributed equi-distantly around the chosen site.\n\nPlans and specifications were left with Constable Two Axes, who was to announce the fact at the church door on Sunday the 10th (yesterday).\n\nTenders are to be addressed to the Secretary and to be in before noon on the 26th inst., marked on envelope \"Tenders for School and Teacher's Residence, Caughnawaga.\"\n\nA cheque for $1.00, the consideration paid J. Philips, should issue in my favour.\n\nNo arrangement as to security for the performance of work has been named.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.I.A. & R.\nOttawa, 19th May, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Inspector Macrae when he recently visited the Caughnawaga Reserve, selected a site for the Bush Settlement Indian School, consisting of 30,000 sq. ft. on Lot 320 owned by John Philips. Philips agreed to sell 10,000 sq. ft. for \u00a350.00, and at the same time to give 20,000 sq. ft. to make up the 30,000 sq. ft. required.

Mr. Inspector Macrae, who was at Caughnawaga on the 6th inst., obtained a deed of the site for these buildings from John Phillips and gave notice that tenders would be received up to noon of yesterday. No tenders reached the Department on that date but today two were handed in, one from John Sky, for $4,400.00 and the other from Frank Jacobs, J.R. Daillebout and F.D. Horne, for $4,250.00, being $150.00 lower than Sky's.\n\nBoth of these tenders are far in excess of the amount voted and, if the Architect's estimate was correct, they are exorbitant.\n\nI would suggest that the tenders be referred to Mr. Ogilvie. None of these tenderers are practical builders and their figures are evidently too high. Probably a white builder would do the work for considerably less money.\n\nMartin Brown\nDear Sir:\u2014I beg to report that I have performed my commission that of calling for tenders\u2014Bush School or Teacher's residence.\n\nI have personally received and transmuted Mr. John Stee's tender; and there is one or two sent directly by tenderers.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMasten Woolack\n\nP.S.

The families referred to having urged the establishment of the school, temporary arrangements were made for the use of an empty cottage, but this cottage has not to be given up. The school has been such a success that proper accommodation for the classes and for a teacher's residence is required. The site has been obtained - the greater part of it as a gift from a member of the band. The sum required is $20,000 or \u00a315. The Indian owner gave $20,000 or \u00a315 and took \u00a320 for the remainder, so that only the school-house and teacher's residence have to be provided.\n\nThe band has not sufficient money to pay for the buildings, so a Parliamentary appropriation is being obtained.\n\nTenders were called for by advertisements in Montreal papers and by announcements from church doors in nearby villages.\n\n3 July, 1908.\nSchool House Dwelling\n\nGAUGHNAWAGA\n\n| Item Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| To 20 Tonnes masonry                                  |          |            |             |\n| 32 ft of 2'-6\"x 3'-0\" Brick Chimney                   |          |            |             |\n| 9 pcs spruce joint 2\"x5\"x12'x10\"                      |          |            |             |\n| 250 ft 3x5 partition with runners                     |          |            |             |\n| 130 ft 2x4 for frame                                  |          |            |             |\n| 1700 ft 6\"x1/2 pine siding                            |          |            |             |\n| 3520 sq.ft of rough boarding                          |          |            |             |\n| 24 sq.ft 4\"x8 plate joist                             |          |            |             |\n| 10 sq.yds of roofing complete                         |          |            |             |\n| 20 ft of 7'-0\" Veranda                                |          |            |             |\n| 1 Collar stair                                        |          |            |             |\n| 1 Main stair                                          |          |            |             |\n| 12 doors 1 1/4 & frames complete                      |          |            |             |\n| 3 Collar Windows Complete                             |          |            |             |\n| 7 English Windows Complete                            |          |            |             |\n| 1 short stair                                         |          |            |             |\n| 400 ft of 10\" base bd                                 |          |            |             |\n| 2 closets to fit up                                   |          |            |             |\n| 512 sq.yds plaster                                    |          |            |             |\n| 30 \" Cement floor                                     |          |            |             |\n| 900 ft Rough & Finished floor Complete                |          |            |             |\n| 1 Wood at kitchen door                                |          |            |             |\n| 1 stair at                                           |          |            |             |\n| 60 ft of 12 inc.                                      |          |            |             |\n| Galvanized Iron work                                  |          |            |             |\n| Painting & Varnishing Complete                        |          |            |             |\n\nTotal: $1968.80\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nWe beg to submit the tender above detailed for the school house dwelling of Gaughnawaga for the sum of $1968.80 (one thousand nine-hundred sixty-eight dollars and eighty cents).\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.K.

Will you please advise whether this work is to be done.\n\nWhile in Caughnawaga last week I had an interview with Mr. Brosseau regarding the above mentioned matter, and beg to inform you that it will be necessary to expend at least an amount of $125.00 to put the foundation of this school in a permanent state of repair.

If the stove or any other article authorized above are for the teacher's own personal use in her residence, it is considered that they should not be furnished.\n\nThe Department expects you to see that, before making any purchases, the articles are for the use of the school only.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

I made a careful inspection of the said furnace, and I found nothing strange. I intend to make another visit before long when this furnace will heat, and if I find this furnace is dangerous, I will report to the Department. Mrs. Beauvais said that the kettle asked for the use of the pupils to get hot water for washing hands. That is a good thing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M. Brossard\nIndian Agent\n\nA.F.

Brosseau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nI beg to draw the attention of the Department that at my visit to Birch School, Caughnawaga Reserve, I stated that the stable is in need of repairs. The roof needs either shingling or tar papering to cover 500 ft. The stable is very cold, in fact we can see through the doors; and for this work it would require 1000 ft lumber with paper to board the building which is 24 x 15 x 12 feet in dimensions. Material and work are estimated at $80.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.B. Rossan\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.\nAct. Deputy Secretary\nOttawa\nThis is to inform you that repair to stable is very essential, and I would beg you to have same done before end of July, as same to be stored then the roof of it may either shingle or tar papering to cover 500 feet.\n\nThe stable is very cold in fact we can see through out door and for this work it would require 1000 feet lumber with paper to board the building which is 22 x 6 1/2 feet in dimensions. I kindly consider this to be very urgent as I never as anything which would prove to be useless.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMrs. V.C.\nOTTAWA, July 3rd, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo with reference to the repairs required to the stable in connection with the Bush school on the Caughnawaga Reserve, and furnishing an estimate of the amount of material that would be required to make these repairs.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have the roof of this stable re-shingled and the outside walls re-boarded over one ply of building paper.\n\nMrs. Beauvais, who recently visited the Department, states that this building requires new sills, and, if the cost of installing these would be moderate, this work also should be done when the other repairs are being carried out.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to obtain competitive prices for the purchase of the material required, and you should make the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. The labour required may be given to Mr. Beauvais, if you are satisfied that he would do the work satisfactorily, and as cheaply as any other person. You should arrange to have these repairs undertaken as soon as possible, and you should purchase the material and have it delivered in order that the work can be carried out.\n\nIt is noted that you estimate the cost of the material and the work of shingling the roof and re-boarding the outside of the building to be $80.00. If new sills are put in, the total cost of the repairs should not exceed $100, as this is the full amount that we can provide for this purpose.\n\nProperly certified vouchers should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material, as well as for the cost of the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

However, if you consider it would be cheaper to arrange with a carpenter to make the screens, you may do so.

March 23, 1923.\n\nWant new plaster in the wall of the school and dwelling house. It seems to have fallen out at the joints. Mrs. Beauvais lost her potatoes during the winter. Cellar too cold.\n\nA. L. Gilman,\nInsp.\nOttawa, April 3rd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Bush school on the Caughnawaga reserve, states that the walls of the school and teacher's house require new plaster, and that the foundation under the teacher's residence should be repaired, in order to make the cellar frost proof.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will examine the walls and foundation of these buildings, and furnish a report as to the work which you consider should be carried out in order to place the same in good condition. You should consult Mrs. Beauvais, the teacher, as to what repairs she considers should be done to the cellar of the teacher's residence, and you should state the approximate cost of having the above work carried out.\n\nThis matter should receive your attention as soon as weather conditions permit, in order that, if it is decided to have the work undertaken, it can be carried out early in the spring, or during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nI believe that the pulp wood wall board is the only appropriate material to be used. The approximate cost of these repairs, comprising the demolishing, rebuilding, painting and the purchase of material would not exceed $250.00. I have to state also that the kitchen floor spruce floor is in a very poor condition and need to be replaced with hard wood, another approximate cost of $50.00; making a total approximate cost of $450.00 for the necessary repairs to the Bush School and teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir\u2014\n\nReplying to your letter of the 3rd ultimo, I beg to inform you that I have recently visited the Bush School, on the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve, and to say that the foundation wall under the school need to be replastered with cement to the proportion of one of cement to one of sand, the joints have to be cleaned first; this would cost about $10.00 beside the framing of the air-hole and the window on the east side of the foundation wall, which would also cost about $10.00. That would be all required for the school building.\n\nAs to the teacher's residence, the foundation walls seem to be in good condition with the exception of the upper joint to be filled in with cement in order to prevent the frost into the cellar. I also consider that a partition is necessary in the cellar for its division into half of its size which would be ample for the teacher's use, so that the temperature higher would be kept higher. The approximate cost of work and to foundation walls and the partition would be $30.00. The annex to the teacher's residence, which is used as the summer kitchen, a size of 10 x 11 x 12 feet require to be lined with board inside and painted two coats, the approximate cost is $100.00. I beg to point out that because of the frost getting under two of the foundation wall corners of the teacher's residence, the plaster is falling in almost every rooms with the exception of the wooden ceiling into two rooms. It would not be advisable to replaster.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 9th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the repairs required to the school and teacher's residence in connection with the Bush school on the Caughnawaga Indian reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the repainting with cement of the foundation wall under the school, and for the framing of the air hole and windows on the east side of the foundation wall of the school.\n\nRegarding the teacher's residence, you may have the upper joint of the foundation wall filled in with cement, in order to prevent frost entering the cellar. A partition or dividing wall may also be erected in the cellar, dividing it into two halves.\n\nIt is noted that the approximate cost of the work to the foundation walls and the erection of the partition would be approximately $50.00. In the purchase of any material for these repairs, competitive prices should be obtained, and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nWe have no funds available at the present time for the purpose of lining the inside of the annex to the teacher's residence, replastering the rooms, or putting in a new floor in the kitchen. These repairs will have to stand over for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL.

Beauvais, teacher of the Bush School on the Caughnawaga Reserve, authority to expend an amount not exceeding $5 in the purchase of prizes to be awarded the most deserving pupils before the school closes for the coming summer holidays. Mrs. Beauvais has been requested to hand the accounts to you, which you will be good enough to certify in the usual manner, and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nAt a recent visit at the Caughnawaga Bush School, I have noticed that two coats of paint is necessary at the exterior of both the school and the teacher's residence. The approximate cost of painting two coats at the two buildings, including one coat of paint at the shingle roofing, would be of $250.00, at the most, this according to a very competent painter that would be prepared to do the painting during the coming months of July and August. This work could be done either by day labour or by contract. Referring to Departmental File No 209174-5, I notice that the last put-side painting has been done during the summer of the year 1915.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo: Mr. A.

The present shingled roof is rotten and should be replaced by one made of creosote cedar shingles, same as those used in the roofing of the Protestant School at Caughnawaga. The inside and outside of the building should be painted during next year's holidays. The cost of this work would not exceed $1,100.00.\n\nTEACHERS' RESIDENCE.\n\nThe roof is entirely rotten and should be replaced by one made of creosote cedar shingles as mentioned for the school. The building should be painted inside and outside in the near future. The foundation is in need of repair. The outside closets for both buildings should be readjusted and provided with suitable foundation. The cost of this would be about $500.00.\n\nI would suggest that the Agent be asked to prepare a specification and obtain competitive prices in a similar manner as was done for the St. Isidore road school.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In excavating at a depth of about two or three feet the water has somewhat interrupted the work and we expect that it will be a difficult task to have this excavation well drained for the foundation which we intend to make at a depth of between three and four feet from the surface.\n\nThe foreman suggests that a drain be made from the school foundation to the creek, a distance of about 150 feet, otherwise this foundation would be always exposed to deterioration. I have asked him to make an estimate of it, together with the cost of clay pipes, and this will be submitted to you by the end of this week.\n\nEnclosed herewith are the quantities required of paint, oil etc., for two coats, instead of one, at the outside and inside of the two buildings, as follows:\n\n- 400 lbs of white lead,\n- 20 gallons of oil,\n- 2 \" \" turpentine,\n- 5 paint brushes, different sizes.\n\nA quotation from Jacques Bourdon, Laprairie, on the prices for paint is enclosed herein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nP.S. Please send advance cheque for the payment of wages.\nJuly 21, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, advising the Department that repairs have been started on the Bush School and teachers' residence on the Caughnawaga Reserve, under the supervision of Mr. Barbeau. As I understand that the foundation of the buildings will require to be drained I wish to say that you may arrange to have this work done as economically as possible in order to ensure proper drainage underneath both buildings.\n\nWith regard to the purchase of paint material, I would suggest that you obtain new competitive prices from Mr. Bourdon of Laprairie and the Clovis Electric Co., of Montreal, and any other dealers in paint and place the order with the firms quoting the lowest price.\n\nCopies of the quotations should be sent in with the accounts as usual. I may add that it is considered that one coat only should be given to the interior and two to the exterior of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.

J'ai eu le plaisir de constater beaucoup d'am\u00e9lioration dans la tenue des 27 \u00e9l\u00e8ves pr\u00e9sents ainsi que de la salle de classe, etc., qui sont maintenus tr\u00e8s propres.\n\nComme le mari de l'institutrice, Mme. Phillips, est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 maintenir les feux et le nettoyage de cette \u00e9cole durant l'ann\u00e9e scolaire pr\u00e9sente aux conditions qui \u00e9taient accord\u00e9es par le D\u00e9partement \u00e0 Mme. Beauvais durant les ann\u00e9es pass\u00e9es, je recommande que cette allocation qui \u00e9tait de croix de $50 soit accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme. Phillips. Je recommande aussi que Mme. Phillips soit autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 acheter environ cinq cordes de bois de chauffage, au prix de $4.00 la corde pour l'allumage des feux de l'\u00e9cole Bush ainsi que pour la r\u00e9sidence de l'institutrice.\n\nJe d\u00e9sire aussi vous faire part de l'intention de la Compagnie Beauharnois Electric de l'installation d'une ligne de transmission \u00e9lectrique qui partait de leur ligne principale jusque dans le voisinage de l'\u00e9cole Bush, une distance d'environ un mile et demi, je profite de cette occasion pour vous demander si ce serait l'intention du D\u00e9partement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que cette ligne serait construite dans le cours de cet automne, de faire l'installation en m\u00eame temps \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole Bush, ainsi qu'\u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de l'institutrice.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Indiens,\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des Indiens,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that I have just visited the Bush School on the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve. I had the pleasure to observe several great improvements in the appearance of the 27 pupils present as well as the class room, etc., which are now kept very clean.\n\nAs the husband of the teacher is agreeable to maintain the fire and the cleaning of that school during the present school year at the conditions which were allowed by the Department to Mrs. Beauvais, during the past years I recommend that that grant which was, I believe, of $50.00 be granted to Mrs. Phillips. I also recommend that Mrs. Phillips be authorized to purchase about five cords of fire wood at $4.00 per cord for the lighting of the fire in the Bush School as well as for the teacher's residence.\n\nI wish to inform you of the intention of the Beauharnois Electric Company to install a line of electric transmission which would start from their principal line to the neighborhood of the Bush School, a distance of about a mile and a half. I take this occasion to ask you if it would be the intention of the Department, seeing that this line would be constructed in the course of this Fall, to have the installation made at the same time at the Bush School and also at the teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) L. Letourneau,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 2, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, reporting on your visit to the Bush School on the Caughnawaga Reserve, and recommending that Mr. Phillips, husband of the teacher, be appointed as janitor.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Phillips as janitor\u2014to light the fires and clean the school. The salary allowed him for this service will be at the rate previously paid, viz., $3.50 per month during the ten teaching months in the year. This salary will be paid upon receipt of the usual vouchers from you for the amount due at the end of each quarter. Please inform Mr. Phillips of his appointment. It is expected that he will carry out the duties as janitor to your satisfaction.\n\nYou may authorize Mrs. Phillips to purchase 5 cords of firewood at a cost not exceeding $4 per cord, and you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Department has no funds to install an electric lighting system in the school and teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Phillips, janitor at Bush School, of the Caughnawaga Indian reserve and I wish to amend my voucher No.3636, dated 27th ultimo to the amount of $70.00 which should be of $67.50. Instead of janitor's service during the school year at $35.00, it should read - $22.50, and 5 cords of wood .................. 20.00 \" cleaning of 3 outside toilets, 15.00 a total of ..... $67.50.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 25th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, I beg to say that your Voucher No. 3636 was paid, as follows:\n\nSupplying 5 cords of wood and cleaning toilets at Bush School - $35.00\n\nServices as janitor at Bush School for the academic year ended June 30, 1933 - $35.00\n\nTotal - $70.00\n\nLess 10% deduction on $35.00 for janitor services - $3.50\n\nBalance due - $66.50\n\nI note from your letter of the 23rd instant that you consider $67.50 should be allowed, but I am under the impression that you have made a mistake in deducting the 10% from $35.00. This leaves a net amount of $31.50, not $32.50. As stated above, the account has been paid at $66.50 and the Department considers that this is the correct amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.

La longueur de cette cl\u00f4ture est de 1000 pieds par 4 pds. de hauteur en broche carr\u00e9e. Il faudrait 50 piquets ainsi qu'une barri\u00e8re en deux panneaux. J'estime \u00e0 $85.00 le co\u00fbt des mat\u00e9riaux ainsi que la main d'\u0153uvre pour le renouvellement complet de cette cl\u00f4ture.\n\nLa couverture du puits de l'\u00e9cole est pr\u00e9sentement en tr\u00e8s mauvais \u00e9tat et une cause de danger pour les enfants. Il en co\u00fbterait 5.00 pour ce travail.\n\nL'\u00e9table qui sert d'abri au cheval et \u00e0 la vache de l'institutrice devrait aussi \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9e. Sa base est enti\u00e8rement pourrie et \u00e0 cause de cela n'est plus habitable pour ces animaux, plus particuli\u00e8rement durant les saisons pluvieuses alors que l'eau p\u00e9n\u00e8tre sur le pont \u00e0 une \u00e9paisseur d'environ un pied. J'estime que le co\u00fbt de ces travaux y compris le ciment, madriers, poutres, transport de sable et gravier, ainsi que la main d'\u0153uvre s'\u00e9l\u00e8verait \u00e0 $75.00.\n\nAinsi, le co\u00fbt total des r\u00e9parations \u00e0 faire s'\u00e9l\u00e8verait au co\u00fbt total de $165.00 et j'en recommande l'approbation par le D\u00e9partement. Je recommande aussi que M.A.Robert, gardien des \u00e9coles ait la surveillance des travaux projet\u00e9s, sujet cependant \u00e0 l'inspection durant le cours des travaux.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Indiens.\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that certain repairs are necessary at the Birch school at the Caughnawaga Reserve. The fence around that school ground is now in bad shape and it is no longer possible to stop the cattle of the neighbors from going over. The length of that fence is 1000 ft. and 4 feet in height and is squared wire. We would need 50 posts and a two door gate. I presume that the cost of material and labor for the renewal of this fence would amount to $85.00.\n\nThe cover over the school well is at present in very bad shape and a cause of danger for the children using that well and costs $5.00.\n\nThe stable which shelters the cows and horse of the school teacher should also be repaired. Its base is completely rotten and on that account cannot be used during rainy weather, nor in on rainy days and is often an foot deep over the floor. The cost of repairs, cement, planks, nails, transportation of sand and gravel, as well as labour would amount to $75.00.\n\nConsequently the total cost of repairs to be done would amount to $165.00 and I recommend it be approved by the department. I also recommend that Mr. Robert school guardian be appointed to supervise the work, subject to inspection during the course of the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, May 26, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, I beg to say that you may have the cover over the well at the Caughnawaga Bush School repaired, at once, at a cost not exceeding $5.00.\n\nA departmental official intends to visit the Caughnawaga reserve about the middle of next month, and consideration will then be given to fixing the fence and repairing the stable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.
