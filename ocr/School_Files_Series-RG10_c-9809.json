All partitions are in iron buried by the foot in cement and all the underflooring is cement too. The system of ventilation is the last model and very efficient. Consequently we can assert that these improvements are permanent and an asset to the School.\n\nThe chicken-coop was built since your visit too and in the same manner, as well as the ice-house etc.\n\nIf I insist on the details of these constructions it is with the purpose of showing you that a great deal of work had been done by the School staff and gave us, with the minimum of expenses incurred by the Branch, an opportunity to extend our buildings and create work for our big Boys, who without benefiting of what some call \"vocational training\", got at least a beginning of the working habit, that unhappily they lose so easily when they leave so young our hands.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nRev.

Evidently the check valve in the well has given them a lot of trouble in the past and last year they had it rehored in a Winnipeg machine-shop, but it did not improve the flow of the water very much. As a new valve, Father de Bretagne states, costs in the neighborhood of $50.00 in Regina, and as they are taking the pipes out, they need authority to purchase the valve in question.\n\nIf they find that the old valve can be repaired, the new valve will not be used, but naturally when they get the pipes up they cannot wait for authority from Ottawa as the pipes must be put right back in the well.\n\nI would ask that this authority be given because it is evidently necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

This is giving way because I can see from the ground that in places the facing is protruding about an inch out from the wall, and it will only be a matter of time until the stone facing starts to drop and may fall on someone down below.\n\nDr. McGill was visiting the School the same day I was there and he can probably explain it to you better than I can in a letter. However, on refreshing my memory the same thing exactly happened in connection with the St. Mary's School on the Blood Reserve, and we had to spend several hundred dollars to have the wall repaired. This was about seven years ago.\n\nNow, the question is, are Smith Brothers and Wilson responsible or should we obtain the services of an outsider. I was talking to the above mentioned firm over the telephone during the Summer and they promised to go down and look at it to see if they were responsible. If they were they stated they would repair it and if they were not they promised to advise me what was necessary to do. However, up to the present time they have not gone down to the School. If you wish, I can again interview them but I shall take no steps until I hear from you. I think it would be a good idea to talk this over with the architect down there. No doubt you have the plans of the School and if the stone facing near the top of the wall has loosened in one place it will probably become loose all around the School.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nM.

They state that on November 8th they visited and examined the brick work and cracks in this building and they believe the cracks were caused by water seeping in the joints of the stone belt course, which freezes then and thaws again, thus forcing the stone and brick work to move. This, they go on to say, happens on buildings where the mortar joints in the stone or brick work become faulty and are not repaired. Their advice is to examine mortar joints every few years in a cold climate such as in Saskatchewan, and wherever any signs of depreciation are shown the holes should be patched with caulking compound or mortar to prevent water seepage.\n\nWith particular reference to this building Smith Bros. and Wilson further state that the movement of stone and brick has not yet reached a danger point as there is still a good deal of bearing left for the stone, and in their opinion there is no danger of any brick falling at the present time. They think it is too late in the year to do any permanent repair work to the brick and the matter of repairs should be postponed until Spring as it is so hard to get brick layers at present. However, the joints in the brick work and stone should be caulked with oakum and caulking compound to prevent any seepage of water behind the masonry as if this is not done further freezing and thawing of the water will shift the brick work to the extent where it will become dangerous. In their estimation the cost of this work would be about $35.00 in order to make the cracks water-proof for the Winter, and they are willing to arrange to have this work done and are awaiting instructions on the matter.\n\nThis is the information given to me and I am forwarding it on to the Branch for further action.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nM.

It is a source of much trouble for us because.................\"\n\nThe Reverend Father goes on to explain here that the war regulation does not allow the Railway Company to send small cars and as a result they have to bring in larger shipments. Due to the lack of space it is therefore necessary for them to pile the coal outside and since it is Lignite coal the snow mixes into it, causing deterioration. In view of this the Principal has asked for authority to purchase lumber in the amount of $50.00 to build an addition on the coal bin. The employees of the School will do the necessary work.\n\nI would recommend this as good use is made of everything that goes to this School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

Buek writes as follows:\n\n\"The temperature of all of the seven classrooms is much too low for pupil health and good work. The average for the four days of the inspection was between 34 and 56 degrees Fahrenheit. It felt really cold. By actual count over 75% of the 264 children had colds in one form or another, and according to the Principal had had them for several weeks. According to the Indian Act it seems that the Agent in charge has some responsibility in these matters. The same deficiencies were reported last year, but apparently nothing was done about it. Other official visitors to this school have made similar observations.\"\n\nI should appreciate your advising at once why the above condition prevails.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. M. de Bretagne, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\nLebret Sask\nIndian Res. School\nJanuary 9th 1942\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe- Yours 114-0-5 Dec. 31st -\n\nI beg to inform you that at the time of the visit of the Inspector Buck the temperature outside was not really cold and consequently did not necessitate the school buildings to be heated as much as in the winter weather. We have indeed the habit of keeping the temperature at 70\u00b0 in the hall during the winter months and I never begrudged coal to the engineer.\n\nAt the time of the visit of the Inspector Buck we were enlarging the coal bin capacity and digging an outside ash-pit to keep our boiler room clean and to save the health of our firemen. And it might have been that the fire was a little neglected to give satisfaction to the School Inspector G.J. Buck who seems to have a hobby of carrying thermometer along in his visits.\n\nNow, to say that the cold prevailing at the time of the visit of the said Inspector was due to the poor way the building was heated up is certainly an exaggeration because nearly all the children came back from their holidays with a bad cold contracted in the poor quarters occupied by their parents in the nomadic peregrinations in which they usually delight but that took place this year during an exceptionally cold month of August, similar in the West this year to what we used to have in September if not worse.\n\nPractically all schools were quarantined this year for mumps and grippe, and ours was one of the last to be treated so by medical authorities, and had that quarantine lifted up at the same time as the others. Nothing abnormal had to be observed in that fact consequently.\n\nThe reports concerning the health of our children was to my knowledge excellent and Dr Simes is always eulogizing our success in that matter. Our children gain considerable weight, are fat and the pride of their parents who are after all the best judges in that matter.\n\nWishing that these explanations be satisfactory,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nR.A Hoey\nSupt.of Welfare & Training\nMines & N.Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRev.M.de Bretagne O.M.I\nPrincipal.\nLEBRET Sask\nIndian School\n\nMarch 4th 1942.\n\nDear Rev.F.Plourde,\n\nWe would badly need a new kitchen range for our school and I would be very thankful that you insist to the Department to secure that purchase.\n\nWe were given 2 light ranges at the time of the fire of the old school and these ranges are inadequate for their purpose, the ovens in spite of the work done on them do not get warm at least two of them, they burn an awful amount of fuel and wood is very scarce here now and we are in the necessity of using coal for which fuel these ranges are not made up, consequently the tops warp.\n\nIn spite of the economies required by the hard present times I would have to apply for one good kitchen range with one fire box only and 3 ovens, called by the General Steewares Ltd #30 Chef Junior with double deck high shelf, straight water front, equipped with Ni-resist top over firebox, at the price of $459.25, fed. tax not included.\n\nThis is our urgent need and wish you do your utmost to get authorization for its purchase.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.M.de Bretagne O.M.I\nPrincipal.\n\nPS.

Ashdown Hardware Company, Regina, put it back in shape. I am therefore now forwarding our Voucher No. 227 for $88.13 for this.\n\nNext the Reverend Father had trouble with the stokers and had to order new pulleys from the Vulcan Iron Works at Winnipeg. The invoice for this has not as yet been received.\n\nTrouble was also experienced with the switch control of the Vacuum system and when the defect was found by the head engineer of the Sanatorium at Fort San they had to wire to Montreal to secure the worn out parts from Darling Brothers Limited.\n\nThe invoices from the two last mentioned companies will be forwarded just as soon as they are received and I would ask that the one in favour of J.H.

Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWe have been receiving communications from Father M. de Bretagne, Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School at Lebret, with respect to the twin boilers at the school.\n\nThe flues of these boilers need replacing as they are leaking and Father de Bretagne notes that the boilers are in a very bad condition according to a report made by the Provincial Inspector of Boilers here. He further notes that every precaution was taken even to using soft water but after eight winters it seems they are playing out.\n\nThey have already changed 5 flues at the school but it now becomes necessary to change them all and in this connection I would refer you to Departmental letter No. 114-0-6 of June 27th, 1941, when authority was given to repair some tubes at that time which were badly worn. Each boiler consists of 44 tubes 3\" in diameter and 7' long and 46 tubes 3\" in diameter and 6' long, making a total of 584 lineal ft. of tubing for each boiler. These boilers were made by the Vulcan Iron Works, of Winnipeg, and their make is V.I.O.L.A.\n\nTwo years ago the Vulcan Iron Works made an offer to repair the boilers for $277.65 each. At the present time a Mr. Pertle, owner of the General Repair Shop at Fort Qu'Appelle, has offered to do the work for $300.00 that is installing the new tubes, cutting the old ones as well as cutting the smoke stack.\n\nI am giving you all this information and at the same time would point out that this work must be done during the Summer months before the cold weather again sets in next Fall.\n\nI have just received a quotation from the Vulcan Iron Works of Winnipeg, this morning and from this you will note that they will supply the tubing for each boiler and install it at a cost of $498.00 each.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nJune 17, 1943.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Scarth & Victoria, Regina,\nSask.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, regarding the boilers at the Qu'Appelle Residential School. I understand from your letter that the quotation of $300.00 from Mr. Pertle only covers the installation, etc., of the new tubes and does not include the cost of the tubes themselves. The tender from the Vulcan Iron Works apparently includes both the tubes and the cost of their installation. Before submitting the matter to the Departmental Purchasing Agent I should appreciate your informing me if my interpretation of your letter is correct.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAcknowledging receipt of your letter 114-0-5 of June 17th in connection with repairing of boilers in the Qu'Appelle Residential school, the principal happened to be in the office here today and you are correct in your contention that $300.00, the bid from Mr. Pertle, only covers the installation, etc.\n\nI am getting a proper tender from Mr. Pertle and will forward that as soon as I receive it.\n\nM. Christianson,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nIn pursuance to our letter of June 21st, File 315-11ARC, replying to yours 114-0-5 of June 17th, I am herewith attaching tender from Mr. A.

I am today in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the school in which he states that Mr. Pertle of the General Repairs Shop, Fort Qu'Appelle, was badly hurt in his shop and will henceforth be unable to undertake the work of repairing the boilers in question.

In the latter case it should be understood that if he sublets the contract the cost to us will not exceed $300.00.

Hill of Fort Qu'Appelle and the Northwestern Iron Works, operated by Cook Brothers in Regina. On receipt of these quotations you should submit them immediately for our consideration.

Phalen\n\nMy dear Mr. Phalen,\n\nI am in receipt of a list of requirements from the Principal of the Lebret School which I hope you will be able to supply.\n\n1. 16 desks for the first grade. Actually there are only 24 desks for a class of 40.\n2. 3 Blackboards for the above class. Dimensions: 15'10\", 14'10\", 12'4\".\n3. Repairs to the root-cellar. (List of material will be supplied later.)\n4. 200 lbs. of white lead or its equivalent.\n   3 gallons of turpentine.\n   10 gallons of boiled linseed oil.\n   2 four-inch brushes.\n5. Lumber, nails and roofing paper for shed capable of holding 4 carloads of coal. This is advised by the local rationing board.\n6. 2 office desks.\n7. 2 rebuilt typewriters.\n8. The school has received so far this year only part of the school books required. Due to this, the Principal had to spend $90 for the purchase of class books.\n\nNo list of material for the temporary shed for coal has been supplied, and I think that the purchase of this lumber could be referred to Mr. Christianson at Regina.\n\nHoping that you will be able to give the above your immediate consideration, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 7)\nOttawa,\nOctober 9, 1943.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the Qu'Appelle Residential School.\n\nSchool desks are very hard to obtain at the present time and the only ones we can secure are wooden desks. There are no more metal parts. I cannot understand why the first grade at the Qu'Appelle School has only 24 desks. We have not received any similar request since the school was opened. I wish you would investigate this matter further. In any case we will have to have more specific information along the following lines:\n\nSize No. 5 for pupils 5 to 8 years of age\n\" No. 4 \" \" 8 to 10 \"\n\" No. 3 \" \" 10 to 12 \"\n\nWith reference to the blackboards, you do not state the width required, nor if they have moulding and chalk trough.\n\nWe have been turned down on all requests recently for typewriters. Consequently I doubt if there will be any possibility of securing these.\n\nWith reference to item 8, I find that the Qu'Appelle School followed out instructions by forwarding their requisition for books for the academic year 1943 early in January last. The requisition was subsequently filled and since that time no letter has been received from the Principal intimating that they did not receive sufficient books. I may say that many of the books requested on the requisition are those not usually\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Ave. East,\nOttawa, Ont.\nsupplied by this Branch.

It would be appreciated if you would\nsecure a list of the materials required for these\nrepairs and forward same, in order that purchase\nmay be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nI am also advised that lumber, nails and\nroofing paper are required for a shed capable of\nholding 4 carloads of coal.

I remember the letter coming in but we have hunted high and low in our files and cannot find a trace of it. I believe you asked me to take whatever steps were necessary after inspecting the frigidaire at the school.\n\nI might say I was at the Lebret School last week and it was while there that the Principal brought this to my attention because he had received a letter from the Church Authorities to that effect.\n\nIf you can send me a copy of the letter in question I would be grateful.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nM.

I have reviewed our file very carefully and we do not appear to have either received or sent any communication regarding this equipment since the first of January.

This account was paid and we have no official record of hearing either from you or from the Church authorities since that time.\n\nHowever, I understand from your letter that additional repairs are needed now and you may arrange for what is necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. M.

Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nRegina, July 25th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nIn 1935 the water supply intake from the lake to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School was erected under the direction of Mr. D.B. Gow, District Chief Engineer, Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service. I find no information on file about this by which I could give a Department file number for reference. I have, however, a letter from Mr. D.B. Gow to this office dated January 1st, 1937, in which he says he encloses a plan of the construction of this water intake. I am unable to locate the plan in the files of this office.\n\nFrom information obtained from various sources I understand that the following is a rough description of the intake: an iron pipe 4\" or possibly 6\" extending a distance of about 300' into the lake adjacent to the school. For the purpose of protecting this pipe a framework of heavy timber about 10' wide has been constructed and this framework was secured with stones and gravel.\n\nPressure of the ice in the winter has moved this protection considerably to a position where I would expect that another winter's action by the ice would ruin it entirely.\n\nAt a point not far distant from the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School the Fort Qu'Appelle San has a similar pipe supply intake with no protection whatever. It is merely a pipe about 1500' long, being a great deal longer than the one at the school, extending from the boiler room through the ground below the frost line out into the lake where the water is deep enough that ice in the winter will not interfere with the pipe. This has been working efficiently for three years and shows no indication of giving trouble in the future.\n\nWhy such an elaborate construction was made at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School I do not know as the conditions are very similar with the exception that at the latter point the length of the pipe is a great deal less.\n\nAs I am afraid there may be trouble with the intake at the school either during the coming winter or immediately thereafter I would suggest\n\nthat the Department communicate.........\nthat the Department communicate with Mr. D.B. Gow at Winnipeg for the purpose of obtaining from him a description of his work at the school and his opinion of the possibility of damage which might result from the ice pressure moving the framework considerably out of its original position. It would be interesting also to enquire why the elaborate protection was necessary when it does not seem necessary at the San under similar conditions.\n\nJ.P.B.

Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 25 and my reply of July 30th regarding the water supply of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, I enclose for your information a copy of a report submitted to the Surveys and Engineering Branch by Mr. D.E. Gow, District Chief Engineer for the City of Winnipeg.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRe: Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lebret, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe are enclosing copy of a memorandum by Mr. G. M. Lyon, engineer of this staff, relating to the condition of the water supply intake at the above mentioned school.\n\nUnder date of January 19, 1927, we forwarded our Controller at Ottawa three copies of the plan of the water intake at Lebret, being one print each for our Controller, Indian Affairs Branch and the Director of Surveys and Engineering Branch. Copies were also forwarded to the Principal of the School, to the Inspector of Indian Agencies at Regina and to the Sanitary Engineer, Department of Health at Regina. Again, under date of February 25, 1929, we forwarded you, along with other plans, duplicates of the new water intake at this school. Accordingly, you will have available detailed plans of the present water supply intake at this institution. In 1941, the writer visited the school and found the intake in fairly good condition except for insufficient filling. It was suggested to the Principal that he have some additional earth filling placed on the structure and I believe this was done. A photograph taken upon the occasion of the visit is enclosed for your information.\n\nMr. Lyon in his sketch plan has shown in detail the movement of the crib work. We do not definitely know in what way the ice pressure has caused this movement but the writer is inclined to believe that it has been caused by combined ice expansion and wind movement rather than by floating ice movement at the time of the spring breakup. If this view is correct, then it will be difficult to combat such pressure or protect against it.\n\nReferring to the letter of Mr. J.F.D. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies at Regina, I might say that we are not familiar with the new water intake at the Provincial Sanitarium near Fort Qu'Appelle. They probably had suitable equipment for dredging out a channel for the intake and they also had the advantage of the more regulated level of these small lakes and accordingly did not have to protect against low water conditions. In 1936 we had to provide for a possible low water elevation of 63.0 on the lake. Now, however, with such a low elevation pretty well guarded against by the dam at the outlet of Katipwe Lake, we could dispense with the outer 300 foot section of cribwork protection.\n\nAs pointed out in Mr. Lyon's memorandum, there does appear to be no immediate necessity for repairing the crib or providing additional protection for the pipe line. If the deterioration continues throughout the coming winter, it may become necessary to give further consideration to what is required or what should be done at the site to protect the pipe line itself from rupture.\n\n(Sgd.) D.B. Gow,\n\nEnclos.\n\nD. B. Gow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. D.B. Gow\n\nRe:-Water Supply Intake at Indian Residential School, Lebret, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, this school was visited by the writer on August 12th last.\n\nThe water supply intake consists of a 4\" Universal Cast Iron Pipe Line, 1220 feet in length, of which 950 feet was added in 1936 extending the line west from the original well supply to a lake intake. The intake 790 feet of the pipe line is offshore and 440 feet of this adjacent to the shore have been protected by a clay and rock filled timber crib. This crib was deemed necessary to protect the pipe line from freezing and from the movement of ice.\n\nThe necessity for such protection depends on the relative elevations of the pipe line and the depth of frost penetration or ice formation. Continuous records of the water level in Lebret Lake are not available. Based on the datum at the school, frequent records show fluctuation from 84.8 to 85.7; the elevation being 85.5 on August 12th. From information obtained by Mr. W.T. Rose in 1936, a probable minimum water level of 80.0 was deduced. Allowing for a maximum thickness of ice of 3 feet, the necessity for protection for the pipe line where it is above elevation 80.0 is indicated. This coincides with the position of the end of the crib as constructed in 1936. Therefore, to maintain the present pipe line in service, protection for it will have to be supplied in the future as in the past.\n\nAn examination of the crib and contained fill was made by the writer which showed that considerable movement has taken place due to ice pressure from the south where a lake expanse about one mile long exists. The north side of the crib is not subject to comparable ice pressure because it is not more than 1/4 mile from the shore. Attached are a sketch showing cross sections of the crib at 50 feet intervals, and a photograph looking west towards the intake from the high portion of the crib at station 300. It is evident that differential vertical movement has taken place varying from nothing up to a maximum of 2.0 feet in a particular part of the crib. Some lateral movement towards the north has also taken place but its extent was not determined. The whole structure has moved as a unit with the exception of some of the 3 x 10 cross brases which have pulled away from the piles; the piles, sheeting and longitudinal wellings on each side have maintained their original relative positions. The clay fill topped with rock has not shown appreciable subsidence except at the extreme west end where it is 1.3 feet lower than constructed.\n\nD. B. Gow, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n532 Dominion Public Building,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nAt the present time there is still sufficient protection for the pipe line, as the crib and clay-fill, although displaced, are largely intact. The water level at elevation 85.3 is high enough to protect the pipe line against ice, even without a protective covering. Hence there is no immediate necessity for reparking the crib or otherwise providing additional protection for the pipe line. If another winter causes further deterioration in the crib and the water level in the lake drops appreciably, then consideration will have to be given to some method of assuring adequate protection for the water supply intake.\n\n(Sgd.)

I am informed that, regardless of the efforts of the engineer to heat the dormitories, there is a difference of as much as 12\u00b0 between the temperature of the two lower storeys and that of the top one. This is due to the kind of construction used in the roof of the building and the only means now known to correct it is the placing of isolated material between the ceiling of the dormitories and the school roof.\n\nThe ceilings of the school are all of cement and only the ground floor ceilings were ever painted. This lack of finish was due possibly to the depression and later on to war conditions. Now that paint can easily be secured, it is hoped that the Department will supply same immediately. The quantity required is estimated at 100 gallons with a proportional quantity of oil and terpentine. Four paint brushes should also be supplied.\n\nThe floors of all the class rooms are of cement and cause considerable trouble particularly due to the dust that is raised by the children's feet. It is eminently desirable that linoleum be placed on all these floors. It is estimated that 200 yards, double width, would suffice to cover the great part of these floors.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n4) The ceiling of the Chapel was never completed and it is now proposed to cover the rough cement with Darnacane.\n\n5) The manual training classes are now held in a very old building which is too small for the purpose. It would certainly be very desirable for the school to have a new work-house, sufficiently large to lay out benches and other machinery to enable the teacher to properly supervise the work done by the children and to teach them the elements at least of mechanics. We have no data as to the cost of this building, but your inspector at Regina could get in touch with the principal and find out what would answer the purpose.\n\n6) There are a few pupils who wish to learn the typewriter but there are no machines available for that purpose. If two or three could be supplied, it would be very much appreciated.\n\nJ.O.

He states that in spite of the efforts of the engineer to heat the dormitories, there is a difference of almost 12 degrees between the temperature of the two lower stories and that of the top one.\n\nHave you obtained any estimate of the cost of doing this work, or is there any firm in your vicinity that specializes in doing such work?\n\nFather Plourde also states that the building used for manual training purposes is too small. Please let me have an estimate of the cost of enlarging it. You should, of course, let me have full particulars regarding the size of the present building and the size of the enlargement which you consider necessary.\n\nWe are ordering 100 gallons of inside white paint and 200 lineal yards of linoleum.\n\nFather Plourde also recommended that two or three typewriters be supplied. At the present time these are not available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend Paul Piche, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLe Breton, Sask.\nIndian Residential School\n\nLebret, Saskatchewan\n\nNovember 15th 1945.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of Nov. 8th re: insulating the roof of our School and plan for a building for Manual Training,\n\nInsulation of the Roof:\n\nThere is a firm in Regina which specializes in doing such work: Regina Home Improvement, 826 Dewdney East, Regina, Sask.\" The total area to insulate is 10,500 sq. ft. The cost for material and labor would be around 15 cents a sq. ft. plus $200.00 for necessary openings and ventilators. (In order to do the work they have to open the roof; and ventilators will have to be installed to keep the right temperature.) Total cost would be around $1775.00 for material and labor. The Company is in a position to do part of the work immediately.\n\nBuilding for Manual Training:\n\nThe building we are using now for this purpose is 42 x 24, but we are using the same building for blacksmith's shop and general repair shop. This is why this building is too small at the present time. I have in mind the following plan:\n\nI would move the tools of the blacksmith's shop and repair shop into another building and I would fix the present building (42x24) in a shop used exclusively for woodwork. We could do the necessary repairs immediately, but we would need some material to improve this shop and make it comfortable for the winter.\n\nMaterial that would be needed for a new ceiling, work benches, drawers, tool cupboards, shelves etc:\n\n- 1200 sq. ft. 1x6-14ft long (for the ceiling)\n- 5 rolls tar paper\nIndian Residential School\n\nLebret, Saskatchewan\n\n-2-\n\n300 lin ft. 2x12-14 ft long-fir (for benches)\n800 lin ft. 2x4 - 12 ft long fir (benches and shelves).\n1000 sq. ft. 1x12-12 ft long - fir - (drawers and tool cupboards.)\n\nI think that with this material, we would have a nice and comfortable shop for manual Training. I could improve the building for blacksmith's shop later on; and thus it would be less expensive than building a new shop.\n\nMany thanks for ordering white inside paint for our unpainted ceilings, and also linoleum. With these 200 yds, we will be able to fix three of our seven class rooms.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.

These automatic fire extinguishers are sold at $42.00 a dozen. We are told by the Inspector of the Fire Chief, Automatic Fire Extinguishers that 5\u00bd dozen of these extinguishers would assure fire protection of the buildings mentioned above.\n\nFollowing is the address of the Company:\nFire-Chief\nAutomatic Fire Extinguishers Co.\n10 Diana Street,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nWe consider that the Department should allow a special grant for this fire protection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. Pich\u00e9 O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, May 20, 1946.\n\nDear Father Piche:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to supplying automatic fire extinguishers at the Qu'Appelle Residential School. I am not familiar with the type of fire extinguisher which you request and would appreciate more definite information. I would like to know also the number and size of fire extinguishers that you have at the Qu'Appelle School at the present time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend P. Piche, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\nMemo:\n\nMr. D. R. Gov\n\nRe: - Lebret Indian Residential School.\n\nAn inspection was made of the sewage disposal bed at the above school on May 16th.\n\nPresent Conditions:\n\nOn the day of inspection, one break existed in the disposal bed area. Flow of apparently the same magnitude as the outflow from the septic tank was coming through the break and running out onto the ground surface, about 50 feet from the main distributor line near the bottom of the disposal area. Four other similar breaks had occurred this spring in the disposal bed on the other side of the main distributor pipe but were not flowing on May 16th. These had been stopped by merely excavating the soil down to or close to the tile and then refilling the excavation again, sealing the backfill in solidly. The maintenance crew had applied the writer's presence to the present break and no further outflow took place during his visit. However, an excavation to the tile, 10 feet farther away from the main distributor pipe, showed that the tile was locally blocked with black solid material and only a slight seepage of water was evident in the tile. It is probable that the tile in the whole disposal area is in much the same condition.\n\nAs the surfaces of the disposal bed has been used by the school for a garden, the school authorities were reluctant to have it torn up in order to clean out the tile. I, therefore, suggested that they attempt to clean out the tile by forcing clean water under pressure from the school's pump back through the tile to the main distributor line and then out by removing the plug at the end of the line. They said that they would try it and let us know the results.\n\nIf this method is unsuccessful, it will probably cost $1,000. to remove the soil, dig up the tile, relay and backfill it.\n\nThe crib, which protects the intake for the water supply, appears to be in much the same condition as it was when the writer made an inspection of it on August 12, 1946. The water level in Lebret Lake is 0.5 feet higher at 85.6 than it was on that date.\n\n(Signed): G. M. Lyon.\n\nD. R. Gov., Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n532 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nFor your information please.\n\nPlease note there is a possibility that $1,000 may be required this summer for cleaning and relaying tile. We will advise you again when a further report from Mr. Gow is available.\n\nJune 13, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal, Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret, Saskatchewan.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of May 16th, we are now in receipt of the following from Mr. Gow under date of May 30th:\n\n\"We are enclosing herewith memorandum by Mr. G. M. Lyon of this staff with reference to his inspection of the sewage disposal bed at the above mentioned institution following a visit on May 16th last.\n\n\"You will note that in the second paragraph of Mr. Lyon's memorandum he made certain suggestions to the school authorities that might correct the situation caused by the partial plugging of the tile in the bed. It will also be noted that they agreed to try out his suggestion and to advise us as to the results. As soon as we receive further advice from the school authorities in connection with the efforts being made by them, we will communicate with you further.\"\n\nDuplicates copies of the report of Mr. Lyon dated May 30th are attached herewith. You will note the estimated cost to clean and relay the tile is $1,000.00 which work, if necessary, could probably best be accomplished during the Summer school vacation period.\n\nWe await a further report and definite recommendation from Mr. Gow.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

The Fire-Chief Automatic Fire Extinguisher has the advantage of being \"automatic\" and therefore is a real safeguard against fire. This extinguisher consists of a bottle filled with Carbon Tetrachloride and of an attachment which automatically breaks the bottle at 140 degrees of heat. The bottles are installed on the wall of the building at 15 to 20 feet apart.\n\nWe had the experience of the effectiveness of the liquid a month ago when a blow-torch filled with high test gas exploded in the boiler room. It happened that one of these bottles was near. The engineer threw it on the fire and the flames were extinguished instantly.\n\nOn account of the low cost of these extinguishers ($5.50 each) and of the good protection they give, we think that it would be a profitable expenditure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.

M. Lyon and Mr. J. A. Aitken of this staff are in Saskatchewan in connection with hydroelectric work and surveys of Indian Schools and Indian Agency Buildings. They do not expect to be returning to Winnipeg until after the middle of the month and accordingly I am drawing to your attention an extract from a letter received from Mr. Lyon concerning an inspection of the sewage disposal bed at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret:\n\n'An inspection was made on June 27th of the sewage disposal bed at the Lebret Indian Residential School. There was no sign of leakage or seepage in this disposal area from the disposal bed. On questioning one of the brothers, it was learned that no trouble had been experienced since my previous visit. It will be recalled that on that occasion we had the leaking area dug up and solidly backfilled. This backfill apparently held the water since no further leaking occurred there or elsewhere. No attempt was made to clean out the tile as I had also suggested so it probably will have to be done at some future date, but is apparently not necessary this year.'\n\nYou will note that the condition previously reported upon with respect to the sewage disposal bed appears to have been corrected and no further trouble is expected during the present year. However, we would draw your attention to Mr. Lyon's remarks that at some future date the tile will have to be cleaned out.\"\n\nIf further trouble is experienced with the disposal bed, the school authorities might try to flush the tile with clear water as recommended by Mr. Lyon under date of May 30th last.\n\nJ.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to bring to your attention our laundry problem in this school. We wash the clothing for 300 inmates. The water used for this purpose is pumped from the lake; the hardness of this water, as per letter enclosed, has 35.0 grains of hardness. We use about 4800 gallons of water for each laundry and in order to get little results we have to use a great quantity of soap, crystal Brite water softener (chemicals), soda etc. The results are rather poor, moreover we damage the clothing.\n\nAccording to Mr Smith, the superintendent of the Laundry Division, for the Sanatorium of Sask., we could cut the quantity of soap used to one third, by using a softener. We could also eliminate the use of the chemicals, and the results on clothing would be far better.\n\nWhen this school was built, a small softener was installed which is insufficient for our requirements. This softener has a capacity of only 640 gallons between regenerations. The factory recommendation for our requirement would be a 210,000 grains, priced at $633.60. To be able to use the softener we have now, we would need a large storage tank (4000 gals), that would cost nearly as much as a new softener, and there is no room in the power room or laundry room for same. Besides this, the water in the laundry machines is heated directly by steam, which, according to an expert, has a very bad effect on the fibres of clothing. By installing a storage tank of 500 gallons (for which there would be room) we could heat the water directly in the tank at the necessary degree of 100\u00b0 or 150\u00b0 for cotton & wool.\n\nQuotations:\nSoftener........$633.60\nStorage tank..$260.00\nTotal........$893.60\n\nAUG 5 1946\nI believe that this installation would be a valuable improvement in this school. Soft water could also be used for shower baths, washing dishes. The saving we would make on soap, on clothing, elimination of chemicals, would compensate greatly for this expense. The little softener we have now could also be sold or used in a smaller school.\n\nI wonder if the Department would consider to undertake this expense in favor of this School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. Piche O.M.F.\nPrincipal.\nQu'Appelle Indian School,\nLebret, Sask.\nOttawa, August 7, 1946.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, suggesting the purchase of a new water softener and storage tank for the Qu'Appelle Residential School.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to your request, but at the present time we are not prepared to incur this expenditure.

As you know, there is an authorized enrolment of 280 pupils at this school.\n\nThey have obtained a quotation from Crane Limited, Winnipeg, for a Model XLE-210 Water Softener which Crane Limited state they have in stock and are willing to supply for $792.00 less 20% f.o.b. Winnipeg, sales tax included.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

He is willing to assume most of the labour costs provided the Department will supply the material. As there are about 300 pupils, 150 of whom are boys, he is of the opinion that the work-shop should be about 100' by 40'. It could be built of lumber, one story high, on a cement foundation. Most of this work can be done by the ex-pupils who are now undergoing special training at the school. The material can be bought now, provided the Principal is authorized to purchase it himself. A list could be supplied to the Department and all purchases would be strictly based on it.\n\nHoping that you will be able to consider this request favourably I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 6 December 1946.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Ave. East,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe have received your letter of the 20th ultimo regarding a work-shop at the Qu'Appelle Residential School. I understand there is a building which is being used at present for manual training purposes. It is probably a little small but at the same time we have to provide buildings at other schools where no such facilities are at present available.\n\nMr. Doucet visited the Qu'Appelle school recently and while the Principal was absent, he discussed the situation with Father Dionne.\n\nAbout 30 feet from the building at the present time being used for manual training purposes, there is another building of approximately the same size. If these two buildings were joined Mr. Doucet feels that there would be reasonably adequate accommodation for manual training work for some time.\n\nYou might obtain a list of the materials required for joining these two buildings and if possible, we would like to know the approximate cost of these materials. I am not certain that we will have funds in the current year's appropriation for this purpose but the matter will be further considered when the list of materials and their approximate cost is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Hobart Mixer.\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nReverend Father Pich\u00e9, principal of the Lebret Indian Industrial School, has again written to me about the necessity of providing the matron in the school kitchen with at least a few mechanical appliances to enable her to prepare the meals for the children and staff, without calling on the school girls for too much manual labour.\n\nAmong the machines which he says are essential for the proper equipment of the kitchen, is a Hobart Mixer, the specifications of which are as follows: \"30 qt bowl, B-Beater, D-Wire whip, meat and food chopper attachment, 8\" Vegetable and Fruit slicer, soup strainer and colander.\" The price of this machine is $853.00 FOB. Winnipeg.\n\nI understand that the office of the Hobart Manufacturing Company in Winnipeg has this machine in stock or at least can supply it with very little delay.\n\nThe Department Dietitian, who inspected the kitchen set up of the Lebret School, has advised these machines on the ground that they will save a great deal of labour which the school girls have to do at the present time and which takes time away from their classes. Personally, I think that the recommendations of the dietitian cannot be set aside. Men have no idea of the task of preparing three meals a day for close to 350 people to set themselves up as judges of the necessity over...\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nor not of providing these mechanical devices in such large kitchens. I think that those who claim they are not essential should be made to prepare these meals not for a month or two months but just for two or three days. They would then be of the opinion of the dietitian of the Department.\n\nI therefore hope that you will be able to provide this equipment immediately.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, December 28, 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to a request from the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School that he be supplied with a Hobart mixer. We are submitting the question of supplying such equipment to the Minister's office and we will advise you later of the decision that has been reached.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Thompson, Esq.,\nDistrict Resident Architect,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nFederal Building,\nSASKATOON, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Lebret Indian School.\n\nWith reference to the recent examination of the above building by yourself and our Mr. Johns. After discussing this matter fully with Mr. Johns we believe that the movement of this brickwork is caused by condensation freezing on the roof joists and shiplap, and in a thaw this would possibly drip onto the concrete slab and drift over to the corner of the building against the brickwork. At that point freezing and thawing could occur and move the brickwork out. It seems to us this is the only satisfactory explanation for the movement taking place although we are not absolutely certain on this point.\n\nWe estimate that it would cost approximately $425.00 to pull down the brickwork of the south west corner to the belt course level, reset the belt course stones at the corner and rebuild the brickwork. This price is approximate and we would be willing to carry out the repairs to this corner on a basis of cost plus ten percent.\n\nWe understand that there is a slight movement taking place in the north west corner but our price is for the work in the south west corner only.\n\nWe think it might be advisable to put in some ventilators to the roof space on this building. This would eliminate a good deal of condensation freezing on the under side of the roof deck. This would not cost very much and might possibly cure the whole trouble.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) E.S. Lord, Engineer.\nC. Gustave Brault, Esq.,\nActing Chief Architect,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Indian School - Lebret, Saskatchewan.\n\nI wish to report that the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Saskatchewan informed me that a dangerous crack had appeared in the brick work at the above building.\n\nOn August 7th I visited the Indian School at Lebret in company with Mr. Johns of Smith Brothers and Wilson, contractors of Regina, who erected the said building. We inspected the building and found that a portion of the South West corner of the parapet wall had moved out, and was in a dangerous position at the break, which is at a point two lengths of stone band from the corner. At this point the stone is hanging out about two inches beyond the face of the other stone band, and as the face brick is above the stone and flush with the stone band, this too is hanging out about two inches.\n\nIn my opinion the cause of this is that rain has found its way in the weathered mortar joints of both stone and brickwork and entered into the cavity between the face brick and the back brick of parapet wall, and during cold weather has frozen, thus causing a movement, similar to the movement of the stone coping on the Indian Hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle. The inner brick wall of parapet wall was in perfect condition, no cracks were noticeable.\n\nWe were informed that this movement has been going on for years, however this spring it seemed to move more than previous years. In view of this and in view of the fact it is a school where 285 children are playing around I requested Mr. Johns of Smith Brothers and Wilson to\nforward me a letter with a quotation to repair said parapet wall as I do not wish any accident to occur. I here-with enclose said letter with a quotation of $425.00 to repair said parapet wall.\n\nI consider the price to be fair and reasonable and the work absolutely necessary and in the public interest and shall be pleased to receive your authority for this expenditure as quickly as possible as this repair work is urgent.\n\nI may further state that other portions of the parapet wall showed signs of slight movement but not dangerous.\n\nAn enlarged photo of crack is being prepared and I will forward it to you as soon as I receive same.\n\nNorman L.

Phelan\n\nRe: Kitchen Mixer for Qu'Appelle Industrial School\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nEarly in October this year, I purchased from the University of Ottawa a Hobart kitchen mixer for the above school. It was then my impression that the school would be able to pay for it out of the school revenues, as the price of this mixer, which is in first class condition, is about one quarter that of a new machine.\n\nUnfortunately the Principal writes me as follows in a letter dated October 22nd: \"I just received the account from Ottawa University for the Hobart mixer. The price of $250.00 is certainly very reasonable, it is in first class condition and gives entire satisfaction. It is regrettable that our finances do not permit me to pay for it; that is why I am asking you to present this account to the Department of Indian Affairs. May I add that Miss McCready, who paid us a visit on the 19, 20 and 21 of October, saw this machine and was entirely satisfied with it. She had mentioned the necessity of such an accessory during the course of her first visit last year.\"\n\nMay I hope, therefore, that you will assume payment of this account?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, November 12, 1947.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant with reference to the kitchen mixer recently obtained by the Qu'Appelle Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department has not previously provided funds for the purchase of this type of equipment.

School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nPP/MGD\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Report of the Dietitian on Qu'Appelle Indian School - Kitchen Equipment needed.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYour dietitian on the occasion of her visit to the above school, on October 21 to 22, 1947, recommended the following:\n\n1. Replacement of the present cook stove or the installation of steam equipment to cook satisfactorily for over 300 people. Prices have been asked for a stove large enough for this school, and will be submitted to your Department shortly. Of course, if you wish to install steam equipment, the same will be favourably considered by the Principal.\n\n2. This school lacks proper pot washing facilities in the kitchen and must be provided with them as soon as possible.\n\n3. A dish-washing machine is also advised. If the purchase of this machine was thought too expensive, proper dish-washing facilities should be provided in the dish-washing room.\n\n4. The replacement of the old and worn bread slicer.\n\n5. The Principal bought a War Assets electric mixer for the price of $250.00, and has already asked your Department to assume the payment of this machine but you have been obliged to refuse. He still insists that it is a departmental obligation and that the grant is not sufficient to allow him to assume such purchases.\n\nThe financial limitations were given by the Principal of this school as well as by all other Principals, and they all find it impossible to procure the quality, quantity and variety of foods asked for by your dietitian under the present financial set-up.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nIndian Residential School\nLebret, Saskatchewan\n\nFebruary 5th 1948.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWe are in need of two knitting machines and we would greatly appreciate the immediate purchase of same by the Department.\n\nThe Company \"Auto-anitter & Hosiery Ltd.\", 6324 Louis Hebert, Montreal, P.Q., could supply them at the cost of $80.00 each\u2014guaranteed for five years.\n\nThese machines would permit us to knit all the winter stockings for the children. It would also be a saving, considering the high cost of manufactured stockings and their poor quality of material.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nP. Fiche\nPrincipal.\nJanuary 31, 1948.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe have your letter of January 28th in connection with equipment required at the Qu'Appelle School as recommended in the report of the dietitian.\n\nAs you have previously been informed, we are prepared to favourably consider the installation of another stove. It is noted that you will submit an estimate of the cost of the stove in the near future. We are not prepared to install steam equipment.\n\nWith regard to items 2, 3 and 4 in your letter, these cover equipment that has not previously been supplied at Indian residential schools. No funds are available for their purchase at the present time but the contents of your letter will receive further consideration after April 1st.\n\nIn connection with item 5, you will recall that the Reverend Principal of the Qu'Appelle School purchased the mixer without first receiving authority. In addition, this type of equipment is not usually supplied; consequently, the decision given in our letter of November 12, 1947 still holds good.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Ltd., the merchandise of your order No 23883 - 20 Beds and Mattresses.\n\nWe have asked through Rev. Father Plourde, for 20 Beds-size 21 x 5'. The beds received are size 3'ft x 6'. We are unable to use them. We have informed Globe Bedding Co. about this, and we were asked to ship the 20 units received to Muscowequan Indian School. But the Principal told me that he already had his supply.\n\nWould you kindly contact the Company about this matter. The beds are needed on account of the increasing number of pupils. Actually, we are using rented camp beds.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. P. Piche O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 10, 1948.\n\nDear Father Piche:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to the beds supplied recently to the Qu'Appelle Residential School. In recent years we have always made it a practice to supply beds six feet long by three feet wide. I admit the size you mention takes up less floor space but they are nearly as costly as the larger size and we feel that the larger size is the most suitable one for residential schools.\n\nUnder the circumstances I feel that you should retain the beds that have been sent to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

But would you authorize me to ship them to Rev. J. Lamert, Principal, Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. He has asked for 30 beds and has the floor space for the larger size.\n\nIf this transfer is authorized, may I ask again for smaller size beds. I feel that smaller size beds are more suitable because for the same floor space, smaller beds can be put farther apart than the larger ones; anyone responsible for the keeping of boys dormitory knows what a greater \"moral\" protection this means.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

There are many things in connection with the report which deserve serious consideration by the Department, and the need...\"\nof a residential school for Indian young people in the higher grades to take additional technical training should be faced if it is decided to give higher education to Indians.\n\n\"Many of those past grade 8 do not wish to go on, and with those very little can be done. However, those who do wish to go on will be served better through the discipline of a residential school where their working hours are under some control, as well as their recreational and study periods, and are much more likely to be successful than if they were sent into a town or city on their own responsibility at the dangerous age for Indian young people.\"\n\n\"It would appear that much of the hope for success lies in the right kind of discipline, with competent instruction both during study hours and during recreation.\n\n\"I would be glad if the officials of the Department would seriously consider this report. Many things about it seem practical and in line with recommendations made by and before the Joint Committee. Further instructions with regard thereto will be appreciated.\"\n\n(5) That the Provincial of the Oblates has submitted a report to the Department concerning the proposed technical school in which a thorough outline has been given of the type of education which would be offered therein. A copy of this report is attached hereto.\n\nI have seen the plans of the seminary (erected of brick veneer about 1925) and feel that it would be suitable for our needs. We could house approximately 20 older boys and girls in the building and could use the farm and farm buildings for horses in farming, farm mechanics, carpentry, brick laying, auto mechanics, etc. It will be necessary that a careful educational survey be made by our Supervisor of Vocational Training to determine the number of graduates from our Indian day and residential schools in Alberta,\nSaskatchewan and Manitoba who can take advantage of the technical courses proposed at Lebret. It will also be necessary to assure ourselves that we can hire a staff of qualified technical teachers. There is a great shortage of trained personnel in this field and it may be necessary to approach officials of the Canadian Vocational Training Division of the Department of Labour in this regard.\n\nDirector.\nSt. Boniface, Manitoba, Canada\n\nJune 28, 1948.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nOn February 18 we wrote you with regard to three unpaid invoices dated March 1947. Since then two have been paid, but invoice #2930 dated March 24, 1947 remains outstanding. This invoice covers goods shipped to the Indian Residential School at Delmas, Sask.\n\nAnother invoice remaining unpaid is #7302 dated March 25, 1948 for $98.47.

Dion, O.M.I., regarding the request for new flooring in the boys' playroom at the Qu'Appelle Residential School.\n\nFrom the information given by Father Dion it would appear that the cost would be slightly over $900.00 to supply and install tile flooring. We doubt if this type of flooring would prove satisfactory for the rooms in which it would be placed. It is presumed that one of the main reasons for asking for new flooring is to keep down the dust and we would like to know if you have ever tried painting the floors with a good cement paint. Two coats of good quality cement paint to cover 2,200 square feet costs approximately $50.00 and should give satisfactory at least for several months when the process could be renewed.\n\nIf you do not consider this satisfactory we suggest that you obtain prices for applying plastic rock to the floor. We understand that this material gives a good covering.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

We hope, therefore, that you can arrange to wait until the middle of this month when we can give you prices and information on this new light-weight, which will really be an excellent machine.

Ltd. Information which\nwe have received indicates that the continued use of a\nstoker on a stove such as the one which is used at Qu'Appelle,\nwarps the top of the stove in a comparatively short time.\nThis is due to the intense heat.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit to the\nQu'Appelle School I would appreciate it if you would\ndiscuss the matter with the Principal and let us know\nwhat action you consider we should take in the matter.\n\nThe stoker was purchased without applying to\nthe Department, and consequently, no Purchase Order has\nbeen issued. Before payment can be made we will have to\nhave a Purchase Order issued by the Departmental Purchasing\nAgent, and it will probably require considerable explanation\nregarding the manner in which this purchase was handled\nbefore we can secure a Purchase Order.\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Deputy Minister\n\nRe: Lebret Scholasticate - 25605\n\nI desire to place before you the following additional information regarding the Lebret Scholasticate, Lebret, Saskatchewan, for the purchase of which representations have been made to the department. You will have on file my previous memorandum to you, dated January 7, 1949, on this subject.\n\n1. Report of the inspection of the buildings by the Donald Inspection Limited.\n\n2. Report received from Mr. C.A.F. Clark, our Educational Survey Officer.\n\n3. Memorandum on the suggested purchase, dated January 22, 1949, from Mr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor, Saskatchewan.\n\n4. Summary of the Indian children of the Roman Catholic faith attending residential schools in the western part of Ontario and the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.\n\nTaking into consideration the total number of children in Grades 7, 8, 9 and 10, as shown in the summary, only a small percentage of whom would be available to attend, if we should use Mr. Ostrander's figures for Saskatchewan as a guide, it is not seen how the purchase of this school, for the training suggested, could be justified. It is difficult, as well, to find firm...\ngrounds on which purchase could be recommended, in view of the relatively small number of children for whom schooling would be provided, compared with the much larger number to whom education could be extended through the construction of Indian day schools for the same outlay. Apart from this, however, it is doubtful whether we have yet secured sufficient information on which to make a decision, considering the large sum involved and the other matters of equal, if not greater, importance in the picture.\n\nI can see no justification for purchase by the government.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 9)\n1st March, 1949.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo enclosing Invoices covering the cost of equipment and supplies purchased by the Principal of the Wi'Appelle Residential School. Arrangements are being made to pay the account of $74.25 covering the cost of these supplies.\n\nAs you are aware, the Principal has not complied with our regulations regarding purchasing in securing a Hobart Kitchen Mixer and a stoker. Consequently, it is difficult for us to give favourable consideration to recommending that the Departmental Purchasing Agent issue a purchase Order.\n\nWe have carefully considered the contents of your letter, and it has been decided that we cannot consider payment of the account of $230.00 covering the cost of a second hand kitchen mixer. I am returning same to you.\n\nInformation which we have received indicates that continued use of a stoker on a kitchen stove will warp the top of the stove in a comparatively short time. It is difficult for us to understand why the Principal did not apply to Regional Supervisor Ostrander before making the purchase.\n\n......2\nIt has been decided to submit the account to Mr. Ostrander with a view to obtaining his opinion in the matter. When this is received, the account will receive further consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard E. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n1st March, 1949.\n\nInternational Laboratories Ltd.,\nSt. Boniface, Manitoba.\n\nAttention: Mr. McKinnon\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of 23rd February, 1949, we have located Invoices Nos. 7302 and 2936, and we hope to have payment of same forwarded to you in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPP/ST Bernard F.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nIn answer to your letter of March 8th regarding the stokers installed on our kitchen range. These stokers have been in operation for 5 months, and no signs of warping are showing on the range. This will eventually happen when steam or hard coal are being used. But in our case, with the use of Lignite soft coal, no intensive heat is produced.\n\nProwse Co. of Montreal, who sold the range, assured me that their range was being built to be equipped with stokers. The top of the range is very heavily built.\n\nSimilar installations are being used in two of our large houses in Manitoba with very good results.\n\nEngineer, Frank Arnusch, of Regina, whose recommendation was being followed to install the stokers, told me that the installation would solve the problem of lack of draft. It must be taken into consideration that the draft, here in the valley, is very deficient on certain days. Since we are using these stokers we have never experienced any handicaps; the heat on the range and ovens is even at all times.\n\nThe economy of operation of this installation is a recommendation that speaks for itself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd. Rev. Paul Piche, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe matter of purchasing a stoker for use in connection with the range in the kitchen of your school has been referred to me for a report. The Department has information to the effect that a stoker such as the one purchased for your range warps the top of the range in a comparatively short time due to the intense heat.\n\nYou will remember that you showed this to me on a recent visit to your school, and it certainly appeared to be an excellent addition to the equipment. At that time I was not aware that such equipment is not recommended for the reason given.\n\nPlease let me have a report on the present condition of the range and any interesting information with regard to the apparent effect upon the range of the use of the stoker, in order that I may communicate with Colonel Neary, with a view to having the account paid. Also, please advise me whose recommendation was being followed when you decided to install the stoker as this will probably assist somewhat in obtaining payment of the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nReverend P. Piche, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLEBRET, Saskatchewan.\nRegina, March 23rd, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 1st instant, File 660-5 (E.1), regarding the installation of a stoker and other equipment at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, I am enclosing herewith copy of my letter of the 8th instant, File 463-315-11 ARC, addressed to Reverend Father Piche, and copy of his reply dated March 14th, 1949.\n\nWhile I do not approve of the manner in which Reverend Father Piche purchased and installed the stoker without reference to the Department I believe that it is proving entirely satisfactory and, so far as I am aware, no difficulty has arisen, or will arise, by the use of the stoker.\n\nThere is a situation at the Qu'Appelle Residential School which is somewhat out of the ordinary. The school buildings are in a valley close to the north side, with the result that north winds sweep down over the sides of the valley hills, sometimes causing considerable trouble in chimney drafts. This, alone, was sufficient reason for installing the blower, as the oven heat can be completely controlled with that installation, which was impossible previously.\n\nI would recommend that future requirements for the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School be referred to Indian Superintendent Frank Booth, whose office is now only ten minutes drive on a gravelled road from the school at Lebret, and, of course, easily contacted by telephone. If that action were followed in the future we would not run into difficulties of this kind where purchases are made contrary to regulations. In the meantime, I would recommend that the account referred to be paid as the installation was practically a necessity.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n5th April, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nAttached is an account covering the cost of the stoker purchased by the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Residential School, for use with the range secured on Purchase Order 33021.\n\nWe referred this account to Regional Supervisor Ostrander, and he states that he recently visited the school and found the stoker working satisfactorily. Mr. Ostrander points out that there is a situation at the Qu'Appelle School which is somewhat out of the ordinary. The school buildings are in a valley close to the north side with the result that north winds sweep down over the sides of the valley hills, sometimes causing considerable trouble in chimney drafts. This alone was sufficient reason for installing the blower, as the oven heat can be completely controlled with that installation, which was impossible previously.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would issue Purchase Order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows: 660-516-12-415. Funds for the purpose are available in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49, and we feel that it should be charged to that appropriation as the stoker was secured in January of last year.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nAttach.\nMarch 31st, 1949.\n\nATTENTION: Director of Indian Affairs\n\nAs far as I am aware, no reply has been received to the memorandum from this office of March 11th saying that the Minister wanted a brief memorandum respecting the purchase of certain buildings at Lebret. Mr. W.A. Boucher, M.P., had inquired.\n\nUnless this memorandum has been handed to Mr. MacKinnon, please check up with the Director of Indian Affairs.\n\nMr. MacKay:\nFor attention.\n\nApril 1 - 21.30\n\nW.C. Bethune\nActing Secretary\nAIR MAIL\n\n14th April, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn your telegram of December 18, 1948, you stated that you could have two bungalows moved from the former File Hills Agency to Qu'Appelle for an amount not exceeding $1,000.00. We requested and obtained the Minister's approval of an expenditure of $1,000.00 for that purpose, and you were advised by army signal on January 10, 1949.\n\nWe have now received the attached account amounting to $1,200.00. Before we can pay this account we will have to refer the matter to the Minister's office again. We would like your opinion regarding whether we should pay the account at the $1,000.00 or $1,200.00. In any case, we would appreciate receiving an early reply, and you should return the attached account which is the only copy we have received, as we wish to pay the amount required out of the appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\nAIR MAIL\n\nRegina, April 16th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 14th instant, File 660-5 (E.1), regarding the cost of moving the two bungalows from the former file hills Agency to the site of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, I did not have a written quotation from Messrs. Stewardson & Sons, Lebret, and I was unaware that someone had given incorrect dimensions of the building referred to when Messrs. Stewardson & Sons gave a quotation to Reverend Father Piche of not less than $800.00 and not more than $1,000.00 for the job. Reverend Father Piche telephoned me and informed me that he had this quotation, and did not state that there was any question of the sizes of the two buildings. Actually, it is my opinion that as the work of moving such buildings consists mostly of raising them on to wheels or skids for towing purposes, and nowhere else thereafter I can see any reason why there should be such a difference of $200.00 in the cost. I would repeat that there was some question as to the possibility of the cost being $800.00. When comparing that quotation with the amount now asked of $1,000.00, otherwise an increase of 50%, I believe the increased price is even less justified.\n\nAs I realize that the matter is urgent in view of the fact that it is desirable that the cost thereof be made from Appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49, a long drawn-out controversy is undesirable. If the Department is prepared to delay payment, to be a charge against the 1949-50 Appropriation, and I am so advised, I would like to have the opportunity to go further into the matter before I would be willing to definitely recommend that the price of $1200.00 be accepted.\n\nConsideration should be given to the fact that when Messrs. Stewardson & Sons commenced work on the two buildings they certainly must have ascertained that the buildings were larger than they had anticipated. That would have been the time for another telegram to be sent to the Department, revising their quotation, not waiting until the work was finished to make the protest. The receipt of the letter referred to is the first intimation I have had that there was any question of the cost exceeding $1,000.00. The account of C.H. Stewardson & Sons is returned herewith.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostreider,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You might point out to them that the Department definitely understood that the expenditure involved would not exceed $1,000.00. As you stated in the last paragraph of your letter, additional authority should have been secured before the buildings were moved, if the firm was not satisfied to accept $1,000.00.\n\nThis situation emphasizes the fact that we must be careful in future to obtain a written agreement before incurring any heavy expenditure.\n\nBernard F.

Stewardson & Sons with Reverend Father Piche yesterday.\n\nFather Piche informed me that Messrs. Stewardson & Sons were given the incorrect measurements of the building by his Assistant, but that they discovered the buildings were larger than anticipated before they started to move them. There was some discussion at that time as to the price. Finally they decided to move the buildings without amending their quotation, and have done so. I may say also that I examined the buildings at the new site, and I find that an excellent job of moving has been done. One of the buildings arrived at the school with no damage whatever to plaster or stucco work, the other building has no damage to the stucco, and only slight plaster damage.\n\nMessrs. Stewardson & Sons hoped that they could be paid an additional $200.00 for the job, but admitted that the Department is well within its rights in refusing to pay more than $1,000.00 under the circumstances, and they have consented to accept $1,000.00 in full settlement, considering the matter closed.\n\nJ.P.B.

For many years we have painted them but paint on a cement floor especially in a playroom has proven to be a futile expenditure.\n\nLinoleum is not recommended on basement floors on account of a certain dampness coming from the ground. Terrazzo as we have in the girls' playrooms has been suggested. We have taken information from M.L. Koyer, Marble and Tile Contractor and I am pleased to send you his answer for your consideration.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. P. Picha O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nM. L.

I am pleased to quote you a price of One Thousand Two Hundred and Twenty Five Dollars for supplying and installing this terrazzo work.\n\nIn making this tender it is understood that a satisfactory concrete slab exists to receive this terrazzo and that we will be allowed to add from 1\u00bd to 2 inches to the height of the existing floor in order to get satisfactory bond on the slab. In other words no provision was made in this tender for cutting down the existing slab in order to keep to the same level. In the above price I figured on using white marble chips with a sprinkle of black as may be desired. I have also made provision for expansion joints consisting of 1\" x 16 gauge white metal strips laid in squares of approximately 4 feet each.\n\nIn making the above tender it is further understood that I will supply two experienced mechanics and the necessary machinery for grinding and laying these floors and you will supply the common labor and provide beds and meals for my two men without cost to me.\n\nTrusting that this price will prove satisfactory and I may be favored with your instructions to proceed with this work, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMLM/IMI\n\nIndian Affairs.

As explained, after inspecting this proposed work we are quoting on installing terrazzo floors in two rooms approximately 30' x 35'. This terrazzo to be approximately two inches in thickness and to be laid on top of the existing mulsomastic base. We do not figure in this tender on putting in any terrazo base boards above the floor level, as there is a type of hard baseboard on at present which answers the purpose fairly well. And we do not figure, as mentioned above, on disturbing the existing floor. If the School authorities should desire for the existing mulsomastic floor to be removed before putting down the new terrazo, they have lots of common labour available themselves to do this unskilled work free.\n\nOur price for this work complete as outlined above is $1,199.00. Eleven Hundred and Ninety Nine Dollars. This price is also based on the School supplying the ordinary unskilled labourers to assist our skilled workmen. It is also based, on the School supplying our workmen with room and board without any charge to us.\n\nYours very truly,\nHarvey Lunam Construction Co.\n\nDHL/L\n\nP.S. The customary 1\" x 16 Gauge white metal strips will be used in the floor which will be laid in squares of approximately four feet each.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Perrie dated September 24th together with a report and sketch prepared by Engineer F.J. Clark, with reference to the high pressure boilers and laundry service at the above.\n\nAn immediate inspection was urgently requested by Regional Supervisor Ostrander, and Mr. Perrie acted without delay, and before this request was forwarded to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nMr. Clark's report (substantiated by the Provincial Boiler Inspector) states that one of the two 10 horsepower vertical high pressure boilers, has been condemned and that the other unit, while in good condition, will have to be re-tubed at an early date. The report goes on to describe the items of laundry equipment requiring high pressure steam service. The load, based on the machines listed in the report, requires about 700 lbs. of steam per hour; this is equal to about 20 horsepower.\n\nIt would appear advantageous at this time to replace these boilers with one new vertical high pressure boiler, having a capacity of 20 horsepower, thus combining one firing and maintenance operation. As this type of boiler requires almost constant attention during its use, it follows that one unit to handle the entire laundry load would be desirable. The cost of re-tubing the 10 horsepower boiler plus one new 10 horsepower boiler would be approximately $200.00 less than the cost of one new 20 horsepower boiler, but the resultant fuel savings together with a much more desirable and safer set-up, would be in our opinion, in the best interests of all concerned.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that at an estimated cost of $2,000.00 one new 20 horsepower vertical high pressure boiler built for 125 lbs. working pressure be installed at the above. This boiler to be complete with fire and ash doors, grates and grate bearers, smoke bonnet, tube brush and rod and to have the following mountings: steam gauge and siphon, water glass, try cocks, safety valve, blow-off valve and nipple, feed and check valves, together with a new injector and the necessary piping.\n\nWe have no information relative to the size of the high pressure steam main from the existing boilers to the laundry machines. This main should be not less than 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" If found to be smaller, the main should be increased to the size mentioned, in order that excessive pressure drops be avoided. Should it be found necessary to replace this line, the cost will be extra to the estimate given.\n\nCondensation should be reclaimed from the ironer and the dryer and returned through inverted bucket traps and piping to a steel condensation barrel set up adjacent to the boiler. This return line should not be smaller than 3/4\".\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nC. Victor F.

L. S. Du Berger, have entirely disappeared, and before a description by metes and bounds, of the proposed addition can be made, they must be re-surveyed, but I did not feel that the value of the proposed addition justified me in making such a survey at this season of the year, when I found the depth of snow, and other physical difficulties which exist, would so largely increase the ordinary expense.\n\nIn event of the Dept. deciding in favor of acquiring this land, a survey can be made in the Spring of the year with comparatively small expense, and at the same time, I would draw attention to the importance of having all\n\nThe Indian Commissioner\nfor Man. & N. W. T.,\nREGINA.\nthe boundaries of the School lands, permanently established with Iron posts.\n\nThe garden as it exists at present, is not of sufficient extent for the requirements of the School, and from an examination of the plan, it would appear that sufficient ground could be found, on the prairie portion for a much more extensive one.\n\nGardening has been tried on the prairie portion, but it has been found quite impracticable for the reasons, of the impossibility of the boys ascending and descending a hill some three hundred feet in height in going to and from work, the impossibility of overseeing them at work, the poor nature of the soil for garden stuff, and its being required for pasture.\n\nOf the eventual practical value of this natural adjunct to the School lands, if acquired, no doubt can exist, the quality of the soil having been proved by the Mammoth vegetables produced in this bottom, and owing to the very acute angle formed at the North end of the present garden, making ploughing difficult, the desirability of the proposed acquisition can be readily seen.\n\nWith regard to the area of the proposed addition, it cannot be given with any degree of accuracy until a survey is made, but as the Mission is prepared to relinquish such a portion of their land lying between the present East boundary of School lands, and the Creek, and within the South half of Section Eleven, as may be required for the price of $100.00 mentioned, regardless of\nof its area, it is not at the moment of importance.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. A. W. Ponton.\n\nD. L. S.\nIndustrial School,\nQu'Appelle,\nMarch 1st, 1868.\n\nNo.3508\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No.126 of Feb.8th and to the survey of Mr. Ponton of a piece of land to be purchased in order to square our vegetable field and make it sufficiently large, I have the honor to inform you that the title of the Mission to the land is clear, the Patent being in their hands and Mr. Ponton having seen it.\n\nMr. Ponton was unable to do the survey properly, owing to the impossibility of finding the former posts or even the line, at this time of the year.\n\nWhen the first survey was made here the Surveyor simply drove a two foot post into the ground at every corner without holes or mounds round them.\n\nIt would be impossible for any but a Surveyor to point out the exact line. As there are at least fifteen angles in it, between the lake and hill, the necessity of having this line between the Mission and School properties permanently laid out with proper iron posts and holes, is obvious. There is still a more urgent reason for having the land surveyed again.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nRegina.\nThe public trail from the Le Bret settlement to Touchwood and to the settlers in that direction passes through our land, and until it is transferred to the municipality we will have to keep it in repair at our own expense, although it is practically a public road.\n\nThis road requires repairs every year. It runs at the feet of, or between the hills, for a mile and a half and gets washed away considerably every Spring.\n\nThere is also a bridge on it which we had to build ourselves and keep in repair at our own expense. The municipality would take over the road and keep it in repair if it was properly surveyed and permanently located.\n\nUntil that piece of land, asked for, is purchased from the Mission the road cannot be properly located, having the land will be a great advantage to us, as it will enlarge our vegetable fields and render its shape fit for cultivation.\n\nIn the present Municipal Council there is a majority who are willing to have the road transferred to the Municipality. It is very doubtful if another Council would be willing to have this done, as it is our only road to the farm and for our own interests we have to keep it in repair.\n\nIt is therefore very important and necessary that early in the Spring steps be taken to have a proper survey made to purchase the piece of land from the Mission, and to survey and definitely locate the road preparatory to having it properly transferred to the Municipality who will then have to keep it in order.\nWe have frequently been delayed when we had other pressing work to do, repairing the road or bridge. Sometimes the teams have had to work on it for several days at a time.\n\nMr. Ponton having seen the place I would refer you to him for further particulars if any are necessary.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. J. Hugonnard.\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department's letter of 18th January last and to transmit herewith a copy of report made by Mr. Surveyor Ponton who was sent by the Assistant Commissioner to obtain such description of the land therein referred to as is required by the Department with a view to enabling it to consider the question of purchasing from the Mission for the benefit of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, also copy of letter from the Rev. Principal of the Institution relative to Mission's title to the land in question, the necessity for a proper survey in the Spring, and giving additional reasons why in his opinion the purchase is most advisable.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor the Commissioner.\n\nTo the Deputy of the\n\nSupt.

W. corner of section 14, which the Mission will transfer. We are the ones who use the road most, it being the nearest by some miles to our farm, and down which we have to haul all our crop and hay; it is a difficult road to keep in repair and we are continually having to do work on it, besides supplying material for and keeping the culverts and bridges in order.\n\nAt present there is a majority in the Municipality Council willing to take over the road, this may never be the case again, as it will only be a source of expense to them, so I would suggest that the matter be decided as soon as possible.\n\nI have etc.,\n\n(Sgd) J.

P. Ry Co\nwhich I understand refused some time ago to exchange\nwith the Government.\n\nThe best half section to be obtained round\nhere, can just now be secured on favourable terms: It\nis the North half of 34, 21,13, is situated 5 miles\nfrom the school and West of the File Hills trail,\nhas yielded an average of 30 tons of hay every year,\nhas from 15 to 20 acres which have been cultivated and\na house which originally cost more than the land and\nhouse can be bought for now. This house would be very\nconvenient for the boys when haying. On the cultivated\nland \"Bromus Inermis\" grass could be grown to supplement\n\nthe\n\nIndian Commissioner\n\nRegina\nthe hay crop and I think between the two a sufficient quantity of feed could always be secured.\n\nThe property belongs to Mr. Wm Crosbie who has the title for the N.W. Quarter section on which the house, cultivated land, and most of the hay is: The N.W. quarter is his preemption and I was informed at the Land Office that it could be reserved for us if Mr. Crosbie's homestead were bought or if he gave up his claim on it.\n\nThe lowest figure Mr. Crosbie will take for the property is $600.00, i.e., for that amount he will sell his quarter section and relinquish his claim on the preemption. The present tenant is leaving in about 3 weeks time.\n\nI could strongly recommend that this quarter section be purchased from Mr. Crosbie and that the other quarter be also secured for hay purposes for this school. I know of no other land having such a quantity of hay, water, wood and land fit for cultivation on it as this piece, besides which it is so cheap, has such a good house, and is so conveniently situated as regards the school. The hay to be procured from this property is worth far more than the interest of the money asked for the land, and I think steps should be taken to secure it without any delay. The crop in this district appears to have been better than in other parts.\nparts of the country this season and new settlers are coming in, some of whom are buying land. If there were better railway facilities the land could not be purchased under twice the amount now asked for it, and as things are, it will be an investment always increasing in value.\n\nHaving experienced so much trouble, inconvenience and expense with the hay supply during the past few years I would again strongly recommend that immediate steps be taken to secure this advantageous offer.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n(Signed) J.

No special appropriation has been made in the current year's Estimates for buying hay lands for the Qu'Appelle and High River Industrial Schools, but as this land is necessary, and as there is no available Government land in proximity to the School, I see no reason why the purchase should not be made. We require the hay lands, and to pay for them from existing appropriations simply does away with the necessity of\nof making additional provision.

M. at cost of $900.\n\nThere are not sufficient hay lands available without the purchases recommended, which probably can never again be made so cheaply, if at all.\n\nThe only alternative is the recurring annual purchase of right to cut, (when such can be bought), or of hay, either of which means of supply is uncertain, and in the long run more costly.\n\nFunds, although not specially voted for such purpose, are available from the current fiscal year's M.W.T. school appropriation.\n\nFebruary 10th, 1894.\n\nHayter Reed\nDeputy General\nFile VI.166\n\nOttawa, February 21st, 1904.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 11th ultimo, and prior correspondence, and to inform you that the quarter of Sec. 34, Tp. 21, R. 18, and pre-emption right to adjacent quarter section may be purchased from Mr. Crookshank, as lay land for the Industrial School at Qu'Appelle, at a cost not to exceed six hundred dollars.\n\nWhen the bargain is completed we will notify the Department of Interior to remove the pre-emption quarter, and that we will relinquish Sec. 6, Tp. 22, Range 18.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy of the Sup't General of Indian Affairs.\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6330, file 660-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that it is time steps should be taken to fence in our hay lands in order to protect them against roaming bands of cattle and horses, as otherwise the land recently purchased for hay purposes would be valueless.\n\nLast year we had to go 15 miles and over to procure hay for want of a fence round our hay lands and we have had to purchase 40 tons as well. We have now three quarter sections of hay land either belonging to the school or purchased for it. To fence in this land with two wires and willow posts 3600 of the latter would be required, at 2 cents each and about 3600 lbs of wire with staples.\n\nThe quarter sections are the N.W.\u00bc of 22, 21, 12 reserved two years ago and the N.W.\u00bc of 34, 21, 12; the N.E.\u00bc lately bought from Mr. Crabbe and the N.W.\u00bc reserved.\n\nIndian Commissioner\n\nRegina\nboth these pieces of land lie in the same township as the school and are therefore at a convenient distance and if properly fenced will I hope yield a sufficient quantity of hay.\n\nThe willow pickets at 2 cents each will be exceedingly cheap, as they are very scarce in this vicinity; but the half breeds are in such destitution now that I can procure them at that price. I beg to be authorized to purchase the willow pickets while I can procure them at the above price and so as to have the fencing done before the hay can be destroyed.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n(Signed) J.

This is done\nin this case. I have asked what approximate size an\nto the quantity of willow poles are required, and\nas to the opportunity of purchasing the former at a very\ncheap rate; and this material may therefore be purchased\nat a cost of about $250.00 which the Department\nreckons ought to be sufficient for the purpose, but the\nDepartment may not be able to make payment therefor until\nafter the 1st July next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy of the Supr Genl.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRegina,\nN.W.T.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6330, file 660-9, part 1)\nMr. Sworder, the clerk here, owns S.W. 1/4\n28,21/I3 W/2 three miles from here and half a\nmile from N.W. 1/4 22,21,I3,W/2 which was reserved\nfor hay purposes at the same time as 6,22,I2 W/2\nbut which we have now fenced in and cultivate.\n\nThere are some good hay sloughs on Mr. Sworder's\nland and the soil is of first class quality,\nlast year the school cut over 25 loads of hay\nthere though cattle had been grazing on it part of\nthe summer.\n\nMr. Sworder would exchange his quarter section\nfor either the north half or the east half of 6,22,I2.\nthis would be advantageous to the school as the land\nwould be close at hand, could be fenced and fire\nguarded, and after the hay was cut used as a pasture\nour young stock\u2014there are some acres of bush growing on the\nquarter section and about 40 acres have been under\ncultivation.\n\nI would recommend the exchange to your fa-\nvourable consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) J.Hugenard\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo re section 6-22-12, W 2 M, and to enclose copy of a letter from the Rev. Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School in this respect. It would seem that for various reasons the above land is unsuitable for the school's purposes whilst the suggested exchange would be decidedly advantageous. If it can be arranged at all I would recommend that the exchange be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 14th ultimo, No. 247 COI, I beg to state that the Section therein referred to, (6 - 22 - 12 - W.2 M.) has not been used by this Department for about six years. Prairie fires destroyed the bush, which retained the moisture that was required to grow hay in that district.\n\nIt appears that the supply of hay which the Indian Agent has been obtaining by taking out permits for hay land situated about twenty miles North of the Qu'Appelle Indian Industrial School, is being rapidly cut off by the closer settlement in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe Section above mentioned is stated to consist of sand and gravel ridges, and the grass is very scanty. The soil is too light also to be of other use to the School.\n\nThe owner of the S.W.\u00bc - 28 - 21 - 13 - W.2 M. offers this Quarter Section, which is reported to have some good hay sloughs, and that the soil is of first rate quality, in exchange for the N.\u00bd or the N.\u00bd of the above mentioned Section. It is considered that the exchange would be advantageous to the School, and is recommended by the Indian Commissioner and the local Indian Agent. I shall feel obliged if you will kindly inform me whether the exchange can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.O. Keyes, Esq.\nSecretary,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am pressing the matter and hope to be able to give a satisfactory answer in a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Industrial School\nat Qu'Appelle, N.W.T.\n\nJanuary 27th, 1903.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.68/42 of 24th instant, and in reply beg to say that I have deferred answering your letter No.68/42 of 24th December 1902, regarding section 6.22.12 W 2 N, with the intention of looking over the land in the Spring and seeing if it would warrant cultivating for the purpose of sowing brome grass and fencing for a pasture for our young stock and fallow cows. The great draw-back for this purpose is its lack of water, sandy and hilly character and distance from the school.\n\nI am still strongly in favour of securing the S.W.\u00bc 28.21.13 W 2 N referred to in my letter No.6793 of November 18th, 1902; it is the only piece of land not being farmed in the district and its situation makes it very convenient for the school. Mr. Sworder has refused $6.00 cash, an acre, for this land, but, as mentioned in my former letter, is still willing to exchange his quarter for a half section of 6.22.12 W 2, and I would suggest that the Indian Department purchases this half section from the Department of the Interior and afterwards completes the exchange with Mr. Sworder.\n\nThis quarter section 28.21.13 with the improvements we would make on it would be a valuable asset for the Department; and as we have so many pupils on our roll only drawing half the grant there should be a considerable amount of money appropriated for this school that will remain unexpended at the end of the year, part of which perhaps could be used in this direction.\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\nA good supply of milk is an important item in the diet of so many children; to obtain this it is necessary to keep quite a number of milch cows and to keep the cows we must have grazing land, hay land and land for root crops. The increased farming operations in the district render it impossible to let our cattle range at large in the summer, and have cut off our former hay supply, necessitating our growing fodder of some kind for winter feeding in future.\n\nThe land we own in the immediate vicinity of the school is light, slopes to the south and embraces the hills facing the south so that after July, in a season like last year, everything gets scorched up and there is very little pasturage; in consequence we have to rely on land lying further back from the valley for farming operations, pasture, fodder, supply, etc.; and as mixed farming is the occupation most of the pupils will follow in after life it is most important that facilities for successfully carrying it on at the school are secured while available.\n\nIn the event of the Indian Department not being able to secure other land more suitable I would advise retaining the whole of Section 6.22.12 W 2 N, at any rate for another year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) J. Hugonard.\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo re section 6-22-12 W 2 M, I beg to enclose copy of a letter from the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School on the subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 12th Feb., 1905.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 17th ult., No. 247001, I beg to inform you that in accordance with the recommendation of the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Indian Industrial school it has been decided that the whole of section 6-28-13-W.3.N. should be retained by this Department at least for another year. The Principal is desirous of examining the land carefully in the spring in order to see if it will warrant being cultivated for the purpose of sowing bromo grass and fencing it for stock. The great drawback for this purpose appears to be its lack of water, its sandy and hilly character and distance from the school.\n\nThe Principal still strongly urges the exchange of the north half or the east half of the said section for the southwest quarter -28-21-15-W.3.N., as this quarter section is very suitable for the purposes of the school. He states that the present owner has refused $6.00 an acre for this land. I shall feel obliged if you will kindly reconsider this matter, and inform me if there is any manner in which the exchange may be effected.\n\nP.G.

This notice has not been given, consequently the said section 6 is still reserved for this Department.\n\nIndian Affairs.

See Ref. 139216.\nThe Deputy Supt. General,-\n\nAt the request of this Department in 1891, Sec. 22-13-W.2 M. was reserved for hay purposes for the use of the Qu'Appelle Industrial school.\n\nIn 1894 the Northeast quarter of Sec. 34-21-13-W.2 M. was purchased from Mr. Crosbie together with his pre-emption right to the Northwest quarter of the same section.\n\nAt the time the said purchase was made it was intended to notify the Department of the Interior that the above mentioned section 6 was to be relinquished. This notice, however, was not given and consequently the said section is still reserved for the use of this Department.\n\nIn October of last year the Department of the Interior requested to be informed whether the said section 6-22-12-W.2 M., was still required as a reservation for hay purposes for the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner at Regina was asked to state whether the said section was still required. In reply he forwarded a letter from the Rev. H. Hugonard, Principal of the School stating that the said section was too distant from the school, and not suitable for growing hay. He strongly recommended that an exchange of half of the said section be made for a quarter section which he represented to be better land, and which was situated much nearer to the School.\n\nThe Department of the Interior would not entertain a proposal to exchange a half section for a quarter section.\nOn again referring the matter to the Indian Commissioner, the Principal again urged the exchange above referred to, and if this were not possible then he wished that the said section should be retained by this Department at least for another year to afford him an opportunity of ascertaining whether he could make any good use of the land in connection with the school.\n\nThe owner of the quarter section referred to has refused $6. per acre for it, but is willing to accept as stated half of the said section 6 in exchange. The price set upon the said section 6 by the Department of the Interior is $5. per acre, and the Accountant has informed me that there are funds available to purchase the said half section in case the Department should desire to acquire it, in order to give it in exchange for the quarter section.\n\nThe lands occupied by the Industrial School are as follows:\n\n- The main reserve where the buildings are located ........................................... 889.30 acres.\n- Reserved by the Department of the Interior in 1891, Sec. 6-23-13 and Northwest quarter Sec. 23-21-13- W. 2 M. .................................................. 569.20 acres\n- Purchased from Mr. Crosbie in 1894, 160. acres\n\nHis pre-emption right to the adjacent quarter section ........................................... 160.00 acres.\n\nThe school has, therefore, in the home farm as stated 889.30, and apart from the said section 6, 480 acres for hay purposes. Incidentally I may say that the 480 acres are well fenced. The total area of land, therefore, which the school has control of is 1369 3/10 acres, which apparently should be a very reasonable area for the purposes of the school.\nI beg to submit whether steps are to be taken to make the purchase above referred to of the East half of Sec. 6-21-13-W. 2 M., in order that the said half section may be given in exchange (to Mr. Sworder, the clerk of the School) for the Southwest quarter Sec. 28-21-13-W. 2 M. The exchange is recommended by the Hon. Mr. Laird.\n\nIn this connection I beg to draw attention to the fact that the Department has only the pre-emption right to the Northwest quarter of Sec. 34-21-13-W. 2 M., and has held it since 1894. I think it would be well to communicate with the Department of the Interior to ascertain whether this quarter section should be set apart in a more definite manner by purchase or otherwise.\n\nSam Bray\n\nChief Surveyor.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received your letter dated Nov. 17th, 1853.

For the purpose of having the permanent stone fence now under construction in the right place and of protecting the growing timber in the ravines, and of having a correct statement of the number of acres of land belonging to the school, for the Annual report I would ask that a plan copy of the plan of this survey be sent here as soon as possible, with details as to number of acres.\n\nI believe we have been considerably overstating the number of acres we actually own, but the corner posts are in the lake or ravines so no one but a surveyor can be exact.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nNon-obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. Hugonard,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle, Assa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 11th July last, covering statement of lands which appear to be held for the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, affirming that the Department has no title to the Northwest quarter of Sec. 34, Township 21, Range 13, West of the 2nd Meridian, and setting forth that the School appears to have a liberal allowance of land without the said quarter section and also Sec. 6-22-12 W.2nd.M., I may say that I have communicated with the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, and he states that it would be a great loss to the institution to be deprived of the use of the N.W. 1/4 of Sec. 34, T.21, R.13, W.2nd.P.M., because they have improvements thereon and crop the same; but that as Sec.6, T.22, R.12, W.2nd.M. will not produce hay and is not worth fencing in for pasture, he recommends that it be conveyed back to the Department of the Interior.\n\nI approve of these requests being granted.\n\nThough the School by this arrangement will still have the use of 1369-3 acres, yet as the portion of this area which runs over the ascending bank of the river is worthless for cultivation.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ncultivation, scarcely more than half of the acreage held counts for anything except scant pasturage.\n\nThe School is very short of hay land, and for this reason the Principal strongly urges that the Department purchase S. W. 1/4 of Sec.28, T.21, A. 13, W. 2nd. M., which can be had now for the reasonable price of $7.50 per acre, and is near the School. Adding this quarter section to the School property would be a great benefit to the institution; and if the Department authorizes me to do so, I will place $1200.00 in the next estimates for the purchase.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, 2nd Oct., 1905.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 9th June last, No. 71863, I beg to inform you that a report has been received from the Hon. David Laird, Indian Commissioner at Winnipeg, relating to the lands held by the St'Appellee Indian Industrial School.\n\nThe Commissioner states that it would be a great loss to the Institution to be deprived of the use of the Northwest quarter of Section 45, Township 31, Range 15, West of the 2nd Meridian, because they have improvements thereon and crops the same. I have, therefore, to ask you to be good enough to have the said quarter section set apart for this Department to be used in connection with the said Institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Mupt. General of Indian Affairs.\n\nP.G. Keyes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nMemo.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 1st Oct., 1903.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General,\n\nI beg to submit herewith two drafts of letters relating to part of the lands dealt with by the Hon. D. Laird in his letter of the 23rd ult.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph in his said letter, I beg to state that there was correspondence with the Department of the Interior regarding the Southwest quarter of Section 28, Township 21, Range 12, West of the 2nd Meridian, therein referred to, in which an effort was made to obtain the said quarter section in exchange for half of Sec. 6-22-12 W. of the 2nd M., the subject of one of the letters hereunder to the Department of the Interior.\n\nThe exchange was positively refused by the Department of the Interior.\n\nThe Commissioner now recommends the purchase of the said quarter section to be held for the use of the school, and that he be allowed to place the sum of $1,200. in next year's estimates to recover the cost.\n\nThe question appears to be one of policy for the decision of the Department. It may be noted, however, that in view of the large area of land held by the school, it might be reasonable for the school to give up an equal area of land, which the Commissioner states is of very little use to it.\n\nPlease see memorandum of the 31st March last.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa, 3rd Oct., 1905.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the last paragraph of your letter of the 3rd ult., No. 82/42, in which you state that the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School strongly urges that the Department purchase the Southwest quarter of Section 28, Township 21, Range 18, west of the 2nd Meridian, and you suggest that $1,200 be placed in the next Estimates to cover the cost of the purchase, I have to ask you to be good enough to have a special investigation made, and to furnish a full report on the matter. It is considered that, in view of the fact of the school having already a large area of land, any proposed purchase of an addition thereto should have careful consideration, before placing an item in the Estimates.\n\nIt would perhaps be well in connection with the investigation to look into the advisability of relinquishing a portion of the land, which you state is worthless for cultivation, in exchange for the quarter section of better land desired by the Principal.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 6575/1A of September 25th also of the plan of school lands referred to therein. As regards the location of section 6.22.13 from the school the plan is misleading as the correction surveys and different system of road allowances between ranges 21 and 22 make section 6.22.13 one and a half miles further north and half a mile further west than is shown on plan.\n\nSection NW 34.21.13 from Crooks' prairie is not marked as reserved for the school, this is our best piece of land, is fenced, has 80 acres under cultivation and in consequence of careful fire guarding has wood and water on it.\n\nSection 6.22.13 is of no practical use to me and I have recommended its relinquishment and the purchase of SW 23.21.13.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nas this land is of good quality more convenient to the school lying one mile south and half a mile west of Crowe's (34-21-13) and north of though half a mile west of NW 4-21-13 Reserve for hay purposes.\n\nWith the advent of the railway which I believe goes through the south part of 6-22-17 it will be impossible for us to secure hay and wheat from the north and it will be impossible for us to rent lands we have been accustomed to use for hay purposes and for wheat as they will now be occupied.\n\nI would therefore urge the necessity of securing more land while it can be obtained cheaply, as we require it for wheat raising and fodder; the latter being especially necessary in order to keep up our band of milk cows, milk being such an important article in the dietary of so many young children.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may add that the Agent encloses a copy of a letter from the Reverend Father Hugonard, and the latter states that they are willing to abandon the said land.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo relative to Section 6, Twp. 22, Rge. 12 West of 2nd Meridian, which was reserved for the Qu'Appelle Industrial school; and in reply I beg to say that as this section is no longer needed by the school the Department will withdraw its claim to it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of the Interior\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit to your favorable consideration the following report respecting the farm connected with this school.\n\nTowards the year 1890, the Department bought for this school the north-east quarter of section 34 township 21 range 13 and reserved also for us, the north-west quarter, making a half section viz the north-half of section 34 township 21 range 13. This half section is over five miles from the school and was intended chiefly for hay land.\n\nSince that time, the farming has become more important and //is now the principal industrial training for the eldest pupils. We are endeavouring to carry out the intentions of the Department by farming more extensively than before and teaching it to the boys. Having not enough of cultivable land, we had to farm on the section adjoining the school, on the above mentioned half section what is fit for it.\n\nBut the distance makes it almost impossible to farm properly and successfully. It is too far to go there every day. To go there for the week means the loss of half a day to go and half a day to come back. It takes one to do the cooking. The boys working there cannot be overseen nor trained as easily as if it was near. The least brake, the wanting of a bolt, or grain, or hay, or provision, or clothing necessitates a trip of ten miles to get it.\n\nIt is therefore very desirable that the farm should be nearer. A section 15 township 21 range 13 of land situated half a mile from school, and adjoining on two side, the lands on which the school is built, as per attached sketch is now for sale and could be almost exchanged with the half section above referred to.\n\nThis section 15 township 21 range 13 is the only one whose location is suitable for this school and it would be regrettable\nto miss the opportunity of securing it at a reasonable figure.\n\nThis section can be obtained for $16.00 an acre or $10240.00 and the half section above referred to could bring $30.00 to the acre in a few years, being only two miles from the Patrick station and having 150 acres cultivated on it. At the present time it would bring no more than $20.00 to the acre, and we need it until the section 15 will be sufficiently cultivated.\n\nAs it would be necessary to secure the section 15 now, otherwise it will be sold to others, and as the half section 34 is still needed and could not yet bring its full value, I would ask the Department to advance five thousand one hundred and twenty dollars ($5120.00) to pay half of the section 15, or the whole sum $10240.00 which could be returned in full or nearly when the half section would be sold. If only a part is paid now, interest will have to be paid for the balance.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 2, 1907.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Rev. Father Hugonard asks the Department to secure Section 15, Township 21, Range 13, for farming purposes in connection with the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, as their farming land, which is situated in Section 36, Township 21, Range 13, is too far from the school to be properly worked; it is over five miles distant, while the Section he wishes to acquire is only half a mile from the School.\n\nBefore dealing with this matter I think that a report should be had from Mr. Inspector Graham and that Rev. Father Hugonard should be told to communicate with him on the subject.\n\nWhile the School has a large tract of land in its immediate neighbourhood, it is not fitted for farming purposes and the present farming lands are much too far to be of any practical value for properly teaching agriculture.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was the intention of the Principal to pay this amount out of school funds, but I would recommend that this land be purchased by the Department. The Principal erected this building on Mission property as he was much pressed for room, and there is only a narrow lane dividing it from the Government property.\n\nWhen the improvements asked for are completed the Department will have two first class houses.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This property was purchased from the Roman Catholic mission. In addition to this they have portions of sections 14, 10, and the west half of sec. 2, comprising about 500 acres, all within a short distance of the school, while the farming lands are situated some five miles to the northwest and contain 480 acres.\n\nThere would be room on the land on which the school buildings are erected for houses for the employees, but Mr. Ogilvie, who was for a considerable time at Qu'Appelle, tells me that the hospital building which it is proposed to convert into dwelling houses is easily worth $2,000 and is just across the road from the school property. If we buy the land for $200 it would include the buildings, and with the proposed alterations we would have a property worth at least $3,000, and it would cost that sum to put up separate cottages on the school property. This being the case I think the Department would be quite justified in buying the land outright.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(R3 10, Volume 6330, file 660-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to my Letter of April 24th 1907 No 7524 and to your Letter No 116578/22 of 7th May 1907 re the exchange of our Farm situated five miles away.\n\nThe experience of every year proves more and more that it is impossible to cultivate at that distance without loss to the school and in the manner required for the proper teaching of the pupils in farming.\n\nWhat I propose amounts to an exchange although, at the present time, it will require the purchase of a farm conveniently situated but as our land is the same size and about the same value, the sum required to purchase could be entirely returned to the Department as soon as the far away school land would be sold.\n\nThe proposed Farm to purchase is the West half of 23, 21, 13 which is two miles from the school while our farm is the North half of 34, 21, 13 five miles from the school. The proposed farm 23 is all fenced and has a good house and stable on it, which are required for us, and has about 260 acres cultivated. It contains 320 acres and the price asked is $25.00 per acre including all improvements making $8000.00 for the farm.\n\nOur land or half of 34 contains the same number of acres and is, just now, two miles nearer a station. It also has a building and 125 acres under cultivation therefore it can be sold for the same amount as the proposed farm would cost but at present there is no demand for land and it is not possible to exchange land for land. If the proposed land is not bought now there will not be another farm suitable and the school will remain crippled for convenient farming land which is very important for this institution.\nThe land proposed last year could not now be purchased at any price. I hope the Department will consider favorably my demand and advance the money which will be returned as soon as the Department can sell our present farm and not now lose the opportunity which chance will not likely occur again. I may refer you for further information to Mr Inspector McKenna and Mr Inspector Graham.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nsir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, December 7th, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in reference to the exchange of farm lands connected with the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, and in reply I beg to say that this matter will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. Bugonard,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\nMEMO:\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nWith reference to the matter of exchanging 320 acres of farm land at present used as part of the farm at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School for 320 acres of improved land three miles nearer the Institution, I would point out that this Institution is very much handicapped in having a large part of its farming lands situated five miles from the school. There is difficulty in giving proper supervision to the boys while at work. The distance travelled night and morning is too great and little more than a good half day's work can be put in on the land.\n\nThere is a farm of 320 acres situated two miles from the school, owned by one, D. McDonald, which would be quite suitable for school farm purposes. I understand Mr. McDonald offers to sell this land at $25.00 per acre. The farm contains 320 acres of which 260 acres is under cultivation; there is also a good frame dwelling and a stable on the farm, which can be used to good advantage should the Department decide to buy the farm.\n\nThe 320 acres at present used as a farm might bring $12.00 if offered for sale at the present time, but will be more valuable later on. If the Department were to buy Mr. McDonald's farm, say at $22.00 an acre it would not be long before it could recoup itself from the proceeds of sale of the present farm, and by this arrangement we would have a much more satisfactory arrangement at the school.\n\nOttawa, 28th Jan'y, 1910.\n\nInsp.of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nReferring to my letter No 7732 of Dec 4th, 09 and to yours of Dec 7th, 09 No 116575/22 re securing half section of 23, 21, 13 in exchange for half section 34, 21, 13 six miles distant, I beg to inform you that said property is being offered for sale and unless secured within a short time it will not be available later.\n\nThe non purchase of this land will leave the school crippled in its most important branch.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nI think it highly desirable to arrange for the purchase of this land for the Qu'Appelle School. Mr. Graham deals with the question in his memorandum of the 26th of January, and there is also a letter from Father Hugonard dated the 4th of December upon the subject. We could by-and-by sell the present farm which is so inconveniently situated. Sufficient money is available from the present appropriations to make the purchase. You will see from what Father Hugonard says in his last letter that there is some urgency in the matter.\n\nChief Accountant.\nOttawa, February 23rd, 1910.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 14th instant and previous correspondence in reference to the purchase of 320 acres of improved land near the Qu'Appelle Industrial School and the sale of the half section situated at some distance from the school, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to carry out this arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. Hugonard, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\nIndian Industrial School\n\nat Lebret - Sask.\n\nJan 1916\n\n21st\n\nLetter No 8306.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Affairs,\nBalcarres - Sask.\n\nSir:\n\nAs you have inspected our farm last Fall and are acquainted with the farming conditions of this school, I beg to submit for your recommendation to the Department the following proposition\u2014\n\nA good quarter section adjoining our farm just at the top of the hill from the valley viz the N.W.\u00bc of section 10 Tp 21 Range 13 is to be sold by public auction on Feb 10th next. The said quarter is part of the same section as our school farm, as per attached sketch. There are about 40 acres of cultivated land in this quarter and about 25 acres more could be worked and the rest of hills and bluffs, the quarter having 150 acres.\n\nThis land is more valuable for the school than for any one else on account of its location adjoining our farm. It is land which produces a sure crop each year, the proximity of the valley being a protection against frost. Although there is a considerable area of land suitable for the school, the hills of the coulee and valley, which are 325 ft high, make the greatest part suitable for pasture only. Owing to these and large bluffs we have no farm whatever is arable on our hay-land 5\u00bd miles away, the distance makes farming difficult and unprofitable.\n\nWhen teams have to walk 11 miles a day to work on such farm it is more than half a days work. This hay-land is what we call \"crosbie Farm\", it is so far away that it is impossible to properly cultivate the land and consequently less clean than any other land besides it is exposed to fire and depredations.\n\nAlthough we have made use of all arable land we never yet could have more than 115 acres of wheat which is not enough to keep us in flour.\n\nThe farming is the most important training we can give to our pupils and the quarter in question can easily be well cultivated and a good instruction for the boys.\n\nThe occasion to procure such a suitable quarter section is unique and no land around could be found better located.\n\nThe price of the land cannot be high as the location is not suitable for any one else and may be bought. The price will not be above $3000.00 but should be only $2000.00.\n\nThe purchase of this land is so important for the school that I feel confident that you will realize the fact and recommend same to the Department.\n\nWhen there will be a sale for a \u00bc of the \"crosbie farm\" we would have no objection to have it sold and refund the Department for the money required now to buy the N.W.\u00bc of 10.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6330, file 660-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Rev. Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial school has written to me in regard to a quarter section that adjoins the school land, which is to be sold by public auction on Feb. 10th, 1916.\n\nI may say that the school authorities have been asking for additional farm land for a long time and it looks as if an opportunity had now arrived by which they can procure what is wanted. I see the Principal is of the opinion that the land will sell at a low figure.\n\nThe letter of Father Hugonnard's which is attached will give you additional information regarding the matter. About two-thirds of the land now belonging to the school is useless for farming owing to bush-hillsides and sloughs. I should like to see the quarter in question purchased.\n\nA rough sketch of the school lands is herewith enclosed also the quarter marked in red, which is to be sold.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6330, file 660-9, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Inspector Graham forwards a letter addressed to him by the Rev. Father Hugonard, Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, in which he states that a quarter section adjoining the land on which the school is situated will be sold by public auction on the 10th proximo and he encloses a sketch plan which shows the exact situation of this section.\n\nThe Qu'Appelle School has a deficit of about $10,000.00 and, even if this were wiped out, Father Hugonard claims that the present per capita grant is not sufficient to meet expenses. They have a half section of land nearly six miles from the school, which is too far away to be satisfactorily worked. If they had the quarter section applied for they would be in a much better position.\n\nSix years ago it was proposed to purchase a half section nearer the school and partly pay for it out of the proceeds of the sale of the half section above referred.\nreferred to. This purchase was recommended by you, as you will see by your memorandum of the 18th of February, 1910, turned out hereunder. However, there were no funds available for this purpose and the purchase was not consummated.\n\nFather Hugard thinks that the quarter section which to be put up for sale will not realize more than $3,000.00, in fact he thinks it might be purchased for $2,000.00, as there is not likely to be much competition at the present time for this land. If funds could be provided it seems to me that it would be desirable to make this purchase.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

My right of way survey was made connecting with the boundary line as shown on the plans sent you and of course all necessary ties were made to the lots of Plan S3784 which will all be shown on the plan of right of way now in course of preparation and on the plan of resurvey of part of the Ellisboro Long Lake Trail which is in course of being submitted to the Department of Highways. The point to be decided is whether the line as defined on my plan can be regarded as the original line of division between these properties, notwithstanding that the bearings and lengths of the several courses do not agree with the original survey as evidenced by the official township plan and the description in the Oblate Fathers' title.\n\nOn first discussing these discrepancies, I am rather inclined to the opinion that the iron posts found by me represented a survey of this boundary made without reference to the survey shown on the township plan but on studying the question further am now disposed to think that the iron posts were put in to replace the wooden posts of the original survey while the wooden posts were still in evidence and that the differences in lengths and bearings are due to errors in the original survey, the whole survey being over very difficult ground.\n\nI referred to this question to the Surveyor General in August last who in reply stated that this line was established in 1885 by C.C. Du Berger D.L.S., as shown on the official township plan dated Sept. 20th 1890 and that no further surveys affecting this line have been made under instructions from his office. Commenting upon the difference in lengths and bearings, the Surveyor General stated \"Discrepancies such as you find between the township plan and the monuments as they are on the ground are not uncommon in surveys as far back as 1885.\"\nAs far as my survey is affected, I required only the portion of this line between the posts which I have designated Nos. 5 and 6 on the plan. Post No. 6 was readily found as it is referred to in Plan S.3794 and was well known to many of the people living at Lebret. A Mr. Chisholm who is employed at the Mission knew of the post shown on plan S 3794 on the west boundary of Lot 1 having frequently seen it before the ground at this point was cut away in grading a road running north from the Fort Ellice Trail at this point. This is the post shown on my plan as No. 5 and to reestablish its position, I relocated the S.W. corner of lot 1 from original posts found on the ground, joined that point with post No. 6 and produced the line so obtained northerly, a sufficient distance to give 8.82 chains between posts 5 and 6. In connection with the resurvey of the land I also required to know the direction of the next course of the boundary north of post 5 and being unable to find anyone at the time who knew of any posts farther up the coulie, I decided the quickest way to determine whether any such posts existed was to retrace the west and north boundary of section 11 and from that retracement to reproduce the line from the township plan southerly from the north boundary of section 11. In doing so, I found the posts marked 1, 2, 3, and 4 and later from information brought down by Mr. Loucks we located the iron post shown at a short distance (984 ft) southerly from No. 4. Post No. 4 was then joined by a straight line with Post No. 5 as reestablished.\n\nSouth of post No. 6 towards the lake, I ran the next course on the bearing and for the distance given on the township plan but found nothing. From the end of that course I ran out the next course on the bearing S43\u00b035'W and at 5.55 chains reached the lake shore. The Mr. Chisholm referred to above mentioned to me in this connection that the lake had encroached on the shore at this point from time to time and that the fence had been moved back on several occasions. This may account for the fact that the length of this course to the shore as it existed last August is considerably short of the length of this course as given on the Township plan.\n\nThis portion of the boundary is however shown on plan B.I.3065 made in recent years by Mr. W.R. Reilley, S.L.S. but as no evidence of Mr. Reilley's survey was found on the ground I decided not to make any reestablishment south of post No. 6. I can however furnish connections between the portion of the boundary between posts 5 and 6 and the lots of the subdivision shown on plan S3794 if desired.\nIt seems to me that if these discrepancies were brought to the attention of the department of Indian Affairs and the Oblate Fathers' that they would readily consent to have the necessary order made correcting the titles affected. I discussed the question with the Secretary of the Industrial School and the Parish Priest at the mission and both gentlemen were reasonably certain that no objection to the course would be raised by those in authority.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEdgar C. Brown.\nLand Surveyor.\nWinnipeg, Man. March 24th 1919.\n\nS.H. Phillips Esq.,\nActing Chief Surveyor,\nRegina, Sask\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will recall our discussion last August regarding the boundary line between the Industrial School Grant and the property of the Oblate Fathers in sections 2 and 11 tp. 21 range 13 west of the second meridian at Lebret.\n\nI explained to you at that time that in retracing this division line, I found certain iron posts evidently intended to define this limit instead of wooden posts as shown on the township plan and as mentioned in the certificate of title to the Oblate Fathers' property. These iron posts were not at the points where the wooden posts should have been according to the township plan. The Dept. of the Interior has no record of any survey of this limit on which iron posts were used and I have been unable to ascertain on what authority the iron posts were planted. The posts themselves are of an unusual type being solid cylindrical bars about 3 feet long with a foot plate of iron about four inches by six inches rivetted to the lower end to prevent removal. As nearly as I have been able to ascertain they were put in by A.W. Ponton D.L.S., about the year 1890, Mr. Ponton at that time being surveyor for the Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nThese posts have been accepted as defining the boundary for so long that in my opinion it would be advisable to have the records amended so as to give them proper legal standing, for any attempt to reestablish on the ground the boundary as shown on the township plan and as described in the Oblate Father's certificate of title would lead to confusion as such a reestablishment would place the division line between the properties a considerable distance to the east of the line as at present defined and at the south end would encroach upon the lots shown on Reg'd. plan S.3794.\nI am sending you a duplicate tracing which I have prepared showing my retracement of this boundary and am satisfied to have you make such use of this plan or any other information regarding this boundary that I may have in my possession, as you see fit.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEdgar C. Brown,\nLand Surveyor.\n\nP.S.\n\nField Inspector Loucks went over this boundary with me on the ground last August and I believe he is also of the opinion that it would be preferable to adjust the titles and records to conform to the boundary as now posted rather than to attempt to resurvey the boundary to fit the titles.\n\nE.C.B.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\n\nSURVEYS BRANCH OF THE LAND TITLES OFFICES\n\nADDRESS YOUR REPLY TO\n\"CHIEF SURVEYOR,\" SURVEYS BRANCH,\nDEPT.

Brown, S.L.S., the G.T.P. Surveyor who has recently been making a resurvey of the company's right of way across the above mentioned lands.\n\nFrom these letters you will notice that Mr. Brown finds iron posts of a substantial nature at the various points of deflection on the above mentioned boundary whereas the original survey of this line was made with wooden posts according to the records of Mr. C. C. Du Berger D.L.S., as shown on the official township plan.\n\nWhat I would like to know is if your department has any knowledge of or has ever authorized a resurvey or retracement of this line. If so and you have any satisfactory evidence that the iron posts found by Mr. Brown are the posts planted in such authorized resurvey or retracement, it would appear that the present established line could be accepted and whatever adjustment of the records is deemed necessary could be made in accordance with the retracement survey made by Mr. Brown. I am also enclosing blue print from Mr. Brown's plan on which I have noted in red the measurements as shown on the township plan.

A.W. Ponton, D.L.C., was instructed to make the survey during winter of 1893-94.\n\n2. Survey was not made during the winter on account of snow and the fact that re-survey was necessary.\n\n3. The blue print forwarded in March 1895 indicates that a re-survey was made as well as a survey of that parcel tinted red.\n\n4. The title conveying said parcel indicates that Iron Posts were planted.\n\nAs A.W. Ponton was the surveyor usually employed by Assistant Commissioner at that time and as he was originally instructed to make the survey, it is presumed that sometime between winter 1893-94 and April 1895, he made the survey indicated by the blue print in question although the Department is not in possession of any signed plan or field notes.\n\nThe above information and that conveyed in our letter of 25th ult., is all the information that can be supplied. Certified copies of correspondence on file substantiating points indicated above can be supplied if required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ponton D.L.S. made a resurvey of the original Boundary line when surveying the addition to the school lands, and I do not anticipate that certified copies of the correspondence will be required in connection with a Petition for the amendment of the records on file in the Land Titles Office.\n\nThanking you for information supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Surveyor.\nSept. 4, 1919.\n\nRev'd Father Nigman,\nOblate Fathers,\nSt. Boniface, Winnipeg.\n\nSir:\n\nRe Boundary Line between Industrial School Grant and Oblate Fathers' Property, Sec's 8 and 11, Tn. 21, R. 13, West End Dist., at Lebret, Sask.\n\nDuring the season of 1918 Mr. H. C. Brown, S.L.S., the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company's Land Surveyor, while resurveying this Company's line from Melville to Regina found it necessary to re-establish the boundary line between the Industrial School property and the Oblate Father's property at Lebret.\n\nAs the survey monument on this line immediately to the North of the right of way had been lost, probably due to the road being graded at this point, Mr. Brown made a retracement of the boundary line from the extreme limit of Section 11 to the North shore of the lake. In making this retracement he found monuments consisting of iron bars of an unusual shape, being from 3 to 4 feet in length with a foot plate of iron about 4 inches by 6 inches rivetted to the lower end to prevent removal. The township plan shows that wooden posts were originally located at these points, and the Certificates of Title refer to these wooden posts and to the measurements as shown on the Township Plan. A thorough enquiry was made from the old time residents at Lebret and from the interested parties at this place, as well as from the Surveyor General and the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa but no authentic record of the survey with iron posts could be found.\n\nAll parties consulted however, seemed in agreement as to the time and manner in which this survey was made, viz:-\n\nIn 1890 by J. W. Ponton, D.L.S., then in the employ of the Dept. of Indian Affairs. As the original survey of the line was made in 1885 it is quite probable that Mr. Ponton found the old wooden posts at that time, but he received his instructions from Regina, and the records of such instructions or of his survey are somewhat vague at the present time at Ottawa. Personally, I am of the opinion that from the evidence submitted the above noted conclusions are reliable, and the iron posts found should be accepted as defining the boundary line. Moreover, these posts have been accepted as such by the various owners and residents of this vicinity for a good many years, and while the retracement survey joining these posts disagrees somewhat from the measurements shown on the township plan it seems desirable that the records based on same should be amended to agree with the present position of the iron posts.\n\nMr. Brown made a thorough investigation of this matter and\nI am prepared to accept his re-establishment of this line for the purpose of tying in his right of way and road survey. In making the survey he retraced the East boundaries of Sections 3 and 10 from the lake Northwards and terminated his survey at Station 6 opposite the Industrial School. He made a careful search for monuments between this point and the lake but could find none.\n\nIt is now proposed to accept Mr. Brown's survey and this Department has agreed to extend his survey to the lake, together with such further additions as may seem necessary and file a plan showing the results of this survey. It is then proposed to have the Ministry of Titles issue an Order to the Registrar of the Aboriginal Land Titles Office, in which district the lands affected are situated, directing him to record all titles to the property on either side of the above mentioned boundary line, placing an endorsement on all such titles affected by this boundary, to the effect that the description referred to in such titles are to be interpreted according to the plan made by Mr. Brown R.L.S., acting in conjunction with this Department, this latter plan to be taken on condition that you, and the Minister of Indian Affairs give your consent to this procedure. Plans will of course be submitted to you and to the Minister of Indian Affairs for approval and signature before they are filed.\n\nAs stated above no changes whatever are to be made on the ground. The survey and plan are merely for the purpose of recording the true bearings and distances connecting the various monuments now in existence and which have been accepted. The missing monuments are to be restored in accordance with the data shown on the township plan.\n\nIn connection with the improvements affected, it is noted that the stone fence to the East of the Industrial School does not agree with the surveyed line. The L.P. at Station 6 is some distance South and East of the bend in the fence near this point. The fence between Station 5 and Station 6 crosses the survey line and is partly outside and partly inside the boundary line. From Station 5 to the lake the stone fence will fall back to the West of the line.\n\nEnclosing herewith a Blue Print showing the results of Mr. Brown's survey. In black are shown the proposed additions made by agreement from this Dept. In red I have indicated the measurements shown on the township plans and over which the survey was based. To reproduce the measurements shown on the township plans would result in the boundary line falling about 20 feet further East in the townsite so that it is apparent that the measurements are inaccurate, due no doubt to the time of year and the difficult nature of the ground over which the survey was made, the lines crossing deep ravines and high hills.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience and if the proposal outlined above is agreeable to you steps will be taken to have the survey and plans completed, when they are approved by you for your approval and signature.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Surveyor.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The quarter was secured years ago for hay purposes but in later years was cultivated and seeded. At the present time there is only a small part (about 25 acres) from which we get hay. Last year produced about 30 loads. About 100 acres is now plowed and the balance will be plowed this spring and sown for feed.\n\nWith the number of cattle and horses raised here it is essential that a large quantity of feed must be grown as it would be impossible to buy sufficient for use.\n\nThe school has neither too much arable or pasture land and to cancel this quarter would be depriving the school of a source of revenue which is so badly needed.\n\nThis quarter although not now producing hay does produce its equivalent in green feed which farmers are now obliged to raise in lieu of the hay formerly obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa - Ont.\nOttawa, 13th April 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, No. 43185, I have to inform you that the N.W. 1 Sec. 22, Tp. 31, R. 13, W.S.W., to which you refer is very much needed for the purposes of the Indian Industrial School at Lebret, Sask.\n\nIt is the best piece of farming land the school has. The land was originally secured for hay purposes but in later years has been cultivated and seeded. At the present time there is only a small part from which hay is produced. About one hundred acres is ploughed and the remainder of the quarter section will be ploughed this season.\n\nThe school requires a large amount of feed for its cattle and horses. This quarter section although now not producing hay is producing its equivalent in green feed, which farmers are now obliged to raise in lieu of the hay formerly obtained.\n\nIn view of the foregoing I have to request that the reservation of the said quarter section in favour of this Department be continued indefinitely.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.O.

The Department does not appear to have had any correspondence from the Province in connection with this matter and it is desired to know if any arrangements have been made with regard to compensation for the land included in this roadway.\n\nIf this roadway is not of sufficient value to the Industrial school lands to justify its transfer without compensation, would you be good enough to inform the Department what demands should be made on the Province before the said road is transferred to the Crown in the right of the Province.

I have taken the matter up with the Principal of the School however, and he informs me that the only roadway through Sections 11 and 14 is an old Mission trail which has been used every since the country was opened up, over forty years ago, and this trail is also used by the school members themselves going back and forth to their farms.\n\nThe Principal goes on to say that since receiving my letter he has had a communication from W.M. Thomson, Secretary-Treasurer of the Rural Municipality, in which he states that there is no intention of building another road but thinks that there may be a possibility of the Provincial Government trying to get title to this roadway.

Kindly note that these roads join in the S.E.4 Sec.11.\n\nKindly submit valuations in connection with these roads, as requested in letter of the 1st August last. The Provincial Government is requesting that title be transferred to His Majesty in the right of the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F.MacKenzie)\nFor Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nW.M.Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nReplying to your No.116575-22 of the 21st instant, I beg to state that a fair valuation of the land through which the roads referred to run, would be $15.00 per acre.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H.Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, 3rd November 1922\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, stating that the land required for a roadway through the Qu'Appelle Industrial School lands in Secs. 11 and 14, Tp. 22, R. 15, W. 2 M., is valued at $15.00 per acre, and to say that the Department requires further information.\n\nIn your letter of the 26th August last, you state that the Principal of the school informs you that the old Mission trail has been used ever since the country was opened up over 40 years ago and that this trail is also used by the school members themselves going back and forth to their farms. In view of this statement do you consider that the Municipality should be requested to pay for the road along or in lieu of this trail.\n\nWith regard to the new road leading off this trail, I shall be obliged if you will be good enough to inform me whether any extra charge should be imposed for fencing or severance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D. McLean)\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st ult., your reference file No. 116575-22, regarding roads in the Qu'Appelle Industrial School Lands, sections 11 and 14, township 21, range 13, west of the 2nd meridian, and note that our plan No. 5904 has been recorded in your Department under No. 1973, and that our plan No. 3318 has been recorded as No. 1985. I further note that the transfer of the portion of these roads lying within lands controlled by your Department is receiving your attention.\n\nWe will be pleased to receive copy in duplicate of Order-in-Council transferring same, at your convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.S. CARPENTER\nDeputy Minister of Highways\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, No.116575-22, with reference to the matter of handing over to the Provincial Government a roadway which passes through Sections 11 and 14 in Township 21, Range 17, West of the 2nd M.\n\nI find on making further enquiry that it is an old trail that runs through the above mentioned Sections that the Provincial Government wish to obtain title to. It appears that this trail was surveyed in 1893 by Mr. Brody, D.L.S., but the title was not registered at the time, and the Government now wish to clear the matter up and obtain title. Personally, I do not think that the Municipality or the Provincial Government should be requested to pay for the land which they wish to obtain for road purposes, but I do think that they should be called upon to fence the trail as it would not be fair to expect the Department to erect a fence along the trail on either side of the road.\n\nThe Highways Department are anxious to clear this matter up and obtain title as it is one of many that were surveyed some years ago but title was never registered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nPlan showing position of roads through school lands.\nOttawa, 1st December 1922\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the last ultimo, your file No.3111, I may say that your plan No.3513, which is recorded here under No.1985, joins a road which follows the North limit of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Regina-Melville Branch. This road replaces at this point a trail which was surveyed by T.D. Green in 1886. The original plan is of record in the Department of the Interior and we have a blueprint of record in this Department under No.1927.\n\nThis road as surveyed by Green appears to have been discarded and a new trail established as recorded under reg. plan B.Z.12094. We have no official record of the last mentioned plan. Kindly send us a plan on tracing cloth showing this road through the S.E.\u00bc Sec.10, N.E.\u00bc Sec.3 and the N.W.\u00bc Sec.2, Tp.21, R.13, W.2.M., as far as the East boundary of the Industrial School lands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.B.

I note that you desire both sides of the road through section 14, township 21, range 13, west of the 2nd meridian fenced, and in this connection I beg to advise you that according to the records of the Land Titles Office only the west half of the S.W.\u00bc of section 14 is unpatented.\n\nThe east half of the said quarter section stands in the name of the Oblate Fathers. This road was surveyed by the Department of Highways upon the request of the council of Rural Municipality No 187, and the said council is responsible for all compensation.\n\nAs it is just possible that all fencing that is required has been completed, I am today writing the Secretary Treasurer of the above mentioned municipality regarding this matter and upon receipt of his reply you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.S.

These are the boys referred to in Department No. 103-2-10, dated 7th May last, who were transferred, with the Department's permission, from the St. Mary's School on the Blood Reserve to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. I understood from the Department's letter referred to that, having been transferred, the boys would complete their education at the Qu'Appelle School, as no mention was made of the transfer being for a definite, limited period.\n\nWill you please advise me so that I may reply to the enquiry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 9th, 1929.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to Bob Eagle Bear and Mike Black Forehead.

While the Department will pay the cost of his transportation to Qu'Appelle, we are not prepared to consider paying the cost of an escort. No doubt, the school authorities can arrange for this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Muration.\n\nS. J. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nOttawa, February 15th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe December quarter return of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School states that the age of Stephen Benning, No. 740, is eleven years.\n\nAs you are aware, this boy was first admitted to the Kenora Residential School and the application form, which is dated January 29th, 1923, gave his age at that time as eight years. It would appear from this that he is now fourteen years of age and he should be so entered on future returns.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. G.

I may say that this is the reply I gave to Mr. John L. Fawcett, LL.B., of Macleod, Alberta, when writing recently to me asking what was the Department's intention; and I am advising you of this, as it is possible that Mr. Fawcett may now communicate direct with the Department who will know that I have had prior correspondence with him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The application form submitted at that time was signed by both parents and stated that she was a Roman Catholic. She remained in that school for four years and, apparently, was allowed home simply to receive medical treatment as she has never been officially discharged from the Qu'Appelle School.\n\nIt is not the Department's practice to transfer pupils from one residential which we maintain to another on religious grounds and it is considered, therefore, that, if this girl is medically fit to re-enter a residential school and it is desired that she receive additional education, she should return to the Qu'Appelle School.

Father Leonard, Principal of the Qu'Appelle School, has no objections, the Department approves of the transfer. I may say that I doubt if the Principal will agree to the transfer and I do not feel like asking him. It seems to me that this is a matter which the Department could decide. Mrs. Cook's request is a very reasonable one, in my opinion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 31, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 314-11B of the 25th instant, concerning the proposed transfer of Albert and Jimmie Cook from the Qu'Appelle to the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School. I note you do not feel like asking the concurrence of the Rev. Principal. In reply, I beg to state that the management of a school is undoubtedly interested in a pupil, who may have been recruited and who has been cared for and trained by members of the staff. To summarily discharge or transfer, without the concurrence of the Principal, would likely militate against the pleasant relations that exist between the management of our residential schools and the Department.\n\nIn the case in question, the proposed transfer is entirely reasonable, and the Department is satisfied that Father Leonard will concur, if you bring the matter to his attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to request permission to transfer the following pupils from the Cowessess Indian Residential School to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School:\n\nNo. 082 - Emile LeRat\n083 - Alice Delorme\n075 - Virginia LeVallee\n22 - J.B. Redwood\n\nThe three girls mentioned have become difficult to manage at the Cowessess school and it is considered better that they should be farther away from their homes which are all on the Cowessess Reserve.\n\nJ.B. Redwood was drunk on Sunday the 22nd of September, last, and it happened that the drunkenness occurred at the school, or near it, from liquor given him by an older brother. This boy is 17 years old and I did not think it wise to send him to goal, but I think that a year at the Qu'Appelle school, under more strict supervision, might prove beneficial to him. He is the youngest of five sons in the family and they have all been very troublesome after being discharged from school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department states that it considers the pro-\nposed transfer is entirely reasonable, in which case it\nseems to me that it should intervene and request the Principal\nof the Qu'Appelle school to transfer the children to the Fort\nAlexander school. The very reason the Department advances\nfor the management of the school taking an interest in a\npupil could be employed as an objection to consenting to\nthe transfer, and I do not desire to be placed in a position\nof suggesting an action, considered entirely reasonable,\nwhich might be refused, and having no authority to insist\nupon its being carried out. If the Department is satisfied\nthat Father Leonard will concur, I think it should take up\nthe matter with him and arrange to have the children sent\nto the Fort Alexander school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

She married Albert Daniels about eight years ago and immediately after her marriage left the Reserve and for some time resided in the United States. They came back some years ago and have worked around this district and part of the time they have lived with Mrs. Daniels' parents and they have also worked for Indian farmers on the Reserve. Albert Daniels is at the present time looking after the farm of Jack Fisher, but it is only as a hired man, as the horses, implements, buildings, etc., belong to Jack Fisher, and it is not certain how long he will remain in this position.\n\nThe matter of the eligibility of this girl for admission as a grant earning pupil has not previously been taken up with me nor have I any knowledge of an application form having been prepared. I have read very carefully the Deputy Superintendent's letter dated Nov. 9th, 1922 and I do not think that the above mentioned girl is entitled to be admitted under the Department's ruling shown in that letter. I must point out however that while Daniel's is working on the Reserve the chances of this girl getting an education other than through an Indian school is extremely remote. I hesitate to make a recommendation in this particular case, though I would like to see the girl in school, for fear that it would be referred to as a precedent, in future applications of a similar kind.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs.

As it would appear from your letter of December 16th, last, that this family has been living the Indian mode of life on a reserve for some years, the Department would appreciate your stating your reasons for considering that this girl does not come within the terms of the ruling mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeo.

(RG 10, Volume 6330, file 660-10, part 1)\nBalcarres, Sask.,\nFeb. 8, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 114-0-10, dated the 3rd instant, in connection with the application of Rosie Daniels for admission to Qu'Appelle Residential School.\n\nPossibly I am in error in interpreting your instructions. Albert Daniels is a half-breed and generally works around this district. When he is out of work he has from time to time come to live on the Reserve with his wife's parents and have occasionally employed him to work for Indian farmers which he is doing at the present time. If this is considered living the Indian mode of life than Daniel's children would be entitled to admittance to Qu'Appelle Residential School.\n\nI have pointed out the facts in this case so carefully as the Department have issued instructions not to recommend children for admittance to schools where they had come to live on the Reserve for the purpose of qualifying. I do not think this has been done in this particular instance, but as there are quite a number of Indian women married to half-breeds and most of them are desirous of putting their children in Indian schools, there would be nothing to stop them from coming to stay with the woman's parents and possibly do a little work around the Reserve and then putting their children in the Department's schools. I thought Daniel's application would create a precedent that would be pointed to in subsequent applications of a similar nature.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Affairs.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 12th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to previous correspondence regarding Rosie Daniels, I beg to say that a report just received from Mr. Agent Dodds shows that this girl does not come within the terms of the Department's ruling concerning the admission of half-breeds to Indian residential schools and the Department, therefore, is not prepared to approve of her admission to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.

It is evident from the information received that this girl does not come within the terms of the Department's ruling regarding the admission of half-breeds to Indian residential schools.

Lecaine, his wife, halfbreeds living in Wood Mountain (new town) four miles north and east of reserve.\n\nJimmie Ogle, halfbreed, is a rancher living on his own land about three-quarters of a mile from here.\n\nMrs. Jennie A. Brown, halfbreed, was living here part of fall and winter. At present working in vicinity of Willow Bunch.

Children have already been admitted to the school. I understand they (or children of these parents) have attended the school before under similar circumstances. Chas.

March 7th, 1930\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copies of letters from H. E. King, Overseer at Wood Mountain, also copy of letter written to Mr. King by Rev. Father Leonard, asking him to sign 'Applications for Admission' of a number of half-breed children to the Qu'Appelle School, who have no right whatever to be admitted.\n\nI may say in the first place that Father Leonard knows perfectly well that he should not admit any children to that school without having the proper authority to do so, and it looks to me as though he is deliberately ignoring the instructions of the Department.\n\nYou are aware that at one time (about 15 years ago) nearly half the children in this school were halfbreeds. We succeeded in getting every one of them out, and made it a hard and fast rule that the only halfbreed children who could be admitted were those who were living on an Indian reserve as Indians.\n\nThe parents of every one of these children are voters, and when the children become of age they will have the right to vote. They are not a charge on the Federal Government at all, and if they are to be sent to school the expense should be borne by the Provincial Government.\n\nDuncan C.

(RG 10, Volume 6330, file 660-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWe have had cases of this kind before, and I have consistently refused to have anything to do with them, so that if these admissions are permitted we will have done an injustice to other applicants and schools. We will also have opened up an avenue for the admission of hundreds more of the same type.\n\nI would ask for your authority to have these children returned to their parents. There is no doubt there will be a long controversy if the Department is not emphatic in the matter.\n\nI may say that I know the cases in question well, and they do not come under the category of those who should be admitted to an Indian School. I am rather annoyed with Father Leonard's action in this matter. He must have known that these children should not have been admitted, and if he had any doubt in the matter he could have called me up. I am inclined to think that he did know and that he refrained from consulting me, as he is aware of my attitude regarding this question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nMarch 12, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 314-11B of the 7th instant, with enclosures, concerning the eligibility of certain half-breed children for the Qu'Appelle School. I have reviewed the correspondence, and I believe that the children in question cannot be considered wards of this Department. You may so inform Father Leonard.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 27th ultimo, No. 114-0-10, and the application for admission of Bill Alary to the Qu'Appelle Residential School, I beg to say that I am informed by Rev. Father Carriere, Principal of the Cowessess Residential School, that he, personally, knew the father and mother of the boy in question and that they both died within recent years. Their names were Louis Allary and his wife Alexandra St. Pierre and they were both half-breeds. The boy in question, Father Carriere states, was adopted by Alex Peepetch about two years ago.\n\nI might mention, in this connection, that I would interview Peepetch and the boy personally if possible, but they are living on the Little Bone Reserve and it is impossible to reach that point at the present time without a long train journey. However, the circumstances of this case are practically the same as in the case of Celina and Harry Allary, two other adopted children of Alex Peepetch, who were admitted to the Qu'Appelle school under authority of Department letter number 114-0-10 dated 26th June, 1938. The boy for whom application is now made is no doubt a half-breed living the Indian mode of life on an Indian Reserve, and would therefore appear to be eligible for admission as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nIn my opinion, the only unsatisfactory feature of these cases is the fact that half-breed children who should be depending upon the Provincial Government for their education can be adopted by an Indian and with a little encouragement from church authorities, can become a charge upon the Federal Government for their education.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.S. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 19th, 1930.\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., with reference to the application for the admission of Bill Allary to the Qu'Appelle Residential School. Contents of your letter have been noted but the Department is not yet satisfied if this boy comes within the terms of our ruling regarding the admission of half breeds to Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIt is desired that you interview Alex Peepeech as soon as convenient and ascertain from him the circumstances under which he adopted Bill Allary. You should ask Peepeech if anyone intimated to him that this boy would be placed in a residential school after he looked after him for a year or so. Any further information that Peepeech gives regarding Allary should be forwarded for the Departments' consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nOttawa, March 19, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated the 17th ultimo, Mr. Agent Ostrander forwarded an application for the admission of Bill Allary to the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The application showed that this boy is a half-breed, and Mr. Ostrander was requested to obtain further information. I am now in receipt of another letter from him, but, as yet, the particulars given are not sufficiently definite for the Department to decide if this boy comes within the terms of our ruling regarding the admission of half-breeds to Indian residential schools.\n\nThe Department was surprised that he was admitted to the Qu'Appelle School, as it is most important that in the case of pupils whose eligibility is doubtful full particulars should be supplied to the Department and our decision given before a child is taken into a school.\n\nMr. Ostrander is being instructed to interview Alex. Peepsoch, who signed Allary's application, and when the Department receives his report regarding this interview it is hoped that we will then be able to decide whether or not approval could be given to Allary's admission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Only after I\nhad interviewed Mr. Letrander, Indian Agent, and he told\nme that he would sign the \"Application\" recommending\nhis admission did I consent to take him. Both his\nparents are dead and he has been living the Indian mode of\nlife on the reserve being adopted by Alex.

Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuscow, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 23rd instant, No. 114-0-10, in connection with the application for admission of Bill Allary to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, I beg to say that I had a conversation with Alex Peepeetch and his wife recently, also other relatives of the family and the only information I was able to obtain was to the effect that this boy's step-father is still living, but his address is unknown. Apparently the step-father has never had much to do with the boy since the boy's mother died and the boy has been wandering about from place to place, often at Alex Peepeetch's, but as often at other homes and the actual adoption took place only last fall before the boy was placed in the Qu'Appelle School. Other relatives of the family say that the mother of the boy asked for Alex Peepeetch and wife to look after the boy when she was dying and, outside of this, there was no adoption.\n\nI asked Alex Peepeetch and wife whether anyone made any suggestion of adoption and placing of this boy in school. His reply was to the effect that Father Leonard advised him to do it, but I would not place much confidence in Peepeetch's word. He is the type of Indian who might, on being asked the same question to-morrow, deny having made the statement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.H. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 4th, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to official letter of March 19th, last, and your reply of March 25th, with reference to Bill Allary, I beg to say that the Department is in receipt of a further report from Mr. Agent Ostrander. Reports received from Mr. Agent Ostrander indicate that it is doubtful if this boy could be considered a ward of this Department. As he is a half-breed, he should be maintained by the provincial authorities and I am, therefore, requesting Mr. Commissioner Graham to endeavour to make arrangements with them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. G. Leonard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Res.

As he is a half-breed, he should be maintained by the provincial authorities and I am, therefore, requesting Mr. Commissioner Graham to endeavour to make arrangements with them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nOttawa, July 4th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nA few months ago, a boy named Bill Allary, aged thirteen years, was placed in the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. He is a son of the late Louis Allary and the late Alexandra St. Pierre, both of whom were half-breeds. Previous to his admission to the Qu'Appelle School, this boy was residing with Alex Peepeeh on the Little Bone Reserve.\n\nReports received from Mr. Agent Ostrander indicate that it is doubtful if this boy could be considered a ward of this Department. He is, apparently, a half-breed without a home and the Department considers that it would be advisable to make an endeavour to have the Department of Neglected and Delinquent Children in Saskatchewan provide for his maintenance. I would appreciate your making this attempt and advising the Department of the results of your efforts in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

(RG 10, Volume 6330, file 660-10, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant No. 114-0-10, informing me that a boy named Bill Allary, aged thirteen years, was placed in the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School a few months ago. You state that he is a son of the late Louis Allary and the late Alexandra St. Pierre, both of whom were half-breeds.\n\nI may say that I knew the parents of this boy very well, and he is no more entitled to be in the Qu'Appelle School than any white boy in the district.\n\nI note you state that reports received from Mr. Agent Ostrander indicate that it is doubtful if this boy could be considered a ward of the Department. The question is, why was he admitted to the school? If the Principal of this institution had paid any attention whatever to the regulations of the Department he would not have been admitted. As long as the Department treat the matter of halfbreed children in our schools as lightly as they do we will not get anywhere. I should like to have the money that is spent in our schools on halfbreed children, who, when they leave school take the status of white citizens; this money would go a long way in feeding destitute Indians.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI have not been successful in getting much satisfaction when I have brought similar cases to the attention of the Department. These children should not be admitted to our schools under any consideration, and nothing short of strict instructions to the Indian Agents will bring this about.\n\nI am taking the matter of this boy up with the Department of Neglected Children, but it is difficult to get children transferred to the care of that Department once they have been admitted to our schools. I have had similar cases to deal with in the past, and this has been my experience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, July 24, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Mr. Agent Pugh, in which he recommends that Bob Eagle Bear and Mike Black Forehead, who are at present pupils of the Qu'Appelle Residential School, be returned to the Blood Residential School. In view of the Agent's recommendation, the Department is inclined to give favourable consideration to his request; but, before giving definite instructions, we would appreciate your views in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T.

Upon receipt of his reply, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant. Allow me to remove from your mind any impression that the answers to the questions in the application forms emanated from me; their inaccuracies, etc., (originally) their incorrectness marks them as the product of some reverend gentleman\u2014a novice at typhus inoculation. The children have been living with their father and mother here, and it is the state of health of the latter that calls for the admission of the children to school permanently\u2014or rather, one might say, her absence from home as the doctor can never be in good health again\u2014from what her husband assures me the doctors tell him, and the statement seems borne out by the length of stay she has recently made at the Grey Nuns Hospital at Regina\u2014not, that is, in such a condition as the due management of home and the rearing of a family call for.\n\nAs to the \"Lecaine\" \"coute\" matter this father is an Indian named Walter Coute, but in moments of exuberant fancy he poses as a half-breed and styles himself Walter Lecaine. So far as it is possible to do so we insist on the user of coute.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, July 29, 1930.\n\nRev.

At first these boys gave us a little trouble, being brought back by the R.C.M. Police on one occasion after having run away, but since then they have behaved very well and have given us no trouble.

At first these boys gave us a little trouble, being brought back by the R.C.M. Police on one occasion after having ran away, but since then they have behaved very well and have given us no trouble. They are receiving the proper training for farm work and I do not think it would be in their interest to transfer them to another school.\n\n\"Besides, Mike Black Forehead is about eighteen years old and will soon be of age for discharge; though I would request the Department to allow him to remain here another year to become better acquainted with practical farming. Bob Eagle Bear is in his seventeenth year, these ages are as given on their Warrants of Commitment.\"\n\nPlease let me have your comments regarding the Reverend Principal's suggestion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I do not think it advisable to hold the boy till he is 19 years.\n\nIn Bob's case, I am of the opinion that it would be advisable to transfer this boy back to the Blood H.C. School to complete his 18 years. I make this suggestion as the Department will readily see that if we remove one, it will work a hardship on the other, being of different tribe and language to the rest of the school children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 6th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, with further reference to Bob Eagle Bear and Mike Black Forehead.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your report, the Department is again writing the Reverend Principal of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School approving the discharge of Mike Black Forehead and authorizing the transfer of Bob Eagle Bear to the Blood Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

In reply he advises that Mike Black Forehead's father is growing old and is unable to work and the Agent feels that the boy could be of considerable assistance to his parents. Under these circumstances, the Department considers that he should be granted his discharge.\n\nMr. Pugh also feels that it would now be advisable to transfer Bob Eagle Bear to the Blood Residential School.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will arrange to have these two boys sent to the Blood Reserve at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 3rd, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your 306-11B of October 13th, last, enclosing copy of a letter received by you from the Principal of the File Hills Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the question of the auspices under which the Stevenson children should be educated has been receiving very careful consideration by the Department.\n\nWhile it is agreed that both Stevenson and his wife are Protestants, I may advise you that two older girls of this family were admitted to the Qu'Appelle Residential School in 1924 and remained there for several years. In the meantime, three boys had been placed in the File Hills Residential School.\n\nMr. Agent Davis was asked to interview the parents and he replies, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I have interviewed the parents of these children and the mother gives as her reason for wanting them placed in the Qu'Appelle School is that, as she is blind, she would like the children close to home.\n\n\"They also state that the two older girls are Roman Catholics and the family are divided in religion in any case and, rather than not have the girls put in the Qu'Appelle School, they would place the boys there also.\"\n\nIt appears from the above that the parents are very insistent that their two girls should be placed in the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. However, the Department is not prepared to accede to this request at the present time and, for your information, I enclose copy of a letter which is being directed to Mr. Agent Davis.\n\nYou may inform Mr. Rhodes, Principal of the File Hills Indian Residential School, regarding the Department's action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6330, file 660-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 3rd, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of November 15th, last, with further reference to your request for the admission of Florence and Nora Stevenson to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. The Department is aware that two older girls of this family were admitted to the Qu'Appelle Residential School in 1924, but it was not intended at that time that their admission was to form a precedent. It is the intention of Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act that children of Roman Catholic parents should be educated under Roman Catholic auspices and children of Protestant parents under Protestant auspices.\n\nIt is definitely reported to the Department that Thomas Stevenson, father of these two girls, and his father before him were Protestants. Stevenson's wife also comes from a Protestant family. Three boys of this family have been educated in the File Hills Residential School and two of them are still in that school.\n\nAs a general rule, the Department considers that it is in the best interests of all parties concerned to comply with the intention of Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act and, with this in mind, the Department feels that the Stevenson children should be educated under Protestant auspices. It is noted from your letter that you state that both parents desire their two girls educated in the Qu'Appelle School. However, the Department is not prepared to accede to their wishes at the present time.\n\nThe two girls should be returned to their parents and Mr. Agent Davis is being informed that the Department will not approve of their admission to any Indian residential school during the next six months. At the end of that time, the matter will again be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. Leonard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Qu'Appelle Res. School,\nLerret, Sask.\nOttawa, February 3rd, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd ultimo, with further reference to the application for the admission of Florence and Nora Stevenson to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department has given very careful consideration to this case. As you were informed in official letter of December 11th, last, it is considered that, owing to the Protestant antecedents of these children, they should be educated under Protestant auspices. It is noted from your letter of the 2nd ultimo that the parents are insistent that the two girls should be educated in the Qu'Appelle Residential School, where their two older sisters were also educated.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to accede to this request at the present time. Rev. G. Leonard, O.M.I., Principal of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, is being informed that the two girls should be returned to their parents and that the Department is not willing to have them placed in any Indian residential school during the next six months. At the end of that time, the matter will again be given consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuscow, Sask.\nOttawa, February 5th, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to refer you to previous correspondence with reference to your request for the admission of Alice Starr to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department has made very careful inquiries with regard to the religious antecedents of this girl.\n\nIt appears that the father, Sidney Starr, is a Protestant, also that the deceased mother was a Protestant.\n\nMr. Agent Dodds further states that, during the time that Sidney Starr's first wife was alive and after she died, Sidney Starr and Cowicket lived together. Mr. Dodds states that it is equally true to say that Cowicket lived with Sidney Starr instead of Sidney Starr living with Cowicket. They have lived that way ever since Alice Starr was born. Cowicket sent his own children to the File Hills School and it would appear from this action on his part that he was recognized as a Protestant.\n\nThe Department considers that it is in the best interests of all parties concerned to adhere to the intention of Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act. In view of the fact that Alice Starr's father is a Protestant, the Department believes that this girl should be educated under Protestant auspices. Under these circumstances, we are not prepared to approve of her admission to the Qu'Appelle Residential School and I should appreciate if you would have her returned to her home at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

In connection with the above, I have the honour to report that at 9:30 p.m. this date I was advised by Dr. A. B. Davis of Fort Qu'Appelle, physician of the Indian hospital, that the above named girl had left from school at Lebret, Sask. and was believed headed for the Sioux Indian Reserve, in company with another girl who had left the school (see C.R.e.: Nancy ROSEBLUFF) and requested that I proceed to intercept her, if possible, and take her back to Lebret. Dr. Simes also stated that he had been unable to get in touch with the Indian Agent, R.S. DAVIS, to inform him of the matter, but according to the information received the girl had just passed through Fort Qu'Appelle.\n\nSub-Division\n\n2. Upon receipt of this request I immediately patrolled, per hired team livery, to Bahe Lake and with the aid of flashlights I was able to discern footprints in the snow showing that the girls were headed either in the direction of the Sanatorium or Sioux Reserve.\n\nDetachment\n\n3.

In connection with the above, I have the honour to report that at 9:30 p.m., this date, I was advised by Dr. A.B. SIMES of Fort Qu'Appelle, Sask., Physician to the Indian Department, that the above named girl had left it from the school at Lebret and was believed heading for the Sioux Indian Reserve and requested that I proceed to intercept her, if possible, and take her back to Lebret. Dr. Simes further informed me that he had been unable to get in touch with the Indian Agent, R.B. DAVIS, to inform him of the matter, but according to the information received, the girl had just past through Fort Qu'Appelle.\n\n2. Upon receipt of this request, I immediately patrolled per hired team livery on Echo Lake and with the aid of flashlights I was able to discern footprints in the snow which showed that the girl was heading in the direction of either the Camatorium or Sioux Reserve.\n\n3. The lake was patrolled cross-wise several times, but no signs of the girl could be seen, although it is quite possible that she might be dodging the cutter, as she would doubtless know that the authorities would be after her as soon as it was learned that she was missing from the school.\n\n4. In an effort to head her off, I patrolled to the Sioux Reserve and circled around in the hope of catching a glimpse of the girl, but was unsuccessful. I had no idea on what part of the Reserve the girl might go and as a result of enquiries instituted, I gathered that the girl might belong to Muscowpetung Reserve. I patrolled around the B-Say-Tah area without finding any trace of the girl and finally returned to my Detachment at 2:00 a.m. of the 5th inst.\n\n5. In the p.m. this date, I was advised by R.B. Davis, Indian Agent, that it is possible that the girl will from place to place in an effort to avoid being taken back to school and he suggested that I wait until I get definite word from him as to the girl's whereabouts before taking any further action.\n\nHANDLED OVER TO DEPT.

There is a tendency in most Indian families to cater to the wishes of their children with the result that when pupils are discharged from school they become virtual managers of their own and at an extent of their parents' affairs. At sixteen they are not qualified for this role and may eventually become unmanageable and a problem on the reserve. We have co-operated with the different Indian Agents and have discharged pupils at sixteen when we considered their home conditions warranting it and the parents had requested their discharge; in other cases we have kept pupils up to the full age of eighteen years when we considered it in their interests to remain in school.\n\nWe are, however, attaching a separate list only of the pupils who have special reasons to remain in school, with the reasons in each case. Nearly all the others will be discharged in the September Report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nFB.\nOttawa, July 9, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to pupils sixteen years of age and over who are in the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General's circular of the 15th ultimo did not state that children must be discharged at sixteen years of age, but simply pointed out the requirements of the Indian Act viz., that, when children over sixteen years of age are being kept in a residential school, permission must be obtained. The Department realizes that there are often very good reasons for keeping children in residential schools after sixteen years of age, and we are prepared to consider any representations that Indian agents and principals make in this regard.\n\nIn order to carry out the requirements of the circular letter recently sent to you, you should, at the end of each academic year, forward the names of the children in the Qu'Appelle School who are sixteen years of age, and, in the case of those whom you wish to retain for a further period, you should ask permission to do so and give your reasons for making this request.\n\nWith special reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, I beg to say that the Department approves the following children remaining in the Qu'Appelle School for another year:\n\n| No. | Name          |\n|-----|---------------|\n| 0725 | Core Crow     |\n| 0733 | Louise Leves  |\n| 633  | Louise Lerat  |\n| 676  | Philip Desjarlais |\n| 0787 | Edna Dumont   |\n| 0810 | Jane Starblanket |\n| 0820 | Justine Agecoutay |\n| 0858 | Rosie Chapeescan |\n| 794  | George Yuzicappi |\n| 0788 | Rosie Kayasowatam |\n| 0836 | Florence Pinny |\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Res.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nIndian Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.,\nSept. 21st, 1934.\n\nLetter # 10758.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen you wrote to us on Feb. 3rd, 1934, Letter No. 114-6-16, refusing, for the time being, admission to this school of Pilgrims and Nora Stevenson, you promised to give the matter further consideration after a period of six months. We now understand that these girls have been sent to File Hills school and that the parents have not signed the Application forms and still wish to have them sent to this school. We would like to have your definite decision in this case.\n\nIt is not our wish that section 10 [1] of the Indian Act should be entirely ignored but it would appear to us that in many cases it has been rather differently interpreted, and in these cases it has not been to our advantage. We will call your attention to the following cases so you may see that we have some grounds for this belief.\n\nWe had correspondence with the Department with reference to the children of Alex. Ackusis. (See our letters No. 10483 Jan. 5th, 1931 and No. 10487 Jan. 31st, 1931. Department replied No. 111-1-10 Jan. 14th and 21st, 1931 and Feb. 16th, 1931.) The Department decided that these children should remain at File Hills school. We can produce an affidavit from Alex. Ackusis that he is a Roman Catholic and wishes his children to remain Roman Catholics and have them sent to this school.\n\nWe have recently had a letter from James T. Ross of Griswold requesting that we take his three children, Elizabeth, Eva and Stephen, who are now attending Portage La Prairie school. Their parents are Roman Catholics. Eva was baptized May 8th, 1921, by Father Walsh, Brandon, and Stephen Oct. 10th, 1920, by Father Etienne.\n\nWe have also been informed that there is another Roman Catholic girl attending Portage La Prairie school: Agnes Myrick, born Feb. 10th, 1920, baptized myself Aug. 15th, 1920. This girl's parents are both Roman Catholics.\n\nStill another case is that of Sydney Mandy's two children, of Piagot band, who have been sent to Gordon school about three weeks ago. The parents are both Roman Catholics and both ex-pupils of this school.\n\nWe are not asking for any privilege not covered by the Act, but we are asking that we be given equal treatment. If the Act is to be strictly followed that Protestant children be sent only to Protestant schools and Roman Catholic children to Roman Catholic schools, we cannot see any reason why our Roman Catholic children now attending Protestant schools should remain there, and if they are to remain there we cannot see any reason why the admission of the Stevenson girls to this school should be refused.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6330, file 660-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n(2)\n\nTrusting you will give this matter further consideration,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. G. Leonard\n\nPrincipal.\n\nFB.\nIndian Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.,\nSept. 27th, 1934.\n\nLetter # 10760,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast year we discharged pupil No. 749 Tom Matto from this school. Mr. Clarke has written to us that the boy was needed at home to assist his grandfather who was unable to work. The grandfather has since died. The boy is now an orphan and the Agent returned him to school with the other pupils.\n\nThe boy was admitted in 1928, and his age was given as thirteen. This evidently was an error as the boy cannot be more than fifteen or sixteen now. He was very small when admitted here, and is still only a boy. It is difficult to ascertain his exact age.\n\nWe would like your permission to have him remain in this school another year or two.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nFB.\nOttawa, October 10, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, I beg to say that the Department approves of the re-admission of Tom Matto - No. 749 - to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. He may remain in the school until June 30th, 1935, at which time his case should be again brought to the Department's attention if you consider that he should be kept in the school for a further period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland.\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. G. Leonard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Res. School,\nLebret, Sask.\nOttawa, October 12, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your No. 10758 of the 21st ultimo.\n\nThe admission of the two children of Alex. Nokusis to the File Hills Indian Residential School was approved in official letters of February 16, 1931. At that time, both the father and mother desired the children placed in the File Hills School. In this regard, I would refer you to official letters of January 21, 1931, and February 16, 1931. Since that time the Department does not appear to have received any statement from the father showing that he was not satisfied with his children being in the File Hills School.\n\nWhen applications for admission of children to a residential school are first received, every possible consideration is given and when a decision has been finally made regarding the school in which children should be placed, it has not been the practice of the Department to transfer them.\n\nStephen Ross, son of James T. Ross, was admitted to the Portage la Prairie Residential School in September, 1930. The application form forwarded at that time was presumably signed by the father and stated that his religion was \"United Church Of Canada.\" You wrote in your letter that the parents are Roman Catholics. Do you mean that they have become adherents of the Roman Catholic Church since the time Stephen Ross was sent to the Portage la Prairie School?\n\nThe last quarterly return from the Portage la Prairie Residential School does not contain the names of Elizabeth and Eva Ross. As far as the Department is aware, these children are not at that school.\n\nThe June quarterly return of the Portage la Prairie Residential School does not show the name of Agnes Myrick, nor does the June quarterly return of the Gordon's School show the names of Sydney Mandy's children, nor have applications for their admission been received by the Department since July 1st. As far as we are aware, these children are not in the Portage la Prairie School, but, in view of your letter, the Agent will be written.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. Leonard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Res.

Tickets had been issued on receipt of a requisition from you.\n\nThe Department does not desire transport requisitions to be used for the transportation of children to or from an Indian residential school. For this purpose transportation requisitions should only be used if necessary to obtain the reduced rate, and all such transportation costs should be paid in cash and a special account forwarded to the Department.\n\nIn the case of residential schools where children are allowed home on holidays and it is necessary to provide their return transportation, the principal of the residential school concerned should supply the funds, as the Department makes arrangements with the respective principals regarding the amount which we are prepared to allow for transportation purposes.\n\nIn the case of new children going to a residential school in your Agency whose parents are unable to pay the transportation costs, you should pay same and submit an account to the Department. In the event of your not having funds for the purpose, you should apply for an accountable cheque.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA.

I would ask you to kindly give your favorable consideration of these cases.\n\nThe following pupils are orphans, one or both parents being dead, and on account of their home conditions I believe it would be in their interest and in the interest of the Department to allow them to remain in school until they are eighteen years of age.\n\n667 Dec.

The number in brackets after their name was their age on admission.\n\n744 Louis Dubois (9)\n763 Harry Cootipe (10)\n795 Daniel Waijunta (10)\n818 Albert McNamee (12)\n821 Alfred Tacan (13)\n830 Antoine Rosebluff (13)\n8588 Rosie Chapeecan (13)\n917 Agnes Ironstone\n\nThe following two pupils are in Grade VIII and wish to take up their High School work.

We\nphone him every day today he has promised to have this\nweek. As soon as he completes the Certificates of Health\nwe will forward you the forms through the Indian Agent.\n\nThe reason for transferring the four pupils from\nSt. Philips School was because that school is at present\novercrowded, and as we recruited from those reserves before\nthat school was built, the parents requested that their\nchildren be sent here. The same applies to the pupil,\nfrom Fort Alexander School, 0989 M.A.Alexander. Fort\nAlexander School has more pupils than they can accommodate\nand as we also recruited on Roseau reserve and have a\nsister of this girl a pupil of this school, the parents\nwished her to be transferred here.\n\nI would also request your permission to have\npupil No. 837 J.S. McArthur readmitted to this school.\nWe discharged him last quarter as he had not attended\nschool the previous year and had not returned at the end\nof the quarter.

D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. A. Dodds, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nMuscow, Sask,\nMay 20th, 1936.\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI am asking the Indian Agent to send this letter on to you as the matter is of great importance to me, and while I know that Mr. Booth, the Agent, is in sympathy with me and recognises the justice of what I ask, I think the matter will require to be dealt with by a higher authority.\n\nI am a member of Pasqua Indian Reserve, No. 79 and I was at the Industrial School at Lebret for 14 years, which were 14 years of my life wasted, although I was there during the time of Father Hougenard for whom I had the highest personal regard, but then the school was not as badly run as it is now. I learned practically nothing, but I am glad to say that after I left school I had the opportunity of studying and by reading and with the assistance of others I have attained some little education and alike for improvement. I am happily married to a half-breed woman of English descent who is a good housekeeper and a good mother to our children. I am a Pagan in religion and nothing I have been able to read and study and nothing I have heard from any denomination has caused me to change. Certainly nothing urged by Roman Catholic Priests and Nuns, taking into consideration their own conduct at the same time, would cause me to adopt that religion, and I say this with due regard for the late Father Hougenard and many other worthy priests.\n\nIn spite of my being a Pagan, I have placed all my children in the Industrial School at Lebret, but I have now withdrawn my daughter Edith, aged 14, from the school, and for reasons I will give, I do not propose to let her go back, and I wish your permission to keep her away, and I will make arrangements to send her to public school or some other arrangements to educate her. The Agents however will not agree to this as they want the money the Department pays them for pupils, and will have me prosecuted by law unless you intervene on my behalf, and as one of your wards, I crave your protection.\n\nMy youngest daughter, aged 11, was at the Industrial School at Lebret and we heard she was ill. We went there on April 21st and found her very much suffering from pneumonia, but being well looked after by Dr. Simes and an I.D. nurse. Our daughter however seemed worried as well as ill and asked us to keep the Nuns and Priests out of her room as \"They were telling her that she would be sacrificed unless her father accepted Christianity\". She said that as soon as Dr. Simes and the nurse were away, a nun, Sister Lacroix, and a Priest, who is a stranger and whose name I could not get, would go in and tell her she was going to die for her father's sins, that he must get her father to join the catholic faith before she died, and many other things. The child was so earnest about this that my wife stayed with her as much as possible, but the moment she might be away for meals or a little sleep, this Nun would get in and worry the child, and on my wife's return, she would find her in tears greatly upset, and she would beg her mother to keep that Nun away. I told Father Leonard about this and he\npromised to tell the Nun to keep away, but he did not and she kept up her terrible work in spite of all our efforts.\n\nMy wife was told that she has passed the crisis on Friday night and that she had good prospects of recovery. However, on the Monday following, her temperature had again increased and she seemed weak and ill. I said he could not understand this, but the reason was that this Nun had again got to the child and had worked upon her, worrying and frightening her and telling her that she was dying for her father's sin in not becoming a catholic, and saying, \"It is his fault you must die, because your father is a Pagan.\" The child cried to her mother not to leave her and not to let the Nun in again, as the Nun told her she had to die. Evelyn said to her mother \"The Nun will be happy when I am dead, but my little sister will cry.\"\n\nI am positive that if it had not been for this Nun, my child would be alive today. When she died, they told me, \"You should be glad your daughter is in Heaven praying for you to be saved from your sins.\"\n\nAfter stating these facts, I would be grateful if the Department grant the discharge of my two children from the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nI would also like to state my appreciation of the services rendered by Dr. Simes and the Department nurse to my daughter.\n\nYour humble ward,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6330, file 660-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMuscow, Sask,\nJuly 11th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter #114-0-10, dated the 9th June, 1936, I beg to submit the following report:\n\nI visited the school on June 13th and interviewed the Principal, the Mother Superior and Sisters Lacroix and Dalgeecle.\n\nThe Principal stated that Andrew Gordon's statements are false and that the girl received the best attention possible.\n\nSister Lacroix only visited the girl once as Sister Dalgeecle, who is a trained nurse is in charge of the infirmary, and was on duty all day and Nurse Graham of the Indian Department was night nurse.\n\nSister Dalgeecle stated that the girl was not bothered in any way at all.\n\nAs Andrew Gordon who is a very outstanding Indian on this Agency, would not be able to send his children back there to finish their education as in his own mind he is convinced that statements are true, and also as he is capable of finishing educating his children outside the reserve, I would recommend that they be discharged. If not I am afraid Andrew will be a source of trouble until his children are of age,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Booth,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 16, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the letter received from Andrew Gordon of the Pasqua Band.\n\nI would appreciate if you would return Gordon's letter to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nIn view of your report and the report of the Medical Superintendent, Dr. A. B. Simes, it is considered that Gordon's daughter received every possible care and attention previous to her death. There does not appear any reason why Gordon should feel that his children are neglected at the Qu'Appelle Residential School. Under these circumstances, the Department is not prepared to approve their discharge at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nFrank Booth, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuscow, Sask.\nRev. Sir:\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 11th inst I beg to inform you that the late Alice Hornby was number 73 Peorman Band, paid on her own ticket from years 1916 to 1930 when she commuted annuity.\n\nI understand she was first married to a man named Guinville, and later on married John La Plante. The name of John La Plante shows on the records here first at treaty in 1925 when he came along and asked for his wife's treaty money. In 1927 the woman was shown as married to John La Plante. These transactions took her out of all benefits as a treaty person except that she could still draw the annuity.\n\nHer family by John La Plante have been trying to get admitted to various schools operated by the Department of Indian Affairs, I have refused to have anything to do with them myself as the only way they could get onto a reserve is by trespass now, the father should keep them, he is responsible for them not the Department of Indian Affairs in my opinion. I may be wrong. Last I heard of them was that they were trying to get adopted by two old people who are on the destitute list on another reserve, I do not think the Department would approve of such an adoption, the old people cannot keep themselves without assistance. However, this is all the information I have about John La Plante family.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. N. de Bretogues O.M.I.\nPrincipal, Lebret School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Today, as these same parents, without any undue influence or pressure from others, have changed their minds and if the will of the father in the matter of admission to a school is the supreme rule by which the Department decides religious cases, it stands to reason that the transfer of these children to a Catholic school should be approved of.\n\nAs registration day is on the 16th instant, the parents are anxious to have their case settled by the Department for that date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Nokosis. The declaration signed by Alex. Nokosis refers to four children, viz.: Maurice, Mildred, Archibald and George.\n\nOn reviewing the return from the File Hills Residential School, I can find no record of George Nokosis.\n\nMaurice and Mildred were admitted to the File Hills Residential School in 1931. As stated in your letter, this was a contentious case and there was considerable correspondence at that time, but the admission of these two children to File Hills was finally approved.\n\nIn August, 1935, Alex. Nokosis applied for the admission of Archibald to the File Hills School. The application form submitted stated that he was Protestant.\n\nAs you are aware, it has not been our practice, in the past, to transfer children from one\n\n- school\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nschool to another for religious reasons. I think you will appreciate the difficulties that would arise if we adopted that policy.\n\nAt the moment, I do not see what action we could take, other than discharging the children from the File Hills School, provided the father applies for their discharge through the office of the Indian Agent. At the present time, we could not consider transferring them from File Hills to Qu'Appelle.\n\nNo doubt, you will be in Ottawa in the near future, and the matter could be discussed further at that time.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Sup't. of Indian Education.\nDivision Fyle No.: 36R/1250-17\n\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\n\nDivision Sub-Division Detachment\n# Regina Fort Qu'Appelle\nProvince Saskatchewan Date\nAugust 21st, 1936.\n\nFyle References Re:\nAndrew GARRI\u00c8RE - Truant Indian\nQu'Appelle Industrial School - Lebret, Sask.\n(Assistance to Dept. of Ind.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Bob:\n\nCan you tell me when and whether there is any probability of starting a mink farm at the Lebret Indian Industrial School, or at any place in that neighborhood under the auspices of the Indian Department?\n\nMy understanding is that through the instrumentality of Father Plourde here, who is Superintendent of Indian Schools for the Oblate Fathers, a couple of pupils of the Lebret School came down here to learn what they could about mink farming. It appears that Father Plourde got in touch with Mr. Morris Arkin who gave these pupils all the information and help he could in preparation for them commencing to run a mink farm.\n\nNow that, according to what I am told, the school authorities at Lebret are in a position to start a mink farm, they will have to buy foundation stock, and Mr. Arkin very naturally is interested in supplying same at a reasonable price. I should like to help him and it does seem to me that it is right and proper he should be dealt with in view of his free assistance so far. Any information you can give me relative to this project will be much appreciated.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRalph Maybank\nRalph Maybank, M.P.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In an interview with Father de Bretagne a few weeks ago, he expressed the view that a little training in domestic fur farming should prove of great value to Indian pupils upon their return to the Indian reserves.\n\nFather Plourde, of Winnipeg, discussed the desirability of such a farm with the officials here a few months ago. Of course, no objection whatever was raised to the proposal. This farm, however, will be established by the Principal and maintained by him without any additional cost to the Government. I would suppose that it is his intention to establish the farm and purchase the foundation stock out of the per capita grant allowances or out of any profits that may have accrued to him as the result of his farm operations. In any event, we are making no contribution whatever\n\nRalph Maybank, Esq., M.P.,\n614 Avenue Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nto the project.\n\nI feel confident that, if you or Mr. Arkin would communicate with the Principal, he would be glad to consider Mr. Arkin's claims, if he has not already purchased his stock. My understanding is that he is starting in a very small way, with the intention of proceeding slowly and cautiously.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSchool To Help Start Fur Farms for Indians\n\n(Special Despatch)\n\nLEBRET, Sask., Oct. 17.\u2014Fr. M. de Bretagne, O.M.I., Lebret Indian school principal, has started mink farming in connection with the school. This is considered the forerunner of an industry which will be expanded so that will assist them in becoming self-supporting. Fr. de Bretagne is engaged in a project to cage 40 nutria, Quebec mink, in a coulee, between the school and the Seymore farm. This will be foundation stock, and other schools will later start mink farming. Upon success of this venture will depend to what extent Indian schools and Indians will continue in fur-farming.\n\nHon. T. A. Crean, minister of the interior from Ottawa, has looked with interest on the project and believes Indians should take a natural interest in fur-farming. It is proposed later to start mink farming and later again to branch out in other fur-bearing animal raising. On account of the Indians, it is pointed out by the federal minister, know the animals through habits and their characteristics. They would be best qualified under proper supervision to raise thousands of animals every year, and supply a great part of the world demand.\n\nFr. de Bretagne has the distinction of being the first pioneer in the fur-farming industry among the Indians.\nSTAR-PH\u0152NIX.\n\nStart Mink Farm At Indian School\n\nExperiment Planned at Lebret; Teach Boys to Become Self-Supporting\n\nEstablishment of a mink farm at the Qu'Appelle Indian residential school marks another progressive step in the vocational training of Indian children. While boys of 'teen age in areas where the livelihood of the Indians depends largely upon the practical training in hunting and trapping, the starting of a fur farm at the Qu'Appelle school is considered the forerunner of an industry that may eventually make many of the Indians self-supporting.\n\nThe success of this venture, which is being fostered by Fr. M. de Bretagne, principal of the Qu'Appelle school, will determine to what extent Indian schools and Indians will continue in fur farming.\n\nINDIAN SCHOOL FUR FARM OPEN\n\nEstablishment of a mink farm at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret, Saskatchewan, marks another progressive step in the vocational training of Indian children. While boys of 'teen age in areas where the livelihood of the Indians depends largely upon the game resources have for some time past been afforded opportunities for practical training in hunting and trapping, the starting of a fur farm at the Qu'Appelle School is considered the forerunner of an industry that may eventually make many of the Indians self-supporting. The success of this venture, which is being fostered by Fr. M. de Bretagne, O.M.I., principal of the Qu'Appelle school, will determine to what extent Indian schools and Indians will continue in fur farming.\n\nBINDING HISTORY OF SIX NATIONS\n\nLONDON, Ont. (CP)\u2014Today lonely country school-teacher and historic martyr Isabella Grant Gilkison, born in 1846, was made a Princess of Six Nations Indians in 1913 and given the name Sashawhahm, which means \"One who makes a research.\" The first sash of honor given to a woman was presented in 1888 to Col. Gilkison, her father, long superintendent of the Indians at Brantford.\n\nMiss Gilkison has worn it at times \u2014 red, with a blue border, interwoven with beads, three yards long. The Sash is spun, woven and dried by Indian women.\nA Good Idea\n\nAn innovation in Indian vocational training is the establishment of a mink farm at the Qu'Appelle Indian residential school. It is a good idea because it is a natural and a progressive step.\n\nWhat could be more reasonable than turning an Indian who is a born trapper and huntsman with an inherited knowledge of furbearing animals, into a fur farmer? Having an instinctive appreciation of the characteristics of wild life, he should be naturally interested in the problems of fur farming and should develop into an expert in the line.\n\nThis experiment will be watched with interest. It reveals the alertness of the Indian department of the Government. And when the idea is in general operation it should go one further step in making the Indian self-supporting\u2014and happy and contented into the bargain, which is just as important.\nRAA196 40 NL 1 EXA\n\nWINNIPEG MAN 29\n\nR A HOEY 316\n\nDIRECTOR WELFARE AND TRAINING INDIAN BRANCH AFFAIRS OTTAWA\n\nWOULD APPRECIATE VERY MUCH RECEIVING PAYMENT IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE FOR THE MINKS SUPPLIED TO THE QUAPELLE INDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL STOP WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND AT TIME OF SALE THAT PAYMENT WOULD BE MADE IMMEDIATELY AFTER DELIVERY OF ANIMALS\n\nRED RIVER VALLEY FUR FARM PER M ARKIN\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nThe management of the Qu'Appelle Indian residential school, Lebret, Saskatchewan, has completed arrangements for the establishment of a mink farm at the school.\n\nThe Principal has engaged a man who is thoroughly familiar with raising and caring for mink to take charge of this activity at the school and as a result the teen age boys will receive training which should be of very practical value to them after they leave school.\n\nThe salary of the above member of the staff will, of course, be paid by the school management from school funds and in addition they supplied all the labour required for the erection of the necessary buildings to house the mink.\n\nThey request the Department to pay for the mink (50 head --- $1200.00) and the cost of the material for the buildings amounting to $290.51.\n\nFunds for the above purpose are available in the appropriation for the current fiscal year and as I feel you will agree that this is a very desirable training to afford the boys I should appreciate receiving the approval of the Honourable the Minister to pay the accounts mentioned.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

To follow out the latter suggestion would mean that certain boys to whom it is decided to give mink would not only do their share of the general work but would also look after their own mink. This, of course, would involve setting aside special space and possibly could not be carried out.

Arkins-Winnipeg by the Indian Affairs Branch as a foundation stock:\n\nNumber of males .....15\n- females .....25\n\nSince November we have to sustain the following losses:\nJan. 1-39 1 male cause determined by Veterinarian\n- 16-39 2M.38 acidosis\n- 16-39 1 male - penis enlargement\n- 7M.38\nFebr. 3-39 1 male - acidosis\n- 5M.38\n- 5-39 1 male 10M.38 do-\n- 7 1 - 12M.38 do-\n- 8 1 - 1 M.38 do-\n- 8 1 - 6 M.38 do-\n- 8 1 - 4 M.38 do-\n- 9 1 - 9 M.38 do-\n\n9 total were so lost by death.\n\nSince that date we have numerous births increasing our stock by an average guessed number of 110. The exact number of them will be reported as soon as we will know it. For the time being it is impossible to disturb the mothers to secure a more accurate enquiry.\n\nAs you might notice, these 9 minks that died this spring practically died from the same disease the origin of which has to be blamed from a wrong way of nutrition. With the help of Veterinarians in that line we detected it and changed accordingly. The manager of the ranch cannot, as assured me specialist in the matter, be too much blamed because there is always a certain amount of experience to acquire and we are always at the mercy of disease easily spread among animals in captivity.\nMoreover these animals that died were all male. So the school took the means to replace them in a way that the consequences of these deaths would not cause any prejudice in the breeding of the females. It was a question of time, not a day could be lost, the time in which these deaths occurred being the breeding season. We did not want call for any help from you who had been already so generous to us in paying the original stock. Consequently we secure ELEVEN proven breeders from Winnipeg. THE LIVE STOCK OF MINKS in the ranch at the time of the visit of Mr. T.G. Willis was not 46, but 50 less 9 what makes 41 plus 11 what makes 52 if we figure these eleven males, lent then by Mr. Arkins.\n\nI beg to report that Mr. T.G. Willis asked the manager of the ranch how many minks he was taking care, but put that question without seeming to put any other importance in his questions than the curiosity's sake. He never put to me any question and he probably never got that answer of 46 from the manager.\n\nIf you never got any report from us about the ranch it was because you did not determine any special date at which you wish to have this report made up and we were waiting for the results of the increase by births to do it. I intended as well to show you the cost of upkeep and the expectation this experiment could afford for the settlement of our graduates on their reserves.\n\nWe have sold the pelts of these dead males but they have not yielded much because they came from dead animals and because it was no more the season of pelting.\n\nI am at your disposal to give you any more information and wish to tell you that in spite of the many difficulties encountered in the perpetual improvement of our School, I am always ready to cooperate with the Department for the betterment in the education of our children.\n\nI remain yours very obediently,\n\nRev.

I do not presume to dispute the right of the Auditor General to request such explanations. I would point out, however, that the Indian Affairs Branch makes periodic returns of many thousands of head of livestock of different varieties throughout the country. Fluctuations large and small occur from day to day in their numbers. It would be a serious matter to us if we were called upon to give an explanation of every increase or decrease which naturally occurs in the ordinary course of stock breeding.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure.\nMay 29th 1939\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn connection with the Mink Ranch established at our School, I wish to inform you that some decision should be taken henceforth about the future of this new Branch attached to our School.\n\nExperience had proved us that the first year is a costly one for the upkeep of the ranch and would bring only a deficit for the School even if we are authorized to sell pelts from the pelting kits or adults after selection made for the increase of the livestock. The School should be as least partly reimbursed for these expenses from the natural increase of the livestock.\n\nNow, if we remember that the primary aim of that institution is to help and cooperate with the Department in the education of our children as well as the success of them when they become ex-graduate, we have to consider that this institution of the ranch should be detached from the School and made self-sustaining without however breaking all bonds that necessarily have to link them together.\n\nThe training of children (I say children and not students because they are, the Department should always remember it, children in the full strength of the word, leaving us when they just start to learn a little about work and moral education really start) in that particular branch should require 5 years. At the age of sixteen they cannot be trusted for keeping such a delicate stock on their own name. Moreover the bad habits prevailing amongst most of our Indians in Saskatchewan of the South, living nomadically in summer and spending some good time at the Regina Exhibition and local picnics, cannot allow the waste of such a precious source of revenue. Very few would be able to keep a very little number of these animals at home. This source of activity and probable source of income has to be put in a community business and with a good manager at the head until they show initiative and consistency enough to be trusted themselves. For the time being a white man alone can do it for that management. These people need bread to live and especially when young need to be taught how one has to manage his own money to secure a more certain and more plenty source of it.\n\nWho will give them that bread when starting a business that will yield only 2 or 3 years after?\nA residential School only can do it when equipped like ours with people ready to sacrifice something of their time and money. Nothing on the Reserve, where Officials of the Department have already enough to do for the most essentials of the very life itself of their wards, can be apparently expected except if the Department is ready to supply what required... and God knows how far it might go when Indians expect that the \"Government\" is behind.\n\nThis is my point of view in which I might be wrong. I do not want of course say that the Department is not capable of fulfilling its duties, but I think that an experience of this kind should have a certain \"loose string\" to prove that this particular industry is available for our ex-graduates.\n\nAnother point, that has to be brought up now, is to ask you what the Department expects from the School in return for the investment made by the Minister in the purchase of the foundation livestock and of a good part of the material used in the erection of the buildings? I suppose that it is only the help to start and occupy the youngsters fit to that work.\n\nMany of our boys will pass through that training or help in the work on the ranch and be recognized as unfit. This takes the time of a man to supervise and instruct them. That man has to be well paid if we want him interested in that kind of occupation. Shall the School pay all expenditures and never see any revenue? Or would it not be more convenient to entrust that manager of the whole business in abandoning him the whole thing and exacting from him a bond sufficient to cover the School and by the way the Department, which both have contributed to the building of the present livestock?\n\nI think advisable to settle so during the course of next Fall, with the charge of course for that man to continue to draw from the School or amongst our ex-graduates his help for giving these Boys the necessary training. He should be exacted of course to take care of that ranch in the same way as he does actually and provide after the three years training either money for the establishment of the graduate from his course of training or rather some tries to start with, or a partnership in the ranch, as will be decided by the Department and the Principal.\n\nI feel like offering the Department that if a Boy after his 16th year of age would be authorized to come back to the School for that training and the Department grants to the School on the behalf of that Boy a grant of the same amount as the one paid for the other children, the School will keep them and continue their education and be able to save enough from that grant to endow the said Boy when settling up.\nNot more than a few could be taken at the time, but I think that it will be the only way to settle for them the problem of self-sustaining life, and with an easy way for the Department to find a source of funds for it.\n\nI am rather sorry to have been so long and wish to have made the matter clear enough to be understood.\n\nHoping to hear soon from you in a way that a settlement of that question could be foreseen before holidays, I remain\n\nYours very obedient servant,\n\nRev. M de Bretagne O.M.I\nPrincipal.\n\nR.A Hoey.\nSuper. of Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Nat. Resources.\nOTTAWA. On.\nOttawa, June 7, 1939.\n\nDear Father de Bretagne:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 29th ultimo, in which you submit, for departmental consideration, certain proposals relating to the administration of the mink farm at your institution.\n\nI am not at all sure that I fully grasp the meaning or the significance of the suggestions you have sent forward. It is just possible that part of your letter at least is based on a misunderstanding of the agreement reached by the Department with Father Plourde at the time the mink ranch was established. I am sending forward, therefore, for your information, a copy of departmental letter to Father Plourde dated January 24, 1929, and his reply thereto dated February 4, 1939. Both these letters, you will note, are self-explanatory.\n\nThe mink ranch was established at the Lebret school in the hope that a certain number of the pupils would take an interest in the care and feeding of fur-bearing animals. It was not our hope at that time, nor is it our hope at the moment, that all the pupils would become interested in the mink. We do feel, however, that it is a good thing for Indian boys to become kindly disposed toward animals in general and fur-bearing animals in particular.\n\nIt was not our thought that many of the boys would undertake the operation of mink farms after their graduation from the school. It was rather our intention that a few of the boys, whose parents were well established on the reserve, might receive two or three mink at the time of their graduation and experiment in the raising of these animals in addition to their regular agricultural operations.\n\nThe mink are the property of the school and the increase of mink from year to year will also become the property of the school. You will note in our letter to Father Plourde we suggested that mink to the number of 50 might be given to a number of boys interested in the ranch at the time of their graduation. It is not at all necessary that the distribution should take place in a single year. As a matter of fact, there is no reason why you should not distribute about 10 a year for a period of five years. I am of the opinion that the\n\nReverend M. de Bretagne, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6331, file 660-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nmink ranch should be conducted in the same sense that the regular farming operations are conducted at the school. The ranch should be self-supporting. If it cannot be made self-supporting at your school, then Indians should certainly not be encouraged to raise mink. If it cannot be made self-supporting, serious consideration will have to be given to the disposal of the mink. It is certainly not our thought that you should operate the ranch at a loss or that it should become a source of worry or annoyance to you or the members of your staff. The ranch was established to help you and the pupils in attendance at your school and it would be very regrettable if it became a hindrance or a handicap in any sense.\n\nIt is just possible that none of the Indian boys this year or next year would be sufficiently trained to take care of a few minks. If this is the case, no distribution of animals could be made until the boys are sufficiently trained to take care of them. You will have to exercise your own judgment in respect to the number of mink you should sell from year to year in an attempt to meet the running expenses of the ranch.\n\nYou might let me hear from you again when you have had an opportunity to study the correspondence between the Department and Father Plourde.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJune 1, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School Mink\nFarm, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of May 13 and my reply of May 16 with reference to the Departmental Auditor's report dated April 25, 1939, in connection with the number of mink at the above-mentioned school.\n\nIn a letter dated May 27 the Principal of the Qu'Appelle residential school writes as follows:\n\n\"I beg to inform you that the stock of mink at the ranch started at our school under your auspices consists of the following number:\n\n\"Originally bought from Mr. M. Arkins, Winnipeg, by the Indian Affairs Branch as a foundation stock:\n\nNumber of males ....15\nNumber of females ..35\n\n\"Since November we have had to sustain the following losses:\n\nCause Determined by Veterinary\n\nJanuary 1, 1939 - 1 male 24.38 - acidosis\nFebruary 16, 1939 - 1 \" 74.39 - penis enlargement\nMarch 3, 1939 - 1 \" 31.38 - acidosis\nMarch 7, 1939 - 1 \" 124.38 -\nMarch 8, 1939 - 1 \" 12.38 -\nMarch 8, 1939 - 1 \" 62.38 -\nMarch 8, 1939 - 1 \" 42.38 -\nMarch 9, 1939 - 1 \" 92.38 -\n\nTotal - 9 lost by death\n\nThe Auditor General,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\"Since that date we have had numerous births increasing our stock by an estimated number of 110. The exact number of the births will be reported as soon as we definitely know it. For the time being it is impossible to disturb the mothers to secure a more accurate inquiry.\n\n\"As you might notice these 9 mink that died this spring practically all died from the same disease the origin of which has to be blamed on a wrong way of nutrition. With the help of veterinarians in that line we detected it and changed accordingly. The manager of the ranch cannot, as I was assured by a specialist in the matter, be too much blamed because there is always a certain amount of experience to acquire and we are always at the mercy of disease easily spread among animals in captivity.\n\n\"Moreover these animals that died were all male so the school took the means to replace them in a way that the consequences of these deaths would not cause any prejudice in the breeding of the females. It was a question of time. Not a day could be lost as the time in which these deaths occurred was in the breeding season. We did not want to call for any help from you who had been already so generous to us in buying for the original stock. Consequently we secured 11 proven breeders from Winnipeg. The number of mink in the ranch at the time of the visit of Mr. T.G. Willis was not 46 but 30 less 9, or 41 plus the 11 which makes 52 if we figure the 11 males lent by Mr. Arkins.\n\n\"I beg to report that Mr. T.G. Willis asked the manager of the ranch how many mink he was taking care of but put that question without seeming to place any more importance in his question than curiosity. He never put to me any question and he probably never got that answer of 46 from the manager.\"\n\"If you never got any report from us about the ranch it was because you did not determine any special date at which you wished to have this report made up and we were waiting for the results of the increase by births to do it. I intended as well to show you the cost of upkeep and the expectation this experiment could afford for the settlement of our graduates on their reserves.\n\n\"We have sold the pelts of these dead males but they have not yielded much because they came from dead animals and because it was not the season of pelting.\n\n\"I am at your disposal to give you any more information and wish to tell you that in spite of the many difficulties encountered in the perpetual improvement of our school, I am always ready to co-operate with the Department for the betterment in the education of our children.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nPP\nMr. R.A. Hoey  \nSuperintendent Welfare & Training  \nOttawa\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI had a long talk yesterday with Father M. de Bretagne on the mink ranch which he has, with your generous help, established in connection with the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.\n\nThis new school activity is still groping for light and it will likely be a few years before the right methods of operation have been evolved. The balance sheet to date is very much unbalanced, showing a very decided unfavourable condition. The sale of pelts next November should help to defray some of the expenses incurred within the last twelve months, although not near enough to balance off the cash outlay to date; and conditions should improve each year as the natural increase in the ranch population will make that possible.\n\nThe question of help is not quite as simple as we had esteemed it would be. We find that the ranch must be in the hands of a competent manager and that the management of the ranch must be a full-time job. The ranch, therefore, must be large enough to provide revenue for the salary of the manager.\n\nThe training of the oldest school boys in mink ranching involves various problems of a practical nature and there again our early conceptions have suffered greatly. We find, for instance, that only a very few select boys...\nare susceptible of learning the art of mink ranching; that at the age of 16 Indian boys are too young to be accorded much confidence; that only boys who have attained their 18th year and who have otherwise given proof of stability of character should be selected for this activity.\n\nAs in practice all boys at the present time are dismissed from residential schools at the age of 16 it would seem that some exception should be made in favour of boys that the Principal might wish to train as mink ranchers, and that whilst they would be nominally on the school roll, they would be exempt from all ordinary school activities and allowed to spend all their time with the manager of the ranch. This, of course, could only be done if the Department allowed the per capita grant for such boys without reducing the regular grant of the school.\n\nI understand that there is a special fund voted each year by the Government for special and technical training of Indian boys. If this information is correct we hope that your Department will allow the school a special grant for three or four boys that would give their full time to mink ranching.\n\nMay I hope that you will give this matter your kind attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I did not neglect any detail either to make one member of our staff competent in that line, or to take our share in the establishment of this new branch of occupation.\n\nI do not call this essay a failure, but a fair trial and the appearance of our ranch has struck many an amateur, \"connaisseur\" or mink rancher and favorably I should say.\n\nIt might be that if you decide to transfer to some other school the original minks it will be required some of the pens as well to start more cheaply and more easily a beginning of ranch. I would offer you willingly to help for the transport of these minks with the double pens available by means of my truck and even our ranch manager if necessary. The only condition required would be for instance that the school to which it is destined pay the gas for the trip.\n\nIf any other ex-graduate could be tried with some chance of success to be given one trio, I would mention you his name if you are favorable to my proposition.\n\nI remain yours very obediently,\n\nRev. M de Bretagne G.M.I\nPrincipal.\n\nto R.A Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training\nOttawa. Indian Affairs Branch.\nI beg to submit to your consideration the following remarks and report about the Mink ranch established at our School.\n\n1\u00b0- The hope put by the Department on the interest that had to be taken in the care and feeding of fur-bearing animals had been answered by our big Boys and even a few have shown a real skill in so doing. The manager of the ranch had done his best to make our students understand the whole matter by his lectures on these animals and their care and this through the mean of studies and conferences, as that fact had been reported to the Department. One Boy named Louis Bellegarde who was a \"pioneer\", having been sent to Winnipeg to be trained a year ago will probably succeed and deserves some help. Many others have shown a temporary interest that sooner or later dropped into disgust either because they were too young to understand yet, or because the monotony of a too regular occupation was inborn in them by atavism.\n\n2\u00b0- Your second suggestion in the above mentioned letter about the undertaking of mink farming by our graduates has to be studied with the conditions special to Saskatchewan. Our country is not like Manitoba endowed with plentiful game, I mean South Saskatchewan where most of our pupils come from. These last years have made the situation growing worse. The rabbits are completely missing and they could have provided a good supply of food to the Mink rancher, an aliment almost complete for the mink in captivity. Old horses are very scarce since the great drought of 1937 and the epidemic of encephalitis. There is no fish much available.... Consequently, even on the advice of our Agents, there is very little hope that any of these graduates could afford the food necessary for the upkeep even of a few minks. These animals are very delicate and need a very regular care; with the best intention, it seems impossible for our ex-graduates to be able to provide for it.\n\n3\u00b0- The following paragraph about the property of the mink...\nto Mr Hoey-\n\nmink and the means to support the upkeep of the ranch permits me to tell you frankly that I have lost all hope that it be one day so for us. That ranch costs me much and I cannot continue on that basis because I would be unable to afford for it. A close study of the cost for upkeep shows me that only a man working for himself could expect some return specially if he is fortunate to secure the food at low price.\n\nNow that we have to pay one man, competent and on a full-time job, that we have to secure food from Winnipeg it will require quite a good sum of money to make the ranch self-supporting. There is no doubt that our minks are very good, so declared the Official Inspector but the market is very instable and I have now very serious doubts that even alive we will be able to secure money enough to pay only a good part of the next year expenses. Even with the generous help granted by the Department for the foundation stock costing $1200.00 more or some $300.00 for the buildings, the School had to spend some $500.00. Aside of this the wages of a man since a year and the food of the minks amounting often at $90.00 or little less a month.\n\nThe budget of my School is too heavy to allow me any expense of that kind.\n\nSome ten days ago I have visited a Mink ranch near Lake Dauphin, apparently very prosperous. When I investigated the reason of his success, I found that it was in great part due to the cheapness of the food and of course the lack of overhead in the management.\n\nMy conclusion is that in spite of the proposition made by Rev.F.Plourde to have 2 or 3 big boys receiving a grant to follow that training in our ranch I think that it will not be wise to continue it in our part of the country. I would propose that the original minks less the nine dead be put at the disposal of the Department to be distributed in the Schools where food for mink is cheaper (Pine Creek, Sandy Bay etc., may be some day School as Water Hen) or other at the choice of the Department, but where decidedly fish is plentiful and cheap. Taken in small quantity, one or 2 trios in each there will not be any overhead etc... One trio could be given to Louis Bellegarde with the understanding of never selling any without the Agent's permission. The increase of minks (86) could be disposed of by the School for reimbursement of our expenses.\n\nI am sorry to have come to that conclusion, but I could assure the Department that I have given a loyal cooperation in that desire of creating in our ex-graduates an occupation that would have helped them to render them self-\nMr Hoey -\n\nsupporting, I did not neglect any detail either to make one member of our staff competent in that line, or to take our share in the establishment of this new branch of occupation.\n\nI do not call this essay a failure, but a fair trial and the appearance of our ranch had struck many an amateur, \"connaisseur\" or mink rancher and favorably I should say.\n\nIt might be that if you decide to transfer to some other school the original minks it will be required some of the pens as well to start more cheaply and more easily a beginning of ranch.

M de Bretagne\nPrincipal\n\nto R.A Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training\nOttawa, Indian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa,\nAugust 24, 1939.\n\nDear Doctor Robertson:\n\nYou are no doubt aware that about a year ago a mink ranch was established by the Department at the Qu'Appelle Indian residential school. The cost of the mink and the building in which they are located was borne by the Department.\n\nThis experiment was undertaken after the matter had been very fully discussed with Father Plourde and referred to the Minister. The Minister expressed the view at that time that the care and feeding of fur-bearing animals might well form a part of the course of study at an Indian residential school. It was not the intention of the Minister, nor was it our intention, that these boys should establish mink ranches immediately following their graduation from school. The thought was that the care and feeding of animals would create, or be apt to create, in the Indian pupil a more kindly disposition toward the care and feeding of animals in general.\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from the principal in which he states that the experiment has been in no sense a success. He states it is costly, too costly to be borne by the institution, and that he has been called upon to engage a man to devote the whole of his time to the supervision of the ranch. The food of the mink, he states, is also very costly in that particular section of Saskatchewan.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that a mistake was made at the outset in the purchase of so many mink. In the light of the experience we have had it would have been much better if the Church authorities had purchased two or three pairs of mink rather than fifty. However, in\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nmost things it is comparatively easy to be wise afterwards. I am anxious that you should visit the Qu'Appelle school at your earliest convenience and discuss with the Principal the best ways and means of disposing of these mink at a price that will not involve too great a financial loss to the Department. The suggestion made by the Principal that these mink should be transferred to other schools or to Indians is wholly unsatisfactory to the Department. If the Principal of the Qu'Appelle school, having received these mink without cost, is unable to operate a ranch profitably then it is simply absurd to ask other schools or other Indians to take up mink ranching in the hope that it will prove a success. The mink purchased by the Department should be sold to the best possible advantage and the money returned to the Department. The increase that has taken place might be disposed of by the school and the money received given to the school to compensate the Principal for any loss he has sustained in the operation of the ranch.\n\nI regret very much indeed that this experiment has proved to be so unsuccessful. I know that the news of its failure will be a source of great disappointment to the Minister. I am gradually being forced to the conclusion that our residential schools, with one or two exceptions, are not equipped to undertake with any hope of success projects other than the elementary instruction of Indian boys and girls in reading, writing and arithmetic. You are more familiar than I am with their farming operations. The auditor's report suggests that these operations, except in the case of one or two schools, are in no sense profitable. The Principal of the Qu'Appelle school is, in my judgment, one of the ablest Principals we have anywhere in the Dominion and if he cannot make a success of a project such as mink ranching the outlook at the other schools is in no sense encouraging.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nAugust 24, 1939.\n\nDear Father de Bretagne:\n\nRe: Mink Ranch\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in which you intimate that the mink ranch established about a year ago at your school has been in no sense a success.\n\nI am today communicating with Dr. Robertson in respect to this matter and I am enclosing, for your information, copy of the letter I have sent forward to the Inspector. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory. It is my hope that we may be able to dispose of the mink at a reasonable price and thus escape the loss that might ordinarily accrue.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. M. de Bretagne, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\nQu'Appelle Indian School\nLebret, Sask.,\nSeptember 20th 1938.\n\nRev. Father Plourde, O.M.I.,\n597 McDermott Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Reverend Father:\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 16th instant, I have carefully read the quotation you made about Mr. Hoey's letter and following the remarks therein made, I wish to call the attention of the Department on the following observations.\n\nAll the courses of training referred to were always taught in our school, in as much as circumstances allowed us to do so; for the girls, sewing, crochet work, the tailoring of their own dresses were always in favor, and the proof might be found in the fact that we always obtain for them a great number of prizes at the Provincial Exhibitions.\n\nAside of this they are good helpers in the housekeeping and they are a big help in the kitchen, the laundry and the different up-keep of the house. Here they are very active and the neat appearance of the school is in great part due to the splendid direction given by the Sisters, very devoted and very particular about that kind of work.\n\nIt is now true that the finishing touches making more thorough that training would be improved by the center of Domestic Science which we are actively considering and for which plans have already been made, but in as much as the many managements of a house of this scale allows me to do so.\n\nThe graduates of our school, without the pretention of becoming white women, have however in the past already improved considerably the up-keep of their own homes especially when these youngsters have been encouraged by local officials. The unhappy circum-\nFather Plourde\n\n2 September 20th\n\nstances very often must have prevented these officials from giving to these people the means of starting on a good footing and this was probably the cause of the falling back of some girls into their rather primitive state.\n\nAs in every enterprise, we have to figure with a certain number of \"second\" products but our work of civilizing these people is a work of generations.\n\nNow for the boys, a very good training was always given in the care of live-stock and agriculture. It is true that we might contemplate some means of giving them more initiative and enthusiasm by interesting directly the boys and girls in the raising of calves, chickens and maybe individual garden plots but here we are facing a big difficulty which arises from the fact that the children need a contact with the home called holidays, during which time they will abandon the garden work and the fruit of their efforts will be lost.\n\nThe results obtained in the past have not to be altogether overlooked. Moreover the first bad impression given by the sight of many failures in different reserves on difficult cases must be analysed before jumping too early to the conclusion that Residential School graduates would have failed on account of a too ineffective training.\n\nWe do not think that the old missionary had thoroughly expected to transform the Indian into a white man and if criticism could find room in this new field of observation, we realize that justice should be given to their efforts and very often their self-sacrificed applied to their compulsory transformation of these people, formerly nomads into settlers animated by ideals of comfort in life and a christian code of morals.\n\nThe ideal crowning of our course of training is the settlement of our boys and girls on a little farm where they will receive encouragement, substantial help and this in a new place in as much as possible located away from the parents. The colony near File Hills has given proof in the past of real success when well supervised and intelligently managed in a period of prosperity. Indian families successful in their agricultural projects here were mostly produced by Residential Schools where habits of discipline were given them.\n\nThe Qu'Appelle Indian School has produced in the past Carpenters and Blacksmiths who now-a-days, sometimes, do not put in practice their trade for reasons that do not depend on actual Principals or missionaries.\n\nI repeat that we always have to figure with the natural incli-\nnation of Indians to go back to their nomadic life rather than to be under the regular life of the white man.\n\nThere is no room in Canada for Indians living like their ancestors, and to my knowledge, the Catholic missionaries have always attempted to adapt them to the conditions that will surround them in the future. It is always a hard task for them because they have to struggle against the natural tendency of human beings to take the most easy way to reach their end.\n\nTo conclude, I must assure the Department that, in my rather important school, I intend to work in close cooperation with the Branch of Welfare and Training of our Department, and adapt our teaching to their practical aims. I will try to use all means dictated by my past experience to conduct these children in the direction pointed out by Mr. Hoey. I have done my best to keep healthy and even, to often improve the health of these children. We try to make them enjoy that life of discipline by games and sports.\n\nWhen occasionally we have the chance of keeping some big boys after 16 years of age, we give them the chance of training in elementary work of carpentry and blacksmithing. The conclusion of the experience of the past seems to make us avoid shoemaking and tailoring for the boys, as well as spinning and weaving for the girls because of competitive facilities in low prices for the same kind of goods coming from manufacturing centers.\n\nThe only future of our people stands in the settling of our boys and girls, kept away from their family in colonies of small self-sustaining farms, where the first effort of education given in school will be continued by intelligent and devoted officials.\n\nBut the sojourn in Residential Schools for youngsters who leave at the brim of their 16 years in very beneficial to them and far more effective than in the Day School where attendance is almost never regular, and will certainly be improved by a practical training crowning their education if made in the way indicated by Mr. Hoey, especially if we have a chance to do it in the conditions enumerated above.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nM. de Bretagne, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Yours 114-C-11 Aug. 24th and 109-1-5 June 7th\n\nKindly allow me to make different remarks about your state of mind concerning this Mink ranch business as well as the judgment you thought necessary to pass on Residential Schools in your letter to Dr. Robertson. I wish indeed to defend myself because I consider that our Mink ranch was in some sense a success. If we consider the ranching point of view and the average crop in other ranches it was a success. An average of three kits is a success. That you chose the point of view of teaching our pupils the care and feeding of fur-bearing animals, as well as creating interest and a more kindly disposition toward the care and feeding of animals in general as you mentioned in your letters, here yet we ascertain that we had a success too. The only point left to be considered is the financial loss involved to the Department.\n\nNobody could say what will be the price of these pelts or breeders now that the war broke out, but it was no doubt that no loss would have had to be involved to the Department without this last circumstance but it would have been a loss for the School to have undertaken this experiment because it is a fact recognized by all ranchers that to manage a self-sustaining ranch one has to get the greatest possible pelt value of mink. Father Plourde took advice from prominent Manitoban ranchers who told him so, and if, as you think, we would have been wiser in purchasing some three pairs of mink rather than fifty, I do not see why now it is (as you said) absurd to transfer to other Schools or Indians such a small number to constitute so many experiments on a smaller scale than ours.\n\nThe country and individuals where I had proposed the Department to transfer the original stock of our foundation would have been I think a better way of disposing of these mink than to declare our trial a failure. The great cause of our worries lies in the too great cost of food in our part of Saskatchewan, a fact that I had more or less considered before we started but that was however one of my intimate reasons why I reluctantly accepted to make that experiment and secondly because, as I have mentioned above, to have this business profitable or at least self-sustaining, I needed to hire an extra full time hand who would take care of a great number of mink.\n\nThe conclusion seems to be that personally I had realized that in our conditions we would never make the ranch much profitable and even probably compel me to operate it at a loss. So I have submitted to you a scheme by which it seemed to me that the Department would have been able to continue the experiment in a wiser manner. In doing so I had in mind your remark expressed on page 2, letter 109-1-5, saying \"If it cannot be made self-supporting, serious consideration will have to be given to the disposal of the mink.\"\n\nI had accepted the eventuality of losing money in the operation of a mink ranch that in our conditions proved to be impossible to manage otherwise; I had advised the Department in a way that it would be possible to attempt an experiment in the sense that yourself by chance think that we should have started; I think wise yet now to dare to call again your attention upon this last proposition and see if even now after that state of war of our nation, it would not be advisable to contemplate another scheme for the disposal of our original stock than to declare...\nourselves vanquished. It would certainly be less humiliating than to avow to the Minister a supposed failure.\n\nIn the example illustrating my comparison in my letter of Aug. 17th, I had pointed out to you the possibility of finding places where our Schools and Indians could keep mink at a very low cost. Experiment on a small scale could be undertaken there without much difficulty it seems to me.\n\nWhen Dr Robertson would be back from his holidays I will discuss the matter with him according to your wishes, but formerly I would wish to have your opinion again on that matter.\n\nNow, with all the respect that I owe you, and without prejudice for the kind dispositions you never failed to show me, I have to tell you that the remarks you thought necessary to pass on our Schools in your letter to Dr Robertson are in my point of view the conclusion of a premature judgment.\n\nAs you seem to give here a strong argument to Dr Robertson against Schools for which he has already many prejudices, I think that you will not object that I personally interfere in the discussion to put my word.\n\nYou conclude that the Residential Schools are generally not equipped to \"undertake with any hope of success projects other than the elementary instruction of Indian boys and girls in reading, writing and arithmetic,\" that \"their farming operations are generally in no sense profitable.\"\n\nThese two statements are no doubt preposterous for the following reasons:\n\n1. Would it be for most of the reserves' expectation that the residential schools would provide to the children, that the department according to the Indian Act is supposed to send to school, these elements of instruction it would already be a success if compared with the results obtained in some reserves by the day school. If I mention this comparison it is because that argumentation directs exclusively to the choice between these two kinds of school. Many reserves and the nomadic life of many Indians do not leave any margin for another choice. If we are interested in the welfare of Indians we have to realize that the basis of life is education, a word that means far more than a mere teaching of reading and speaking a language. Your special Branch being welfare & training there is no doubt that you wish to see this purpose executed. It had been realized in the past in no other way was left to educate the future of the Indians for the betterment of the race than to take the children from their surroundings and in spite of many difficulties try to change what had to be changed. Owing to the fact that in taking their country we were changing their races we were bound to exterminate them or to adapt them to new circumstances. It would be too long to make you understand that assimilation has only that purpose in mind, because the betterment of the new life of the Indian was at the same time doing a parallel result in their soul. It might seem to a newcomer into that work that the result was not equal to what could be expected and that apparently mistakes were made in that line, but experience will teach him that if it's good to be sometimes progressive, it is dangerous to be too premature in one's judgment. That kind of work is a slow work and a work of generations and sometimes of assimilation. For your own edification may I be permitted to refer you to a copy of a letter sent a year ago to P. Plourde. In it you will see what we consider to have done on behalf of preparation of our children to their future life in the reserves.\n\n2. It is a fact that most of the farms owned by White farmers did not bring much profit. Today after the economic problems of the nation farmers are becoming slowly but surely proletarians whose losses are absorbed by the Commonwealth. And when these farms are rented, they often do not bring back any yield to their owner because in many cases of them last years, when they were not well situated they were given only to their manager a profit comparable to simple wages, when they had not to be sold for taxes to no buyer... Now farm operated by Residential school is not there for the mere purpose of bringing profit. It is there as was my Mink ranch for the purpose of teaching the children habits of working, ways of doing it etc... The Auditor's report cannot always show the good and profitable\nside of the School farming operation. For instance the value of the by-products of the farm that help for reducing the cost of food etc...\n\n-3- If the Indian Act would be effectively put in force in details that would uproot some bad habits of the Indian wards, and if some change would be made to prevent bad conduct in the wardlock, there is no doubt that the post-scholar problems would be solved by the very fact that discipline and morality would exist in the families where our children are supposed to go back. This problem is not the problem of the residential schools and consequently could not be blamed to not adapting themselves to the future surroundings of their graduates. But however here is arising the question: Shall we attempt to better the Indian problem or shall we be satisfied with half-measures and blame indiscriminately those who devote themselves with encouraging results (for those who have the time to wait) to the welfare and training of the Indian Youth?\n\nElementary instruction, better knowledge of their duties and obligations, better health, knowledge of discipline in as much as their discharge age allows them to have, knowledge in some art as drawing, music etc., knowledge for girls of housekeeping science and for boys of good habits of working.... all this for children leaving at the brim of their youth. Such is a gross enumeration of quite a change in children taken from the wilderness and they constitute quite an asset for those in charge of continuing that work in the time of their whole life, since the organization of the Indians' life is the share of the Department in hands of whom is trusted the care of the Queen's wards.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nRev. M.de Bretagne O.M.I\nPrincipal.\n\nTo R.A Hoey\nSup. Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Br.,\nOTTAWA.\n\n1 encl.\nOttawa, September 14, 1938.\n\nDear Father de Bretagne:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, in which you ask the Department to reconsider the desirability of distributing the mink now at your school to a number of other residential schools in the prairie provinces.\n\nA few weeks ago I received a request from Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, province of Manitoba, for the establishment of a number of mink ranches at residential schools in Manitoba. This request was due, no doubt, to the pressure exercised upon the Inspector by mink ranch owners in Manitoba, who were anxious to dispose of mink at a good price for breeding stock. I intimated to Inspector Hamilton that we had at Lebret a number of mink that we were anxious to dispose of, to the greatest possible advantage. I did state, however, that in my judgment it would be almost impossible to make a success of a mink ranch at a residential school. I take the position that the Lebret school is one of the most efficient, if not the most efficient, in the Dominion, and, if the mink ranch under the direct personal supervision of yourself could not be operated successfully at the institution, there is little chance of it being a success at other schools. However, I would have no serious objection to the transfer of a few of the mink to one or two residential schools in the prairie provinces that might be selected by Dr. Robertson and Inspector Hamilton. This transfer would have to be made on the distinct understanding that the school receiving the mink\n\nRev. M. de Bretagne, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\nwould become responsible for the construction of the pens and any other incidental expenses that might arise. In view of the war conditions now confronting us, there is no money in this Department at the present time, nor is there likely to be any in the immediate future, for the promotion of such projects.\n\nI am sending forward a copy of this letter to Dr. Robertson.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 26, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference your 114-0-11 of August 24.\n\nI regret to report that, owing to recent work as well as to the fact that for a couple of weeks I wasn't very well and able to cover as much ground as I should have, I did not get an opportunity to visit the Lebret School with reference to Mink until yesterday when I discussed the matter fully with Father de Bretagne. The Principal has gone to a great deal of trouble and to considerable expense in fitting out and establishing this Mink Ranch. His increase has been equalized to the records of the best commercial ranches. Consequently he has demonstrated that Mink Farming can be carried on successfully under his personal supervision. It isn't through any fault of his that the project has not proved a financial success but, due to the fact that he has to have a man especially for that purpose and the high cost of food.\n\nI have paid considerable attention to Fur Farming as I have a number of friends who have been engaged in it for years both in the West and in the East. It is a business that requires a great deal of study and strict personal attention to make it a financial success under present conditions. Only recently I was talking to a friend of mine from Lloydminster who has been conducting a Fur Farm of both Fox and Mink for some years and they informed me that it is only by giving his strict personal attention and watching all expenditures very carefully that they are able to make a profit, they also state that with good stock and the closest\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\nsupervision their profit is not more than $5.00 a piece, at present prices.\n\nIn considering what action should be taken with regard to these Mink, I think the first problem we have to consider is, will the ultimate benefit to the Indian warrant the expenditures necessary to continue the Ranch, personally I do not believe it will as stated before Fur Farming demands constant care and attention. We find it very difficult to get the Indian to milk cattle, they do not want to be tied down. We might possibly find an Indian here and there who would do this, but, that the few successes would not compensate for the expenditure in the great number of failures we would have, I am of the opinion that we should confine our efforts in Fur Farming to Beaver and Rats. These do not require constant supervision, they rustle for themselves and we have found that where a Band has Rats or Beavers on their Reserves they will protect them each member becoming a Game Guardian to see that other members of the Band do not destroy them.\n\nWith regard to transferring a number of these Minks to other schools at points where food would be cheaper, I entirely disagree as these schools would be in the North where we have very little supervision of the Indian except right at the School and to operate a Ranch at a School for the teaching of these Indians Fur Farming, with the establishing of them in that business after they left school would, in my opinion, simply be a waste of money. The Indian of the North moves around much more than the Indian of the South, they would not be tied down continually in one place consequently, would not give the attention necessary. I am strongly convinced that any efforts that are made to get the Indian to take up Fur Farming should be made in our Southern districts where the Indian no longer traps and has more or less accustomed himself to staying at home. I am also convinced that the time is not yet ripe to do this in view of these circumstances, the fact that we are now at war will, no doubt, greatly reduce the present price of fur, I do not believe that we would be warranted in making the expenditure necessary to continue this Ranch at Lebret and if we cannot hope to make a success of it there with, I think, the ablest and most competent Principal in the Dominion of Canada, I fail to see how we could make a success of it elsewhere. I have talked this matter over with Father de Bretagne and, I think, he is of the same opinion as myself, that we should as soon as the furs prime, pelt the stock on hand and close the Ranch unless in the meantime we should be able to find\nbuyers for them which is very improbable as I do not think anyone will go into Mink, or increase their stock by purchasing while this war is on.\n\nI did not discuss with Father Bretagne the matter of allowing him the increase for the purpose of recuperating his personal expenditures but, I think it should be done as he has devoted a great deal of time and attention as well as being out considerable money in the project.\n\nRe your remarks that you were forced to the conclusion that our residential schools, with one or two exceptions, are not equipped to undertake with any hope of success projects other than the elementary instruction of Indian boys and girls in reading, writing and arithmetic. I am in full accord with you in the opinion. I am also strongly of the opinion that the Day Schools will do much more in the solving of our Indian problem than the Residential Schools, at the same time I am satisfied that much more can be done in our Residential Schools than is being done at present. For example at Lebret School yesterday I visited a building that they had fitted up for the purpose of instructing the girls in Domestic Science. This building is completely furnished with furniture such as any Indian could purchase. They have a cook stove, cupboards, wash tubs, wash boards, irons for heating on the stove, etc. These girls are taught how to cook, bake, wash, iron and carry on the work just as they should in their own home. They have a nice Dining Room and I had the pleasure of having lunch there yesterday, prepared and served by these girls. If this work was carried on in our other schools and the boys given the same instructions they are receiving there in Manual Training, Agriculture, etc., more of their time given to this work and less to higher education, I think the girls and boys would leave the school much better prepared for life on the Reserve than under the program now being carried on by most of our other residential schools.\n\nIf we could get a few more Principals like Father de Bretagne, I think, a great improvement could be made for the benefit of all.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, September 30, 1939.\n\nRe: Mink ranch - Lebret School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein. The views you express are very much in accord with my own, in respect to the operation of mink farms at Indian residential schools.\n\nI am still of the opinion, however, that a certain amount of misunderstanding still exists in your mind and in the mind of the Principal in respect to the purpose for which this mink ranch was established. In this regard, may I again refer you to the second paragraph of my letter of August 24, 1939. The thought in establishing the ranch was the feeding and care of these animals to develop a tendency in the Indian pupil to be more kindly disposed toward animals in general. It was never our thought or intention that pupils graduating from Indian residential schools should go in extensively, if at all, for mink farming.\n\nI am disposed to think, also, that some misunderstanding exists at Lebret with respect to the feeding of these animals. There are large mink ranches comparatively close to Ottawa, and an official of the Department, who retired a year or two ago, has been operating a successful mink ranch in the Gatineau country. I have visited a number of these ranches and the men in charge inform me that the cost of the food supply is comparatively insignificant. They smiled when I informed -\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nI informed them that horse flesh was purchased for the mink at Lebret. Most of them attributed the remark to my Irish humor and asked me how many horses mink usually killed and devoured in their natural state. In any event, I do not know that any good purpose can be served at this date in reviewing the factors that have contributed to the non-success of the project. It is not at all likely that we shall make a similar experiment at any time in the immediate future.\n\nYou are authorized to proceed with the disposal of these mink in such a manner that the loss will be kept down to the lowest possible figure. I concur in your recommendation that the increase that has taken place should be allowed the Principal for the expenditures he has already made in the operation of the ranch.\n\nI was interested in your reference to the Model Indian Home, operated by the girls at Lebret. A number of Indian schools have adopted such homes and there is no reason whatever why the principals of other schools in Saskatchewan should not follow the example of Lebret in establishing such a home for the training of girls. In view of war conditions, of course, expenditures will have to be kept very low.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 19, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copies of certain correspondence relating to the operation of the mink farm at the Morley U.C. residential school.\n\nI am sending forward copies of this correspondence to Father Plourde and Inspector Robertson.\n\nMay I, on behalf of the members of the staff and myself, express the hope that you and your associates will spend a very enjoyable Christmas and that the New Year ahead of us will be for you successful in every sense.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend M. de Bretagne, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Yours Dec. 19th 1939 -\n\nI have received the correspondence you mentioned therein and beg to submit to your kind consideration that the remarks you make to Dr Robertson are in the correct sense. A mink ranch should start in a small way and operated under competent management and then could be measurably successful, if the fur business is normal.\n\nWe have overcome the drawback of the fur business at large. It was successful, our average being 5 by female. Their yield would have been extremely good because they were of a good strain.\n\nNow, their feeding cost was lower than the one experienced on the Morley U.C Residential School. Our total cost of feed amounts to $852.63 for an initial stock of 50 mink raised to the 126 figure in Spring\u2014amounting to 37/40 daily ration, which puts our daily ration of food to 2,264 in other words $8.24 a day\u2014a saving of $1.24 on the Morley feeding cost of $9.00\u2014with the same kind of food.\n\nI intend to submit to you soon a general report on the operation of our mink ranch as soon as we will get the return on our pelts trusted to the Hudson Bay Co for sale. You will judge by yourself at the reading of the figures that we could not make any money in the bad year in which we started. We had indeed to figure with the wages of the labour employed & the management of that ranch as Inspector Scott himself is mentioning in his report, as well as some other indispensable expenditures.\n\nWith the collapse of the fur market you will easily imagine that more profitable investment of money than to bury one's scarce funds in a business that with proper management costs 2 dollars for each dollar invested and collected after the operation, could be made.\n\nIn spite of this apparent failure I take opportunity of this letter to thank you for having trusted me to experience this branch, feeling well that in reading my answer you will realize that no effort was spared by us for a success of the Minister's plan to improve our Indian self supporting problem.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nRev.

After advertising, on his advice I tried to sale some mink for breeding purpose, but customers were scarce and very cautious on account of war conditions and poor prospects for the market. Consequently I had to accept what I could secure and got for them an average price of $11.00. It looked bad, but I expected that the pelt market would yield better, especially on account of the encouraging remarks made by visitors included the Inspector appointed by the Department of Natural Resources of Saskatchewan, on the good quality of our mink.\n\nBut, it was written that our experiment was doomed to unsuccess. Winter practically did not exist in our beautiful Valley and unhappily the pelts seemed to take time to \"prime\".\n\nThe latest possible in December we started to\npelt in a way to arrive on time on New York market for the mid January sale, supposed to be a good one.\n\nHere again, no chance, we yielded around $497.00 for 90 pelts, by the report of Lampson, Fraser & Ruth a good firm of Montreal to which we were directed by the Hudson Bay Co., that found our pelts of a good grade.\n\nI wish that these explanations will show to you how hard it is for me to present such a report after so many efforts made by the Department and by the School. Like I told you already I am proud to have been chosen for that experiment but, today, I have to add that I expect some token of your appreciation in helping us by the authorization to keep the sum that will soon be into my hands.\n\nI remain\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo R.A. Hoey\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nEncl.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention Mr. R. A. Hoey,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Father de Bretagne in which he requests me to ask that the proceeds of the sale of the minks of his ranch be allotted to him in full. He wishes to use these funds for the purpose of building an addition to the school barn. He informs me that this addition is very necessary. Years ago, when the school barn was erected less pressure was brought to bear on the school management to give fresh milk to all the school pupils. However, nurses and doctors insist now that all the children be given a fair supply of milk every day. In order to do this, the Lebret Principal has had to keep more milk cows than formerly and it is necessary therefore to enlarge the school barn.\n\nHoping that you will favorably consider Father de Bretagne's request, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

School,\nFebruary 12, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe - The enclosed report - Mink Ranch\n\nI beg to submit to you for your kind consideration the report of our expenditures for the management of our Mink Ranch.\n\nFollowing my letter Dec. 26th, 1939, in which I drew a comparison between the cost of feed at the U. C. Morley School and ours, I wish to call your attention upon the fact that our management was not successful on the point of view of profits.\n\nAs I cannot share the responsibility of that loss due in great part to the adverse conditions met with, particularly the outbreak of the fall illness account of the European war, I would ask you if there would not be any possibility for me to keep the proceeds of the whole sale in reimbursement of the loss sustained in the operation of the ranch; as you suggested to Dr. Robertson in your letter dated August 24th, for the increase of the ranch.\n\nIn that letter indeed you gave order to Dr. Robertson that the mink purchased by the Department had to be sold to the best advantage and the money returned to the Department, and that the increase be given to the school to compensate our loss.\n\nNow, Dr. Robertson, after his visit to our ranch, authorized me on Oct. 11th to dispose of these mink. After advertising, on his advice I tried to sell some mink for breeding purposes, but the market seemed very cautious on account of war conditions and poor prospects for the future. Consequently I had to accept what I could secure and I got for them an average price of $11.00. It looked bad, but I expected that the pelt market would yield better, especially on account of the encouraging remarks made by visitors included the Inspector appointed by the Department of Natural Resources of Saskatchewan, on the good quality of our mink.\n\nBut, it was written that our experiment was doomed to unsuccess. Winter practically did not exist in our beautiful Valley and unhappily the pelts seemed to take time to \"prime\".\n\nThe latest possible in December we started to pelt in a way to arrive on time on New York market for the mid January sale, supposed to be a good one.\n\nHere again, no chance, we yielded around $407.00\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nWelfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nfor 90 pelts,- by the report of Lampson, Fraser & Huth, a good firm of Montreal, to which we were directed by the Hudson Bay Co., that found our pelts of a good grade.\n\nI wish that these explanations will show to you how hard it is for me to present such a report after so many efforts made by the Department and the school. Like I told you already, I am proud to have been chosen for that experiment, but today I have to add that I expect some token of your appreciation in helping us by the authorization to keep the sum that will soon be into my hands.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n(sgd.) M. de Bretagne, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOttawa, February 20, 1940.\n\nRe: Operation of Mink Ranch\n\nDear Father de Bretagne:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 12th instant and also statement of the expenses incurred by you in the operation of the mink ranch, attached thereto.\n\nI have not yet had an opportunity to discuss the subject matter of your communication with the Treasury officials and consequently I am not in a position to state what action, if any, could be taken, under existing regulations, to pay over to you the proceeds received from the sale of the mink. It is noted that the total amount received is $382.51.\n\nIt is of the opinion that before the matter could even be considered we would have to have before us a recommendation from Dr. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Saskatchewan. I am therefore sending forward a copy of the correspondence to him and asking him to submit a report and recommendation to the Department.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Father Plourde, in which the suggestion is made that the money available from the sale of mink should be used for the extension of the barn at your school. In view of war conditions, however, unless the addition to the barn is urgently needed, this work should not be undertaken at any time in the immediate future. The Principals of our schools should know that the limited amount of money -\n\nRev. M. de Bretagne, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\nmoney at our disposal will simply not permit us to make extensions to our school buildings for the time being at least.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 20, 1940.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nIn response to the suggestion contained in your letter of the 15th instant, I am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter sent forward under today's date to the Principal of the Qu'Appelle School, Lebret, Sask.

I am not at all sure that under existing Treasury regulations we could make the refund he suggests. In any event, no action should be taken until the matter has been investigated and reported upon by you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thos.

I can assure you, however, that my recommendations will be along the lines suggested by you.\n\nI think that you are entitled to this consideration and so far as any other recommendation goes, it has always been my opinion, which I have expressed to the Department, that we have received, under your jurisdiction, a dollar and a quarter to a dollar and a half value for every dollar the Department has put up.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) Th.

And I have for proof the already tangible results shown by many of our ex-pupils who are not all an example of money vainly spent on behalf of an education impossible to reach. In other words I had always before my eyes your advices given us since the beginning of your leadership in the training department.\n\nIn the matter of expenditures I had always managed the funds trusted to my care in the same way as I would have done with my own. And the thrifty way learned when young I was managing in the thrifty France the wealth of my parents, kept in German custody, is applied here by me for the benefit of the Department, which I tried to save not only the current expenditures but the future ones as well. The reports of the inspectors could tell you plainly that everything is in order in spite of the difficulties encountered. Often I had undertaken ameliorations that are an asset to our institution and for which I have had asked often but a little help from you.\n\nYou will certainly understand that in these conditions I dared to ask you the disposal of the little funds coming from the sale of Mink. The recommendation of the Inspector Robertson, as you suggested it, is given by a letter of which I give you today a copy, and I take the liberty to ask you to call the attention of the Minister if necessary upon the fact that I had undertaken that source\nof expenses to show to the Department how I am ready to cooperate with him if it is thought that such experiment should be undertaken.\n\nBy the report submitted to you on the 12th of February you might have noticed the expenditures made by the School to keep the ranch going and it seems but natural that I would be authorized to keep the proceeds as a partial compensation for such expenses.\n\nHoping to hear an encouraging word from you\n\nI remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. M de Bretagne O.M.I\nPrincipal\n\nl encl.\nOttawa, April 1, 1940.\n\nDear Father de Bretagne:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo and also the album of snapshots which reached the Department a few days ago. It is scarcely necessary to state that I appreciate very fully the courtesy and thoughtfulness that prompted you to send forward the snapshots.\n\nIt is my intention to review with the officials here the request for the refund of the money secured from the sale of the mink at this institution, just as soon as a definite recommendation from Dr. Robertson reaches the Department. I am anxious also to discuss the matter very fully with Father Plourde when he next visits Ottawa. I must state, however, that the present rules and regulations governing refunds present an almost insurmountable obstacle to the refund of this money to the school. You can rest assured though that the whole matter will be very carefully and very sympathetically reviewed in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

Hoey\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI wrote you sometime ago concerning the moneys received from the sale of the minks of the Lebret Indian School, and suggested at the time that these moneys be turned over to the school management to be used for much needed improvements.\n\nIn acknowledging my letter you stated that you had not had the time to place this matter before the Treasury officials. My purpose in writing to you again about this matter is to urge that every consideration possible be given to Father de Bretagne's request.\n\nThe standard which he has set in the management and operation of the Lebret School is one which the grant itself is hardly sufficient to keep up and any additional help from the Department would be very much appreciated. It must also be remembered that the experiment made in the management of a mink ranch on a commercial basis was a costly one for the school and if the proceeds from the sale of the minks are allotted to the school, the loss incurred will be partially offset.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nMEMORANDUM: MR. HOEY,\n\nIn the fiscal year 1938-39 the Department gave financial assistance to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret, Sask., toward the establishment of a mink farm at that school. Expenditures were made from appropriation approximating $1600.00, being for the purchase of fifty mink $1200.00 and various other material amounting to $300.00.\n\nYou will recall that in 1939 the Auditor General, on reading the report of April 22, 1939, from our Mr. Willis, raised the question as to the number of mink then at the school. Mr. Willis had reported the number as 46. The Department wrote the Principal asking for a report on the matter and were advised that 9 mink had died and that they had replaced these by obtaining 11 male mink from Mr. Arkins.\n\nFrom the correspondence on file it would appear that the experiment in mink raising has not been a financial success and that in August of 1939 it was deemed advisable to dispose of the mink on hand and to discontinue the experiment. According to the report on the file under date of February 13, 1940, from the Principal of the School, the proceeds from sales are shown as $982.51. In the audit report furnished by Mr. Willis under date of September 10, 1940, the proceeds of sales are shown as $1,111.98. It is quite possible that between the time of the report by the Principal of the school and the time of the report by Mr. Willis, further sales of pelts had increased the amount of the proceeds.\n\nI would appreciate being advised if it is the intention of the Department to request the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Residential School to refund the amount of the proceeds to the credit of the Receiver General.\n\nLWMcS\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\nOctober 30, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson:\n\nI am sending forward herewith correspondence relating to the establishment and operation of a mink ranch at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret, Sask.\n\nYou will note that this ranch was established early in the year 1939 and that expenditures were incurred by the Department in this connection amounting to approximately $1,500. You will note also that the experiment was never wholly satisfactory. It would appear that from the outset the cost of food, particularly horse flesh, was very high and that 9 mink died early in the history of the project. Then it was learned here that the price of mink pelts had fallen approximately 50% immediately following the outbreak of the war, the Department decided to dispose of the mink, under the direction and guidance of Dr. Robertson. The mink were disposed of in due course and the question now arises as to what equitable settlement should be effected, in view of all the circumstances.\n\nThis mink ranch was established on the assumption that it would continue in operation from year to year and that the school authorities would be allowed to keep the yearly increase to compensate them for the additional expenses incurred, such as the salary of the manager of the ranch, cost of food, etc. It was agreed also that the school would distribute to a number of graduating pupils mink to the number of 50 and thus reimburse the Department for the Department's initial outlay of $1,200. You will note from the correspondence, however, that the school authorities were permitted to\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nGeneral Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building,\nCor. Scarth & Victoria Streets,\nREGINA, Sask.\nmake this distribution over a period of years.\n\nDr. Robertson was asked to investigate the whole matter very fully, in departmental letter dated February 20, 1940, and to send in a definite report with his recommendation. Unfortunately, however, Dr. Robertson, by reason of his illness, was prevented from undertaking the investigation and no report or recommendation on the matter has reached the Department.\n\nThe Chief Treasury Officer, in a memorandum dated October 25, 1940, points out that the Principal of the School reports the proceeds from the sale at $882.51, whereas the audit report furnished by Mr. Willis September 10, 1940, reports the proceeds at $1,111.98. It is just possible, of course, that between the time of the report by the Principal of the School and the audit made by Mr. Willis further sales of pelts had increased the amount of the proceeds.\n\nThe Department is anxious that you should undertake an investigation of this whole matter and receive from the Principal of the School an up-to-date statement indicating the amount of money received from the sale of the pelts. You will learn from the correspondence that substantial expenditures were incurred by the Principal in the establishment of the ranch. It would be appreciated if you would carefully review these expenditures and state definitely what in your judgment would be an equitable settlement.\n\nUnder existing regulations it is just possible that the total amount obtained from the sale of the mink may have to be returned to the Department and a cheque issued later for the amount of compensation that may be agreed upon.\n\nIn view of the delay that has taken place in the settlement of this matter, owing to the illness and death of Dr. Robertson and the illness during the summer months of the Superintendent of Welfare and Training, it would be appreciated if you could find it convenient to undertake this investigation at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nMemorandum.\n\nOttawa, November 1, 1940.\n\nMr. Hoey,\n\nMy information from a number of first-hand sources is that the small mink operator has very little chance of success.\n\nMink or fox raising, in my opinion, is much too risky for us to involve ourselves financially in any way.\n\nT.R.E. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 114-0-11 of the 30th ultimo in connection with the mink ranch that was in operation last year at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lebret.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that I have just returned from Lebret last night. The Chief Treasury Officer's remarks as noted on Page 2 of your letter, stating that the Auditor found the total receipts had been $1,111.98, whereas the Principal's statement showed only $982.51, are noted. In this regard I wish to say that while at the School the Reverend Principal and I went over the Cash Book and the only additional amount we were able to find was a credit of $45.32 over and above the $982.51 previously reported, making a total credit of $1027.83. The extra $45.32 was exchange on American money. If you will refer to the Principal's statement you will note that he reported a credit of $982.51, also that there is a notation stating that 90 pelts sold by the Hudson Bay Company through Lampson, Fraser, and Ruth Encorp., amounting to $497.56 were to be paid for at the end of February. Of course, at the time he sent in the statement, he had not received the money as it was paid in American funds. When the deposit was made by the Principal the Bank gave him a credit over and above the $497.56, of $45.32 American money. This statement accounts for 135 mink, which the Principal claims is correct, as one animal died about the time they were being disposed of. Therefor the total outlay by the School was $2056.03 and the total outlay by the Department, $1500.00. To liquidate the cost of this expenditure we have $1027.83.\n\nI would therefor make the following recommendation, that the school be allowed to retain the whole amount of money received, namely $1027.83 and the following is my reason for doing so; in the first place, according to information that I received, Father de Bretagne was not in favour of going into the mink farming business but as evidently it was the wish of the Department, he was most anxious to co-operate. As a lot of work was performed by the Principal and members of his Staff in connection with starting the Ranch, which was not charged up to the Department, and if everything was charged up on the statement furnished\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nby the Principal...\nby the Principal, it would amount to a lot more than $2,056.03, I believe they are entitled to some compensation. I also must be guided by the late Dr. Robertson's action in the matter. In a conversation with the Principal he promised to recommend that the total amount received from the sale of the minks would be handed over to the School.\n\nI find that on February 26th, Father de Bretagne wrote to Dr. Robertson and his letter reads in part as follows:\n\n\"...and now we ask to keep the all sum proceeding from that sale for our own use and in compensation of the sum spent by the School, because they will yield about $982.00 only.\"\n\nTwo days later, that is February 28th, Dr. Robertson replied as follows, and here is the last paragraph of his letter:\n\n\"I think that you are entitled to this consideration and so far as any other consideration goes, it has always been my opinion, which I have expressed to the Department, that we have received, under your jurisdiction, a dollar and a quarter to a dollar and a half value for every dollar the Department has put up.\"\n\nOn April 18th, File No. 315-11A RG Mr. Booth wrote to the Department in this connection, and quoting from his letter:\n\n\"I understand the Reverend Father had discussed this matter with Dr. Robertson and the Doctor had definitely agreed that the money should be refunded to the School Authorities so as to reimburse them somewhat for their work in connection with the farm.\n\nI have today discussed the matter with the Reverend Father and I would recommend that the Doctor's wishes in this matter be carried out.\"\n\nTherefore, in my opinion, there is nothing else to do but carry out the arrangements that were more or less entered into by the late Dr. Robertson with the School. In other words, this venture leaves a net deficit to the School of approximately $1000.00 and several hundred dollars worth of labour by the Principal and his Staff. Also the Department has lost $1500.00. I trust that you will find this in order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6331, file 660-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 20, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nI am sending forward herewith correspondence relating to the sale and disposal of a number of mink purchased by the Department early in the year 1939, for the establishment of a mink ranch at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret, Sask. This correspondence, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nThe establishment of a mink ranch at the Qu'Appelle School, Lebret, Sask., and a somewhat similar ranch at the Morley Indian Residential School, Morley, Alberta, was part of a vocational program, designed to provide a practical course of training at our residential schools. The Brandon Residential School experimented at the same time in the keeping of bees and the Fort Alexander School in the breeding of goats. For a period of years, criticism was widespread that the course provided at our schools was altogether too academic and abstract and that students graduating from these institutions had not the training or equipment to enable them to return to the reserves with any hope of making a success of life.\n\nThe Lebret School was selected for this experiment, in co-operation with the church authorities. Father de Bretagne is looked upon as one of the best, if not the best, residential school principal in the Dominion. He is a man with a very practical turn of mind. The Lebret School at this date has reached a very high state of efficiency. There is nothing on file here to indicate that he was at any time against the introduction of this experiment, and I am inclined to think that he -\nthat he was not only willing but exceedingly anxious to secure from the Department the mink necessary for the establishment of the ranch. Mr. Christianson's statement, therefore, that Father de Bretagne was not in favour of going into the mink farming business, must be the result of incomplete or misleading information. It cannot be said, however, that the mink ranch at Lebret was at any time a success. Drought conditions in the Qu'Appelle district made it exceedingly difficult for the Principal to secure meat at a reasonable cost and it would appear that most of the carcasses had to be shipped in. In addition to this, a few of the animals died. The drastic reduction in the existing price of mink pelts, however, was the chief reason for the failure of the experiment. Had the prices remained at the pre-war level, I am disposed to think that the project would have been reasonably successful.\n\nYou will note Mr. Christianson's recommendation with respect to the disposal of the money secured by the Principal from the sale of the pelts. This recommendation appears to be supported by an excerpt from a letter written by Dr. Robertson to the Principal. The original understanding was that the school would be allowed the annual increase after so much had been distributed to graduating pupils. This understanding, of course, was based on the assumption that the ranch would be in continuous operation from year to year.\n\nThe conclusion reached by Mr. Christianson in the last paragraph of his letter of November 15 is scarcely borne out by the facts. The school has at this date a fully modern building worth at least $200 and a building that is equipped for the production of poultry. If it is considered advisable to allow the Principal to retain the proceeds of the sale, now in his possession, I recommend that this allowance be made on the understanding that the Principal will utilize the funds so released for the extension of the barn at the Lebret School. Reports reaching the Department for a number of years indicate\nthat this barn is too small for the steadily growing needs of the institution. The Lebret School has at this date an enrolment of 250 pupils. It will thus be seen that this is one of the largest residential schools operated by the Department.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, December 6, 1940.\n\nDear Father de Bretagne:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report on the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, submitted by Mr. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThis report is on the whole very encouraging. Mr. Christianson was very favourably impressed by the condition and cleanliness of the buildings; the addition that had been made to the house, the cost of which was provided from school funds; the course of study provided for the girls and he concludes by stating: \"This is, no doubt, a very fine institution with a good staff. The Principal is an outstanding man and practical in all his work.\"\n\nMr. Christianson was somewhat surprised, however, to learn that very little manual training was provided for the boys in attendance at this school. It is just possible that you have not yet had time to adjust your program for the senior boys, immediately following the disposal of the mink. This project was organized, as you know, in response to a suggestion made by the Minister and was designed to encourage the boys to take an interest in the feeding and care of fur-bearing animals. In addition to this project, you had at one time a well organized Band, in which the boys took a keen and active interest. Inasmuch as the graduates of your school are likely to take part in agriculture and return to the reserves to engage in this industry, emphasis in your educational program, of course, should be placed on animal husbandry, the cultivation of the soil, subsistence gardens, etc. It has occurred to me that if the formerly occupied by the mink are still vacant, it might be worth while to experiment in the production and care of poultry. A number of the boys might be encouraged in a project of this character. In addition to this, a certain amount of carpentry work should be taught. I have in mind particularly the use and care of ordinary tools, the principles of elementary building construction, etc.\n\nI note from the reports that have reached me on our residential and day schools in British Columbia that approximately 2 hours of each day is set apart for vocational instruction - carpentry work, boat building, blacksmithing, auto mechanics, etc.\n\nI am -\n\nReverend M. de Bretagne, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Saskatchewan.\nI am particularly anxious that you should not interpret this letter as a criticism of your work which, in the judgment of Mr. Christianson and in my own judgment, is practically all that one could desire. It is my intention that the suggestions contained herein may prove suggestive and well worth while.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nLEBRET SASK\nINDIAN SCHOOL\n\nDecember 14th 1940\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe- Yours 114-0-11 Dec. 6th -\n\nI beg to acknowledge reception of same and to thank you for the kind and encouraging remarks you made to me.\n\nNo doubt I will try to carry on the instructions and advices you gave me, but I wish to call your kind attention upon the fact that there must have been an answer to the question that Mr. Christianson made to me and that provoked a misunderstanding between us about the manual training of the Boys.\n\nWe make a lot of work around where the Boys are mostly used, sometimes alone, sometimes to accompany a member of the Staff, often the Principal himself when economy has to be put in practice and a man is for that fact unprocureable. All the big Boys have their share in the different kinds of work performed around the School, and God knows that we cannot take a rest if we wish to keep everything in order and constantly improve our buildings or repair some other. They paint, they help the carpenters in all their work, they do all the chores of the farm and of the land, they do the work of the garden that is large, they haul coal, wood, straw, hay etc... But to say that they learn a special trade (carpentry, blacksmithing etc.) we cannot say so. In the past I have done my best for it but now our Boys have left us at 16 years, and at 15 an Indian Boy is not a white Boy; moreover we need them for the different works mentioned hereabove. If one day after the War, funds are available and that I could be granted 275 pupils I would have sufficient money to engage the teacher in some of these lines and have children devoting time to learn some of these trades more efficiently.\n\nOur stables are a place of show, not by the only beauty of the buildings that are neat, in good order and practical however, but by their outstanding appearance. There the Boys learn animal husbandry far better than they would do unhappily in some of the stables of Indian Agencies. Our animals are not abused by the children and it is obvious that their quietness is due to the good behavior of the Boys around them. Our herd is giving to our children much milk what contributes so much for their good health.\n\nThe boys work extensively to the garden, but I would wish more revenue here too from a larger pupilage in a way to find the money to pay better wages to a better gardener who would be able to teach practical gardening to the girls, who are mostly called to take care of garden on the reserves once they quit the School. With the time I expect to be able one day to start something more practical for them.\n\nI have done nothing with the pens of the mink yet, the war with the\nwith the departure of 5 members of our Staff to the Army, had brought some disturbance in our plans, because I intended to take care of chickens and tame rabbits in these pens. I would resume these activities as soon as possible however within the range of our means.\n\nNow in mentioning the Band of the School, I am afraid that you would think that we have abandoned it. Far from it our Band, in spite of the losses sustained by the War in the Staff and the annual loss of our best players, specially this year where I had to get rid of more pupils than ever on account of the regulations of the Department, is going on better than ever.\n\nOur name is good yet and we have been to different parades last Summer for the Red Cross, in November even to Regina for the parade of the film on the Mounties of the N.W. where our Boys were very popular again. Their director Rev. F. Laviolette is very capable and devoted and we have teachers of music who cost me much money. We do not appear to any place and our little Band are the object of surprise for many Whites. We are requested to go to the Exhibition of Regina every year but we have to decline the invitation on account of the Holidays. We consider that this activity is one of our principal ones for the recreational point of view and for the education of will power as well as the developing of their taste and good manners.\n\nI am at your disposal to put in practice any suggestion you find proper to give me and be sure that in spite of the difficulties of the War-time we do our best to keep to our School the same efficiency with reduced means than I had tried to give in the last few years of my principalship.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nRev.

I would appreciate if you would give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian School\nLebret, Sask.,\nMarch 9, 1944\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nTraining Division,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs I have not, up until now, made Monthly Reports on the Manual Training of my boys, I will at this time make a general report covering the work done up till now, and will in the future endeavor to make monthly reports.\n\nUntil October, last, the training I was able to give was very limited, as it had to be given in the classroom, where the furniture had to be protected and few boys could work at one time.\n\nIn October we were given the use of the large shop outside. Here considerable time was taken up in building a cupboard to hold our new tools received last year, as well as additional workbenches. The bigger boys did good work here in the construction of the benches.\n\nAs I have an enrolment of 33 boys, I have divided them into two groups for Manual Training. Each group goes to the shop once...\na week for half a day. While one group is in the shop, the other group works at the barn, with the chickens, or wherever there is some special work to be done which will have training benefits. We find this system to work better than to take all the boys into the shop at once, where adequate attention could not be given to all.\n\nFor quite some time at the beginning, I found the boys exceedingly slow in performing the various jobs; some are still so. Perhaps my standards are too high for them. However, they have and are improving greatly. Many are really turning out good work. What is more important, they like this Manual Training. For the greater part, I allow the boys to choose their own projects, unless I feel that what they have chosen is too difficult at the time, or sometimes we have not the material necessary. Then, often too, I assign certain jobs or articles to be made for which there is an immediate need\u2014card tables and stools, for example. Furthermore, considerable repair jobs are done, as well as outside construction jobs.\n\nSome of the main outside construction jobs on which the bigger boys worked...\nwere a Pig Barn, Haying equipment Implement Shed, Cow Barn, and Car Garage. This was done last summer. These I have listed on the report sheet although they are not objects made by a boy individually. On larger jobs several boys participate.\n\nIn choosing projects, I encourage the boys to make articles which will be useful in a household, as well as beautiful. My main object is to try to train them to improve their homes by constructing articles such as small tables, stands, cupboards, shelves, etc.\n\nSo much for woodwork. Besides this, under my supervision, these boys handle the poultry raising. Last year we received 300 hatchery chicks which we successfully raised. The cockerels were killed to provide food, leaving 142 pullets. About half of these are laying eggs throughout the winter. We are again expecting 300 chickens on March 31st.\n\nI am also giving the boys quite a thorough training in Gardening. Last year, our school garden was a success; this year we are enlarging it, to provide...\nfor more canning as well as more fresh vegetables.\n\nThe majority of the boys like all these activities; better in fact than any classroom work than I can give them. However, we try to correlate the classroom work with these other activities\u2014for example Natural Science and Gardening.\n\nSo many activities besides the regular Curriculum subjects, does not give me as much time for preparation as I might like, or rather would need, but I try to do my best under the circumstances. If my boys will carry at least part of the training home, and apply it to their lives after they leave school, to better their living conditions, I shall be satisfied and happy.\n\nYours faithfully,\nJoseph Sherberger,\nInstructor, Senior Boys.\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nChief, Training Division  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed a report on the manual training which Mr. Herberger, our teacher, is giving to our senior boys. Great attention is given to Manual Training in our school. The boys were glad to receive their Proficiency Badges for learning. The girls have also completed many units in domestic training and we would be much obliged if you would send us 100 cards to certify their work and to recommend that a Proficiency Badge be granted.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nP. Pich\u00e9 O.M.I.  \nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nMarch 14, 1944.\n\nDear Father Piche:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing report on the manual training which is being arranged for the senior boys at the Qu'Appelle Residential School.

A few of these are included. I am very pleased to see the progress that you are making in poultry raising. I wish to draw your attention to the fact that you may have difficulties by trying to make the project too extensive. It would be preferable to have several poultry projects on a smaller scale. In this way pupils would be given full responsibility. This would be in line with possibilities out of school, but few Indians will have poultry by the hundreds. I wish that you would look into this matter and see what can be done in order to make Manual Training such that the children will be able to carry out this training in their future life.\n\nPhilip Melan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDelivered to Same, Lebret, Sask.\n\nJ.

Please find enclosed herewith the invoices for same.\n\nIn his last inspection of our classes, the School Inspector for the Saskatchewan Department of Education ordered the purchase of new books for Grades I and II. As these books were needed immediately I took it upon myself to place an order directly with W.J. Gage and Co., Ltd. and Ginn and Co., Ltd. Although this purchase has not been authorized, would the Department accept the books, considering that, for the benefit of the pupils, they had to be ordered without delay.\n\nWith reference to Jimmy Breland, the boy we have recently accepted at Mr. Hoey's request, he himself tells me he is a Protestant. If this assertion is correct, I would be inclined to question the advisability of his remaining a pupil of our school. I was under the impression that he was a Catholic.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. Piche O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School\nLebret, Sask.\nDec. 9th 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nATTENTION MR. A. DOUCET:\n\nDear Mr. Doucet,\n\nEnclosed are the reports of basic operations mastered by our students in the different activities. Would you kindly send us other forms for these monthly reports.\n\nYour lectures at our school, during the last summer have aroused a great enthusiasm for the Manual Training among the teaching staff. Again I wish to express to you and to the Department my heartfelt thanks.\n\nThree different instructors are employed in the Manual Training for the boys. These pupils are receiving special and more elaborate training in the kind of work in which they show more interest. The three boys to whom the Department has granted a school extension are doing well.\n\nWillie Luziciri (16 yrs) is taking a course in mechanics and is given a special programme of studies with the following subjects: Business Fundamentals; Language; Indian Economy; Typewriting.\n\nGeorge Lavallee (17 yrs) has been trained in Leatherwork and is now in a position to handle the shoe-shop.\n\nPatrick Gogginirel (17 yrs) has given all his interest in farming work. He has learned to drive the tractor.\n\nWe have a special home near the school for these three boys. An old Indian lady is staying with them to take care of the house and of their clothes. They take their meals at the school and they go to their home for the night. They greatly appreciate the freedom and the responsibility we are giving them. I consider this arrangement to be a good transition from the school life to their future life at home. They are happy, reliable and industrious.\n\nWe have not yet received confirmation of the acceptance of Mr. Doll as Instructor of Manual Training. Mr. Doll has been working for us in that position since October 15th. If he is accepted, how soon can we expect to receive this special grant towards his salary? We wish to thank you for the invoice of all the books we have ordered. Thank you also for your kind interest.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nP.

In fact, the most progressive Indian farmers will get in the tractor farming as soon as they will be able to procure equipment. On the other hand, many of our graduates would get work on outsiders farms if they could only be able to work with a tractor.\n\nWe have begun this year to give the boys of Grades VII, VIII and IX a course in Mechanics. But this course will be of little use to them if they are not shown in practice how to run a tractor and work with it.\n\nOn account of these reasons, would the Department consider buying a small tractor such as a W-4. Such tractor would be necessary to complete their mechanical course.\n\nAnd what would prevent us, after agreement with the Indian Agent, to permit our graduates to break on their reserves a certain number of acres for themselves with this tractor. I consider that this would provide us with the means of helping our graduates. The School would be willing to lend its implements whenever necessary.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your consideration,\n\nI am, Yours very truly,\n\nP. Piche O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 27, 1946.\n\nDear Father Piche:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant with reference to manual training work at the Qu'Appelle Residential School. Needless to say, I am pleased to know that the boys are showing so much interest.\n\nI note your request for a small tractor. These are rather difficult to obtain at the present time, and in any case, I presume that you do not require it immediately. There are other difficulties which we would have to consider before deciding to supply it. Mr. Doucet hopes to visit your school early in June, at which time he will discuss the matter further with you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend P. Piche, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\nMr. Phelan,\n\nRe: Meeting with Manitoba Provincial School Inspectors.\n\nQU'APPELLE:\n\nIt will be recalled that the Qu'Appelle School was authorized to make improvements to the shop. I wish to state here that they have at present a splendid shop. It will, however, require interior decorating which they hope to be able to do before the opening of the school next September. There are three Manual Training Instructors at this school. The problem of integration is rather different when the Instructors have not been trained for this work, (one of the Instructors followed the course given by the Department last November).\n\nThis school has a good start and I hope that by next visit the improvements will be more prominent. It must be kept in mind that the shop was repaired by the pupils themselves. Greater benefits would have been obtained from this work if the Mathematics, etc had been integrated to a greater extent. It was, however, as far as it went very good training for the young people and I wish to state again that they have made a lot of their shop and encouraged a qualified teacher at this school to attend the general shop course to be given in Brandon or Winnipeg this summer.\n\nThe Manual Training students deserve commendation for the work done on their shop. This was good training for them. More planning, however, should have been done by the pupils themselves. In fact, a class discussion followed by a sketch competition would have brought into play many educational factors. The pupils plan to paint the interior of their shop this fall.\n\nThere are three Instructors employed at this school. One of these assisted at the short course given by the Department last November. The problem of integration is rather difficult when the instructors have no training for this work.\n\nA.J.

J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Ave., East,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe have received your letter of the 20th ultimo regarding a work-shop at the Qu'Appelle Residential School. I understand there is a building which is being used at present for manual training purposes. It is probably a little small but at the same time we have to provide buildings at other schools where no such facilities are at present available.\n\nMr. Doucet visited the Qu'Appelle school recently and while the Principal was absent, he discussed the situation with Father Dionne.\n\nAbout 30 feet from the building at the present time being used for manual training purposes, there is another building of approximately the same size. If these two buildings were joined Mr. Doucet feels that there would be reasonably adequate accommodation for manual training work for some time.\n\nYou might obtain a list of the materials required for joining these two buildings and if possible, we would like to know the approximate cost of these materials. I am not certain that we will have funds in the current year's appropriation for this purpose but the matter will be further considered when the list of materials and their approximate cost is received.\n\nyours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, February 20th, 1947.\n\nDear Father Piche:\n\nWe have your requisition for material for the manual training building at the Qu'Appelle School.\n\nAs you are aware, Mr. Boucet has suggested that the present manual training building be joined to another building which is approximately thirty feet away. It is presumed that in preparing the requisition which we have received, you intend to carry out the above suggestion.\n\nWould it be possible for you to let me have an estimate of the cost of the material mentioned in your requisition. It is noted that you state that this can be secured from the Security Lumber Company. As you know, the end of the fiscal year is approaching and we want to know the approximate cost of the materials so that we can decide if we can provide the funds between now and the end of March.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard F.

And they expect this last item in the near future. They could also substitute.\n\nThis material will be used to join the present manual training shop to another building which is approximately 40 feet away. This would give a new shop of 24 X 40.\n\nReverend P.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe wish to thank the Indian Affairs Branch for purchase of material for enlargement of our Manual Training Shop. The plan which has been suggested is to enlarge our actual Manual Training Shop. But, now, all the members of the staff are unanimous in suggesting a more practical plan.\n\nOn account of the large number of buildings that the Indian Affairs Branch has in view throughout Canada, we presume that the Department will not consider the construction, for our school, of an auditorium or gymnasium for some years to come, notwithstanding the need for one.\n\nOur new plan would be to build the Manual Training Shop large enough so that we could use it occasionally for Cadet Drilling, Physical Training, Band and Choir practice and finally, on certain occasions such as on Christmas and Easter, as parlour for Indian parents.\n\nMay I say, that at the present, because our parlour for the parents is only a hall of 20x22 ft., we are very often obliged to set benches in the corridors of the school and in the laundry room. This causes much inconvenience and trouble.\n\nFor all these reasons, we suggest that instead of uniting the actual workshop with the Bakery Shop, an extension be made to a building which actually serves as Club House for the senior boys and as a storeroom. This building measures 36x24 ft. In annexing to it a building of 70x56 ft., we would have a first class Manual Training Shop which could also be used for the purposes already mentioned. All the necessary benches for the Manual Training could be set around the hall and as the tools are kept in lockupboards when not in use, they would be conveniently out of the way.\n\nThe lumber for the 40x24 ft. building already approved amount to $1138.95. The additional quantity of lumber needed for the 70x56 building we propose, would amount to $1395.45 plus the new price increase now in effect.\n\nWe feel that this additional cost would prove to be a saving if we consider the services that this building would give us and the small difference in labor that it would require.\nIndian Residential School\n\nLEBRET, SASKATCHEWAN\n\nAnother advantage is that this building being closer to the school, it could be heated by the central heating system of the school.\n\nYou will find enclosed the list of the additional supplies needed and the price of same.\n\nWe sincerely hope that you will give our suggestion, your most earnest consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. Piche O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nNo estimate of labour\nOttawa, May 9th, 1947.\n\nDear Father Piche:\n\nWe have your letter of the 23rd ultimo requesting the Department to approve the erection of a larger building than was intended in official letter of February 20th.\n\nOur records show that we have already authorized lumber to the amount of $1,138.50 and you request further material costing $1,395.45. This would make a total for material of $2,533.95. Please let me have an estimate of the labour that would be required to erect the larger building. When we have this information your application will receive further consideration.\n\nIn addition to the cost of the labour for the actual erection of the building, would there be extra expense involved in arranging for the new building being heated from the heating system in the school? If there would be extra expense, please let me have an estimate of the amount required.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. P.

It is realized that the building which you would like to build would no doubt provide many facilities not at present available. However, as stated, owing to lack of funds it is not possible to authorize it this year.\n\nWe understand that the materials already supplied amounting to approximately $1,138, will be sufficient to carry out the original plan, namely to enlarge the present manual training shop. We are particularly anxious that manual training should receive special consideration at the Qu'Appelle School during the coming academic year, and by carrying out the original plan as outlined in your letter of March 19th, 1947, reasonable facilities for manual training instruction would be available.\n\nAs the building will be much smaller than the one on which you submitted quotations in your letter of June 5th, the cost of the labour and material for the heating systems will be reduced proportionately. We estimate that the amount of $800 should be sufficient to cover the cost of the labour and the material for the heating system and the cost of installing same. We are prepared to allow this amount.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPP/MGD\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. P.

At the same time we are very much interested in having larger space available for manual training and if the original plan was put into effect, reasonable accommodation would be available during the academic year 1947-48 for manual training.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of your letter, we are quite prepared to pay the salary of the manual training teacher but in the case of all residential schools, the principal applies for this payment, either monthly or quarterly. On reviewing our file we cannot find any previous request for payment of this salary.\n\nWe do not put manual training teachers on the regular pay list as in many instances the manual training teacher only stays for a few months and consequently we are never certain whether the residential school has a manual training teacher or not.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The references obtained praise his knowledge and skill in the different trades and also his ability as teacher.\n\nWe are willing to pay him a salary of $1800.00.\n\nI was surprised to learn from your letter of October 14th that your maximum grant for the Manual Instructor has been reduced to $125.00 a month. As this was the first notification of the reduction, I hope that the Department will be disposed to pay $150.00 to Mr. Doll for September and October. Mr. Doll has been approved in 1946 as Manual Training Instructor and it was understood since last year that the Department was paying $1500.00 a year for this position.\n\nMr. Doll is qualified in Engineering, Mechanic and as Electrician but not as Carpenter. It is for this reason that carpentry training was given to Mr. Desjarlais.\n\nWe expect that Mr. Sieben will be able to take the full charge of the Manual Training.\n\nIn closing, may I express the opinion that the Department should continue to pay the grant of the maximum amount of $1500.00 a year.

This animal has an enlarged joint with a running sore, and the Priest told me on enquiring what it was, that the animal must have been shot, but when I asked him he was not sure of that being the case. In my opinion it is a tubercular joint. I would advise that it be tested and if such disease be pronounced, that the animal be destroyed. I know that tuberculosis was among the Van Horn cattle on the Van Horn Farm. It is a matter which I think should be attended to at once.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nO.I.

D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Rugonard, O.M.I.\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School.\nLebret, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWith reference to the matter of supplying milch cows for the Qu'Appelle Industrial School and the File Hills Boarding School, I beg to say that I have been unable to locate in this Province or in Alberta or Manitoba, the breed of cows we require. There are only two breeds that can be used either the Holstein or the Ayrshire and the nearest place that I know of that they can be purchased is in the Province of Ontario. I could pick up other breeds but from the advice I have and from what I know personally, I think it would be a mistake to depart from the breeds mentioned as the Holstein will give at least twice the quantity of milk of any Shorthorn that we might pick up, or in other words one good Holstein will give as much milk as two good Shorthorns, therefore we should use nothing but the Holstein.\n\nMy suggestion is that the Department might arrange through Doctor Ruddick of the Agricultural Department, Ottawa, to procure for us the cattle we require in the East. He no doubt has a man whom he could send out to pick up these animals. As I have said before I could get a Shorthorn breed here but it would be very inadvisable to do so as it would not be profitable. This advice I also have from the Dairy Commissioner here and from other experts on dairy cattle. The Provincial Government institutions here use dairy herds entirely for their milk supply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, June 15, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your No. 306-11 A and 314-11 A of the 17th ultimo, referring to the purchase of milch cows for the Qu'Appelle and File Hills Indian Residential Schools. I have noted that you have been unable to secure grade Holstein cattle, which you strongly recommend. The Department will make arrangements with the Department of Agriculture for the purchase in the East of the cattle needed, and you and the principals will be advised. I shall make arrangements to have the stock shipped to Mr. Indian Agent Beacon at Balcarres, and instructions will be sent to him concerning the disposition of the animals.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

W. L. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 21, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Abraham:\n\nWe require, for the purposes of two residential schools in Saskatchewan, thirty grade Holstein cattle. Mr. Commissioner Graham has been unsuccessful in securing this type of milch cow in the West, and I should be grateful if you would make arrangements to locate and purchase these animals. If possible, they should be animals that have been tested and found free from tuberculosis. You should bend every energy towards a purchase to the best possible advantage.\n\nThese cattle should be shipped to Saskatchewan in September, and it will be necessary for you to arrange for the services of a man to care for the stock en route. I will give you shipping directions when such information is needed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. H. Abraham, Esq.,\nAgricultural Representative,\nR. R. #1, Chatham, Ont.\nOttawa, June 21, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 306 and 314-11 A of the 14th instant, with reference to the supplying of milch cows for the Qu'Appelle and File Hills Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIn reply I wish to refer you to my communication of the 15th instant. I have also to refer to that portion of your letter of the same file number, in which you state that steps should be taken to remove the tubercular cattle at once and to put the new milch cows in their place as soon as possible. I have to inform you that, in the opinion of the Department, it would be better to arrange for the shipment of the new stock when the barn is completed. The danger of infection in an old barn, where tubercular cattle have been, makes such action advisable.\n\nI shall be pleased to learn from you whether Balcarres is the most suitable point for unloading. It would be necessary for Mr. Agent Deacon to arrange for an officer and boys from each school to take the cattle to their final destinations. Twenty animals will be for the Qu'Appelle School and ten for the File Hills Institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCHATHAM, ONT.\nJune 23, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 21st No. 114-0-14 in regard to the purchase of 30 grade milk cows for the residential schools in Saskatchewan. I do not think that it will be at all difficult to secure cattle in Oxford County but if it is not desired to have the cattle shipped until September, it would not be advisable to make any arrangements until shortly before shipment. I will make arrangements to have a man go with them as suggested in your letter.\n\nIs it your intention to purchase fresh milk cows or to purchase cows that will freshen in March or April? It might be advisable to purchase if possible fresh milk cows which have been bred to a first-class Holstein bull.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.G. Scott, Litt.D.,\nDept. of Ind. Aff.,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nR. H. ABRAHAM,\nAgr. Rep. Dept. of Ind. Aff.\nOttawa, July 3, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your No. 12-1 of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the purchase of 30 grade Holstein milch cows for two residential schools in Saskatchewan. I have noted that you will be able to secure these cattle and that you can make arrangements for a man to accompany them on their journey.\n\nIn reply to the last portion of your letter, I beg to state that the Department approves of your recommendation - that fresh milch cows, bred to first-class Holstein bulls, should be purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Abraham, Esq.,\nAgricultural Representative,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nR. R. #1, Chatham, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st inst. with reference to the supplying of milk cows for the Qu'Appelle and File Hills Residential Schools.\n\nYou seem to have some concern about the cattle coming in contact with the existing barns at the latter institution. In reply I would say that during the summer months the cattle need not go near the barns at all, but would be pastured and brought to corral at night for milking purposes.\n\nBalcarres would be the most suitable place to unload the cattle, being about nine miles to Lebret. However, I do not think that ten cows will be sufficient for the File Hills School. I would ask that this be placed at fifteen, and at least 25 be sent to Qu'Appelle. Care should be taken however to see that some of the cows will come in to milk in the late fall, as I do not wish to have all of the cows milking at the same time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 7, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 306-114 of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the new milch cows for the Qu'Appelle and File Hills Indian Residential Schools. I have noted that it will be quite in order to arrange for the shipment of these cattle before the new barn at Qu'Appelle is completed. It would be advisable to instruct the principal at this institution not to permit these cattle to be placed in the old barn, if they arrive before the new one is completed. I have also noted your recommendation that 40 head be purchased and I have to inform you that, if the funds at our disposal for this purpose are sufficient to cover the purchase price of the extra cattle, they will be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, July 7, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to the purchase of grade Holstein milch cows for two Indian residential schools in Saskatchewan. The Department has learned that it would be advisable to secure 40 head, and I should be pleased if you would estimate the cost of this larger number. It might be well to purchase some of the cows that will come in to milk in the late fall, so as not to have them all milking at the same time.\n\nI have further to inform you that it will not be necessary to delay shipment of these animals until September, as we are assured arrangements can be made for their care at the western schools at any time.\n\nPlease estimate the cost of 40 cows, as soon as possible, so that the Department can give you instructions as to the exact number to be purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Abraham, Esq.,\nAgricultural Representative,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nR. R. #1, Chatham, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, No.114-0-14 and in reply would say that you need not have the slightest fear that the cows that will be shipped from the East will be permitted to enter the old barns at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nThe Principal has had strict instructions on this matter and I am hoping that the old buildings will be torn down before the new cattle arrive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCHATHAM, ONT.\nJuly 28, 1923.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 7th No. 114-0-14 in regard to the purchase of 40 head of Holstein cattle for two of our residential schools in Saskatchewan and in reply thereto I beg to say that I believe the cost of good Holstein cattle would be something between $600 and $90 per head, tubercular tested. When I am ready to purchase the cattle I will make requisition for sufficient money to make the purchase with and pay for transportation; etc., as it will be necessary to pay cash for the cattle, freight, etc.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

May 2, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on\nthe Qu'Appelle Industrial School, which was recently\ninspected by Mr. Murison.\n\nThere does not appear to be a sufficient\nnumber of cows to supply milk for this institution.\nYou are aware we supplied some cows a few years ago\nand by this time there should have been a large enough\nnumber by natural increase. The farming has been\ncarried on in a profitable way, as the finances of the\nschool show.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe horse and cow barns are good buildings. A silo has been built between the two barns. It was tried out this winter for the first time and has proven very satisfactory. The cow barn provides accommodation for 24 cows, and a calf pen. They have 23 milch cows, 1 bull, and 21 head of young stock. A shed is provided for the young stock. They should have at least 35 milch cows at an institution of this size, and in order to accommodate this number it would be necessary to extend the barn at least 30 feet. At the time of my visit they were milking 14 cows, which is not sufficient to provide milk for approximately 250 persons. They should have at least 35 in order to keep at least 20 milking steadily. I may say that the cattle are all Holsteins.\nSir:-\n\nI have received a letter from the Provincial Government drawing attention to the Dairy Convention to be held in Prince Albert, January 29-30-31 next, and in this connection to the work of one of their Field Staff who has greatly interested himself in herd improvement work at one or two of our Indian schools, particularly at Crooked Lake and Lebret. The Field Inspector states that he has found the boys at these schools keenly interested in live stock and is anxious to see a team of Indian boy contestants in the Dairy Cattle Judging Competition this year. Father Leonard is equally enthusiastic that the boys should go to Prince Albert.\n\nI am sure that the training which they will receive in taking part in such a contest will be of great educational value to the boys, and I wish to recommend that a team of boys be allowed to go from Lebret. I think the only expenditure in connection with the arrangement would be that of their transportation and perhaps one day's board at Prince Albert. I shall be glad if the Department will sanction and provide for the small expense which will be entailed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW. M.

It is considered that the school authorities should provide for the maintenance of the boys during the time they are in Prince Albert.

The Reverend Father now has over 100 head of good Holstein cattle. He is certainly crowded for stable room and at present is renting a barn. His calves and young stock were in excellent condition and are being well fed and looked after. The Reverend Father is anxious to obtain a good herd of milk cows sufficient to supply milk and butter for the school, about 260 people, consequently more barn accommodation is necessary. The girls are given lessons in milking during the late spring and in the fall when the weather is good. I understand that the girls, on being discharged, are able to milk.\n\nThe horse barn is in good repair and was clean. The horses are in excellent condition and are receiving the best of care.\n\nAt present, they have about thirty growing pigs and during the recent months sixty fat hogs had been butchered. Six or eight brood sows are kept.\n\nPoultry is also kept and with fair success.

Plourde, O.M.I. acting in\nplace of Reverend P. Piche, O.M.I. Principal of the\nQu'Appelle School has recently brought to our attention\na new project proposed by Father Piche.\n\nIt appears that Father Piche has leased land\nin close proximity to the Qu'Appelle School for the\npurpose of training ex-pupils in farming and stock\nraising. This enterprise is to be operated on a\nco-operative basis and all the profits from it will be\ndistributed in equal parts to the group of ex-pupils\nwho will be employed. We are requested to assist the\nproject by purchasing a small tractor at an approximate\ncost of $1500.00.\n\nI discussed this proposal with the Director\nyesterday and he suggested that I communicate with you.\nI have also written to Father Plourde to have Father\nPiche discuss the project with you.\n\nAs Father Piche desires to proceed at once\nit is important that he have your views at the earliest\npossible date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRegina, April 20th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 17th instant, No. 114-0-1, in connection with the proposed purchase of a tractor for the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School I have to say that I had discussed this matter with Reverend Father Piche yesterday and I would recommend that the tractor be purchased for use at the school in the training of ex-pupils in farming and livestock raising.\n\nReverend Father Piche does not agree to operating the tractor on a strictly co-operative basis and I believe he is right in this. His wish is to operate the tractor entirely under the direction of the school but the profits of the leased land which will be operated in the training of pupils and ex-pupils will be set aside in a special account and the proceeds of this account will be used to assist deserving ex-pupils after they have had a satisfactory training and have shown that they are deserving of special consideration.\n\nJ.P.B.

Please let me have full particulars regarding the type of tractor which you stated you could secure, also the name and address of the person from whom the tractor can be purchased and its approximate cost.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nVery Reverend M. Lavigne, O.M.I.,\nJuniorate of the Holy Family,\n340 Provencher Avenue,\nSt. Boniface, Manitoba.\nExtract from Annual Report of Rev. Paul Fiche, O.M.I., Principal, Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, for fiscal year ended March 31, 1946.\n\nNotwithstanding the many difficulties, the School is bringing progress among the Indians. The progress is noticeable from one generation to another. In judging the Indians' problems, one must never forget that the work of civilization is a work of generations. Men are not remade overnight. The process of full adjustment of a people to a civilization finds itself handicapped by centuries of traditions, ways of living, habits which are deeply rooted in the very soul. We cannot expect the Indians to have achieved a transition from the bow and arrow to the atomic age in sixty years.\n\nWe consider that it would be one of the Department's duties to establish a plan for the post-scholar aid to the school graduates. When boys and girls are dismissed at 16 years of age, they are too young to have acquired during their school years either a trade or a training which can fit them to undertake the task of earning their own living. Nowadays it is left to the parents to continue the graduates' training. Whereas many parents are not in an economical position to give this help, the graduates are left to themselves, destitute of any means towards this end. It falls the Indian Affairs Branch to provide these graduates with a follow-up system that could fit them to earn their living.\n\nThe Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School wants to experience the following plan: We have rented a farm near the school. This farm has 360 acres under cultivation. Our aim is to have the graduates who want to continue their training at school work this land under our supervision. The net profit would create a fund to help not only the graduates who would be working on the land but all those who would stay at school for a higher training. The aid to be given to each graduate when leaving could be based on the length of time he has remained in school after 16 years of age, also on his character and good behavior and his sense of responsibility.\n\n......... These boys\nThese boys staying for post-school training would not be under the same regulations as the other pupils. I am satisfied with the following experience made with the three boys to whom the Department has granted, this year, a school extension: I provided them with a home near the school building. An old reliable Indian lady stays with them to take care of the house and to supervise them. They sleep there but take their meals at the school. They have a radio, books, reviews. They are given more freedom in order to develop their sense of responsibility.\n\nThe satisfaction that this system has brought this year inclines me to think that such a plan could be a solution to that difficult period of transition the graduate has to go through when leaving school:- that of a followed-up supervision at school to a total freedom at home.\n\nOur School will always try to co-operate with the Indian Affairs Branch to the welfare of the Indians especially of the Indian children.\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nChief, Training Division,  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nVery Reverend M. Lavigne O.M.I. has asked me to send you the address where a tractor can be purchased for our ex-pupils Farm.

He was interested in reading the extract from the annual report of Reverend Paul Piche, the Principal of the School, and agreed that there was undoubtedly a need for the additional training of selected male pupils from Residential Schools.\n\nAs the proposal is a new departure from the kind of assistance usually granted to ex-pupils, the Minister felt that there should be a clear understanding of what might be involved. If the request for the purchase of a tractor is granted the Department will likely be asked in the future to make other contributions. Again, there is the probability of similar requests being received from other schools. As you know, it has not been the general practice up to this date to purchase farm equipment to enable the Church organizations to carry on their farming operations connected with the school. As the Department would have little if any control over the proposed farming project, the Minister expressed the view that it might be preferable if our contribution were limited to a continuation of the per capita grant to the selected number of ex-pupils that might be chosen for the additional training. Your memorandum does not indicate whether the Department was expected to continue the grant in addition to assisting in purchasing machinery and equipment.\n\nYour file and the requisition are returned herewith.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nEncls.\nOttawa, June 5, 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of April 16 and subsequent correspondence from the Principal of the Qu'Appelle School, in regard to a project recommended by Father Piche for ex-pupils.\n\nYour suggestion has been very carefully considered and, we feel, has a great deal of merit. However, I think you will agree that the proposal is a new departure from the type of assistance previously granted to ex-pupils. In view of the enquiry now being made into Indian administration throughout Canada, it is felt desirable to postpone a definite decision on your request until a later date.\n\nWe will be glad to review the matter subsequently.\n\nIn view of the above, the tractor is not being ordered.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nFile Hills, Agency,\nBelcarres, Sask.\nJuly 6th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI beg to report on the Affairs of this Agency for the quarter period ending June 30th, 1946.\n\nWelfare. The increase effected in garden acreage is due to a great extent to the co-operation given this Office by the Principals of the Qu'Appelle and File Hills Residential Schools. Every family who had children attending either of these two schools, and had prepared a suitable garden plot in time in May were permitted to have their children home to assist in planting. The Principal of each school accompanied me on a separate tour of inspection of the plots prepared for this purpose. The children were permitted to be home from Friday until Sunday of the same week. Only one child failed to return to school within the allotted time. It is planned to follow up by a similar inspection before the children complete their summer vacation.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Qu'Appelle Indian Industrial School and purchase of tractor.\n\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Reverend Father Paul Pich\u00e9, O.M.I., of the above school, in which he expresses his great disappointment at the refusal of the Department to purchase, for his older boys and former pupils, a tractor with which to help them start farming on their reserve.\n\nFather Pich\u00e9 has often mentioned his conviction that something must be done for these former pupils if we do not want to allow them to spend five or six years at least in useless seeking for jobs and in the persuation of habits which are far from being a credit to the school which had charge of their early training.\n\nHe now proposes to pay half of the purchase price of a tractor, out of missionary funds which he has been able to gather and suggests that the Department pay the other half. Furthermore, he would like, for the coming year, to be authorized by the Department to take in up to ten boys of sixteen or over that age, who are willing to continue their mechanical training in his school, on condition that the Department pay for their upkeep the ordinary per capita grant allowed for regular school pupils, and $15.00 extra, per pupil, per month. This amount of $15.00 will be placed to the credit of each boy at the end of each month, and remitted to him, in a lump sum, on his leaving the school at the end of two...\nyears.\n\nMoreover, a small sum will be credited each month, so as to give each boy $500.00 when leaving the school, at the end of this two year training period. He will try to supervise the spending of this money, in the building of homes for each of these boys or in the purchase of machinery, horses or any other farm implements which he will judge useful for their start in life. He further states that he would have no objection to be guided in this work by the recommendations of the Agent or Superintendent of Indian Agencies in Regina.\n\nIn other words, his sole purpose for proposing to the Department this method of training for these boys, is to try some scheme whereby the work so ably conducted at the school will not be completely lost and the boys be given a chance to utilize their training immediately upon reentering the reserve.\n\nPlease let me know what your reaction to this offer can be, at your earliest convenience, so that I may be able to so advise the Reverend Father.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O.

During the term of school, the children have been with us, not continuously, under our care, receiving food and clothing, and will receive education.\n\n3. The bedding and clothing have been sent by the Women's Foreign Mission Society of the Presbyterian Church.\n\n4. The school has spent $100.00 in building in 1874, and another $800.00 spent in 1876 in the same work.\n\n5. There are more than 60 children in the Circle on Rama Lake who are now wishing to attend our school.

Hugh McKay.\n\nThe Hon.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nthe several employes of the Agency,\ntogether with a few white settlers,\nand about forty or fifty male Indians\nand a few squaws; and had it not\nbeen for the extremely inclement weather,\nno doubt many more would have\nbeen in attendance.\n\nFifteen children were, at the\ntime, being boarded at the Institution,\nand these were all neatly and prettily\ndressed in clothes which had been\nsent by good people from Ontario.\n\nIn the large dining-room were\nfound long tables neatly laid, and\nspread with a capital repast, to\nwhich, as many as could be\naccommodated (both Whites and\nIndians) sat down. After the enjoyment\nof a most hearty meal, speeches were\nmade by the Rev. Mr. McKay, re-\ncounting the progress and success\nattending his efforts, in connection with\nthe Institution, and by guests wishing\nthat the same marked advancement\nmight\nmight continue until the efforts of all concerned should, in the laudable undertaking, be crowned with every success. Second and third tables were laid for the Indians, who apparently enjoyed the occasion beyond measure.\n\nThe building first used, as you are aware, Sir, was a small one-room log-shanty, with an upstairs and a kitchen attached. In this, Mr. McKay tells me, he had as many as ten children. In three years, additions have been made, until now, a fine wooden structure, with solid stone foundations and fine basement, and heated with hot air, have lately been added, at a cost of some $5,000; the whole affording accommodation for some sixty children, which it is thought will soon be had.\n\nIn my interview with the Indians during the evening, one\nand all expressed delight at having such an Institution at their doors, and many voluntarily announced their intention to bring their children to it, to be properly cared for by people who had won their hearts and confidence, by their kindness, meaning the Rev. Mr. McKay and Mrs. and Mr. Jones.\n\nSome few said that the lack of clothing debarred them, during the very cold weather which then prevailed, from bringing their children, but this difficulty was met, by instructing the Agent to furnish necessary blankets for their transport, and to see that the Instructors, if necessary, conveyed the little ones to the Institution.\n\nThe building appears to be one which will answer all purposes for the time being at least; the rooms are sufficiently spacious and arranged, and I think ample accommodation will\nwill be found for the intended number of children.\n\nOne noticeable feature was the manner in which all the work consequent upon having so many guests, most of whom remained overnight, was carried on. No confusion, nor unnecessary noise, and apparently with no more exertion than is necessary on ordinary occasions; the young girls of the Institution doing much of the work.\n\nMrs. Jones, the matron, in whose praise not too much can be said, was apparently loved by the little ones, who came about her, taking her hands, and caressing her as children would their fond mother.\n\nOn asking several of the children if they desired to leave, they immediately replied in the negative, and said they would much prefer remaining where they were, being quite happy.\n\nMrs. McKay informed me that...\nhe feared the means at his disposal would not enable him to have the boys taught trades, beyond a little carpentry, and of course farming and gardening; but as this school will, I fancy, be but a stepping-stone to the higher Industrial Institutions, to which the children may be drafted, on arriving at a certain age, the inability to teach these other trades, will not, I think, be a serious drawback.\n\nI learnt that over and above the contributions, in the way of clothing from friends in the East, the cost of maintaining each pupil\u2014apart from the sums paid for employees\u2014is $50 per annum, of which the Department pays $30.\n\nSince this school has opened, the day-schools on the Crooked Lakes Reserves have closed; the children\u2014that is such as can be had to attend any school\u2014are either at the St. Appelle Industrial School, or the Round Lake School.\nschool; and this fact goes strongly to endorse your views, advanced to the Department, in the direction of doing away entirely with day-schools under similar circumstances.\n\nI am of the opinion that Institutions similarly conducted, but with more trades taught, would bring about the good results desired, through the maintenance of the larger Institutions, but at a greatly reduced cost.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say, that from all I could see, and all I could gather from both Indians and Whites, this school, under the Rev. Mr. McKay, has the sympathy and good will of all, and consequently must necessarily be a success, which I sincerely trust it will.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\nHayt Reed\nAsst.

While we have not yet tested the machine, I am sure that it is all that could be desired. The ladies here think it a splendid machine.\n\nWe were much pleased with the contents of the bale of clothing from Toronto. I think every item I had mentioned as being short of was there, and in such liberal measure. The forty pairs of boots and shoes for boys and girls, all new from the shop, along with what we already have, will carry us through the year without having to make any investment for that purpose. Indeed we now feel that we have a supply of clothing of every kind sufficient to carry us through the year. The twelve new sets of boys' clothing were just what we needed, and we are most thankful to have them. Will you convey to the Toronto ladies our very hearty thanks for this splendid supplementary bale of clothing.\n\nI have also to report that measles of a very mild type has broken out in School. So far only one girl has taken it. The doctor happened to be on the Reserve at the time. He and Mr. Jones decided that the best thing to do was for the children to go home at once, with the hope that we could have the family to come back without its spreading further. This has been done. If any child who has gone home gives signs of taking the measles it is to be brought back to the School at once and nursed here.\n\nWe hope there may be no more cases, and that by the New Year we may have them all back again. We are having very severe weather, and the school building is very cold.

I think the present number is 30.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary Indian Department,\nOttawa.\nMemo. Rev. Mr McKenna:\n\nI beg to submit herewith as requested a statement showing the enrollment at the Round Lake Boarding school for the past four years as shown by the quarterly school returns:\n\n|       | 1895 | 1896 | 1897 | 1898 |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| March Qr. | II boys | 13 boys | II boys | II boys |\n|        | 9 girls | 7 girls | 9 girls | 16 girls |\n|        | 20    | 20    | 20    | 27    |\n| June Qr. | II boys | 13 boys | II boys | 17 boys |\n|        | 10 girls | 7 girls | 9 girls | 15 girls |\n|        | 21    | 20    | 20    | 32    |\n| Sep.

He says that there is abundance of space for 50 pupils without over-crowding.\n\nThis school was opened in 1884 by the Rev. Mr McKay, but it was not until 1887 that any grant was made to it by the Government, which allowed $1500 in that year, being at the rate of $30 per annum for each of 50 pupils, but as there were only 15 pupils drawing this grant it was doubled to $60 per capita the next year (1888), and remained at that figure till 1891, when only 40 pupils were provided for, - the cause for this apparently being that the\naverage attendance had not exceeded 25. In 1892 the number was again reduced to 20, while the rate was raised to $72,-20 pupils being the number enrolled then, as shown by the returns. The number provided for has since been increased to provide for the increased enrollment, until there are 40 pupils now provided for, although the last return shows 35 at the school with an average attendance of 30.\n\nAs the quarterly returns previous to the year 1894 have been burned, I have taken the information as to the attendance prior from the published reports of the Department, which are open to the public.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department has never contributed anything towards the buildings, which have been put up and are owned by the Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church have lately put up a new boarding school building on the Cowessess Reserve and Mr. Inspector McIlhenny, in his report late in November last, states that the building was nearly completed.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The building had cost up to that date over $7,000.00.\n\nThere is nothing on file to show that the department has contributed anything towards this building, and if anything has been promised, provision has most likely been made in the Main or Supplementary Estimates for next year, which you have before you.\n\nNo provision for the payment of a per capita grant was made for this school in this year's estimates, but the Deputy Minister in a memorandum of the 7th November last directed that it should receive the usual grant on a basis of twenty pupils to be paid from the list of last July, if the school has been in operation since then.\nMemo:\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nIn connection with the report of the Principal of the Round Lake Boarding School for the year ended the 30th of June last, it is observed that four scholars were sent home as they were consumptive and scrofulous; of these, one died; the other three are living, but have running sores, and for that reason are not allowed to mingle with healthy children.\n\nSecretary.\nRound Lake Boarding School\n\nSituation:\nThis school is beautifully situated at the East end of Round Lake and on the North side of the River, it is in the Qu'Appelle Valley, 70 miles East of Fort Qu'Appelle, and in the Crooked Lake Agency, Treaty Number 44. The P.O. Address of the school is Whitewood, Alta., N.W.T.\n\nReligion:\nIt is a Presbyterian School conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nBuildings:\nThese consist of two separate buildings of wood and stone. One contains school rooms, class rooms, boys sleeping rooms and teachers rooms. It is well ventilated and heated by furnaces. The other building contains principal rooms, kitchen, parlor, dining rooms, girls dormitories, etc. Room, etc. The last mentioned building is also well ventilated and heated by furnace. Besides these there is also a barn 24 x 40 ft with stone stable under, with room for 12 cows or 6 horses. There is also a workshop and an implement shed.\n\nThere is a good well from which a supply of pure water can always be obtained and for fire protection.\nBuildings (contd)\n\nis two chemical engines and also pails which are kept filled with water and stationed at convenient places throughout the building.\n\nHistory of School\n\nThe Boarding School at Round Lake was first opened during the winter of 1884-5 and was conducted for 3 months. It had an average of 15 pupils. In the winter of 1885-6, it was again opened and conducted for a period of four months with an attendance of 20 pupils. It was also opened for 6 months during the winter of 1886-7 with an attendance of 30 pupils.\n\nThe school was during this time conducted under the management of Rev. Hugh McKay, a Presbyterian minister who has continued as Principal of the school up to the present time. The school during the above mentioned period did not receive any grant or assistance from the Deptt. But was conducted solely at the expense of the church authorities and by voluntary subscriptions.\n\nIt was conducted in a log building which the Church authority had from time to time been improving and making additions to. During 1884, the Church expended $800.00 in improvements and also a like amount of $80.00 during 1896.\nThe children attending the school came principally from the Crooked and Round Lake Reserves.\n\nThe Rev. M. McKay stated that as the old building was very much overcrowded, that the Church Authorities proposed building during the summer (1887) and he requested that a grant be given them by the Dept. towards helping them carry on the work. He stated in his letter that there were 60 children of school age on the Reserve who were willing to attend the school providing suitable accommodation was provided.\n\nDuring the summer of 1887 extensive additions and improvements were made to the old building and when completed the new building consisted of a fine wooden structure with solid stone foundation and fine basement and heated with hot air. The whole cost of this work was $5000.00 the funds for which the Presbyterian Church supplied them but afforded ample accommodation for 60 pupils.\n\nOn the 18th May 1887 the Indian Comm. was notified that provision was made in the Supplementary Estimates for 1887-8 for a resident at the rate of $30.00 per annum for each of 50 pupils at the Round Lake.\nHistory of School Control\n\nLake Boarding School\n\nThe new building was opened for the reception of boarders on the 12th December 1887. It then began to earn the per capita grant which it has continued to receive annually ever since that date.\n\nDuring the year 1889 another building was erected in connection with the Boarding School. It was a frame building on a stone foundation well plastered inside. It is situated 50 yards from the main building. The first floor is used as a school room for all the scholars and the second floor is used as a dormitory for the boys and also rooms for the employees. This building was also erected at the expense of the Presbyterian Church authorities.\n\nA new wing 24 x 18 ft was added to the main building during 1897 at a cost of $600. The expense was also borne by the Church authorities.\n\nIn a statement showing the assets and liabilities of the Round Lake Boarding School for the year ending Dec 31st 1897, the total value of the buildings is given as $7,600.00.\n\nThe land in connection with the school consists of the south half of Section...\nLand (cont.)\n\nSection 23, Township 18, Range 3,\nWest of the 2nd Meridian. This\nland is vested in the Department of\nIndian Affairs for Agricultural\npurposes in connection with the Round\nLake Boarding School by an Order\nin Council dated the first day of\nMay 1899.\n\nThis land was part of the land\nsubsidy of the Canadian Pacific Railway\nCo., but that Company waived its\nright thereto in order that the same\nmight be granted to the Dept. for\nSchool purposes and located in\nSection 16, Township 17, Range 29, West of the\n1st Meridian and for which a Patent\nwas issued in favor of the said\nRailway Co. on the 15th Feb. 1899.\n\nThe purchase of the School, the Rev. Mr.\nMcKay in a letter to the Dept. Dated\nMay 23rd 1888 first applied requesting\nthat the above described piece of\nland viz.: \"the South half of Section\n23, Township 18, Range 3, West of\nthe 2nd Meridian\" be set aside for\nthe purpose of the Boarding School at\nRound Lake.\n\nIt was found on enquiry from the\nInterior Dept. that this land was\nthe property of the C.P.R. and formed\npart of the land grant to that Co.\nAfter a very considerable correspondence\nextending\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLand (contd.)\n\nextending over a period of 11 years from April 23rd, 1888 to May 1st, 1899 in reference to the land in question the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. finally waived its right and agreed to accept in exchange a portion of land of like value.\n\nThis Exchange was confirmed by the Order in Council before referred to Dated May 1st, 99 and the title to the land so transferred in the Dept. of Indian Affairs for the purpose of the Round Lake Boarding School. All the correspondence in connection with this grant of land to the Dept. will be found on File No. 117,080\n\nPer Capita Grant\n\n1887-8\n\nThis School was first opened during the winter of 1884-5 by the Rev. Hugh McKay but it was not until the December quarter 1887 that it began to receive any Government Grant. The first per capita grant made to the school was $500.00 which was voted in the Subsidiary Estimates for 1887-8 being at the rate of $6.00 per annum for each of 50 pupils. Only 15 pupils showed earned and were paid this grant, that being the average attendance at the school for that year.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nPer Capita Grant (cont.)\n\n1888-89\n\nDuring the next fiscal year the per capita grant was doubled and the school was voted an allowance of $60.00 per capita for each of 50 pupils. This was voted in the Estimates for 1888-89. The average attendance of pupils for the year was 19.\n\nThe grant to the school for the year (1889-90) was the same as that of the previous year viz: $60.00 per capita for each of 50 pupils. The average attendance for the year was 24.\n\nThe number of pupils receiving the grant this year was reduced to 40. They were voted an allowance of $60.00 per capita each. The average attendance for the year was 18. The number of pupils allowed the grant during this year was again reduced while the rate was raised. The Estimates provided for 20 pupils at $72.00 per capita. The average attendance for the year was 16.\n\nDuring the next five years viz: 1892-3, 1893-4, 1894-5, 1895-6, 1896-7, the grant to this school remained at the rate of $72.00 per capita for each of 20 pupils. The number of pupils allowed the grant this year was increased by 10.\nPer Capita Grant (cont'd)\n\nand the Estimate provided for a grant of $72.00 per capita for each of 36 pupils.\n\nIn 1898-99, the number of pupils allowed the grant was again increased by ten. The year after, the school was allowed an additional grant of $72.00 per capita for each of 40 pupils.\n\nThis addition of ten pupils was provided for in the Supplementary Estimate for 1898-99.\n\nThe Estimate for this year contains an item \"to increase the number of pupils at the Round Lake Birch River Boarding School\" by adding 15 pupils added @ $72.00 per capita. This will provide for a total of 50 pupils @ $72.00 per capita.\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform the Department that I have just learned that the Rev. Hugh McKay, Principal of the Round Lake Boarding school has resigned, and that Mr. R.P. Heron, late Principal of the Regina Industrial school is moving from Regina to Round Lake to take charge for at least six months.\n\nWhen I first heard, some four weeks ago that Mr. Heron had been asked by Mr. McKay to go there, I felt confident that no such change would take place, as the Department would not sanction it, but while in Regina last week, Mr. Heron told me he was about to leave to take charge of the school, and I am of the opinion that the change is taking place without reference to the Department.\n\nMr. Heron has proven himself to be the last man that should have anything to do with an Indian school. His management of the Regina School gave me ample opportunity to judge him, and while my different reports on this institution did not contain all the details I might have given, still I thought enough was said to satisfy the\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment and the Church Authorities, that he was quite unfitted for the position he held, and that once relieved from it, he would not again be employed in a similar position. Aside from Mr. Heron not having business ability, he is deplorably lacking in his discipline and above all, allowed the Indian children, who were entrusted to his care to live in a most filthy condition.\n\nI have had children Indians come all the way to File Hills to complain bitterly about the condition in which they found their children, saying that they were covered with vermin, and it was not necessary for me to depend entirely upon the Indians' word for this condition of affairs, as the children that were transferred from Regina to File Hills, had vermin on them, even after much time had been spent to prepare them for the transfer; what must they have been like before they were cleaned up?\n\nAs you are aware there was a constant changing of staff and no self respecting person would stay more than a few months. When they were installing the plumbing in the school, the workmen on the job complained about the manner in which they were served their meals etc.\n\nIn view of all this it seems wrong to send out Indian children to a school under such a man\nand I can assure the Department that while the Round Lake Boarding school is not at all what it should be, it will not be long before it will be even worse if Mr. Heron is permitted to take charge, even temporarily. I cannot reconcile myself to ask Indians to send their children to a school conducted on the lines Mr. Heron adopts. When Mr. Heron first went to take charge of Regina it was said to be only a temporary arrangement.\n\nI trust the Department will take immediate steps to stop any such arrangement as is proposed between Mr. Heron and Mr. McKay.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp. of Indian Agencies\nOttawa, December 30, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is unofficially informed that the Rev. R. B. Baron is at present acting as Principal of the Round Lake Boarding School and I have to ask you to be good enough to inform the Department by whose authority he was placed in charge, when he assumed his duties and when his term as Acting Principal will expire. An early reply will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nOn the 17th of November last I wrote to the Department with reference to Mr. Heron, late Principal of the Regina Industrial school, going to take charge of the Round Lake Boarding school. I strongly urged the Department not to allow the change to take place and gave what I thought good and sufficient reasons for my action. Up to now I am in the dark and do not know what action the Department has taken in the matter. I cannot conscientiously ask Indians to send their children to Mr. Heron; it is not fair to the parents, and I hope the Department will take steps to adjust this matter.\n\nThe Principal of the File Hills Boarding school called at my office yesterday to say that she had received a letter from Mr. Heron, who is now at Round Lake, asking her to send to his school Susan Drever, formerly a pupil of the Regina school, but transferred to File Hills when that school was closed. Mr. Heron says that it was the wish of the parents of this child that she should go to Round Lake when Regina was first closed. Miss Cunningham thinks that Mr. Heron should have written to the Department or myself on this matter, and tells me she wrote to Mr. Heron on these lines.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\nIt seems to me that now we are starting off with a new arrangement regarding schools, there should be no difficulty in adjusting this matter. We know the man is unfit to manage an Indian school; many of the Church people are convinced of this, and I fail to see how matters in connection with our schools will ever be bettered, if men of this kind are to be kept on, in the face of all we know. I say it is a gross injustice to the Indian.\n\nI know of nothing more I can do to press upon the Department the importance of having him removed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIngr. of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, January 4, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo in reference to the appointment of Mr. Heron as Principal of the Round Lake Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department understands that this is only temporary while Rev. Dr. McKay is on furlough. However, I may say that on the 30th ultimo Rev. Dr. McKay, Toronto, was written to in reference to the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nYour note just received, stating that you have been unofficially informed that Rev. R. B. Heron is acting as Principal of the Round Lake Boarding School, and asking for information as to his appointment, and so forth.\n\nThis is the first intimation I have had of such an appointment, and I think it is probably an unfounded report. I have in my hands the Minutes of the Synodical Committee in Winnipeg, and in these Minutes it is stated that Mr. Heron has been appointed Missionary to the Qu'Appelle Reserves. It is also stated that Dr. Hugh Mackay tendered his resignation to the Round Lake School, which was accepted by the Committee, and they were in search of another Principal. I was told incidentally that Dr. Mackay had come to Ontario on leave of absence. In the meantime, I presume it will be necessary to have some person take temporary charge of the School until another is secured. If Mr. Heron has been invited to do such service, it would be simply as locum tenens. That there is no intention of appointing him permanently, I am quite certain.\n\nI shall, however, write to Dr. Ferguson and make further enquiries as to what has actually been done. I hope they will be successful in securing a competent Principal, and that at an early date.\n\nWishing you and all in the Department a very happy New Year.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 17, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a detailed report upon the buildings and work being performed at the Round Lake Boarding School.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this letter to take up the matter of better accommodation, as this will have to be dealt with in connection with the new contract which goes into effect on April 1st, next. It is the desire, however, to bring to your attention one feature of the work at this school. The Department is informed that the school is keeping at present 106 head of cattle and 19 horses. The work in connection with the caring for this stock falls, to a large extent, on the Indian boys and it is altogether too heavy for them. I may say that the Department had a visit recently from a deputation of Indians from the Province of Saskatchewan and, among other things, these Indians complained that the boys attending this and other institutions in the province were given too much manual labour. The Department is disposed to think that in some cases there is foundation for the complaint. It appears to the Department that it would be in the interests of both the school and the boys from a practical standpoint if the stock at this institution were reduced to such a number that they can be carefully and properly looked after without entailing an undue proportion of manual labour. The stock at present is\n\nRev. R. F. MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIn a very poor condition, due probably to the fact that there is more work than the staff can properly look after and, as the primary object is to give the Indian boys practical instruction in the management and care of stock, it is considered that the school should not carry more than can be adequately cared for. It is thought that 30 head of cattle is all that the Round Lake Boarding School should have.\n\nI would ask you to bring this matter to the attention of the proper authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nThamesford, Ont.,\nFebruary 21st, 1911.\n\nDear Dr. MacKey;\n\nYours, and copy of letter from Ottawa, received. We generally keep two span of working horses in the stable, and a span of drivers, besides giving stable room to the ponys of the Indians who come to visit us. We have a few other horses growing up to take the place of those in use when they become disabled or disposed of. We had to shoot five of our best horses last spring for gliders. We were glad to have a little herd on the prairie to help fill the rank. The horses on the prairie trouble no one summer or winter as they feed out all winter as well as in summer. There are about 50 head of cattle at Round Lake at present, a number of which are cows which we need to supply the school with milk and butter. We make no butter to sell, and from the rest of the herd we have to take our beef for the school, and it is largely due to the abundance of fresh milk and butter, and fresh beef that our children are so healthy, having only one death in eight years, and not a sickly child in the school when we left on December 14th.\n\nIn regard to the condition in which our cattle are at present, I am not able to speak, but have always two men hired to look after the heavy work about the school.\n\nWe have always insisted on our boys and girls in the school doing two hours manual work each day in the school, as reported to the Indian Department, and any further work is optional and paid for at the rate of ten cents an hour for driving a team or any other work on the farm. Last summer I bargained with an Indian who lives 30 miles from the school, to take some of our cattle and take care of them. This he did with the approval of the agent. He had any amount of hay, and it is profitable to him feeding it to cattle and of help to the school. These cattle are kept by him summer and winter, and the boys in the school never see them. About 80 are there at present, and I had a letter from Mr. MacKay, Farm Instructor for those Indians saying the cattle are in fine condition.\n\n24 years ago Mrs. Mortimer Clark sent me $40. for the use of the school. With this money I bought a cow and now there is a herd, profitable for the school. 30 years ago we bought a mare Boss, and she is the origin of the herd of horses and the school has had the use of them. Now I trust you understand how the school is situated in regard to these things.\n\nIn regard to the future of our school, I am in the dark. I know nothing of the changes required by the Church or the Government, of the conditions under which the school is to be conducted. We are leaving for the north west next week, and will spend a day in Winnipeg and talk things over with the F.M.C. there.\nMrs. McKay has been feeling better since coming east. She joins me in kind greetings.\n\nI am,\n\nYours in the work,\n\n(signed.) H. McKay.\n\nP.S.; We would like if the Indian Department would mention one case in which our contract with the boys has been violated in the past 27 years.\n\nH. M.\nFebruary 24th, 1911\n\nMr. Johnson C. Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott;\n\nYour letter received some days ago re the herd and horses at the Round Lake Indian School as reported by the Agent. I sent a copy of your letter to Dr. MacKay who is in Thamesford, but is to leave this week for the West. I send you a copy of his reply, which I think is rather a satisfactory answer to the Agent's report. I would be glad however to know your views upon it. I have seen the herd. That they should be in poor condition, I do not very well understand, because when I was there and saw them in the summer, I have never seen a more beautiful lot of cattle. There were, at that time, I think if I remember rightly, about 80. They gave trouble to nobody, wandering where there was plenty of pasture. Then this is to be remembered that whilst other schools were coming to us with deficits and financial troubles, Dr. MacKay scarcely ever did. If his crop failed and he found things unsatisfactory, he would sell a number of bullocks and make it up. It was a sort of reserve deposit in the interests of the school. Then his practice has been for many years to require two hours labor daily from each boy, and afterwards to pay for any labor done. He encouraged these lads to deposit their money and keep a bank account, which he looked after for them. If any boy wanted extra, he could get it out of his own bank. Sometimes a portion of the land was assigned to a boy and he was encouraged to cultivate it paying for any labor given by the school or the use of machinery as an ordinary farmer would, and whatever profits belonging to himself. That was his method of developing independence.\n\nPersonally may I say that I regret exceedingly that anything should have arisen to mar the happiness Dr. MacKay has had in his work for so many years. If we ever had a consecrated man in the West, he is one of them. This I say rather as an expression of personal judgment; the matter to which his letter is a reply is official and must be dealt with in that way.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRPM-RS.\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKay in reference to the management of the Round Lake Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. McKay does not appear to have appreciated the nature of the criticism made. The Indians complained that the boys at this school are overworked. Following this complaint came a report from the Departmental Inspector, which not only corroborated the complaint of the Indians, but showed that the cattle were in such condition that they were a disgrace to the institution, which is supposed so far as the Indians are concerned to be a model to them.\n\nThe fact that boys are paid for work in excess of two hours each day in accordance with a contract is no refutation of the statements made by the Indians and the Inspector.\n\nMr. McKay refers to the health of the pupils. In this connection I may say that the Inspector reported that they were well-fed and well-clad and spoke in very commendatory terms of the class-room work.\n\nThe state of the building and equipment and the general management was, however, far from satisfactory.

In regard to the whole of this Indian work, I would ask the Department to exercise some patience, as we are arranging for a reconstruction of our whole system. As you are aware, the Home Mission Board has taken this matter over, and, with the authority of the Board, I have visited a number of these centres where we are carrying on work, and I frankly admit that, both as to the plant and as to the staff, the work is not on the scale that it ought to be, and to me is not at all satisfactory. You will understand that I have to meet with the different committees that have the oversight of this work, and that the plan that I am evolving for the future conduct of the work is yet to be submitted to them and approved before it can be put into effect. If your Department will be kind enough to exercise patience until we can get this work on a different scale, I would appreciate it very much, as it is our intention to greatly increase the efficiency of this work in the very near future. I\nmay say that I visited the Birtle School, and I do not think that\nthe improvements that we are making there on these buildings\nare satisfactory; in fact I think we are wasting money there.\n\nAt the Cecil Jeffrey School, where we had an estimated expenditure of some $5,000, it is going to cost us over\n$30,000 before the work is completed, and, although it will\ngreatly improve our plant, yet I do not think that it was a\nwise thing to spend that much money on the enlargement and\nimprovement of an old building.\n\nThere are other matters that we are discussing as\nto methods, looking both to the consolidation of certain\ndepartments of the work among the Indians, and to the securing\nof greater efficiency by these methods, and I hope that you\nwill be patient with us until we get matters lined up. We anticipate certain changes at Birtle, but, while the process of\nreconstructing the building was under way and we had no contracts,\nand the responsibility rested largely with the Principal, we\ncould not make the changes for the present that we wanted to make.\n\nWe will be glad always to receive any suggestions\nfrom your Department, and do our best to act upon them looking\nto the improvement of the work.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nOttawa, January 7, 1913.\n\nRev.

This increase was made upon the condition that the necessary building operations would be undertaken and carried to completion. As the school now stands it is not entitled to be graded in Class \"A\", but in Class \"C\" and from the first of the current quarter the grant will be paid only at the rate of $100.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI am in receipt of yours of March 8th, with copy of Inspector Graham's report. The condition of things at the Round Lake School is due to the failure of the Government to provide the necessary plant for the carrying on of the work there. We are not going to spend another dollar on buildings. That is the Government's business, and I have notified them of this repeatedly. We will not send a Principal to take charge of the work at Round Lake. Dr. McKay is only there temporarily, waiting until the Government is prepared to give us buildings where we can secure a Principal who is capable of carrying on the work satisfactorily. Hence the present state of the school.\n\nWe will not spend any money on those old buildings. If the Government want to, they can do so. We will not put a man there until you give us the plant. If, in these circumstances, you are not ready to come up to your own standard, and you so wish it, we can close the school until this is done, although I think that\nMr. J. D. McL.\n\nthat would be a great mistake. I have discussed this matter more than once with the Inspector, and he knows himself what the situation is, and why there is an adverse report. I think it would be good business to see that a building is put there at once, although money is scarce. When that is done, we will certainly secure someone other than the Doctor to take charge of the work.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As you are aware it is my wish to have a new building erected at Round Lake at the earliest possible date, but until the Department can obtain funds it is not possible to proceed with the work. I quite agree with you that it would be a waste of money to make any extensive repairs to the old building, but at the same time the condition of the building at present is no valid excuse for the apparent neglectful management of the institution. The premises and the children themselves might at least be kept clean, and some of the equipment for which the authorities in charge are responsible might also be maintained in better condition.\n\nYou will have noted the inspector's very\n\nRev.

The condition of the main building can hardly be advanced by the staff as an excuse for this filthiness.\n\nThe class-room work also is being neglected, as the teacher is not efficient. This can hardly be attributed to the dilapidated building.\n\nThe only redeeming feature about the institution appears to be that the children are well fed.\n\nEven under existing conditions I think the Department is within its rights in insisting that a reasonable degree of cleanliness be observed by the present management. We have several other institutions in the west where the buildings are not up to the standard, but in none of these have the staffs, as they appear to have done in this case, abandoned their efforts to manage the schools with some degree of efficiency.\n\nI trust that you will communicate with Dr. McKay and impress upon him the advisability, in the interests of the work among these Indians, of giving\ngiving better attention to the administration of affairs in connection with the school while he continues in charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This communication read as follows:\n\n\"The special committee appointed by Presbytery by instructions of the H.M. and S.S. Board's Sub-Executive to plan and oversee the work and secure the necessary funds, reports to Presbytery:\n\n1. That in order to adequately accommodate the pupils of the Round Lake Indian School, it will be necessary to erect a two-story addition with a basement 40 x 40 feet to the south of the present Boarding School Building, the basement of this building to contain kitchen, fuel room and engine room; the ground floor senior boys' sleeping room, bath rooms and water closets for 25 pupils; the second floor senior girls' sleeping room, bath rooms and water closets for 25 pupils;\n\n2. That the building will cost $9,400, in addition to the $6,000 worth of lumber now on the grounds;\n\n3. That the total amount of money that can be secured locally for this work is $2,400;\n\n4. That the remaining $6,000 will have to be provided from some other source.\n\nWe, the Presbytery of Qu'Appelle, do therefore petition the Home Mission and Social Service Board to provide the necessary additional $6,000, to enable the above special committee of Presbytery to proceed with this much needed and long delayed addition to the Boarding School Buildings at Round Lake.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\nAfter deliberation, the Board decided to give general approval of the recommendation of Presbytery, on the understanding that Presbytery should appoint a strong business committee to plan and carry out the whole project.\n\nIt was further decided to appoint a layman as assistant to the Principal, in order to relieve Mr. McKay of administrative duties and thus leave him free for missionary work.\n\nSince Mr. Turnbull and I interviewed you in Ottawa, I have written to the Superintendent and to the Presbytery Convener, asking them to make no move until plans for the new building have been submitted to you for approval. We have also urged that a good business committee should make a visit to Round Lake, if possible in company with Mr. Graham.\n\nAs the Government is planning, some day to build a new school at Round Lake, possible on another site, it is very desirable that the Church should expend the smallest amount of money that is necessary to make the building comfortable and large enough for the pupils that are seeking admission.\n\nWe have asked Dr. Strang, our District Superintendent, to be on the look-out for an assistant.

Commissioner Graham when he looked at the plan last spring was of opinion that the Government estimate was much too low, but apart from this altogether, it should be remembered that not only was the 40x40 addition erected but the south wing of the old building was incorporated in the new and entirely re-modelled. This with the space in the old building and the new should furnish ample accommodation for 80 pupils at the very least.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Peter Strang.\nMr. D. C.

In the last report we had from Round Lake Principal he speaks of 32 boys and 26 girls - 60 in all, and he intimates that more were anxious to come in. He states that there are many little children who were made orphans on account of the influenza epidemic. As soon as I received the report from the School, I wrote Dr. Strang. Enclosed please find copy of his reply.\n\nI will be glad if you will have your representative look into this matter.

Taylor (Indian Agent).\n\nOn Monday July 26th 1919 I proceeded with Mr. Taylor the Indian Agent in his auto to the Cowessess Reserve, North of Broadview to investigate the above complaint as per the request of the Officer Commanding Southern Sask. District. I obtained the following statements from the different witnesses.\n\nMiss Orelia Dodge stated: \"I am the Matron of the Round Lake Indian Boarding School. On the night of the 15th of June 1919, I was told by an Indian named Roy Berry that 3 or 4 of our Indians were going to break into the school that night. About 1 a.m., I was in a room upstairs near the big girls dormitory, and heard footsteps on the stairs. I had a flashlight in my hand and went through the small girls dormitory, into the big girls dormitory. A man was under the bed with a quilt over him, and the pupil (Harriet Francis) was under the bed. I said to the man 'William get me out of this', which he did with the quilt over him. I tried to pull the quilt off him but only had one hand, the other holding the flashlight, and could not get it. He went down the stairs and must have got out through the window of the old dining-room. I asked some of the girls who it was, but they said they were asleep. I convinced that it was Willie Gaddie an ex-pupil of the school, who had been hanging around the school for some time. These boys are nuisances, because we have to watch them closely. He must have had a key to open the dormitory door, but to get through the small girls' dormitory, he must have got through the transom window, where the floor is open. The door from the inside was easy to make his escape. I do not know what they break into the school for. These boys who have been hanging around the school are Henry and John Crow. The boys have got into trouble before, because I have seen their tracks, and I have warned them. They are all ex-pupils of the school. I did not see William Gaddie's face, but I could tell it was him by his build and walk. He did not hang around. These boys are all about 20 years of age.\"\n\nHarriet Francis, stated as follows:\n\nIndian pupil at the Round Lake Boarding School for 8 years of age and have attended the school for 8 years. One night about the middle of June 1919, I heard a man standing beside my bed in the big girls dormitory. It was dark in the room at the time and I could not see who it was. The night before William Gaddie and Robert Bear came into the building. I did not know these boys were coming to the school. William Gaddie bought Robert Bear's quilt from his bed. Robert Bear got into Bertha's bed. Miss Dodge caught William Gaddie, the others were under the beds, and while Miss Dodge was catching the others got away. All the boys were in the dormitory that night.\"\nDifferent Indian boys are getting into the school (into the big girls dormitory) nearly every night when the school is on. I know one of these boys, his name is George Kenowakesquane. He goes to see Willie Iron Bear. I think the boys get in through the window of the old dining room, and up the stairs through the small girls dormitory. I think these boys come up to have sexual intercourse with us.\n\nVictorine Kashane, stated as follows:- I am a pupil at the Round Lake Indian Boarding School, and have been there about four years. I think I am about 16 years old. The night that Miss Dodge (The Matron) caught Willie Gaddie in the big girls dormitory which was about the 5th of June 1919, Robert Bear was standing beside my bed, while Miss Dodge was away attending to Willie. Robert hit in the bathroom. The three boys I saw in the dormitory that night was Willie Gaddie, Robert Bear & Hoderick Henry all Indians and ex-pupils of the school. They came in through the small girls dormitory, and into the big girls room. Jean Watsonson & Tom Bear sleep in the next bed to mine. Robert Bear was lying on the floor between the two beds while Miss Dodge caught Willie. They get into the school about every other night. The last time they came in was two or three days before we had our holidays, which would make it about the 25th June. When the boys come up at nights they sit on the bed and talk to us. I don't know what else they come up for.\n\nOwing to the fact that the holidays are on at the school, these were the only witnesses I could see, quite a number of the Indians are away to the Fair at Regina & taken the girls with them. The School opens up again August the 4th so will be able to get further information. From what I can see these girls are very fond of these boys, and it is hard to get such information from them. The Principal of the Round Lake School is Doctor McKay, and although he knows that this sort of thing has been going on, does not seem to adopt any measures to prevent it. In fact he suggested that the investigations be stopped. Anything that he knows about this is of course hearsay so did not get a statement from him. Mr. Crookson Asst. Principal of the School informed me that the boys mentioned are a nuisance by hanging around the School, and I'm sure they are around for no good purpose. He seems very anxious to stop this, but everything that he know is what the Matron(Miss Dodge) tells him.\n\nThe Commissioner,\n\nForwarded,\n\n(Sgd.) C. Richardson, Sergt.\n1/closprendview Detachment.\nCommanding Southern Saskatchewan Brigade, 5111.\n\nRegina,\nAugust 4th 1919.\nVictorine Kashane states \"These boys have been into the school three times since Miss Dodge taught Willie. They get into the school about every other night. The last time they came in was two or three days before we had our holidays, which would be about the 25th., of June.\"\n\nIt appears to me that some action could be taken by those in charge to prevent this.\n\nI would be glad to hear from you on this subject and would ask you to advise if you think that a warning to those lads from Sergeant Richardson would have the desired effect.\n\nIt would seem advisable there should be an amendment to the Indian Act with regard to those schools to cover the cases of boys hanging around and making a nuisance of themselves.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Commissioner.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Richardson, in charge of Detachment at Broadview, in connection with his investigation on the above subject.\n\nAfter looking up the Criminal Code and also the Act, with a view to prosecution in this case, the only section which would seem to cover the matter is No. 459 \"Housebreaking with Intent\" of the Code.\n\nIt would seem, however, from the evidence in the report, that a conviction would be difficult, and, in any case, such action would not appear from the report that no steps had been taken by those in charge to prevent the entry of those Indian Boys into the School.\n\nShe further states that Indian Boys are seen in the girls dormitory nearly every other day when school is on. She further states that the boys get in through the window, climb up the stairs through the dormitory.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sask.\nAug. 27th, 1919.\n\nMr. Taylor,\nIndian Agent.\n\nSir,-\n\nI received yours containing report of Sergt. Richardson, re Round Lake Boarding School.\n\nMiss Dodge in her statement speaks of these boys being expupils of the Round Lake School; two of these boys are ex-pupils of our School and two of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nI feel discouraged and disappointed because of these things occurring at our school - we have been under a great disadvantage since building operations began, parts of the old building being taken down; the boys and girls deprived of their day rooms and much discomfort and worry for members of the staff. I am much to blame in not insisting that different locks be put on the doors and fanlights above the doors and windows. I am sorry if any reflection is cast upon the Matron and those who assist her in the School, the work these ladies did during building operations was more than we could expect them to do, they were willing and I allowed, when I should have engaged an assistant to help in caring for the workmen.\n\nI could get no direct evidence against these boys for house breaking but as soon as I suspected I secured the windows and fanlights by nailing numberlock, had padlocks put on the doors and other things that I thought would make the sleeping rooms secure. I endeavored to find evidence against William Gaddie next morning, I made inquiries among the pupils who slept there, all I could find out was some one was in the room but did not know who it was. I asked Harriet Francis but all she knew was that some one was in the room. I might have prosecuted William Gaddie for vagrancy - but he is one of my boys, and so much about him that I admire his musical talent, song, his free-hand drawing, his affable and seeming kind disposition, I feel surely there is some other way besides having him placed behind the bars. I took him into my house for ten days. I talked to him pointing out the consequences of following the indolent way leading to bad times. Mrs. McKay also talked with him and pleaded with him to be a man, to go to work and make a home for himself - not a vagrant that everyone would despise; he showed penitence and promised to try and live a better life, we prayed with him and for him, after going out I went after him and walked with him to the bridge, he said, \"I know you are interested in me and would like to see me do well.\"\n\nIt is hard for me to give him up, I still have a hope that he will reform and become a useful citizen yet had I clear evidence that he was in the girls' room I would have him prosecuted but without clear evidence I did not want to make the case public.\n\nThis school and mission has been my life work, I did not accomplish what I expected to do. During the 35 years we have been here in charge of the school there has not been a single case of a boy going away and leaving the school in disgrace. I trust no one will think that we are indifferent in regard to the honor of the school, Mrs. McKay gave 8 of her best years to the school free of charge and we have spent a few thousand dollars from our own private account in trying to lift up the people among whom we have been sent to work.\n\nWe feel it much as we are retiring from the work and younger people taking charge that we should have to take with us this disappointment, however we have tried to do our duty.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n\"H.

Taylor (Indian Agent).\n\nOn August 21st 1919 I patrolled by saddle horse to the Cowessess Reserve and interviewed the following Indians William Gaddie, Albert Bear and Roderick Henry they being three of the four parties alleged to be breaking into the School at Round Lake. I gave these lads a good talking to, and also pointed out to them the seriousness of the offence, as per the request of Commissioner Graham of the Indian Department. By talking to them The other boy George Kenoweksqape was away so was unable to see him till Saturday August 30th and I gave him a good talking to in a like manner, which I think will have the desired effect. On making enquiries at the Round Lake School on I find that these boys have not been around since I was there investigating this case, so think after my talking to them they will keep away from the School in future. Owing to the fact that I have been very busy during the last ten days, and being unable to get hold of George Kenoweksqape, I was not able to comply with the Diary Date 27-8-19.\n\nRichardson, Sergt.\nl/c of Broadview Detachment.\nReg.

The fact that building operations were going on during the summer made it exceedingly difficult to have the customary precautions as to security of windows, doors, etc. Your committee would call attention to this statement in Dr. McKay's letter\u2014\"During the 35 years we have been in charge of the School there has not been a single case of a girl going astray and leaving the School in disgrace\".\n\nYour Committee have made enquiries and find that preventive measures have been taken, and that the dormitories are properly secured against entrance.\n\nExtracted from the Records of the Presbytery of Qu'Appelle.\n\n(Signed) Thos.

I beg to inform you that there has, since the last returns went in, been a change in the administration of Round Lake School. This change consists of the retirement of the Rev. Dr. McKay and the appointment of Rev. Cookson to succeed. I regret to say that Dr. McKay was somewhat lax in the matter of allowing the children to absent themselves from school, and as he is now away, and as the new principal cannot furnish a reason for the absence of these pupils, I am sorry to say that your letter in this respect cannot be replied to in a very satisfactory way. Dr. McKay, in spite of my wishes, and instructions, allowed the children out of school on the slightest pretexts, and it was always a difficult thing to keep the pupils in the school room, however the Reverend Doctor's successor appears to have the school well in hand and I am confident there will be no more complaints of this nature.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

You can readily understand that we cannot maintain sixty-three pupils with a Grant for Forty-two. I think we should have an increased grant beginning January 1st, 1921.\n\nAm glad to say that the Agent, Mr. Taylor, has been very helpful in increasing the attendance at the School.\n\nI had conference with Commissioner Graham the other day. He seems quite hopeful now of our work at Round Lake.\n\nHoping we may receive a favorable reply soon, believe me\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE:MB.\nAbsent full quota\n12 present for only\npart of quota\n\nTotal Enrolment = 57\nOver attired = 43\n\nFunds forwarded for $75\nOttawa, March 17, 1921\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the pupilage allowed at the Round Lake Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a grant is allowed this school for seventy-five pupils, having been increased to this number from April 1, 1920. It was through an oversight that you were not personally informed that a grant had been allowed to provide for that number.\n\nThe return received for the December quarter last, shows an enrolment of fifty-seven pupils. Of this number nine were absent the whole of the quarter and twelve others were only in attendance part of the time. The average attendance for the quarter was forty-three and grant was paid for that number. In the past pupils at this school were allowed leave of absence by the principal, sometimes for lengthy periods, for very trivial reasons and as a consequence the school suffered by the loss of the grant.\n\nOur agent has been instructed that, acting in conjunction with the principal, every effort should be made to recruit new pupils for this school up to the number provided for.\n\nThe additions and alterations made to the school buildings in 1919 provided dormitories and other accommodation for seventy-five pupils, the number provided for.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nRev.

There is only seating capacity for forty-eight children and they have to take them in turn.\n\nThe second floor of the building is unoccupied and could be used for another school room. It would be necessary of course to get another teacher. They have, I think, sufficient furniture to seat this room.\n\nWhen I spoke to the principal, he said the church was afraid of the expense, but, I think if they are allowed from 60 to 70 children they should furnish accommodation for them.\n\nSome progress is being made here but the new principal, Mr. Greer, seems very dissatisfied and I fear will not stay long.\n\nE. Taylor,\nAgent.\nOttawa, February 4, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your report on the Round Lake Boarding School for the month of January, 1922. I have noted your remarks that the classroom accommodation is not adequate and that the new Principal, Mr. Greer, seems dissatisfied and may not remain long as Principal of the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the matters requiring attention are being taken up with the Presbyterian Mission Board authorities in Toronto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Taylor, the Indian Agent at Broadview, Sask., in which he states that Mr. Greer, the new Principal of the Round Lake Indian Boarding School, seems dissatisfied, and our representative fears that he will not remain long as principal. I am convinced that Mr. Agent Taylor's findings should be brought to your attention.\n\nThe Department received no intimation of Mr. Greer's appointment, and I wish to state that, when the Church authorities appoint a principal to an Indian residential school, it is extremely desirable that some official intimation be received for our files. If for no other reason, the information is needed to prevent incongruous communications. I am sure you will understand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

(RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 24, 1922.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nThe report of one of the Department's travelling nurses on the Round Lake Boarding School brings to my mind the desirability of reviewing with you the conditions under which the staff is working and the Indian children are being educated.\n\nThe Department allows at Round Lake a pupilage of 75, and it is felt that the building which the Presbyterian church erected can accommodate this number. However, the heating system has been so unsatisfactory that practically the whole of the top floor is not used in winter for living accommodation. The average attendance for the December quarter was 49, and they have been sleeping in crowded dormitories and studying in a classroom much too small.\n\nTo remedy these conditions, I believe it may be necessary to make a complete change in the heating plant. The building has been so cold that school could not be held on certain days this winter.\n\nA more satisfactory heating arrangement would permit of the utilizing of the upper rooms for dormitory accommodation. In passing - I understand that more mattresses are needed for the boys' sleeping quarters. I will make enquiries concerning mattresses in the Department's stores in Regina.\n\nIf a half-day routine is not in use at the Round Lake Boarding School during the winter months, it will be necessary to either initiate it or fit up another classroom and employ a second teacher.\n\nLast December the Department approved of a plan for better ventilation. It was suggested that the ventilation shaft for the dormitories be equipped with an aspirating coil. From a careful perusal of the nurse's report, I am inclined to believe that this change has not been made and, if made, is not an improvement.\n\nThe church authorities would be assisted in financing, if there was paid more careful attention to the matter of attendance. In the past, holidays of long duration have been allowed for trivial reasons, and the result is an unearned per capita income. The enrolment of pupils during\n\n- the past year -\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Board of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nthe past year has been about 15 more than the average attendance. This situation is, I am convinced, unique. Residential schools should show an average attendance of at least 90 per cent.\n\nI am not writing direct to the Principal of the school. I have noted that you anticipate a short tenure of office for the Rev. Mr. Greer, at present in charge, and I feel that the Department's efforts might be abortive if I directed our communication direct to him. I hope that, during your annual meeting next month, a strong incumbent for the position of Principal of the Round Lake Boarding School will be nominated.\n\nWith a view to making any necessary changes in the heating plant, this Department, with your approval, proposes to send an expert from Regina to inspect and make suggestions. We hope to be in a position to arrange for the proper heating of the school, without cost to the church authorities.\n\nI wish to assure you of my personal interest in the Round Lake Boarding School at this time, and anything that the Department can do to better conditions will be freely offered.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have yours of February 24th re the Round Lake Boarding School. I have taken this matter up with the Women's Missionary Society and I have received this morning a communication from the Indian Committee of the W.M.S., part of which reads as follows:\n\nRe Heating System. - I have been in close correspondence with Rev. Mr. Greer and other staff members and not once during this winter did they report that furnace was inadequate for heating but I know that there was a difference of opinion between Dr. McKay and some of the members of the Building Committee at the time the school was built and I learned that Dr. McKay built up the furnace in the old building after the Committee had ruled otherwise. I am not sure what effect this would have on the heating system. It is necessary to have in use the top dormitories, all that they are properly heated and it may be necessary to make complete change in heating system. If so we would welcome the kind suggestions from Department to send an expert to inspect and make suggestions, also the offer to arrange for proper heating of school without cost to Church authorities.\n\nThe past two years have been the hardest on our W.M.S. financially since our organization over forty years ago.\n\nRe Class Room Attendance. - The last report from school reported about 70 enrolled but we admit that in the past the attendance has been irregular but we have hopes that this will soon be remedied.\n\nRe Better Ventilation. - Mr. Cookson reported to me that they had procured in Winnipeg the necessary coil for better ventilation and asked me just recently whether I knew if it had ever been put in. I had not been advised at all in the matter and did not know how matters stood.\n\nPersonally, I am grateful to Dr. Scott for his generous offer of personal interest and I feel he knows the situation and will help us out.\n\nRe Mattresses. - We have sent in recently 24 mattresses from Regina (Dept. Stores.)\n\nWe expect to purchase a few more single beds and also more mattresses later on.\"\nI hope we will be able to secure a permanent Principal by April first. This, it seems to me, would be the solution of our problems at Round Lake. The average attendance of the school ought to be much higher than 49.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EMS\nOttawa, March 7, 1922.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 4th instant, concerning the Round Lake Boarding School. I have noted the remarks of the Indian Committee of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church, and I am pleased to learn that every effort is being made to make the school more efficient.\n\nI agree with you that the appointment of a permanent principal will likely be a solution of the problems at Round Lake, and, as intimated in my communication of this file number of the 24th ultimo, I will be pleased to send an expert on hearing from Regina to inspect and make suggestions. Any alterations that are necessary we will endeavour to finance without cost to the Church authorities. As I am writing to Mr. Commissioner Graham in this connection, you might communicate with the principal and prepare him for the visit of our representative.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

TAYLOR'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF FEBRUARY, ON ROUND LAKE SCHOOL.\n\n(Original on File 108-1-7A.)\n\nIn connection with this school I beg to draw the Department's attention again to the classroom. They have 62 children and at present they take in half in the forenoon and half in the afternoon. This, to my mind, is not in the best interests of the children as they spend too much time in idleness. The present classroom is 24 by 30 ft. by 10\u00bd ft. high. This will only accommodate 30 children, allowing 250 cubic feet per child.\n\nI would strongly urge that the upstairs flat be put into shape as soon as possible, and another teacher secured.\n\nI understand the present principal, Mr. Greer, is leaving on the 1st of April.\nOttawa, March 22, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to a matter arising out of your report on the Round Lake Indian Boarding School for the month of February. I have noted your remarks concerning the inadequate classroom accommodation. I wish to inform you that the future policy of this school is at present under review by the Church authorities and this Department, and in the near future it is hoped the institution will be upon a more satisfactory basis.\n\nI note your statement that the \"half-day\" system in an Indian residential school has led to idleness at Round Lake. This, I believe, is the result only when there is a shortage of proper instructors in the departments outside the classroom.\n\nThe Department learns that the Rev. Mr. Greer, the present Principal, is leaving on the first of April.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nE.

We have appointed Rev. R. J. Ross of Auburn, Ontario. Mr. Ross is a man nearly 50 years of age, has a very successful career in the ministry, a knowledge of farming and has executive ability. His wife is competent and will probably accept the position as matron a little later. Mr. Ross begins his work June 5th.\n\nI hope this appointment finds your approval.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/REWS\n\nIndian Affairs.

His wife appears to be a clever woman, but is not particularly optimistic about the future.\n\nBarn accommodation is bad. There is no ice house, root house or garage at the school. When the Government buys Round Lake, we might do well to purchase the property of the Rev. Mr. McKay, for the extra land and for a Principal's residence. I learned that the Church spend about $14,000 for the building at the time of its erection.\n\nIn view of the repairs going on this summer, we might allow more than one month's salary, because it is impossible for the children to be at the school, and the staff have to be paid.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOTTAWA, July 14th, 1922.\n\nRev.

Scott, Esq., F.R.S.C., Litt.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nRe Round Lake Indian Boarding School\n\nI have just received a letter from the Women's Missionary Society, part of which reads as follows:\n\n\"The Executive Board of the Women's Missionary Society respectfully ask that through you as Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of our Presbyterian Church the thanks of our Society be conveyed to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, for the prompt action they took in coming to our aid at the Round Lake Indian Boarding School, Sask., the buildings of which met with such disaster in June last during a cyclone which swept through that section of our country. Our Board was not in a position to expend any money in the large amount of repairs necessary and as it was an emergency condition requiring immediate re-building, the Government took charge expending in the neighborhood of twelve thousand dollars, ($12,000.)\n\n\"The School at Round Lake is the property of our Women's Missionary Society and the Executive Board feel we are not in a position to repay the Government for its outlay in the meantime, nor are we able to face the further repairs necessary for successful work or to give to our staff the larger equipment they should have. We are, therefore, prepared to offer to the Government the whole property at Round Lake School, clear title of same, on one condition, that the Government purchase the residence of the Rev. Hugh McKay, late principal of the School, from him as a residence for our Principal and also either purchase or rent the farm attached to it. In a school so large as this a residence for the Principal and his family is a necessity and makes for better service of the whole staff. We would suggest that a small Committee be appointed to value this property, consisting of Commissioner Graham, Judge Farrell and Mr. R. J. Ross, the Principal of the School.\n\n\"If this proposition is acceptable to the Government, it will relieve our Society of much anxiety over the large sums of money frequently required to be put into capital account for Indian buildings and will enable us the better to co-operate with you by concentrating our efforts on and releasing money for the educational and missionary side of the needs and for which we are responsible in common with other Churches to the Canadian Government.\"\n\nThis matter has not been before the Executive of our Board as yet but I am quite sure that the proposal made by the Executive of the Women's Board will have our hearty approval.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. McKay.\n\nWhen the Executive of your Board approve of the transfer, if you will communicate with me arrangements will be made for a valuation of the property. I will then be in a position to approach the Minister and secure his approval to place an item in this connection in the Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nI would be pleased to have you recapitulate the needs of the Presbyterian Church Indian work in Canada for the coming year.

Scott, Esq., F.R.S.C., Litt.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI wrote you Oct. 12th enclosing a resolution passed by the Executive Board of the Women's Missionary Society. While this had not been considered by the Executive of our Board, I gave it as my opinion that it would be approved.\n\nSince then we have secured the judgment of members of Presbytery. While they do not oppose the action taken by the Women's Society, they expressed the hope that the Government will be willing to vote a nominal figure to the Church to cover part of our outlay in the present plant.\n\nI gather that some of the members of Presbytery have discovered that the Department is likely to take over the Roman Catholic plant at Lebret at a fair valuation, and they feel that if this is the policy being followed in regard to taking over buildings of other churches, there is no good reason why the Presbyterian Church should hand over this building without some compensation.\n\nThe suggestions submitted to our Sub-executive on Tuesday last were as follows:\n\n1. That the Government purchase the property from the Church at a nominal figure of say $10,000 or $12,000.\n2. That the Government purchase Dr. McKay's house for $5,000.\n3. That the Government purchase or rent Dr. McKay's farm, the farm to be used in connection with the School.\n\nAfter discussion these suggestions were generally approved by the Sub-executive.\n\nJudge Farrell advises us that Dr. McKay's farm and house are worth about $17,000. Do you think the Department would be willing to expend this amount on the farm and house and at the same time give a nominal sum to reimburse the Church to the extent of about $10,000?\n\nI may say quite frankly that I do not think the Women's Missionary Society or the Sub-executive for that matter, will go back on the resolution I sent Oct. 12th, but without doubt there is a feeling that if the Government has adopted the policy of purchasing...\nplants that have been in the possession of the Church, exception should not be made in the case of Round Lake. As you have already expended so much on account of the cyclone, we cannot expect that you would vote a large sum. Some of the members of Presbytery suggested as much as $15,000; others thought that $10,000 or $12,000 would, under the circumstances, be a fair figure.\n\nTo our representatives in the West it seems very desirable that Dr. McKay's house should be purchased without delay. This would make it possible for Dr. McKay to leave the Reserve and Mr. Ross would in this way be left freer to carry on the work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Travelling expenses to and from the school were also allowed.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will endeavour to obtain prices from several dentists, for performing at Lebret the necessary work required by the pupils. In view of the necessity of using attention, a dentist would not doubt give a very special rate. The use of precious materials for fillings should not be used. If possible prices should be obtained for fillings and extractions separately.\n\nRegarding the dental work required at Round Lake and Duck Lake Schools, I have to request that you will instruct the local agents to obtain prices as outlined above, from a number of dentists, in each case, and submit the quotations to the Department.\n\nAfter your report and those of our agents have been received, the Department will consider giving authority for the dental work required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I regret that I cannot offer any definite information at this time, as our estimates for the coming fiscal year have not yet been passed by Parliament. I am hopeful, however, that the item will be allowed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nI wish to bring the following matter to the attention of the Department. Last Fall Mr. J. Woodward, who was our Foreman in charge of the construction work at the Round Lake Boarding School, had occasion to proceed to Stockholm for the purpose of transacting business at the Bank there, and purchasing some material necessary for the work underway at the school. While on his way to town, he met a man coming from the opposite direction driving a vehicle being hauled by a team of horses. A third horse was following behind hitched to the vehicle. On the day in question the road was wet and muddy, and had large wagon ruts in the centre, but although the wheels of Mr. Woodward's car did become stuck in the mud for a few seconds just before he passed the conveyance referred to, he was able to extricate them and clear the vehicle with about 18 inches to spare, but as he was passing the horse was following behind the animal flung out its hind-quarters, and was struck by the car, and injured so badly that it was necessary to destroy it. The outcome of the accident was that Mr. Woodward was summoned to appear before the local Magistrate, and was fined for occupying, at the time the accident occurred, more of the road allowance than he was entitled to. The fine and the costs of the case amounted to $40.10, and in addition Mr. Woodward, who was in Regina at the time the case was called, was put to the expense of travelling to Stockholm, the return fare.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nfare from Regina being $10.40, and his meals and hotel expenses while at Stockholm amounted to $3.00, or a total outlay, including the fine and costs of the case, of $43.50. Mr. Woodward contends that he was in no way to blame for the accident, and feels that he was on Department business when it occurred that the expense he has been put to should be borne by the Department. I submit the matter for your consideration, and whatever action you may deem advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. GRAHAM\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, March 22, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant No. 304-11A and regret to say that the Department is unable to pay the claim of Mr. J. Woodward amounting to $53.50 from Parliamentary Appropriation, being for fines and costs as a result of his collision with a vehicle while on his way to Stockholm.\n\nYou will understand that payment of such an account would establish an awkward precedent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I believe it to be in the interest of our work to operate the McKay farm this coming season, for the benefit of the school. You may inform your Western representative and Dr. McKay that it is the Department's intention to purchase the farm and house for the sum of $17,000, provided that an independent and competent valuator assures us that the property is worth at least this figure, and provided, of course, that Dr. McKay can give us clear title.\n\nUntil such time as Parliament has allowed the item, could we not arrange to operate the farm for the benefit of the school, on a rental or share basis? My suggestion for an interim arrangement is that Dr. McKay vacate the property so that the school supply all the labour and seed and take for their own purposes two thirds of the crop harvested. However, I consider that, if a transfer is completed before the crop is taken off, the school authorities should reap the entire benefit of their farming activity on the land in question.\n\nI shall be pleased to learn if this arrangement is satisfactory to your office and to the Rev. Dr. McKay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. H.

I sent a copy of this immediately to Judge Farrell and suggested that he get in touch with Dr. McKay and Principal Ross. I have from him today, a wire which reads as follows:\n\n\"See Indian estimates passed. Dr. McKay still at Rochester. As I have no authority re leasing and believe present completion of sale, if to take place, urgent. Suggest steps taken at once to settle price. Our price was forty dollars per acre for farm outside of house at five thousand.\"\n\nI have not been watching the papers, but if the situation is as he states and your estimates have been passed, would it not be possible to carry out the purchase without delay?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

J.H.Edmison, D.D.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st, inst. with Mr. Duncan Scott's of April 20th re taking over Dr. H.Mackay's farm and house. Mr. Scott suggests that the Church should rent Dr. MacKay's farm on the share plan and if the Indian Department buys the house and farm as they intend to do if Parliament provides the funds that the Church should reap the entire benefit of their farming activity.\n\nJudge Farrell and I had a conference about this matter today as you suggested. I phoned Stockholm and found Dr. MacKay was in Rochester. It is therefore impossible to lease this property from him just now.\n\nI notice that the Indian estimates have gone through Parliament. I therefore think that the Indian Dep. should get busy and buy this property and in time to enable Mr. Ross to seed the cultivated land. I am of opinion that the Department is offering too little for this property.\n\nThe house and stable is worth ......................... $5000\nThere are 406 acres of land, of this\n196 acres of it is valley land worth $50 per acre... 9800\n96 acres of it Hill top land worth $40 per acre... 3840\n124 acres of it Hill side land worth $20 per acre... 2480\n406 .................................................. $20,620\n\nThe Department offers $17000 only.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Peter Strang.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., F.R.S.C., Litt.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI have just received a letter this morning from Dr. Strang, our District Superintendent, in regard to the sale of Dr. McKay's farm and house at Round Lake. I am enclosing you a copy of this letter, also extracts from a letter received from Judge Farrell.\n\nFrom these communications you will see that our representatives in Saskatchewan are anxious to have this matter closed up without delay. Apparently, they are not very well satisfied with the suggested price, namely, $17,000. If Dr. McKay should refuse this, and sell to an outside party, the school would be embarrassed.\n\nI hope you may find it possible to issue this matter soon. It will be necessary for someone to attend to the seeding very soon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/JDF.\n\nENCL. 2.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n2156 Smith St.,\nRegina, April 28, 1923.\n\nRev. J.H. Edmison, D.D.\nGen Secy., Home Mission Board,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Doctor,\n\nI received your letter of the 21st yesterday morning, on my return from Moosomin, re Round Lake and enclosing copy of Dr. Scott's letter to you of the 20th, which would have been under the then circumstances satisfactory to me, if he had not placed the maximum price for farm and land at $17,000 and I would have endeavored to have got authority by wire to make the suggested lease.\n\nI don't know where Dr. Scott got the figures $17,000 from. They have never come from me, as in all my correspondence with you I have placed the price of the farm lands at $40 per acre, over and above the house. The sale and price of the house was long ago settled at $5000.00 when I on behalf of Dr. McKay accepted that figure for it, being the valuation put upon it at the Commissioner's office, and I so notified the doctor, the understanding being that the Board would take over at that figure, should the Government not do so, when buying the School plant as proposed. I have considered that matter settled. Then came on the proposition for buying the farm. I reported the number of acres, and the price asked namely $40.00 per acre, and I made it quite clear that this was in addition to the house which was a separate matter.\n\nAt the same interview that the valuation of house was fixed at $5000, Inspector Murison who is fairly well acquainted with the farm, said the land in the valley was very valuable, and expressed the opinion that $40 an acre would be a reasonable price but said it would depend on what amount of the land was hill-side land, which at the time I was unable to tell him.\n\nThe price as suggested was tentative only, subject to the whole matter being gone into with greater care later. Since then I have had more information on the matter, and find that the land in the valley is worth a good deal more than $40 an acre, so much so as to lead me to the conclusion that an average of $40 per acre would be very fair, and that the Government would also be making a good buy.\n\nFor instance, this week at Moosomin, I confirmed two sales (Sheriff sales,) each at $40 an acre for the whole \u00bd sec. in each case and there was evidence produced of neighboring land being sold for $45 per acre a few months ago. These lands were in the vicinity of Round Lake (that is a few miles away) but not in the valley.\n\nYou understand I am not just saying that $40.00 must be paid\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nfor the whole farm, or there will be no sale. We are ready to negotiate but I think this price is fair. On the other hand $17,000 is out of the question, that only leaves $12,000 for the 406 acres or less than $30 an acre, and the Doctor won't accept that figure, so far as his instructions to me go. In my opinion, also, he would be very foolish to do so, as he can without any trouble get a far better price than that.\n\nAs soon as I got your letter, I attended on the Commissioner, and found he had no instructions, but I also learned, as I had gathered from the papers of the day before, that all the Indian estimates had been passed. This simplified matters, especially as Dr. and Mrs. McKay are still at Rochester and I wired you accordingly last night.\n\nIf $17,000 is the Government's maximum for house and land, I wish you would wire me at once. If the sale is to go on, see that some one is authorized to act for Government out here, and we are advised at once who it is.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Alexander Farrell.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nMay 4, 1923.\n\nThe ROUND LAKE BOARDING SCHOOL was built by the Presbyterian Church, on fractional N.W. quarter of section 14, Tp. 18, Rge. 3, West 2nd. some acres had been acquired by them.\n\nAs early as 1892 church authorities, in conjunction with this Department, endeavoured, through the Department of the Interior, to secure the S. \u00a7 of fractional section 23 from the C.P.R. for school purposes. This effort was abortive for some years, and correspondence was initiated with a view to securing the N. \u00a7 of 13 which was held in 1896 by the Canada North West Land Company. In the course of the latter negotiations, it was found that the S. \u00a7 of 23 was available, and as this was the property which was originally requested, correspondence was continued until 1899 when, by P.C. 567, dated the first of May, the property was vested in the Department of Indian Affairs for the purposes of the Round Lake Indian Boarding School.\n\nIt is proposed, at this time, to purchase the church property at this institution and, further, to secure the house and farm of the Rev. Dr. McKay, for many years the Principal of the school. A description of Dr. McKay's property is not on file. It is my opinion that he has title to the land of Section 10, some additional acreage. Dr. Edmison, in a communication dated November 25th, last, states that Judge Farrell has advised me that Dr. McKay's farm and house are worth $17,000 and he further suggests that the Department reimburse the Church for their building equity and land which it stands to the extent of about $10,000. Judge Farrell, on behalf of Dr. McKay, in a communication to Dr. Edmison dated the 26th ultimo, states that the doctor will not likely accept $12,000 for his 406 acres. Rev. Peter Strang, also of Regina, advised Dr. Edmison, under cover of the 25th ultimo, that the 406 acres is worth $18,620.\n\nIn the Estimates, 1923-24, there is an item of $27,000 for the purpose of purchasing the church and the McKay property at the Round Lake School. It is proposed by Dr. Edmison, representing the Presbyterian Church, that $10,000 be given to the Church for their equity in the buildings and for their property - roughly acres in the N.W. quarter of Section 14. $17,000 was included as the purchase price for the McKay property.\n\nIt is proposed to negotiate with Dr. Edmison, of the Presbyterian Church, with a view to getting a proper description of the church and McKay properties and to arrange with him to get the titles in order. Dr. McKay, or his Regina representative (Judge Farrell or Rev. Strang) should state whether or not $17,000 will be accepted for the entire McKay property (house and 406 acres). The Minister of Justice should be approached for the purpose of securing the name of a competent valuator in Regina. This valuator should give us a valuation of both properties, and, provided the McKay property is worth at least $17,000 and the Church's property - less the Department's expenditures for plant - at least $10,000, this Department should make arrangements for the purchase. The Department of Justice will give us the name of their agent who will search the titles and who will act for us in the matter of the transfer.\nOttawa, May 5, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nI have your letters of the 27th and 30th ultimo, the latter enclosing copies of communications from Judge Farrell and the Rev. Mr. Strang, of Regina - all relative to the purchase of the McKay property near the Round Lake Indian Boarding School.\n\nI should be pleased to complete negotiations for the transfer of this and the school property to the Department, without delay, and I am sorry that there is a misunderstanding regarding the price to be paid for the property of Dr. McKay. I expect some $17,000 will be available for this purpose, and I wish to refer to your letter of the 23rd of November, last, in which you state that Judge Farrell advised you that the value was about $17,000. I am at a loss to know where to look for more funds for this purpose, as it is not my present intention to ask for supplementary Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education this fiscal year.\n\nWould it be possible for you to get in direct communication with Rev. Mr. McKay, and see if the transfer of his property, at the price originally suggested, can be arranged.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. H.

This, I judge, covers the property owned by our Church, which you will see is held by the Board of Trustees, and the property held by Dr. and Mrs. McKay.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EWS\nMr. Duncan C. Scott, F.R.S.C., Litt.D.,\nDeputy Supt. General, Indian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have yours of May 5th to hand me purchase of the property at Round Lake. I have turned up my letter of Nov. 23rd in which I intimated that in the judgment of Judge Farrell, Dr. McKay's farm and house were worth about $17,000. I regret to say that this is an error on my part. I have looked over Judge Farrell's letters that came to the office at the time and I find that in all of them he states that that the farm, which consists of about 425 acres should be worth $40 per acre, so my letter should have read - \"Judge Farrell advises us that Dr. McKay's farm is worth about $17,000\".\n\nHowever, as the situation stands it seems to me that the only course to pursue is to get a fair valuation from some expert who is disinterested. What the farm is worth, it is worth, and Dr. McKay has a right to the full value of his property, and I am sure the Department is not anxious to purchase it below the figure that he might receive from someone else. If he should sell his property to an outside party, the work at the school would be rendered very difficult. In fact I do not see how the work could be continued without the use of this farm. I think it should not be overlooked that we have had the free use of this land and house for many years. I understand the farm belongs to Mrs. McKay and was the gift of her father.\n\nI am not very sure of Dr. McKay's address. He has been at Rochester, Minn. Word reached the city a few days ago that he had intended to return last week to Round Lake, but Mrs. McKay's condition would not permit him to take the journey so soon, so I judge he is still at Rochester.\n\nMy judgment is that you ought to get in touch with Commissioner Graham and Inspector Murison who represent the Government at Regina, and secure a just valuation of the property.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\nIndian Affairs.

The reports regarding the condition of the roads were very bad indeed, and besides that I find that the property is considerably further out from Broadview than the estimate given in your letter, though I don't think the road is quite so long as some people would lead me to believe. However, having the numbers of the sections on which the land is situated, I can easily compute that one parcel at least is eleven miles north and thirteen miles east of Broadview, which by following the road allowance would be 24 miles. The roads I think are improving, and I thought it well to delay a little in the hope of further improvement, and have fixed the 13th or 14th as the time for going there, and will endeavor to make the trip at that time unless I hear from you to the contrary in the meantime. On account of the greater distance and the bad roads it will probably cost me a little more than I expected.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

July 17th, 1923.\n\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe MacKay valuations, file # 108 - l - 1\n\nI went out on Friday afternoon last from Broadview to inspect this property and the roads were so bad we did not get back until the following day at Noon.\n\nI suppose the valuation you want from me is a valuation as to what the land will be worth as a farming proposition though I understand the land is being valued with an idea of taking it over in connection with the Indian School.\n\nAs a farming proposition it seems to me the house is rather expensive to be just suitable for that purpose but I presume it is intended to be used in connection with the school. I intimated in a former letter that I had a little hesitation about making valuations about the buildings by myself so I carefully went over sizes, type of construction etc. and discussed the matter fully with a competent builder.\n\nThe dwelling house is on the part held off the North East Quarter of section 14, 16, 3 w. 2nd M. as is also the stable and any other out buildings. The dwelling house I understand is ten years old but has been kept in good shape. It is well painted. I understand the walls are back plastered. Everything is well finished off though not at all ornate. There is a basement under all the main part of the house with cement floor and cement and stone cistern and there is a furnace in the basement. The main part of the house is 24 X 30 feet, though a jog of 6 X 10 feet is taken out of that as a veranda and there is a lean-to kitchen, one story high 6 X 24 feet. The walls are apparently 18 feet high.\nMr. Duncan Scott.\n\nThe stable is 16 X 26 feet with a lean-to to the side. There is also an ice house of no great value.\n\nWith the assistance I have been able to obtain I have placed the value of the buildings with allowance for depreciation at $500.00. I presume you are fully aware of the composition of the different quarter sections that are owned by Mr. and Mrs. MacKay. But in case you are not I may say that the 40 acres taken from the section 14 is made up of a parcel on the East side of the North East Quarter. On the North side it is apparently only about 150 yards wide or less. There is a surveyed road from the North West corner of that parcel running South West towards the River so that the strip widens out as you go South then the River is the South and South-West boundary of the parcel. It appears to contain about the amount mentioned, namely 40 acres. The North West Quarter of section 13 of course adjoins this to the East and the North of that is the parcel of the South West quarter of 13, lying North of the River said to contain 46 acres.\n\nThis land is mostly in the Qu'Appelle Valley a portion being in the side hills and all lying in one compact block worked together. There is approximately 120 or 130 acres under cultivation in the block and about some 20 acres more could be cultivated though it would require some clearing of brush. The cultivatable land seems uniformly good. There is a fair amount of weeds among the crop but not more than is usual or a little less than is usual in farms in this Country. I would value this parcel of land outside of the buildings thereon at $24.00 per acre. The amount being 246 acres and making a total of $5904.00.\n\nThe other parcel, that is the South West quarter of 24 in the same Township though adjoining the other land cannot be so conveniently worked with it. The greater part of which is on the high land on the North side of the Valley though a portion is taken up by the side hills of the Valley. There is none of this under cultivation. The land clear of the side hills is reasonably level and appears to be good soil. I would estimate that at least about 110 acres of it is capable of cultivation though it would require considerable clearing of brush. I would think $17.00 per acre would be reasonable valuation for it, making $1870.00 for this parcel. This would make a total for farm and building of $12824.\nMr. Duncan Scott,\n\nI am advised that Mr. McKay has spent considerable money of his own on property now belonging to the Government and I am also advised that there was some suggestion that the Government should pay Mr. and Mrs. McKay the sum of $40.00 per acre for all the land. I take it however that what you want from me is an estimate of what I consider the land worth without taking into consideration any of these questions and I think that the amount that I have mention is the full value of the land.\n\nI enclose herewith my account in connection with this matter. The driving expenses look high but I can assure you that the driver earned his money.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

During your illness we have been corresponding with Dr. Emmison, with a view to the purchase, also of your farm and dwelling.\n\nWhen the matter was first mooted, it was suggested that \u00a317,000.00 was a fair price for the 406 acres and the house. Later, however, Dr. Emmison, who has been in correspondence with Judge Farrell and Rev. P. Strang, of Regina, informed me that your property might be worth more than the above sum, and, as we require an independent valuation before making a purchase, the Department gave the commission of appraisal to Mr. Levi Thomson, of Moose Jaw. His report is now on file and has been shown to Dr. Emmison, who suggested that further negotiations be direct with you.\n\nOur valuator places the value of the buildings at \u00a34,200.00; the 40 acres in the N.W. \u00bc, Sec. 14, and the 206 acres in the fractional N.W. \u00bc, Sec. 15, at \u00a34.00; and the 160 acres in the S.W. \u00bc, Sec. 24, at \u00a317.00 - a total for the buildings and the farm of 406 acres, of \u00a312,824.00.\n\nThese facts are being placed before you, with the request that you make a statement, relative to your wishes in connection with the proposed transfer of your property to the Crown.

The house he values at\n$4200. The house is 24x30 two-story, with\nfull basement, cement floor & interior\na special furnace. Upstairs there are 3 large\nbedrooms with closets, a bath, pantries, store-room,\non the first floor there is kitchen with two pantries,\ndining-room, parlor, living-room. There are\ntwo porches & one balcony. The house is\nwell fitted double plastered, and is perfect any\nseason during the coldest winters although we\nburn only wood.\n\nIf I try to purchase a house like this in a\ntown or village I am asked to pay $7000.00\nWe also feel that Mr. Thompson has valued the valley land too low. He knows that the best land in Saskatchewan, so in the Red Appelle Valley\u2014being two weeks earlier than the upper prairie in harvest, there trouble with frost and the soil the most excellent\u2014a few years ago a farm in the valley was sold for $90.00; other farms for $60.00 and in a few years hence land will be up to that again. If I were buying like the government I would not sell. But as I am getting up in years and my wife likely an invalid for life, makes a difference.\n\nI do not feel a moral obligation resting upon the government. The fact that I have been 40 years in its employ and more under its control than that of the church.\n\nBut as a business transaction, we thought the property was worth $7000, that being a fair price to the government & to the maximus. Mr. Thompson thinks it is too much. Others like Judge Harris and Dr. Young think it not enough. But if the government honestly think it is too much, then we shall be content with one or two shillings less.\n\nI trust we shall come to an agreement for this.\ndeal, as the property will be a great help to the school, which I feel a deep interest in.\n\nTo the old buildings erected in '87 I contributed $1000.00 and to the present buildings $8000.00 so that much of my heart is still in the school.\n\nI would like to see it go on to greater things in the future.\n\nIn view of the above statement I will make plans to put our works in the matter.\n\nShall the honor of being yours\n\nobediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\nAugust 17, 1923.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nOn May 25th I asked for the name and address of a competent valuator of farm lands in the vicinity of Broadview, Sask., to whom we could give the commission of valuating certain property at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. You directed that Mr. Levi Thomson, of Wolesey, Sask., be employed, and I have to inform you that Mr. Thomson's valuation was forwarded under cover of the 17th ultimo.\n\nThe property in question is owned by Rev. Dr. and Mrs. Hugh McKay, who were for many years active in the administration of the Round Lake Indian Residential School. Their homestead land is situated contiguous to the institution and has been used for school purposes for many years. In addition, Dr. McKay has donated considerable capital and stock for the maintenance of the institution. He is now advanced in years and desires to turn over his holdings to the Crown, now that the school itself is purchased by the Department.\n\nWhen the matter was first mooted, $27,000 was provided in the parliamentary appropriation for Indian education for the present fiscal year. $10,000 was suggested at that time as the purchase price for the school buildings and the 22 acres of land on which they are situated, owned by the Presbyterian Church. $17,000 was mentioned as a fair price for the home of Dr. McKay and the 406 acres to which he and his wife hold title. The Round Lake school would be somewhat embarrassed if the McKay farm were sold other than to the Department, as the only other land used by the institution is 257 acres, a fractional half section owned by the Department, in which lie the hills on the north side of the Qu'Appelle valley.\n\nMr. Levi Thomson places the value of the McKay home and 406 acres at $12,834. Rev. Dr. McKay, when informed of this figure, was disappointed and is supported by Judge Farrell and the Rev. R. Strong of Regina, and Dr. Edmison, General Secretary of the Board of Directors of the Presbyterian Church, with whom we were negotiating during the illness of the Rev. Dr. McKay. Judge Farrell and Mr. Strong believe that the land is worth $40 an acre, as a considerable portion of it is in the Qu'Appelle valley; Mr. Levi Thomson's valuation is roughly $21 per acre.\n\nIn view of these facts and the Department's wish that a fair offer be made to Mr. and Mrs. McKay, I should be pleased if you would give me the name and address of another gentleman in the Indian Head-Moosemin area, from whom we could receive a second appraisal.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General\n\nIndian Affairs.

Edmison, D.D.,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received yours re the purchase of our property near Round Lake Mission. We are disappointed with Mr. Thompson's valuation of the property. The house he values at $4,200.00. The house is a two story 9 feet ceiling - 24 x 24. In upper flat 3 bedrooms with closets in each, a bath room and store room. On the ground floor, kitchen, with two pantries, dining room, parlor, living room. Full basement, cement floor and cistern and splendid furnace. There are two verandas and one balcony. The house was well built for comfort - double plastered and double boarded and paper between. No frost in any room the coldest winter, although we burn only wood. I try to purchase a house of the same value in a village or town and the price is $7,000.00.\n\nWe feel that Mr. Thompson valued the valley land too low. A few years ago a farm was sold in the valley for $90.00 an acre. It is well known that the land in the valley is the best in Saskatchewan being two weeks earlier in harvest than that up on the prairie and never troubled with frost, then look at the scenery as the farmer said when renting a pasture for his neighbor's cows. If I were young like the Government, I would not sell as land will rise in value from this out, but being not young and my wife likely an invalid for life makes a difference.\n\nI plead not a moral obligation resting upon the government being in its employ and under its control, more or equal to that of the Church for 40 years, but a business transaction. We thought $17,000.00 was a fair price for the property, but if the Government think honestly that it is too much, then we shall take one or two thousand less.\n\nI am glad to think that Mr. Ferrier was sympathetic, and we have not forgotten your sympathy with us in our troubles, when trying to please two Masters. I have written a long letter to Dr. Strang, also a letter to Mr. Mclean.\n\nMrs. McKay is not making the progress I would like to see since our return from Rochester. She joins me in very kind greetings and in the prayer that God may continue to bless you in the responsible position you hold. I am, Yours in the work of our Divine Master,\n\n(sgd.) H. McKay\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of a communication I have received from Rev. Hugh McKay, in regard to the sale of the property at Round Lake. I understand he has written you as well. I have also received a communication from Dr. Strong, our District Superintendent. He thinks the Government should not go back on the offer made by Dr. Scott some time ago. You will note that Dr. McKay is prepared to accept the $17,000. As a matter of fact, I think that if he had been at home at the time the offer was made, he would have accepted. The valuator was sent in because Judge Farrell, acting on behalf of Dr. McKay, felt the price was not high enough.\n\nWhile Dr. McKay does not press the moral obligation resting upon the Government, my own feeling is that the Department cannot ignore his forty years of faithful service. He has put his life into Indian work and has been most conscientious. The Government and the Church together have had the benefit of his house and farm, without rental. I hope you will find a happy solution of this difficulty, even if it should mean the sending in of another valuator.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHR/RWS\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. Hugh McKay,\nC/o Round Lake Indian Res. School,\nStockholm, Sask.\n2156 Smith St\nRegina, Augt 31st/23\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq\nActing Dep. Chief Ind. Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. R. B. Hugh McKay has handed me your letter of 22nd inst., containing an offer of $12,824 for his and Mr. McKay's farm property adjoining the Round Lake Indian Boarding School premises, including in that sum, as I understand the letter, their dwelling house as well as other buildings on the property, with instructions to accept it for them, and at the same time advise you that they wish any further correspondence and negotiations, deemed such be necessary, to be conducted by your Department with myself on their behalf.\n\nWith regard to the Dept.'s said offer, I am instructed to say that as the offer is so much below its price asked by the Rev. Doctor & Mrs. McKay, and which has been so many times communicated to the Dept. by me through Mr. Edmiston, whom you speak, that it was not accepted by them, they do not wish to sell, and are very much attached to the place and the buildings, and your offer is no inducement to them to sell, and break these strong ties of the Dept. in order to pay a sum common sense would say is too low, and often impossible to judge, and what is more, the land and other improvements considered, aside to property, worth it will be due and properly considered, the question of sale, however valuable as quick sale of the work, and I may say, that it is more to us that he should be convinced an expert valuation of farm property.\nI do not need to remind you, that the offer to sell did not come from the McKay's. It was not under pressure from us that they agreed to sell. This was a year ago, and if there had been reasonable promptness in the negotiations for the property, a deal could have been arranged. I think, however, that the matter has been allowed to drift for practically a year.\n\nI notice that Mr. Thomson in his valuation puts the desirability down at $15,000, and that such is the Government present offer, notwithstanding that the price was fixed between the Presb. H. M. Brown and Mr. McKay, both of whom asked for $15,000, and at which price, should the property be sold, the whole school property of the mission would be acquired by the Church. The Church would be expected to accept $42,000 for the property, which if not paid for within a year, would be forfeited.\n\nFurther, I cannot allow to go unchallenged the statement in your letter, that \"when the matter was first worked out, it was suggested that $17,000 was a fair price for the 456 acres of the farm, but the sale of the dwelling house was fixed with the Church authorities at $15,000.\" Now, the sale of the farm lands to the Government was suggested, and the price of the same (after consideration with a number of persons considered competent to judge of their value) was placed at $140 per acre, and added them to the house, which, for any better price, was subsequently changed over into land in the place asked.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI have received your letter regarding the figure named as an error by Mr. Edmonson. I understand that Mr. Scott intended to have so named the figure, and that Mr. Scott mentioned to have so named the figure at Kagi's price instead of the $7,000. I did all the same thing that I thought the proper way would be done or had already promised. There was no offer from the person in charge of the person who had been offered any form of any description, nor had your government ever said that they considered our price too high.\n\nDepartment next said that they considered our price too high.

I have noted that the valuation of Mr. Levi Thomson, of Walselay, Sask., cannot be considered.\n\nI wish to enclose a copy of my communication of the 22nd ultimo to Dr. McKay. This contains the only definite offer that has been made by the Department for the property in question.\n\nI am lately in receipt of a letter from Dr. McKay, relative to the arrangement between the school authorities and himself for this year's crop. Our correspondent was assured, under cover of the 4th instant, that this agreement would obtain, entirely independent of the present negotiations for the transfer of his house and farm.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

So far there has not been much success in the Matron's chosen.\n\nBelieve if this school did away with a head matron and appointed a boys' Matron (as the boys' surely need a woman's supervision in the building) it would solve the problem.\n\nAt present they have a good staff in all other Depts. and if each member could just go direct to the Principal it would prove a success. As things are at present am very doubtful as to the success of the new matron.\n\n(Sgd.) Annie M. LeDrew.\nTravelling Nurse.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of Sept. 10th in reply to mine of 31st ult.\n\nAt the time of my writing I did not know of yours of the 27th ult., at which you enclosed a copy. However, as I had had letter from the Doctor subsequent to its receipt, in consequence it made no difference as to the substance of any letter to you, in another matter, it indicates on the part of the Department an intention to pay more for the McKay's property. There what the Department might consider its real value. It is because of this place of the matter that I am now taking the trouble to write you this private and confidential letter, which I wish it to be taken as a personal matter of my own and not in any official way as the agent of Mr. McKay or in any way affecting their rights or interests, and if the Department are not prepared to fall in with the proposal I make in this letter, we leave it there, and the letter can be considered as if not written at all.\n\nThe state of affairs is this, that a year ago or a little more, I squatted up negotiations with the Doctor, as to his selling his dwelling house and garden to the Royal Victorian Church, in order that it might be used as a residence for the Principal as well as the Baptist congregation with the School as residence for the Principal as well as the Baptist congregation. The question was raised whether the School was not willing to take over the farm land, but he answered that he was not, and I did this because in my opinion, I thought, under the circumstances, that case running over a number of years, which I need not go into now, that such a course would be better for the Indians, better for the School and Mission, and better for your people.\n\nThe Doctor did not want to leave, and does not yet. This Indian School has been his life work (over two years) and his heart and soul is bound up in it, and the Indians. He is entirely attached to the place and its friends. To me, anyway means that he is lost. He is a Highland Scotch man, who has that peculiar mystical feeling about a place, its people, and his occupation that is hard for the ordinary Anglo-Saxon to understand. However, it is there, and the Doctor has a strong love of this peculiar habit, and so I said before he really does not want to leave, but hopes for to continue on and end his days among these Indians.\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. & Sec. 13 | $24 per acre | $4,944 |\n| 160 \" | S.W. & Sec. 24 | $17 per acre | $2,720 |\n\n$11,824\n\nBy letter of August 2nd, Dr. McKay was informed of the valuation placed on the property by Mr. Thompson, and, in his reply of the 10th of the same month, he took exception to the valuation of Mr. Thompson, and stated \"that the property is worth $18,000 so that being a fair price to the Government, and if the Government think it too much then we shall be content with one or two thousand less.\"\n\nOn August 22nd the Department wrote Dr. McKay, making him an offer of $18,000 for the house and farm. This allowed $4,800 for the house and roughly $26 per acre for both hillside and valley land.\n\nDr. McKay has turned the matter over to Judge Farrell Regina, who is now acting on his behalf. In letter of August 31st the Judge states that the offer of $18,000 is no inducement to sell. He stated: \"If the Department is prepared to add $2,000 to the offer for the land and besides bring the price for the house up to $8,000, making the total for the property $17,000, I am prepared to urge upon Dr. and Mrs. McKay to accept and vacate the premises at once.\"\nThe foregoing is briefly as far as the negotiations have gone. The letters dealing with the matter are turned out on the file herewith.\nOctober 8, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have given careful consideration to your letter of the 20th ultimo with regard to the purchase of the Round Lake Mission. I am very sympathetic to the representations that you have made but I would point out that the amount offered by the Department, namely, $15,000, is considerably in advance of the valuation made by Mr. Levi Thompson of Wolsely, Sask., who I am sure is a very competent valuator. I fear, therefore, that a higher offer would scarcely be considered justified in the circumstances.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJudge Alexander Farrell,\n2156 Smith Street,\nRegina, Sask.\n2156 Smith St.\nRegina Oct 18th/23\n\nTo H.C.

I have also a reply from the Doctor, in which he says they have decided to leave Round Lake and not accept the Government offer. He means by that, as I understand it, that the sum named $15,000 will be paid to him at once without deduction, and that any expenses in connection with the transfer will be borne by the Dept. including this year's taxes, which I understand are payable in Dec. I make no comments on the Reverend Doctor's acceptance, more than to say I did not think he would have agreed, but the old gentleman is feeling pretty badly disturbed by the evident lack of appreciation of his efforts of a life time among these Indians, both by the Dept. and the Church, and still their lack of appreciation, but I decide objection to him, and their evident desire to get rid of him or him or his.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I think this is too bad, when it might have been avoided by a little extra generosity forth Dept Church, if you choose to cast a bad but which in any case would seem less than their legal rights they must have gone away satisfied from a friend's place of the matter. This other thing I have to add is that if the Dept once want a settlement of this matter by this purchase of the Dr. then in keeping with your claims and this we have to clear it by the terms by which you, the Doctor, payment of the consideration, for so it seems that you, the Doctor, would you want down in the bottom of our heart's loan, and if there is delay will we doubt.

I make no comments on the Reverend Doctor's acceptance, more than to say I did not think he would have agreed, but the old gentleman is feeling pretty woolly, disheartened by the evident lack of appreciation of his efforts of a lifetime among these Indians, both by the Dept. and the Church, not only their lack of appreciation, but of decided objection to him, and their evident desire to get rid of him and Mrs. McKay. They leave therefore, or will leave, with a decidedly bad taste in their mouths as being meanly and ungenerously dealt with. I think this is too bad, when it might have been avoided by a little extra generosity from the Dept. and Church, if you chose to call it such, but which in my view would have been less than their legal rights. They would have gone away satisfied and in a friendly spirit which will now be lacking. However I need not dwell on that phase of the matter. The other thing I have to add is this, that if the Dept. really wants a settlement of this matter by the purchase of the Dr. and Mrs. McKay's property, you should waste no time in closing it by the transfer of those lands and the payment of the consideration, for as I have told you, the Doctor really does not want down in the bottom of his heart to leave, and if there\nis delay will no doubt change his mind and refuse to sell. I want to make this clear, the Dr. is only agreeing to your offer, on condition that it is closed out immediately, say in the next two weeks at the outside, and also that the sum paid $15,000.00 is clear to him without deduction.\n\nYou have the abstract of all the property, I paid for them $4.00 at my own personal expense, at your request thro. Dr. Edmison, and they were sent to you thro. him last Febry.\n\nThe house is on 40 acres. of N.E. \u00a7 14-18-3 W. 2 (the balance of about 20 acres, being deeded by the Doctor as a free gift to the Presby.

The weather is changeable, and I understand it's going to rain today, but I hope there will be no more rain. I am glad today, and I hope there will be no further hitch. Also, why the changes as you put them in the report of the Dept. of Justice? I feel like doing the necessary work.

I had tried him on the 18th of Oct., to commence to get inside again. I have tried him on the 23rd of Oct., again until his mother said she could not leave in another week if he came, as I expected instructions for him to come at once, and a day would be all that was necessary to send telegraph messages. He said he absolutely needed the matter might become very urgent, so I claimed his assistance, and then he could not travel. The Doctor kept saying that he had to work, and the delay in forwarding his message. When I had to work, I had to be careful and make sure to arrive on time, then the weather had to be good, and I had to obtain permission. There was trouble just as I expected there would be. The Doctor was all packed up ready to go, the matter...\n2156 Smith St.,\nRegina, Nov. 29th, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant. The transfers and cheques, as I understand Mr. Procter yesterday, have arrived, as I am glad to say, and I hope there will be no further hitch, although why the cheques as you state should be made payable jointly to the vendor and the agents of the Dept. of Justice I fail to see either the necessity or object. The first thing I know the said agents will refuse to sign them as they have no interest in them whatever and their objection would be well taken. I have had all sorts of trouble and worry over this matter and from my viewpoint a little care would have avoided it all. Last week the Doctor was kicking over the traces, because everything was hung up and he was practically stranded at the Mission, when he had expected he would be away a couple of weeks before. I had told him on the 16th of Oct. to commence to get ready to leave and on receipt of yours of 23rd Oct. again wrote him matter settled and to get ready to leave in another week if he could, as I expected instructions for transfer would issue at once, and a day would be all that was necessary to search title and prepare transfers. Haste was absolutely necessary, as the weather might become any moment so inclement that Mrs. McKay could not travel. The Doctor had followed my instructions, when I had to write him of the delay of Dept. of Justice in forwarding instructions to Mundell and Co., and then the transfers had to be sent back to Ottawa for inspection, there was trouble just as I expected there would be. The Doctor was all packed up ready to go, the weather had changed considerable for the worst. I finally over the telephone got him to agree to stay on a little longer on the strength that transfer with ck's would soon be up. I also wrote Mundell and Co. again, advising them and asking them to telephone the Dr. as soon as transfer arrived back, and arrange as he was coming out at Whitewood, to have them signed there on his way out, or at Moosomin, even if the ck. had not\nyet arrived at Balcarres. Mr. Proctor was good enough to telephone me on Monday (Nov. 27th.) that cks. and transfers had arrived and he had arranged that Dr. and Mrs. McKay would be in Moosomin on Wednesday (28th) and for me to be there if possible. (You see I have two districts to look after and 500 miles to travel each week for Chambers alone in these two districts, Moosomin and Melville, besides a court elsewhere each week, and it keeps me hustling to get thro my work each week.) I got to Moosomin yesterday, but it was necessary I should leave again on the afternoon train and I had a very large amount of chamber work to dispose of. This did not give me as much time as I would have liked for the Round Lake matter. I found there was a hitch over the taxes. These had not been paid for this year, and no instructions had been given Mundell and Co., that these were to be paid by Government and they were of course insisting that they be paid, and I understood that because of this the McKay's had not arrived and signed. I got that settled as I had your letter of the 23rd. of Oct. with me. However that should not have occurred as proper instructions should have been forwarded to Mundell and Co. when they were engaged. Mr. Proctor said he would see to the signing of transfer and closing deal at once. I trust he has succeeded in doing so, without any new hitch. I am XING waiting impatiently to hear that this has been done, the cks. handed over and this confounded thing off my hands.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.

Title to all of legal sub-division 16, not covered by the waters of Round Lake, and the West half of the West half of Legal sub-division 16 in Section 14 in Township 18 Range 3 West of the Second stands in the name of the Board of Trustees of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, excepting 1.50 acres taken for a roadway, but in your letter you refer to the West half of legal sub-division 16. So far as we can determine from an inspection of the various titles, the east half of the west half of legal sub-division 16 appears to be in Round Lake, and we think that the reference in your letter to the West half of Legal sub-division 16 should read the West half of the West half of legal sub-division 16.\n\nPlease advise us as to this as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMUNDELL PROCTER & FRITH\nper \"A.T.PROCTER\"\n\nATP/IB\nSir,\n\nB.5241\nRe: Purchase of Round Lake Residential School\nYour reference No. 108-1-1\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of March 6th and to hand you herewith copy of communication just received from our agents with special reference to remarks as to the West half of L.S.D.16.\n\nI should be glad to be placed in position to instruct Messrs.

In reply I have to inform you that I am convinced the parcel of land should be described as follows:\n\n\"All of Legal Subdivision 15 not covered by the waters of Round Lake and the West Half of the West Half of Legal Subdivision 16 in Sec. 14, T. 18, R. 3, W. 2nd; 22 acres more or less except 1.50 acres for Roadway, Plan No. K-1390.\"\n\nI note that I omitted the words \"West Half\" in my letter of the 6th instant in this connection. It might be well to compare this description with that shown on the Abstract of Title which was enclosed with my former communication.\n\nThe reason I am convinced that the description should read in part \"The West Half of the West Half of Legal Subdivision 16\" is that the Department has already acquired all that portion of the North East quarter of Section 14 excepting, firstly, L. S. 16 and the West Half of the West Half of L. S. 16, and secondly, sixty one hundredths of an acre more or less for a roadway.
