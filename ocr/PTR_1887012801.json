He has already made a tour of the French settlements, a deputation having waited upon him and asked him to come to their aid. When he has visited all the adjoining settlements, he will return to Prince Albert and hold a public meeting at which he will give his views on the question.\n\nThomas Swan, Andrew Spencer, and Mr. Leslie left for Battleford on Tuesday last, to make a personal inspection.\n\nOn Wednesday last Messrs. Alex. Macdonald and Legare arrived here from Melville and St. Louis. Legare was instructed by Mr. Macdonald to make a report to the settlers to Mr. Macdonald.\n\nThe following letter has been received from Mr. Molloy:\n\nTo Mr. J. D. Macdonald,\n\nMr. Laurence, Jan. 26.\n\nIt is good enough to announce to the Committee of the Liberal that I have withdrawn from the contest, and will use my best efforts to promote the success of the party now in power.\n\nR. J. Molloy.\n\nPer Fremont, on receiving word of Mr. Macdonald's withdrawal, wrote to Mr. Molloy, immediately telegraphed to Mr. Hector Legare, offering his support to Mr. Macdonald.\n\nAt a meeting of the delegates of St. Catharine's and Lindsay districts, held on Tuesday last, it was unanimously decided to take a ballot. Mr. Macdonald, as the only Government supporter, or Mr. Laurence as the nominee of the Liberal party, or an independent candidate, should be elected to represent the support of those districts. The result of the ballot was as follows:\u2014For Mr. Macdonald, 15 votes; for Mr. Laurence, 1 vote. In consequence a delegation immediately waited upon Mr. Macdonald to acquaint him of the unanimous result of the vote of the delegates.\n\nLIEUT. GOVERNOR DEWNEY.\n\nWe have found it our duty on one or two occasions to differ with Lieut. Gov. Dewney in regard to the manner in which he occupied the gubernatorial chair. Whether we were then in error, or whether he is now justified in declining the high and honorable duties pertaining to the Government of the North-West, we shall have to see. If so, we will not at present discuss. Suffice it to say that now, no such charges can be made, and we have no reason for standing in the way of frank manner possible, that during the past few years, he has proven himself to be an honest and able-minded man, who not only has ever been ready to grapple with all and any difficulties that presented themselves, but has been able to master them. We echo this to the Lieut. Governor, and we think we voice the sentiment of the whole country when we say that he should Sir John confer upon him another term of office. We believe that there is no link in the long chain that binds the Northwest to himself and his Government. We trust that he will be given consideration for our remarks and extend to Lieut. Governor Dewney that which he has so richly earned, and which the people of the Northwest desire.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT BREWERY.\n\nPure and Sparkling AMBER--(Hop)--ALE.\n\nDelivered to all Parts of the Town.\n\nMcINTOSH & GERRARD.\n\nT.

STOBART & CO.\nANALYZING THE BAKING POWDER DEPARTMENTS.\n\nUnder the direction of the New York State Board of Health eighty-four different kinds of baking powders, embracing all the brands now in use, were tested by Mr. G. L. Lovell, who was employed to examine and analyze by Prof. C. F. Chandler, a member of the Board. The tests were conducted under the supervision of the New York City Board of Health, assisted by Prof. Edward G. Love, the well-known United States chemist.\n\nThe official report shows that a large number of the powders examined were found to be adulterated, and many of them to such an extent as to render them seriously objectionable for use in the preparation of food.\n\nAll the leading powders of the market, with the single exception of \"Royal\" (not included), were found to contain foreign powders, which have been discarded as unsafe or inefficient by prudent housekeepers. Such a mixture of tartrate of tartar and soda is found to be far below line and utterly impossible in any samples to the extent of 93 per cent. of the original ingredients.\n\nAll the leading powders of the market, with the single exception of \"Royal\" (not included), were found to contain foreign powders, which have been discarded as unsafe or inefficient by prudent housekeepers. Such a mixture of tartrate of tartar and soda is found to be far below line and utterly impossible in any samples to the extent of 93 per cent. of the original ingredients.\n\nThe only baking powder yet put on the market which has been found to be absolutely pure is \"Royal.\"\n\nThis perfect purity results from the extreme care taken in the manufacture, refined and prepared by patented processes which totally exhaust the fat content of the wheat flour used. The result is that the chemically pure content of tartrate of tartar is greater than any other, and on account of this fact it is the best for use in baking powder bottles.\n\nProf. Love has made the analysis of baking powders for the Board of Health, State Board of Health, as well as for the Government, says the purity and whole consumption of \"Royal.\"\n\n\"I have tested the contents of Royal Baking Powder, which I purchased in the open market, and find it composed pure and simple of tartaric acid. It is a cream of tartar powder of a high degree of purity, and does not contain stings, also no phosphates or other foreign substances.\"\n\nE. G. Love, Ph. D.\n\nREVENUE AND EXPENDITURE.\n\nThe statement of revenue and expenditure for the month of December and for the year ending December 31st continues to show a most gratifying increase in the former and decrease in the latter. The total revenue for the year Customs, $27,604; Excise, $27,130; other sources, $223,914, a total of $278,548 as compared with $2,300,000 for the same period last year, showing an increase of $1,021,390, of which $148,014 is in income, $11,910 in overdue, and the remainder in interest, penalties, etc.\n\nThe expenditure of the month was $2,257,169; $8,952 less than December last year, but for the year the result has been as follows:\n\nRevenue, $1,027,667.\nExpenditure, $1,030,785.\nSurplus, $3,118.\n\nFor the same period last year the figures were:\n\nRevenue, $2,300,000.\nExpenditure, $2,257,169.\nSurplus, $42,831.\n\nOr to put it another way the revenue having increased about two million and a quarter, while the expenditure decreased more than two millions, a deficit of over two and three quarter millions has been converted into a surplus of more than three millions and three quarters. The greatest increases have been in customs ($1,057,238) and excise ($1,023,185), while the public works, including railways, also show considerable increase. Taxes alleged to be due from the Canada Southern is highly unlikely and indicates that, after allowing for the half yearly advance in the previous year, will not reach the amount stated. In this month, a very handsome surplus is likely to accrue before the close of the fiscal year.\n\nMONTREAL TIMES.\n\nTHE WEEKLY BULLETIN.\n\nREAD BY EVERYBODY\n\nAND\n\nBENEFICIAL TO ALL.\n\nJ. M.

David Laird is expected to arrive in Prince Albert shortly.\n\nTHE S. P. AND THE NOVA SCOTIA COAL TRADE.\n\nThe coal industry of Nova Scotia would not seem to have suffered much since last month\u2019s special reference, if the following reports are correct.\n\nGeo. Johnson, writing to the Montreal Gazette, says:\u2014\n\nThe total value in 1866 was $3,944,200. There was then a duty of $1.25 per ton on Nova Scotia coal imported into United States. Of the total value that year, $88,900 went to the United States and $3,856,300 to other countries, but of this last sum, only 1,000 tons distributed throughout the Dominion. In 1873 the United States duties were repealed.\n\nIn 1874, 76, 77 and 78, the years of greatest depression, when Canada had no means up to keep up production, here was a great increase in consumption, but little, while the quantity going to the United States filled till in 1879, $1,855,000, but in 1878, $1,700,000, and nine times less than the amount of 1873. There was also considerable protest during those years against the heavy duties, and Canada varied but little, being as follows: 77, 586,653 tons, and 78, 590,069 tons.\n\nThe duties on coal imported into Canada have been very heavy, and the result has been a great increase in consumption. Those who have been engaged in the trade will not forget how hard it was to get the people to buy our coal, and how difficult it was to get them to pay the high duties. Those who have been engaged in the trade will not forget how hard it was to get the people to buy our coal, and how difficult it was to get them to pay the high duties. Those who have been engaged in the trade will not forget how hard it was to get the people to buy our coal, and how difficult it was to get them to pay the high duties.\n\nThe business of the undersigned is being closed up.\n\nAll parties owing said firm will please settle at once at the old stand.\n\nBalance of stock at and under cost for cash.\n\nMISS MACK & CO.\n\nFirst Door East Telegraph Office.\n\nRUSSELL & DAVIS.\n\nWHOLESALE & RETAIL\n\nButchers.\n\nDeer, Pork, Mutton, Sausages, Bacon, Ham and Game in Season.\n\nBranch Stalls\u2014Qu\u2019Appelle Station, Fort Qu\u2019Appelle and Prince Albert.\n\nRUSSELL & DAVIS,\n\nBROWN\u2019S BRICK STORE.\n\nJ.
