Authority is requested that for the purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Act, present and future contributors to the Superannuation Fund be considered as having twelve months' service for each complete academic year of employment, that the yearly amount of deduction from salary for superannuation purposes be made during the ten months of the academic year and that the nature of tenure of these positions be changed from seasonal to temporary and permanent.\n\nOtherwise an employee would have to teach for twelve academic years to accumulate ten years' service, for twenty-four academic years to accumulate twenty years' service and for thirty-six academic years to accumulate thirty years' service. In superannuation schemes sponsored by Provincial Departments of Education, an academic year is considered as a complete year of service. There is a serious shortage of teachers across Canada and the Education Division must compete with Provincial Departments of Education in recruiting staff for its schools. The necessity of teaching in an Indian School for a longer period of time than would be required in a Provincial School would deter well-qualified applicants and teachers who might otherwise seek continuous employment in Indian Schools.\nAs the Department is endeavouring to establish and maintain a high standard of education in its schools it is necessary to secure and retain the services of certificated and experienced teachers. Therefore, it is thought to be in the public interest to obtain the authority requested.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, March 5, 1952.\n\nR.B.

Many of them are genuinely interested in the work among Indians, and not attracted solely by the improved salary schedule in effect in Indian Schools.\n\nHowever, when the matter of the superannuation fund comes up for discussion, the general feeling seems to be a disinclination to lose their equity of twenty years or more in the Saskatchewan Teachers Superannuation Fund if a transfer is made to the Indian Day Schools. This is not a problem when young, inexperienced teachers join our teaching service, who have the greater part of their teaching career ahead of them.\n\nThe teachers with twenty or more years of experience in the Provincial Schools would like a measure of reciprocity between the Dominion and Provincial Superannuation Commissions, inasmuch as their work is beneficial to both Saskatchewan and Canada.\n\nI am not aware of the extent to which negotiations or discussions between the Dominion and Provincial\n\n(con'd).\nMr. Philip Phelan\n\nCommissions have proceeded on this subject.\n\nIt does seem that our choice of teachers at present is largely from among those who are young and inexperienced, or those who are disgruntled and frustrated, or those who have a sickly husband to support. The really worthwhile teachers feel that they cannot afford to transfer to Indian Schools under the present arrangements.\n\nI shall appreciate receiving your comments, please.\n\nE. N.

I understand that service as teachers in most, if not all of the provincial systems, is accepted as pensionable employment.\n\nYou will note that by the terms of our Act, the question of contributing to two pension schemes does not arise.\n\nIf there is any further question concerning this matter, I shall be pleased to endeavour to answer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nAttach.\nOctober 15, 1952.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nMr. Joseph Francis McNeill\n\nMr. J.F. McNeill who was appointed teacher at the Fort Babine Indian Day School effective September 1, 1952, was a permanent employee of the Post Office Department at Glace Bay, N.S., up to August 31, 1952, inclusive.\n\nIn order that he may retain his permanent status and continue to contribute to the Superannuation Fund, it is requested that Treasury Board certify that he has been appointed during pleasure and that the duties of his office are of continuing indefinite duration, in accordance with section 6 of the Civil Service Superannuation Regulations.\n\nIt is our opinion that the privilege of retaining permanent status on leaving a position in the Civil Service to accept employment as an Indian Day School teacher will be an advantage in recruiting certificated teachers for our Indian Schools.\n\nMr. McNeill's case has been discussed with Mr. G.E. Birch of the Superannuation Branch who has stated that it is in order for Mr. McNeill to retain his permanent status on accepting employment in an exempt position, but to comply with Section 6 of the Civil Service Superannuation Regulations Mr. McNeill should be designated as permanent by Treasury Board.\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Minister\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\nMcNeil J.

C. L. Hilton\nMinister of the Interior\n\nOct. 27, 1887\n\nHon. Sir,\n\nI have seen the said agreement of the grant of $600 towards the new school house on the Lebret Reserve and think it will be forthcoming shortly.\n\nThe contract price was $800, of which I am taking the $200 from the missionary board. When the contract was made we made over estimates on the ground that the builder could be cut on the reserve from which we could make all the lower bricks and rafters. The Indians had also signified their willingness to do the laboring work such as setting stones, digging cellar etc. But when the contractor had taken down his cargo of materials and reached the reserve a distance of about 150 miles he found that the Indians would not allow a white builder to be cut neither would they work even at large wages on any part of the building. Carpenters at $250 a day had been employed to do laborers' work and an extra expense was incurred in getting the additional bricks and rafters from Red River and the 1/4 put in a claim for $100.\nHon. C. P. Alison\nMinister of the Interior\n\nHon. Sir,\n\nI have been informed by Mr. Robert Macdonald of the Grant of $600 towards the new school house on the Athabasca Reserve. The contract price was $800, of which I am deducting the $200 from the missionary board.\n\nWhen the contract was made, we made our estimate on the ground that the timber would be cut on the reserve from which we could make all the lower joints and rafters. The Indians had also signified their willingness to do the laboring work such as setting stones, digging cellar, etc. But when the contractor had taken down his cargo of materials and reached the reserve a distance of about 150 miles he found that the Indians would not allow a single fir tree to be cut; neither could they work even at half wages on any part of the building. Carpenters at $2.50 a day had to be employed to do laborer's work, and an extra allowance was incurred in getting the additional boards and rafters from Red River. And the contractor puts in a claim for $100 extra.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that he is entitled to compensation. But the point is who should pay the money\u2014thisness\u2014\ninvolves a consideration as to the cause of the change in the attitude of the Indians\u2014\nThese Indians are Kickapoos (of the Ojibway nation) and the same people who were recently at war with the United States on the northern limits of Minnesota\u2014\nThey are intermarrying frequently with our Canadian tribes\u2014these are a pretty determined lot of men\u2014It appears that there is a deep feeling to be sustained among them concerning the cutting of timber by some of their relatives by the Kawatina lumber company pursuant to privileges granted the said company by the Red Government many years ago\u2014they say they have never had any returns for this timber and the thing has never been explained or shown\u2014\nMr. McDougall will write you about this at length\u2014\nThen when the teacher was very popular among them, just before last Christmas they wanted him to get them liquor, which he refused and they were very rude kept the children from school. They asked for his removal, but the Department did not commission and after inquiry gave me fault\nAnd he was continued into the school next year. The Indians had asked for the new school house and Jon Miller who cut for the building, but waited until after the treaty day meet. After which all the tribes held council and decided not to have schools. Nothing was said so far as we knew about the circular school which was really in operation in the old building. When the contract was let it was supposed that the Indians would help as they had agreed to do. So far as my knowledge goes these are the facts\u2014As the Indians are the wards of the government and as their attitude has caused this offense it seems to me that the Department should pay the amount\u2014I am satisfied that if any further of the case satisfies you that I am right you will do the fair thing. If there be anything further that you would like to know I shall be pleased to make inquiry and advise you\u2014\n\nI am your most respectfully,\n\nAlfred Andrews\nDear Mr. Andrews,\n\nThe delay in acknowledging your letter of the 27th October last has been occasioned by the necessity of my communicating with the Department at Ottawa before giving a definite answer to your application for an increased grant towards the building of the school on the Subiaco reserve. The specific appropriation was $600, but by straining a point I find I will be able to increase the grant from the general vote so as to meet the extra demand which has been made upon you by the contractor on account of the failure of the Indians to co-operate as expected. In accordance with the regulations respecting the expenditure of public moneys the Department will require a statement of the whole expenditure upon the school, supported by vouchers.\n\nRev. Alfred Andrews,\n256 Selkirk Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDecember 1, 1899\nRev. A.A. S.\n\nWhen this is furnished the Department will be prepared to pay up to $700.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) Alfred Sutton\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward the Quarterly Returns of the Assabaska Day School for December quarter last. The \"Remarks\" explain the reason why there has been no attendance; the school material as well as other Indian supplies have been stolen by the Indians and up to the present I have failed to have same returned although the Chief has been written to and threatened of being deposed. Under the circumstances, it not being the fault of the teacher, I think the grant should be paid. The school has been closed for the April quarter, and it is doubtful whether it will be opened at all during the present quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 22nd May, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nA letter has been received from the Commissioner forwarding the return from the Assabasca school for December quarter last in which he states that the school material as well as other Indian supplies have been stolen by the Indians and that the same have not been returned although he has written to the Chief and threatened to depose him.\n\nNo children attended the school during the quarter although the Commissioner says that it was not the fault of the teacher who should, he thinks, be paid his salary. The school is now closed.\n\nIt was only last year that $700 was granted for the erection of a schoolhouse and teacher's residence at this place at the request of the Rev. Mr Andrews of Winnipeg. It appears that the Indians are dissatisfied with the location of the school, which was put up on the reserve. They also seem to have a grudge against the teacher for having refused to procure liquor for them on different occasions. This reserve is near the boundary line and the Indians are very obstinate and inclined to be troublesome.\n\nThe school is not directly under the control of the Methodist Missionary Society and up to a short time ago was supposed to be Church of England, as shown by Inspector McColl's reports.\nMr Atkinson has had charge of the school since 1897. He belongs to the Methodist denomination and it would appear to be on that account that the Rev. Mr Andrews applied for a grant for a new schoolhouse and residence.\n\nI think that the Commissioner's recommendation to pay Mr Atkinson for the December quarter should be complied with but that the school should not be re-opened until some assurance can be given the Department that the work can be proceeded with regularly.\n\nIt seems a pity that the money has been spent for a new building at this place as the Indians have failed to carry out their promises in every way.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nMoved by Mr. [signature]\nSeconded by Mr. [signature]\nThe case of Mr. [signature]\nfor the school\n\n[Signature]\n[Date]\nOTTAWA, 28th May, 1900\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI am directed to call your attention to the condition of affairs which existing at the Assabasca day school. This school, which is not directly under the authority of your Church, has been taught for the last two years by Mr. Atkinson, in whose behalf the Rev. Mr. Andrews of Winnipeg, interested himself and obtained a grant from this Department for $700 for the erection of a schoolhouse and teacher's residence, which building was only completed last year.\n\nA blank return has been received from this school for December quarter last, no children having attended owing to differences which have taken place between the teacher and the Indians. The Indians, it is alleged, have stolen the school material, which is under the teacher's charge, and have not returned it.\n\nThe Department has paid the teacher's salary for December quarter and the school is now closed and it would appear inadvisable to re-open it under Mr. Atkinson, who is unable to get on with the Indians.\n\nIt seems a pity that so much money has been expended.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland D.D.,\nfor\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto\nfer a new building at this place where the work cannot be proceeded with regularly, and the Department would be glad if you would make enquiries with a view to remedying the present unsatisfactory condition of affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 28th inst., No.118209. We regret much the state of affairs at Sabaskong Indian day school concerning which you have written. I beg, however, to inform you that the General Secretary on being advised as to the trouble that had taken place between the teachers and the Indians, immediately addressed a letter to the Rev John McDougall, Chairman of that District, calling his attention to the case, and requiring him to investigate and report with the least possible delay. As the case now stands, Mr Atkinson has resigned, and steps are being taken to have in every sense a suitable person appointed to take his place. Active measures are also being adopted with a view to remedying the unsatisfactory condition of affairs of which you so justly complain. Trusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYours Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssociate Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 23rd, July, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nInspector Leveque in his annual report to\nthe 30th June last makes the following remarks in regard\nto the Assabaska Band, Rat Portage Agency:\n\n\"Education.\u2014There is a school in operation\non this reserve. The same misunderstanding existing last\nyear between the teacher and the band regarding religious\ninstruction has repeated itself, and in consequence the\nschool-house has been closed the last two quarters.

Scott\n\nMay 1st 1901\nSir,\n\nThe Rev John McDougall, Superintendent of our Indian Missions in the Manitoba and North-West Conferences, reports that Mr Atkinson, who has been in charge of the Indian day school at Sabaskong, has resigned, and Mr McDougall suggests transferring Mr Jos Dargue, teacher of the Indian school at Poplar River, to Sabaskong. In that event it is further proposed to transfer Mr Lowen from the school at Norway House to Poplar River, and to send either a lady teacher or an unmarried male teacher to the school at Norway House. At the present stage these are suggestions, but I deem it right to inform the Department of what we propose to do if it can be carried out. The school at Sabaskong is a somewhat difficult post, and we think that Mr Dargue's experience for a number of years at Poplar River will be a qualification for the new position, which a teacher without experience in an Indian school could not possibly have.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA.

T. Ferrier, the Chairman of the District within which Sabiskong is located. At that time we considered it advisable to withdraw altogether from Sabiskong, chiefly on two grounds: First, that the prejudice of the Indians prevents the holding of religious services of any kind, and secondly, that Mr. Dargue was not likely to succeed even as a teacher; we concluded, therefore, that it would be better before coming to any decision that Mr. Ferrier should if possible visit the Reserve, and ascertain the condition of affairs from personal investigation. I think he has not yet been able to do so, but I have written him for information and as soon as it comes to hand will communicate with the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th instant respecting the September quarter return from the Assabasca Day School, I beg to say that the school was opened by my authority and Mrs. Julia L. Harber duly appointed Teacher.\n\nIn January 1907 Rev. Dr. W. E. Norton, of Toronto, Superintendent of Baptist Missions, having heard that the day school at Assabasca had been vacant for some time, asked me if this church might send a teacher there in the following spring. As a good school building had been erected on the reserve and the Methodists latterly and the Presbyterians had declined to nominate a teacher for it, I replied in the affirmative. They sent up a single man named John R. Turnbull, who kept the school open for a month or two during the open season, but left in the autumn, and made no returns that ever came to this office. In March last Rev. Dr. Norton proposed sending Rev. G.H. Harber and Mrs. Harber to the Assabasca Reserve, Mrs. Harber, who was for a number of years a teacher in England, to be teacher of the school. I appointed her teacher, and they went to the reserve in June last. By her return for the September quarter, she seems to have kept the school open from the 1st of July until the Indians went away berry-picking, whence they did not return until the 25th September. This was not the teacher's fault. But as the Harbers...\nare well recommended people, and the Indians are now on the reserve, I expect to receive a good report of the school for the coming three quarters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose quarterly returns of the Assabaska Day School, which I found here on my return. I may say that some time ago Mr. Harber wrote me that it was there intention to resign, some time during the summer, but did not send in any regular form of Resignation, For which I had been waiting so as to send it on to you.\n\nI now find that during my Absence on the payments, they have closed the school, and left, I may add that for some time back, they have been very much discouraged, finding they were unable to make a success of the work, and would have given up long before this, only that I persuaded them to remain on for a time longer, which they did, but found they could not do any good, so I suppose they got so discouraged that they at last gave up in despair. I have not had any word from Board as to whether another Teacher will be appointed or not.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant:\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary:-\nDept of Indian Affairs:-\nOttawa:-\nOttawa, July 2, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo advising the Department of the resignation of Mrs. Harber as teacher of the Assabaska Day School.\n\nAs there are sufficient children on this reserve and as the attendance in the past has been of such a nature as to warrant the school being kept open, I have to ask you to be good enough to take this matter up with the church authorities with a view to securing the services of a competent, qualified teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. S. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nDr. H. E. Norton\n625 Confederation Life Building\nToronto\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd Instant No. 118209/1.\n\nRe the Assabaska School. I beg leave to say that I have seen the Rev. Wills Wilkey, pastor of the Baptist church here, and he tells me that, this is outside of his jurisdiction, that it will be the Church Authorities at Toronto who will have to deal with this.\n\nI have written to Dr. W. E. Norton, on this subject, and I now enclose you his address in case you would wish to communicate with him on this matter. In the mean time when I hear from Dr Norton I will let you know what he says on the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary:-\nDept of Indian Affairs:-\nOttawa.\nMr. R.S. McKenzie,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI suppose I ought to make an apology for not having notified you of the fact that Mr. and Mrs. Harber had given up the work at Sebastopol. Our Board found the work unsatisfactory in many respects, one of the principal things being the migratory habits of the Indians. They were never long in one place, and it seemed to be impossible to do anything along the line of evangelising them. Mr. Harber resigned his position as missionary, and of course Mrs. Harber left with him. It is not at all probable that our Board will take up the work again, so that you may consider yourself entirely free to employ another teacher irrespective of anything we may think of doing in the future. Thanking you for all your assistance in our work on the Lake of the Woods, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.E. Norton\nReferring to my letter of even number dated July 27th, 1912, re the Assabaska Bay School, and the wish of the Dept to keep this school open. I done what I thought best and communicated with the Baptist Church Authorities at Toronto?\n\nAnd now beg to enclose, Rev. W. E. Norton's reply to my letter which gives the reason for the resignation of Mr. Harber and his wife, as Missionary and Teacher.\n\nI may add that Mrs Harber was a good and conscientious woman and last time I seen her she told me that she was discouraged, as she could not get a regular attendance, and while the average of attendance appeared fair, yet it was not as it should be as most of the pupils only attended a few days during the quarter, and many were not members of the Assabaska Band? and told me that she felt she would not be doing right, to hold the school, while she knew it was of no use.\n\nI may add that this has been the case with this school, right along, and I do not think it will be possible to get a regular and satisfactory attendance there for years to come.\n\nI will however try and see the Rev. Mr. Dodds of the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School, and find out if the Presbyterian Board will take the matter up, and place a teacher there, or not, and let you know, what he says on the subject.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:-\n\nYour obedient servant:-\n\nIndian Agent:-\n\nIndian Affairs:-\n\nOttawa:-\nOttawa, August 12, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Assabaska School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will await the result of your communication with the authorities of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. S. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nMay 23, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. PAGET,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum concerning the request of the Indians at Sabaskong Bay, in the Kenora agency, that a day school be established, I may say that from 1899 to 1905, the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church, assisted by a grant from this Department, conducted a day school at this point. The General Secretary, when announcing their withdrawal from Sabaskong, stated that the Indians were prejudiced against religious services and that the teacher was not likely to succeed with his classroom activities.\n\nIn 1907, Inspector Semons reported that was a waste of money trying to keep this school open. Mr. Commissioner Laird writes in 1908 that both Methodists and Presbyterians had declined his invitation to place a teacher there and that the Baptist Church had accepted the responsibility for the activity. School was kept open for 4 years under the auspices of this last mentioned church, and at the end of that time (1912) they, too, threw up their hands. The reasons given for this action were as follows:\n\n1. Migratory habits of the Indians,\n2. Impossible to evangelize them,\n3. Irregular attendance.\n\nSince 1912 there has been no school activity at Sabaskong, and until the attached petition was received, no requests had been made in the matter.\n\nI believe these Indians should be told that our experience with day schools in this locality is unsatisfactory, because of the irregular attendance and the difficulties of securing qualified teachers who will enter and then stay with the work. There is accommodation for their children at the Kenora (Roman Catholic) and Cecilia Jeffrey (Presbyterian) Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI note that complaint No. 10 states there are three trained nurses at the Kenora Residential School. Only one of the Sisters is detailed for this duty and her work is entirely in the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSabaskong Bay Bands,\nJune 29, 1929.\n\nAnd we want a school.

Mr. Andrews, of Rat Portage, in connection with school matters on the Assabasca Reserve.\n\nI have already received a petition from the Indians asking for a better school house, and expressing a desire that the Teacher be married instead of single. Conversations had with Mr. Andrews as well as a report from Mr. Inspector Leveque, enable me to make the following report:\n\nThe School population reaches almost forty, and all pagans; the average attendance did not reach it for last year, but this can be improved if efforts are made in that direction. The attendance naturally fluctuates on account of the parents absenting themselves from the Reserves on hunting, berry-picking, and other expeditions. The present building is in poor condition and would require at least $200.00 worth of repairs. The parents are very anxious to have a school, and the average attendance of last year has been an improvement on former years.\n\nUnder the circumstances, and considering that the Rev. Mr. Andrews has assured me that the Missionary Board of his Church will provide a part of the sum which will be needed for the new building asked for, and also add $200.00 to the grant of the Department for the Teacher's salary, which will enable the Teacher to marry, and thus add the example of civilized family life to the ordinary school training, I feel justified in recommending that $600.00 be appropriated for a combined residence and school house.\n\nIn respect to the cutting of logs, I should be pleased to have your authority at an early date to have the same done by the Indians, as they should be cut in the Winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Hon. Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Minister approves of the Commissioner's recommendation as to providing $600.00 for a combined teacher's residence and school house upon the Assahasca Reserve, and he authorizes the giving of the necessary permission for the cutting of logs.\n\nPlease have the necessary action taken and the Commissioner advised.\nTo Ottawa 31st December, 1896.\n\nHon. D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nMay authorize cutting of legs Assiniboin School\nand teacher's residence.\n\nCharge Dept.

Clifford Sifton,\nSupt.-Gen'l of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nor the school room, but simply laying the rough floors to be completed at some future time - the outside of the building, including the windows, to be completed according to plan, with the exception that the chimney which we intended to be provided with an open fire place in the school room, will start from about 2\u00bd ft. below the ceiling of the school room, a ventilator being placed in the wall of the school room with a suitable grate near the floor, and to extend up to and through the roof.\n\nSecond,- If you deemed it better, we will lessen the size of the residence part to 14x18, instead of 18x23, and finish all the building at the reduced size now indicated, but in all other respects according to the original specifications. I have an offer from a reliable man to erect and complete the building on the reduced scale for $800.00, $300. to be provided by the Department according to provision already made, and $200. which I will collect from the Church people, and which will be paid through the Missionary Board.\n\nIf the Department prefers that we should adhere to the original plan we will be prepared to contribute\ncontribute our share in the same proportion as above. The Department will readily see that the building here cannot be put up at the same price as could be done in Rat Portage on account of freight on material, the distance being about 150 miles from Rat Portage by boat. The steamboat channel is not in a direct line.\n\nI should be obliged for a very early answer as the season is advancing and it is most important that the work be done before the bad season. If it is at all possible I should like the reply made by wire direct to the Indian Commissioner's Office, Winnipeg.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlfred Andrews\n\nP.S. Same over heading at - address above, being minister of the Metisople Church.\nMemo:-\n\nRe communication from the Rev. Mr Andrews in reference to the proposed erection of a combined school house and teacher's residence on the Assabasca Reserve.\n\nLast December a letter was received from the Indian Commissioner, in which he stated that a petition had been received from the Indians of Assabasca, asking for a better school house and expressing a desire that a married teacher should be employed. The Commissioner stated that the present school building is in such a poor condition that it would require at least $200 worth of repairs, and it would at best only be spent in patching up an old building. Under the circumstances and considering that the Rev. Mr Andrews had assured him that the Missionary Board of his church would provide a part of the sum needed for the new building asked for, and also add $200 to the grant of the Department for the teacher's salary, which would enable the teacher to marry and thus add the example of missionary civilized life to the ordinary training, he said he felt justified in recommending that $600 be appropriated for a combined residence and school house. He also asked for authority for the cutting of logs by the Indians for this building, permission for which was given.\nThe Superintendent General approved of the Commissioner's recommendation for a grant of $600 for a combined school house and teacher's residence and this amount is included in the Supplementary Estimates which have not yet been passed by Parliament.\n\nThe Rev. Mr Andrews states in his letter above referred to that he finds it impossible to secure an offer to erect the proposed building from any reliable contractor for a less sum than $1000 in accordance with the plans and specifications that they have adopted, and he suggests that either the residence part be left unfinished, or that the size of the building be reduced. He states that the building could be completed on a reduced scale for $800, which would be covered by the Departmental grant and $200 to be given by the Church, or the Church will contribute in the same proportion if the original plan is adhered to. This would require $733.33 from the Department and $266.66 from the Church.\n\nI think it would be a pity to reduce the size of the teacher's quarters, as additions would have to be made later on, but I think that the Mission Board should be prepared to furnish the additional amount required to carry out the original plan, as the Commissioner's letter naturally led the Department to suppose that if the $600 asked for were granted, the additional amount required to complete the building would be furnished by the Church.\n\nMr Andrews asks for an early reply so that the work may be proceeded with at once.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Brown\nOTTAWA, 7th August, 1899\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th ulto., in regard to the proposed erection of a combined school house and teacher's residence on the Assiniboia Reserve; and in reply I beg to say that the Department has noted your remarks in reference to the price for which the proposed building can be put up and your suggestions as to how the cost might be curtailed.\n\nThe Department is of opinion that it would be a pity to reduce the size of the teacher's quarters and considers that the Missionary Board should be prepared to furnish the additional amount required to carry out the original plans, as when the Department agreed to contribute $600, it naturally supposed that any additional amount required to complete the building would be furnished by the Church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

Under the contract made by me for the erection of a school house on the Sabiskong Indian Reserve No. 35, it was agreed that the joints should be all logs for the lower floor, hewed on one side only. That the rafters should be of straight poles, flatted on two sides. That the Indians would get out the logs for the joists and the poles for the said roof, cutting them on their Reserve under permission given by the Indian Commissioner, on the 4th day of January, A.D. 1899, and that I would have to pay for same merely laborer's wages to the Indians engaged in the work.\n\n2. It was also understood and guaranteed to me that the Indians would perform the labor and get out the stone ready for the wall and would also dig the cellar on their being paid by me laborer's wages for their work.\n\n3. Subsequently after conveying all the other materials for the said building to the Reserve by steamer, the Indians absolutely refused to perform any of the above labor and also to permit me to cut any logs, poles or other lumber on the Reserve, and in consequence of this refusal I was compelled to make an extra trip to Rat Portage and bring from there sawn lumber for the joints and rafters to be used in place of those provided for as above and by the contract. This lumber cost me the sum of $35.00. Fifteen dollars more than the amount I would have been compelled to pay the Indians for the joists and rafters. It also cost me the sum of $5.00 dollars in addition for freight from Rat Portage to the Reserve.\n\n4. In consequence of the refusal of the Indians to perform any work, I was compelled to use the skilled labor which I had\nwith me to get out the stone for the stone work and to make the excavation for the cellar. This skilled labor cost me the sum of $30.50... Dollars more than I would have been compelled to pay had I been able to employ the Indians at laborer's wages.\n\n5. It was also agreed that the Indians would assist in all work which could be performed by ordinary laborers and for which I was to pay laborer's wages, but, in consequence of their refusal I was compelled to use skilled workmen who were the only men available, who did all the laborer's work in connection with the said building, and on this account I was compelled to pay out the sum of $30.50... Dollars more than would have been paid by me had the Indians performed the laborer's work as agreed.\n\n6. Attached hereto is a statement shewing how the above amounts are computed and shewing that the sum of $30.50... Dollars is due to me in consequence of the failure of the Indians to carry out their agreement as per the contract entered into.\n\nAND I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath under and by virtue of the \"Canada Evidence Act, 1893\".\n\nDECLARED before me at the Town of Rat Portage in the province of Ontario this 12th day of November A.D. 1899\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nSTATEMENT OF EXTRA COST of construction of School-House on the Sabinakong Indian Reserve, in consequence of the refusal of the Indians to work thereon and to allow timber on the Reserve to be used in the construction of the building which they had already agreed to do.\n\n1.

Sir,\n\nYour letter of 6th, to hand duly received. I was not aware that the Department would require receipts for all expenditures in detail as the school house was a contract for a definite sum - by that means I was not prepared to get the receipt in regular course as I should otherwise have done. And I am not sure but what one or two which I have received may not have been misplaced. But they will show you themselves by the names. These I send you by my personal note and\nhave that amount.

It may be of that nature.\n\nWhen the contractor demanded an extra hundred dollars, I made a request that he would make out an account of the bills and take out the receipt, which he did on Exhibit No. 1. That did not satisfy me. I sent an attorney & Mr. Brown to see another form on Exhibit No. II.\n\nReplying to him, I said that if I received $90, he could be thankful. And as I had been out a good deal more than $20.00 in cash, besides all the worry & thought I should...\nhave that amount. If they are at least a small part of what I was out, he deserves a little bit, convinced and paid one the receipt in full which see. Now if you think this will be well considered the whole matter closed up - if not I shall send you the $10. The contractor has a Smith piece no good value for our money but on the extra claim of thirty we have held him wrong with him.

Sup't, Gen. of Indian Affairs\nIndian Department - Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indians of Cape Lake, in the territory under the Metis agency, last summer built and equipped a nice little school house, under the impression that the Department would give them the customary grant of $100.00, as is given to all other reserves. At the payment of 1874, they were led to believe that this grant would be given, and last summer while the payments were being made, they were encouraged to go on and complete the school both by the Indian Agent and myself. So far, I learn, that all measures to get the Department to sanction this grant have been fruitless. I respectfully point out to you the fact that the Indians on this Reserve are very much dissatisfied at the treatment they have received, and naturally ask why the Department takes exception in their case. They have been making great efforts to improve their condition, and the school house they have built, though small, deserves great credit, and I feel that the Department should give them encouragement by approving what they have done. They ask that an appropriation be made for the school house and a teacher. The money to complete the building was advanced by a local trader who lives among them, who can ill afford to lose it. I beg respectfully to ask to know whether you can do in the matter! And remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n(Signed) Mr. Brewer - Secretary\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant applying on behalf of the Indians of Maple Lake for a grant of $100 to complete the schoolhouse on their Reserve and also for a salary for a teacher; and in reply I beg to say that it is regretted that the Department was not first communicated with before any expenditure was incurred in connection with the erection of a school house, as were it disposed to sanction the establishment of a school on the Reserve, provision would have to be made in the Estimates and the money voted by Parliament for the purpose before any authority could be given. As it is the Department has no funds available from which the grant asked for could be made.\n\nI may add that the Department, owing to the extremely large and increasing outlay in connection with industrial and boarding schools throughout Manitoba and the Territories, is averse to increasing the number of day schools now in existence and instead of doing so, it contemplates closing some already in existence.\n\nThere are still vacancies at the Rupert's Land school where children belonging to the Church of England could be sent.\n\nI may say that it is only under very exceptional circumstances\n\nRev. Geo: Prover\nWabigoon Mission\nBarclay P.O.\nOnt:\ncircumstances that the Department could consider an application for the establishment of a day school, as past experience has shown that the results obtained in many cases are far from satisfactory, and its efforts are now directed to fill up the existing vacancies at the Boarding and Industrial schools, where permanent results can be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs:\nOTTAWA 23rd November 1896\n\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith for your information in regard to the matters referred to therein, a copy of a letter addressed to the Rev.

McColl, Esq:\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nMr. Indian Agent McKenzie reports that the Indians of Eagle Lake, Savanne Agency, are desirous that the Day School be re-opened. The school is provided for in the Estimates, but I am not quite sure, without obtaining a census of the children on the reserve, about the advisability of re-opening it. However, should it prove advisable to do so, the building would need some repairs, which would amount to $10.00 or $15.00. I should like to have authority to spend this amount, if I find it desirable to re-open this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept.

Dissatisfaction with their Teacher, and the unpleasantness caused on their reserve by the meddlesome and uncalled for interference on his part in many matters having no connection with his duties, and they asked unanimously that he be removed from their reserve.\n\nThe foregoing statements were made in presence of the Teacher, and although he made an effort to refute them, the Indians maintained their statements, and I cannot deny their statements so far as my knowledge is concerned.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

S. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKawartha, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th Instant. No.145378/1:-and note contents,\n\nIn reply to say that when sending you the pay sheets I also sent a copy of them to the Commissioner, and a copy of the report, at the same time. I may add that what was stated about the schools in said report was just what the Indians said to me at the payments. Probably I was in error in saying anything about the schools in said report, and in the future I will make that a separate report and only send it to the Commissioner, as you direct,\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary:-\n\nDept of Indian Affairs:-\n\nOttawa. Ont:-\nRight Rev Bishop Loft house\n\nRevved\n\nMy Lord\n\nI am writing this for Mr. Smith about our teacher.\n\nKnow that Mr. Fox, our teacher here is to be dismissed and I know of no reason why he should be dismissed. I do not think that things would be right if he had no teacher here. The parents who are away from the reserve here say they will soon be coming home to have their children attend School again. I am of the opinion that all of the parents except a few others would not approve of our teacher being dismissed especially those who want to have their children learn something. I do not know if any one here who wishes to have him dismissed. Personally, I shall be very sorry to see\nI have three children attending school regularly and I wish to attend them. I have been to school whenever I can spare time and by next summer I shall have another child who will attend.\n\nIf any one from here has reported anything about the teacher or requested him to remove, I do not think any attention should be paid him. There is only one man on the reserve who is disliked by the teacher, myself and that is Big Joe. He feels hurt for being deprived of his position as Conneller last summer and I think he wishes to have more freedom to think as he does as undesirable as he is. He was put in the reserve so he could not be there and that is why he does not like the teacher on the reserve.\n\nWhile he was Conneller and was expected to be that kind of order was kept on the reserve, if not undesirable.\nClass A which men allowed on the Board, the officers were the case & he always welcomed them and so do I. All some of our women have had illegitimate children.\n\nSince Mr. Fox took charge of the school, only the right sort of people come here & are welcomed.\n\nNow I know and am sure of next day that if Mr. Fox continues the old order of things will start again & we will be worse off than ever. So a teacher I believe he is doing his work well and I am doing what I can to supply the school with fuel so that the school should go on well. Should we at any time see any reason for having him dismissed I don't think we should hesitate to let him to work for us even though he shouldn't be working against him.\n\nI thus give you my Lordship\nI have your influence to know Mr. Fox kept on his track, as I do not think he should ever be able to get another so good as he always has one best interest at heart & has always worked toward that end. It would also be glad if you could kindly forward this if you see fit to Frank Pashley Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nBy granting this request your Lordship will confer a great favor on your Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nAlex Ferguson\nCommissioner\nLittle Lake Reserve\nDear Sir,\n\nI am forwarding you, as requested, a letter from Eagle River. I have already written the Indian Commissioner in Winnipeg on this matter. There seems to be absolutely nothing in the charges against Dr. Rose, and I am quite sure we could not get a better teacher, and if Dr. Rose was removed I could not recommend another man.\n\nThere is also has been a great deal of drinking and gambling at Eagle River and Dr. Rose has thrown rightly out his face against it.\n\nBelieve me sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Keewatin\nOttawa, December 31, 1906.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 24th Inst., inclosing a communication from Councillor Joseph Singleton, of the Eagle Lake band, protesting against the dismissal of Mr. Fox, teacher of the school on the reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the substance of the Councillor's letter, together with your remarks in this connection, has been communicated to the Hon. David Laird, Indian Commissioner, and he will also be specially written to in regard to the drinking and gambling on the reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, December 31, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 16th ult., in regard to Mr. Agent McKenzie's report on the Eagle Lake school and your reply thereto of the 28th of the same month, I beg to say that the Department is in receipt of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop of Keewatin, with which His Lordship incloses a communication from one of the councillors of the Eagle Lake band, Joseph Singleton, protesting against the removal of Mr. Pez and stating that the majority of the band are perfectly satisfied with his work, the only dissatisfied person that he knows of being Ex-chief Big Joe.\n\nFrom His Lordship's letter it would appear that the only fault-finders are those who have been reproved by the teacher for their drinking and gambling habits; and, if you are satisfied that the councillor's statements are correct, no further action need be taken.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nHon. D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nSir,\n\nI have just been informed that it appears Mr. McKenzie (Indian Agent) has written to Ottawa to have me dismissed from the Eagle Lake Day School, as teacher, for unnecessarily interfering in matters here not connected with my duties. And in reply to the charge against me, I am at a loss to recollect anything I did which Mr. McKenzie does not approve of. I have always done what I thought was for the good of the Band; and this, not without Mr. McKenzie's knowledge. And I have letters in my possession to show he approves of what I do.\n\nAnd I might say, I caused a good deal of disturbance in my efforts to put a stop to drinking and gambling whose habits were indulged in to a disgraceful extent by the Indians. And as a consequence of my efforts the Indians did their utmost to have me dismissed when the Indian Agent was here to pay treaty, on Aug. 6th last. But the charges against me were of such a nature that the Indian Agent told the Indians he saw nothing in what they said, to be able to comply to their wishes.\n\nThe man who worked against me the bitterest came to me the following day to apologize for trying to have me dismissed. And the councillor wanted me to write to the Agent for him to tell him to have me kept on.\n\nSo when Mr. McKenzie says the Indians wish to have me dismissed, he is stating what is forgotten.\n\nI wish the Indian Department would know the particulars of the way the drinking and gambling were carried on. I told the Agent the particulars. But I do not think the information ever went further than his office.\n\nI have always been careful to do nothing over the Agent's head; but if necessary I shall give you the detail information direct, to show what the state of things were.\n\nAt present there is very little drinking and no gambling that I am aware of, for some time. But before I did anything the same used to gamble openly and the drunks walk right into my house whenever they felt like it (and this was pretty often) while they had liquor in them. I reported this and more to the Agent; but it seems he finds it very difficult to do anything.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to say, before the Department should do anything to have me dismissed I would like them to know what I might have to say for myself in defense.\n\nKindly forward this to the Indian Department, Ottawa, soon as possible.\n\nHope to hear what you think of the above said.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI wrote Mr Agent McKenzie about this school and he replied on 5th December, \"Since the payments I have not heard any complaints from any of the Indians regarding the teachers and think there is a truce between the Indians and teachers at the present time as all appears to be going on smoothly with them.\"\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report having made an inspection of the Kenora Agency now in charge of Mr. R.S. McKenzie and to offer the following information in connection therewith:\n\nDay Schools\n\nI found that the schools were not in a very satisfactory condition and that both interest in them and attendance of pupils were far below the desired standard.\n\nThe Eagle Lake School is in operation under Mr. James Fox but the attendance averaged only 4.3/8 last quarter.\n\nSchools on the Kenora Agency are about the same as those already mentioned.\n\nIn my opinion a lot of money and energy was wasted in trying to keep these schools open and I favour the enlargement of the Boarding School work but have no definite suggestion to offer without further study of this question.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgt. John Simmons,\nIndian Commissioner,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nMr. Benson\n\nEagle River, Ont.\nOct. 4th, 1907\n\n315296\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI am sending you the enclosed samples of work, by two of my day school pupils who attend pretty regularly since Jan 1st 1905, when the school was reopened after being closed for some time.\n\nI taught both of them from their alphabets. Bella knows all the important cities, lakes, rivers of Canada, and can point them out on the map, and the distance from east to west, north and south.\n\nThe other pupils could learn equally as well, if the parents would send them to school as they should. But I fear they are often kept home to look after the younger children while the mothers (and some men) are away gambling during the absence of their husbands.\n\nMy object in sending you this work is\nfor you to see, what pupils in the\nIndian Bay Schools are capable of doing.\n\nI maintain that the day school are\nalright, while Mr. Agent McKenzie says\nthey are useless, and upholds boarding\nschools. We have not been able to agree\non this point for some time, and other\nthings respecting the Indians and\nreserves generally.\n\nI will write you the particulars of\nmy views later.\n\nKindly show this letter to Hon. Mr.\nOliver, but keep my name private to\nyourself for the present.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJames D.\n15 I. Class Arithmetic.\n\n1. $875 + 4 \\times 2 - 404 = 45 \\times 25 \\%$\n\n2.

And we do hereby respectfully request you to have it opened again as soon as possible, and Mr. Fox, who has been laboring hard and patiently with the Indians as missionary and school teacher for the past three years, be engaged.\n\nOwing to an outbreak of sickness, and a little inattention on our part, the attendance at school was very small during the last quarter. And when Mr. Fox sent his report, Commissioner Laird of Winnipeg ordered the school to be closed on account of poor attendance.\n\nIf the school be reopened, there is a prospect of good attendance (and we sincerely hope that is so).\n\nThe school is the only civilizing influence the Indians have, and the only thing that keeps them together on the Reserve; and if it remain closed, they will wander idly about, and be a great nuisance to the settlers.\n\nThere is another matter besides the closing of the school that we wish to bring to your notice, and that is, that there is some person or persons here selling liquor to the Indians, and under the influence of it, they are gambling, quarrelling, and worse.\n\nIt is the great curse to those people, who would otherwise soon become self-supporting, and a credit to the efforts just made for their advancement.\n\nMr. Fox has been trying to keep liquor from them and help down gambling, and has had some success.\nSince the license was withheld here,\nwe have known Mr. So for some time, and believe him\nto be a very suitable person to take charge of the\nIndian School, as he has done good work and would\nsoon have some very fair scholars (some of them\nmaking good progress) if he were retained.\nTrusting that you will kindly give these matters\nyour attention. We are\n\nVery respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. S. McKenzie\nH.B. Beddome\n\n[Signatures]\n\nD. McKenzie\nJ. E. McKenzie\nJohn Edson\n\nMrs. H. Hawes\nMartin Hawes\nRosie Hawes\nWm. Allen\nMrs. M.

The average attendance for that quarter was 2.5 and for the whole year was only 3.7 and for the year previous, 1906, it was 4.3. The falling off in the attendance was sufficient reason for closing the school.\n\nThis school was previously closed from July 1, 1903 to December 30, 1905, for the same reason. The Agent in reporting on this school gives the number of children of school age as 16, but the teacher has never succeeded in having a better attendance than above mentioned.\n\nMr. Fox, the teacher, from the correspondence on file does not appear to be popular with the majority of the Indians and a petition for his dismissal reached the Department only yesterday, while a counter-petition for his retention was sent in by the white settlers in the district. Mr. Fox has been very active in the suppression of the liquor traffic and gambling, which no doubt accounts for his unpopularity with them. He is well spoken of by the Church of England Bishop of the\nthe diocese and the white settlers, but the fact remains that for the three years he has had charge of this school he has failed to secure an attendance that would justify the Department in continuing him in charge.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, February 5th, 1908.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nThe Accountant.\n\nWill you please let me know what jurisdiction, if any, the Winnipeg Office has over any portion of Western Ontario.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Winnipeg office has jurisdiction over the old Manitoba superintendency, which includes territory covered by Treaty No. 3. As part of this territory is in Ontario extending as far East in that Province as Sarnia, near Port Arthur, it will be seen that part of the Commissioner's jurisdiction does extend over western Ontario. He would have such powers in Indian Affairs in this territory as were given him at the re-organization in 1897. I am doubtful whether this includes the closing of Day Schools if in his opinion it becomes necessary. You will remember that Mr. Fox was the teacher whose complaints were investigated by Inspr. Ramsden the other day.\n\nAccountant.\nOttawa, February 13, 1908.\n\nSirs\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st inst., enclosing a petition, signed by a number of the Indians of the Eagle Lake reserve and citizens of Eagle River, asking for the removal of Mr. Fox, teacher of the Indian school on the reserve and in reply to state that the same will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

He appears to be bad tempered suspicious and vindictive and his zeal is not so much in the interests of sobriety as it appears to be at first glance.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nJohn Sutherland\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner\n\nWinnipeg\n\nManitoba.\n\nIf the main charge against Mr Fox had been proven I would have dismissed him at once as it is he seems to be the victim of a conspiracy in which outsiders have taken the chief part and he hasn't think to a month's notice. I have instructed the agent to notify him that his engagement at the school will close at the end of the March quarter.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir,\n\nIn accordance with your telegram of the 24th inst., I proceeded to Eagle Lake school and found that it had been closed for about two weeks because the Indians will not send their children while Mr. Fox the teacher is in charge.\n\nI found by the register that the average attendance for the first month would hardly equal one.\n\nLooking into the reasons for this it was found that the natives on the Reserve resent some interference which Mr. Fox had instituted in the campaign against drunkenness and immorality. It was impossible for me to find out the right and wrong of the situation in the brief space at my disposal. It was not clear to my mind that it was worth while. Probably there are wrongs on both sides. Mr. Fox has perhaps gone out of his way to represent trivial matters in very dark colors and the Indians on the other hand have entertained a dislike towards him which is out of proportion to the offense. One thing was clear to me and that is that Mr. Fox's usefulness in that place is gone for the present.\n\nI had with me copies of all the correspondence between the Indians and Agent McKenzie and read the same to the Band and they declared that these documents and petitions (which I believe are on file in your office) represented their sentiments.\n\nI further asked them if their attitude towards Mr. Fox had changed since the letters were written and they said no. They were decided in their position that they would not send their children while Mr. Fox was in charge.\n\nI frankly admit that I do not like the boycott. It is\nOttawa, April 6, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to Mr. Inspector Sermon's report on the Eagle Lake day school, dated February 29th, last, and your note thereon, in which you state that you instructed the Agent to notify Mr. Fox that his engagement at the school would close at the end of the March quarter, I beg to say that your action in this matter is approved.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nThe Hon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI was a teacher of the Eagle Lake Reserve Day School up till March 31st last, when it was closed by Mr. David twice since then 31st 1907. The cause he gave for closing it in Dec 31st last was small attendance of pupils.\n\nBut he reopened it on Jan 16th last, till June 30th next. He again closed it at the end of last quarter owing to non-attendance of pupils. And upon getting notice to this effect dated March 4th. I communicated with him direct stating the cause of non-attendance in February. And that I had reopened the school for the first week in March with a fair attendance; and told him, that I thought this should counteract the cause of closing the school which was non-attendance of pupils. But the cause he gave for refusing to hear it continued in operation was the attendance the last six quarters does not justify retaining you in the position of teacher thereof.\n\nI do not mind being removed from the said school for non-attendance of pupils. But I do not approve of my removal for the small attendance in the Quarter, when I plainly stated in the School Return the cause of the small attendance. I also do not approve of the means used to affect my removal by some of the higher element of Eagle River, the Dominion Field Commissioner, and Agent McKenzie indirectly.\n\nThe difference commenced in the fall\nfall of 1866. The following is a copy of Mr. Laird's letter to Bishop J. Lefebvre, which the Bishop sent me. It appears that Mr. Agent McKeague has reported directly to Ottawa about the matter and requested interference in the part of the teacher at Eagle Lake Bay School in matters having in connection with his duties.\n\nThe Indians in consequence with the removal of this teacher, and I am requested by the Department to consult with your Lordship with a view to obtaining a teacher who will perform himself these duties.\n\nThe Bishop sent me a copy of his letter to Mr. Laird in answer to the above. The following is a part. \"In reply to your letter of Nov. 27th, just received re. Eagle Lake Bay School. I have not heard anything about this matter. Mr. James Fox has been for some time in charge of this school, and has I believe always done what he thinks best for the Indians, who have always been a most dissatisfied lot.\"\n\nI then next get the following communication:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Fox,\n\nI enclose you Mr. Laird's letter in answer to mine. I think you will see from this that the trouble will be at an end for the time being anyway. Your Indians are certainly a queer lot, and not to be trusted. But you are quite right to reform them for their gambling and drinking which is really the whole root of the trouble.\n\nWishing you every blessing for Xmas and the New Year\n\nSincerely yours\n\nJ. Lefebvre\nBishop of Newhaven\"\n\n\"My Lord,\"\nI have your letter and enclosure (which is returned) from Mr. James Fox, from whom I have also heard directly.\n\nMr. Agent McKenzie writing to me on the 5th December says, \"Since the payments I have not heard any complaints from any of the Indians regarding the teacher, and think there is a truce between the Indians and teacher at the present time, as all appears to be going smoothly with them.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nK. Laird\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nMr. Agent McKenzie also sent me the following letter dated Dec. 28th, 1907. \"I suppose you have had a letter from the Bishop re an alleged report from me regarding the school. I may state that no such report was sent in this town my report on the Annuity Payments and the complaints of the several bands. I think the matter is now disposed of, and you need pay no attention to it any further.\"\n\nAt the time of the payments, Mr. Agent McKenzie told the few Indians who wish to have me removed that he saw no cause to effect my removal.\n\nAnd if Mr. Agent McKenzie is correct in his letter of Dec. 28th, it appears to me that some such report should be in the Annual Report. But I fail to see it there.\n\nEverything seems to have gone on fairly well till the end of December last, when I got notice from Mr. Laird closing the school. But the school was reopened as I have already stated, and matters going on fairly well. Tell Mr. Agent McKenzie...\ncame to the resort on January 31st last after dark. And held a meeting with the Indians without my knowledge, upon business I was interested in. He then came over to me, after this meeting. And when he left me, I learned from Constable A. Singleton, that Mr. Agent M'Kenzie asked him if the report is true, that I was making love with his wife. And it appears Mr. Singleton told him it was not, or words to this effect.\n\nAfter this visit of Mr. Agent M'Kenzie I had no attendance of police at school during the whole month of February.\n\nThen Mr. Inspector Summers, Agent M'Kenzie and Constable Sherman came on the 25th of February, when Mr. Agent M'Kenzie told me, he simply took down the statement of the Indians for my removal which they signed.\n\nBut I learned from Mr. Van Horn later that he does not recollect of the petition being read to the Indians.\n\nAnd the cause the Indians gave for wanting my removal was, that I was constantly making them feel uneasy about their drinking. But the petition as read to me by Mr. Agent M'Kenzie before Mr. Inspector Summers, did not read as Mr. Horn stated it to me. I also noted, that one man's name was on, who declared to me later, that he never signed the petition. That was drawn up on Jan 31st for my removal.\nOttawa, May 9, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. James Fox has written eleven pages of foolscap to the Minister in reference to the notice he received through the Agent at the instance of the Commissioner to the effect that his engagement as teacher at the Eagle Lake school would close at the end of the March quarter.\n\nThe correspondence on file shows that there was no other course open to the Commissioner than to dispense with his services, as the attendance at the school was going from bad to worse ever since he took charge. In January, 1905, when appointed to this school, there was an enrolment of 16, with an average of 8, which dwindled down to 2-3.\n\nMr. Inspector Simmons in his report on this school, dated Feb. 28, 1908, said that he proceeded to Eagle Lake and found the school closed for about two weeks, because the Indians would not send their children while Mr. Fox was in charge. He endeavored to arrive at the reasons for the falling off in attendance but was satisfied of one thing, which was made clear to him, that Mr. Fox's usefulness at this place was gone for the present. The Indians were decided on their position that\nthey would not send their children while Mr. Fox was in charge. The Inspector did not like the boycott, which appears like giving in to a dissatisfied and quarrelsome lot of Indians. On the other hand he states that Mr. Fox has manifested a spirit of fight which does not recommend him. He appears to be bad-tempered, suspicious and vindictive and his zeal is not so much in the interests of sobriety as it appears to be at the first glance.\n\nMr. Fox was not summarily dismissed. He received a month's notice that his services would be no longer required and the Department approved of the Commissioner's action.\n\nMr. Fox's letter above referred to gives no good reasons why his services should be retained. It is full of excuses, denials and charges against the Agent, which, I understand, have been enquired into.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nHon. Frank Oliver\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI have been expecting an answer to my letter of April 23rd last, with regard to Mr. Robert McKenzie and certain matters at Eagle Lake Reserve. But since I have failed even to get an answer from the Dept., I presume that they consider my letter not worth answering or the statements it contains are false.\n\nWhile on the other hand,\neverything that Mr. Agent McKenzie does, and says, is right and true.\n\nI have written the Agent and Commissioner David long enough about the Agent and the Eagle Lake Reserve, without making any impression what I wish to make known.\n\nAnd since Commissioner David did not give me a reasonable notice to close the school at Eagle Lake at the end of March last, kindly pay me for the June quarter.\nHoping to get the June quarter cheque in a few days.\n\nYours truly,\nJames Fox\nOttawa, July 31, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th inst., and in reply I beg to say that the Department cannot entertain your claim for payment of the June quarter's salary as teacher of the Eagle Lake school, as it was closed on March 31, last, and you were paid in full for that quarter, although the school was only open twenty-five days.\n\nReferring to your letter of April 23, last, I may say that the Department has taken steps for the suppression of the liquor traffic and gambling by the employment of a Dominion constable for that purpose.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJames Fox, Esq.,\nEagle River, Ont.\nEagle River, Ont.,\nAug. 12th. 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of July 31st last No. 145378 in reply to my letter of July 18th.\n\nI am quite aware of the fact that I only taught twenty-five days in the March quarter. But I would say the thirtysix days I did not teach was through no fault of mine.\n\nI am therefore of the opinion I should have been paid up to the end of June since Mr. Commissioner Laird gave me so short a notice.\n\nYours truly,\nJames Fox.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. James Fox, of 150 Pacific Avenue, Winnipeg, who at one time taught school on the Eagle Lake Indian Reserve, when leaving there about the 15th April 1908, stored his household goods consisting of Bedding, Clothing, Books, Cook Stove, Heater, Chairs, etc., in the Church of England Mission house, in which he had lived while teaching there, and the Councillor, Alex. Singleton, said he would see that they were protected. Mr. Fox says he has heard that Fishermen fishing on the lake, when going to Eagle River Station, pass through the reserve and use the Mission house as a stopping place, and that some of his goods have been taken away.\n\nI desire you to make enquiry into this, and find out whether Fishermen are stopping on the reserve, which may lead to liquor being conveyed there, and whether Mr. Fox's effects have been tampered with. It would also be well to instruct Alex. Singleton to see that the Mission house is not used by any unauthorized person. No outside person may camp or stay over night upon any Indian reserve without the consent of the Indian Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nRe: McKenzie Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th Instant No. 130.\n\nI beg to say that I have just seen Capt Johnston of the Dominion Fish Coy., and he informs me that there has not been any fishing done on the Eagle Lake this winter, and that Mr Fox story must be false. I have also seen Mr Gordon who is just up from Eagle River and he states that there is no road out from Eagle to the reserve, except a foot path and a very poor one at that, further he said that if anyone had been fishing on the lake he would have known of it.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I do not feel I would be justified in putting the Dept to the expense of a trip down there and a walk out 10 miles and back just to please Mr Fox? as he should look after his own goods in my opinion. I have however sent a message down to Alex Singleton, asking him to let me know all about this matter, and not to allow anyone to stop over night on the reserve, and if I get anything definite I will go down and see about it, I trust this will be found satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nHon.

He has offered to purchase the necessary materials and articles of furniture, including stove, pipe, etc., if the Department will guarantee him the grant of $100 when the school is completed.

George Price had offered to complete the same and purchase the necessary furniture, if the Department would guarantee him the grant of $100. In my reply to Mr. Agent McJulpy dated the 12th ultimo, I informed him that no expenditure in connection with this building could be authorized.\n\nThe Deputy of the\nDept.

Moreover, the Indians asked that a Teacher be sent to them as soon as possible, and that 30 lbs. of biscuit be required and the usual books and stationery.\n\nOwing to the fact that Mr. Agent Reddow never mentioned anything about this matter in preparing his Estimate for 1896-97, nothing was done by me in preparing the Estimates for this Superintendent, towards the completion of the School building, for the Teacher's salary, nor for the biscuit required, therefore I beg most respectfully to lay the matter before you for your consideration and decision.\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Prover. The building is a small one 16 x 16, covered with shingles and built of logs, good floor and ceiling, four windows of good size, two doors, three long benches, a table, box stove, no open fire place, a stair for the attic which is lighted by one small window. The lot is well enclosed with a good fence, there is a little garden in front of the building planted with different kinds of small seeds. The Indians seem anxious to have their children educated.\n--Copy--\nEagle River,\nOct 28th, 1898.\nThe Commr.of Indian Affairs.\n\nWinnipeg,\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to address you concerning the school on the Indian Reservation of Eagle Lake. We have been wishing to have a Teacher here for some time and as our former Agent told us whenever we had a school house built, the Government would supply us a teacher, I immediately set to work when I was elected councillor and put up a building as we were anxious to have our children taught. The house has been finished some time now and ready for occupation but no teacher has been supplied so I hope you will remedy this as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding the cost of the building, it cost me $130 (One hundred and thirty dollars) and as I had not the means myself, I applied to Mr. W.A. Reddome, Eagle River, who advanced me the wherewithal to put up the building. In the event therefore of the Government accepting the building the amount paid for it should be paid to the above mentioned Mr. W.A. Reddome.\n\nTrusting you will do as I request.\n\nI have the honour &c.,\nJoseph X Ookeyawkisig,\nmark Councillor.\n\nWitness:\nJohn Moar.\nEagle River.\nOct 25th. 1890.\n\nDear Mr. Archdeacon,\n\nYour favour of 26th. duly received.\n\nRegarding points mentioned on which the Government wish to be satisfied, I may state,-\n\n1. As far as I am aware there is no other claim against the School House. Your information regarding Mr. Prever and the Hudson's Bay Company having a claim is the first I have heard of it.\n\n2. That I ask payment on the grounds that I advanced to the Councillor who was putting up the building, materials such as shingles, sashes, etc., and also paid the men whom he had engaged working for him while building it.\n\n3. Regarding the question as to whether the Indian who built the house gives up all claim and acknowledges having been paid by me, the receipt I sent you in yesterday is a sufficient answer.\n\n4. As I evidently cannot get any more from the Government I will be willing to accept $100 as settlement of my claim.\n\nTrusting these answers will be satisfactory, I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\nW.A.

Richardson Esq M.P.\nWinnipeg\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you be kind enough to use your powerful M.P. influence in my behalf in a small matter?\n\nThis is how it is: - Indians travelling are allowed travelling expenses \"to a point, but not from a point.\" (Quotation from an official document.) And this travelling allowance is not paid until two years have passed from date of appointment. Now the authorities have ordered this school to be closed to June next; therefore I cannot put in two years. And moreover the appointment has been of so short duration that before I have cleared myself of expenses incurred in journeying here and in the purchase of a little clothing, I am ordered to move on. Add to this that Grassy Narrows is an outrageously expensive place to live in, and you will easily understand why what a hole I have tumbled. Under the circumstances I think I am justly entitled to my travelling expenses, both to and from Grassy Narrows, and as the whole amount for both journeys is under \u00a325 I hope you will see your way to providing my claims.\n\nI have just had a terrible winter. The house is unfinished; rain and wind come in at their own sweet will; the C.R.R. lost half.\nmy blankets for a while and I did not get them until January 18th! The Indians would do anything without being heavily paid for it. They ought to honestly feed guests, but these creatures refuse to bring in a diet without being given something - I have had to give them several biscuits and the agent tells me I shall have a fine for these - that comes in about once in two months, eight or ten Weekly To in a bundle - many thanks for your kindness in sending them, and the delicate way you sent the gift, I refer to the Govt. in the printed address. I felt half inclined to be a Govt. but I knew my own was not much valued by the Govt. I have reported one Indian for threatening me, trying to persuade my head and using loud (? abominable) language - I hope the authorities will take up the matter. Indians go frequently to Rat Portage, but they don't bother their heads about any mail. Supplies (goods) sent from Wis. were two months at Rat P. - and I the while living on bread and water.\n\nI shall therefore, will carry the $10 - I owe them $2 back $6 - when he has drawn my pay for quarter ending March 31st. The Indians &c could not be this opportunity - I forget to tell Mr. Smith about the $10 - please send him the money immediately - about 3 weeks after you receive this - All good wishes, &c. assure a long letter - Wishing you & the families all prosperity, &c. remains, Yours faithfully,\n\nEdward W.

Lys, teacher of the Indian school at Grassi Narrows near Rat Portage relative to a claim which he makes for travelling allowance, I have the honor to inform you that Mr Lys' quotation from an official document would not apply to his case as a travelling allowance is only to be made to teachers engaged by the Department from Ontario or other Eastern Provinces under written agreement and after two years satisfactory service, so that even if Mr Lys were to remain on for two years and give satisfaction, he would not, under the regulation above referred to be entitled to any allowance for travelling expenses. I may add that notwithstanding the hardships and disadvantages teachers in such unsettled districts have to contend with, such officers are easily obtained.\n\nBiscuits are supplied to these schools by the Department for issue to pupils at the rate of \u00bd lb a day by the teacher, who is held accountable for the entire quantity placed in his charge. Mr Lys is aware of this regulation and has referred to the shortage in the quarterly return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.L. Richardson, Esq M.P.,\nHouse of Commons\nOTTAWA\n\nDeputy Acting Supt Genl:\nof Indian Affairs:\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter, No. 147619, to Mr. Richardson, dated April 28th, 1897 (in my travelling expenses), allow me to say that I made the claim I did because I considered myself perfectly justified to make it. Some seven or eight years ago I was appointed teacher to the Black River Indian School, and my travelling expenses to that Reserve were paid without a protest. But I was not allowed return expenses, so my appointment to this place was annulled at the end of eight months or so by the closing of the school, & I imagined that I was entitled not only to my travelling expenses to Gracey Narrows but also from it. Touching biscuits, the Indians would not supply me with fuel unless I gave them something for the trouble; having nothing else to give, I gave them biscuits.\n\nWith regard to your plan aimed at Indian School teachers, I think I am not far wrong in stating that all government offices, from that of Premier down to scavengers and Indian School teachers, could be easily filled, and probably at less cost to the country. The rush for Indian School teachers proves the deplorable condition of Canada.\n\nIf you really take an interest in the welfare of the Indians, you will surely pardon me for giving you the results of a four-years' experience of Indian Schools. I shall make my remarks as brief as possible.\n\nI consider the plan of giving biscuits to the children pernicious. The Indians are thankless.\nthe white man is greatly benefited by the children going to school. Over and over again have parents come to me, begging for pork, flour or tea, and added, to soften my heart, that they would send their children to school regularly, if I would but accede to their request. If biscuits be given at all I think they ought to be bestowed upon those pupils who not only regularly attend, but work while in school.\n\nThere ought to be some kind of pressure brought upon the parents to compel them to send their children to school. As it now is it rests largely with the youngsters themselves whether they will attend or not. Some years ago I suggested to the Department that an aged couple should be paid to take charge of the children while their parents were away on hunting trips or other excursions; and the youngsters not allowed to join these expeditions. I received a hint for my zeal; and I expect a repetition of it in reply to this.\n\nThe books and lesson cards are utterly unsuited for Indian children; they take no interest whatever in them. Fancy explaining to an unintelligent Indian child, who knows nothing whatever of civilized life, such words as maps, cell, try the ot to get bed, full of the day, &c., &c. The youngsters take no interest whatever in the cards. But when I place before them a picture representing bears, wolves, canoes, and other creatures and things with which they are familiar, they become quite lively and chatter away as if they enjoyed the lesson. Then I can induce them to speak English.\n\nThe final question is a burning nuisance to the teacher; the Indians won't supply wood unless they are paid for it. Why could it not be insisted upon that if 40 cords of wood be not piled up near the school by the time the agent comes round to pay the twenty months' rent money would not be paid till next year? If this were made law, and the agent was firm in the matter, next time I came I would see for 40 cords of wood, the Indians would soon be brought to the point where they would be willing to pay.\nEXAMINED\nSCHOOL BRANCH,\n\nOTTAWA 24th June 1897\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo; and in reply I beg to say that your suggestions regarding Indian school matters will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Secretary\n\nMr Edward W.

Some of our people are obliged to leave in winter for a considerable time to provide for their living, the crossing of the English River also under unfavorable weather, is quite an obstacle for our small children, in the summer, to attend regularly to school. But we understand more today the benefit of the education, and promise a more regular attendance and to do our best in the future.\n\nWe are determined as in the past to fight against ministers and priests proposals, of sending our children far to any boarding school. Hoping that our request will be granted and we will have a favorable answer.\n\nWe beg to remain, Honorable Sir,\n\nYours gratefully,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nPost-Dept.

The last census return showed a total population of 38 of school age and that the majority of the band are Roman Catholics or pagans. The Department wishes to know whether these Indians are so situated that the children could attend school regularly. As you are aware the day schools in your agency have not in the past been a success and the Department must have full assurance in regard to attendance, etc., before taking any steps to re-open the school. In any event a new building would not be erected nor a residence for the teacher. If the school should be re-opened the old building would have to be fitted up for use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. S.

He is most anxious to secure some information in connection with the length of time he acted as school teacher for the Indian Department.

McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKemora, Ont.\nBishopstowe, Kenora, Ont.\nApril 29th, 1910.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have succeeded in getting a man for Islington, a Wycliffe student, Mr. Eley, who will go there for a year. He is a capable teacher and should be paid at the rate of $500.00 a year. Shall be glad to have your sanction for this, as he can come early in May. He has to come from Toronto. Will the Department pay his travelling expenses?\n\nJ. Keewatin.\nOttawa, May 6, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 29th ultimo, and in reply to that portion in which you refer to the Islington school I beg to say that the temporary engagement of Mr. Eley is approved. His salary will be at the rate of $500.00 a year for the time the school is kept open.\n\nThe Department regrets very much that exception cannot be made in the case of this school and the travelling expenses of the teacher paid. If, however, it would be any convenience to Your Lordship the salary due at the end of the current month will be paid immediately upon receipt of returns, and a second instalment will be paid at the end of the quarter, June 30th. These remarks also apply to the salary of Mr. Aldous at Lac Seul.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nKenora, Ont.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 6th inst.\n\nMr. Eley went down to Islington on the 19th inst. and would begin his work at once. We have not yet heard from him.\n\nRe travelling expenses. It seems to me rather hard. We cannot get men on the spot, and if they have to come from a distance we can hardly expect them to pay their own expenses. Mr. Eley's expenses from Toronto were nearly $30, and he had to remain here for ten days because there was no chance of getting down to Islington; this cost him at least $15, the same or nearly so will have to be found for his return, thus it will cost nearly $100. We cannot let him pay this, but if we are to get men into the schools the Diocese of Neewatin cannot afford to pay this, and unless the Department is willing to pay it in future we must refuse to engage men.\n\nMr. Aldous has said nothing about his expenses but it must have cost him fully $50, possibly more to get in to Lac Seul.\n\nBelieve me\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files, Volume 6030, File 130-3-1, part 1)\nSir;-\n\nI beg to enclose Quarterly returns of the Islington Day School.

Agencies.\nWinnipeg, June 4/90.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn letters recently received from our missionaries at Lac Seul, I find that there is a great need for more attention to the Indian schools. Some of them are without teachers for the greater part of the year. The two schools are distant about 3 miles from each other and it is quite impossible for the children, all of them, to attend either school.\n\nIf we had two schools the teacher would be unable to report a regular attendance more than 7 or 8 months in the year.\n\nI can secure the services of a teacher for say, three months to meet a great want at present in that mission and hope you will make the arrangements for the appointment of the same.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) R. Phair.\n\n6th June 1890.\n\nI beg in reply to your communication of the 4th inst. in regard to opening another school at Lac Seul for three months time during this summer to inform you that there are no funds available at present to meet this expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) A. McColl.\n\nThe Venerable Archdeacon Phair.\n\nWinnipeg.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward some correspondence which passed between the Venerable Archdeacon Phair, the old Winnipeg Indian Office and the Department in regard to the opening of a school for the summer months at Caroe River; the place is also called White Fish River, Trout Lake and Treaty point, situated within the Lac Saul Reserve. The school was opened two years ago for the September quarter upon a verbal authority given by the late Deputy of the Superintendent. The Department refused to authorize the same last year on the ground that there was no money available, and Ven. Archdeacon Phair has made an application for the same for this year, from the 1st of June to the 30th of September. The children who are expected to attend this school belong to Indians of the Lac Saul band who keep away from the reserve during the winter months and when on the reserve they reside six miles from the Lac Saul School proper. This latter school is kept open all the year round. The attendance at Caroe River School, if allowed to be opened, is expected to be large, as shown by the return for September quarter 1896 when it was first opened.\n\nI may add that a building has been erected at this point with Government assistance. If there is money available out of the general school vote, I would recommend the application being granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nImmediate\n\nOttawa, 27th May 1898\n\nMEMO:\n\nAccountant,\n\nAre there funds available for the work mentioned in letter December?\n\nH. Ross\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nHere are funds still needed.\nOttawa, 27th May, 1898.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 126/83 of the 16th instant, enclosing correspondence between the Venerable Archdeacon Paulin and the old Winnipeg Office in regard to the necessity for conducting a school at Cunce River, on the Lac Seul Reserve, from the 1st June to the 30th September.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the great necessity for this school and the fact that there is a building on the spot you may authorize that this school be conducted for the period mentioned, there being funds available to meet the expenses.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nA. R. Porter, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg,\nManitoba.\nSir,\n\nI beg to transmit herewith for your consideration, the return of Rev. Thos. H. Pritchard, teacher at the Lac Seul Day School, for the Quarter ending 31st December last.\n\nIn connection therewith I beg to say that thought I have signed the same, it seems to me very strange that he claims payment for said Quarter, as if I am well informed, according to an understanding between the Department and the Ven. Archdeacon Phair, the Lac Seul School on Treaty Point was to be kept in operation during June and September Quarters only. Moreover, as stated by Mr. Pritchard, the school was kept at the Mission, which is a mile across opposite Treaty Point, where the Lac Seul School house is situated, said Mission being outside the Reserve in the Territory of Keewatin, where most of the non-Treaty people reside.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. J. L. Arthur Leveque,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Hon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\nOTTAWA, 9th March, 1899\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt, through the office of the Indian Commissioner, of a copy of a letter from you, dated the 21st January, forwarding the Return for December quarter last from the teacher of the Lac Seul school at Treaty Point.\n\nReferring to your remark therein that you understood that the Lac Seul school at Treaty Point was to be kept in operation for the June and September quarters only, I beg to say that it was not the Treaty Point but the Canoe River school, taught by Mr Boardman to which a grant was to be allowed for this time, in addition to the usual grant to the other school at Treaty Point. It would appear, however, that the Canoe River school was not in operation during the June quarter, but was carried on for September and December quarters and that grant has been paid to it for that time. As, however, two quarters was the limit of time for which this extra grant was to be given, this school is entitled to nothing further on account of salary.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nL.J.A. Leveque, Esq\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nNat Portage, Man., Secretary\nOffice of the Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n\nRAT PORTAGE INSPECTORATE,\n\nRat Portage, Ont., MAR 20, 1899\n\nReference letter, No. 117897 of the 9th instant.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter above quoted, relative to the returns for the December Quarter from the Lac Seul at Treaty Point; and stating that it was not the Treaty Point, but the Canoe River School taught by Mr. Boardman to which a grant was to be made for June and September Quarters.\n\nIn this connection I beg respectfully to remark that this contention must be an error, and surely there is some misunderstanding in the arrangement of this matter. At the time the Indians\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nundertook the erection of a School-house on the Canoe River some three years ago; it was stipulated then that that School was to be the permanent one, and the School at Treaty Point commonly known as Lac Saul School was to be kept in operation during the migration of the White Fish River, and Trout Lake Indians, say June and September quarters at the time they camped at Treaty Point for the receipt of their annuities and their departure for their winter hunt.\n\nSo much so was this understanding that upon the completion of the building at Canoe River in September 1897, the teacher of the Lac Saul School, the Rev Mr. Hitchcock opened the new School and taught there during December Quarter '97, March and June '98, and on the appointment of Mr. Boardman as teacher to the Canoe River School, the Rev. Hitchcock opened the Treaty Point School for the accommodation of the White Fish and Trout Lake Indians during their stage at\nAt Treaty Point; and upon their migration last fall to their winter quarters he opened a School at the Mission across the Bay on the Kawatina Territory as stated in my letter of the 31st January last, enclosing his return for December Quarter. I may say here that upon the receipt of said return I informed Mr. Pitchard that although I had signed his return I was apprehensive of some difficulty in regard its payment, owing to the arrangement arrived at between the New Archdeacon Plain and the then Indian Commissioner, that the Treaty Point School was to be opened only during June and September Quarters in each year, but regret to say that he seems to ignore such arrangement, as I am informed by him in a letter dated the 7th ultimo that he is still teaching School at the Mission for the benefit of the two or three Indian children there, the other pupils seven or eight being non-treaty half-breeds, who without an\nauthority shall be in the discretion supplied by the Department for Indians children who attend School.\n\nI may say that in my opinion Carrot River is the proper place for a School for the half breed Indians who remains on the reserve, there is a good settlement at that point and sufficient children for a good attendance, the average daily attendance at present being over 18 pupils whereas during the winter months and spring there is no children either at Treaty Point or its vicinity to attend School, thus the reason for its removal to the mission house for the accommodation of the half breed children living near the Mission.\n\nI may further state for your information that Mr. Boardman having on account of some personal disagreement with Rev. Mr. Pritchard sent his resignation as teacher of the Cause River School to take effect at the end of December Quarter, Mr. A.R.J. Barnaby.\nThe former teacher at Lac Seul made an application for the position and upon the approval of the C.M.S. Secretary the same was confirmed by the Indian Commissioners on the 11th January last.\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools\n\nH. Arthur [signature]\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nSept. 13th, 1899.\n\nJ.R. Lash Esq.\nSecretary to the Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn behalf of the Indians residing in the neighborhood of the Treaty Point School, Lac Seul Reservation, I beg to make application that this school should be kept open during the coming winter, or at least till the end of the next quarter, Dec 31st, 1899. While a number of the Indians who reside on the reserve during the summer months will leave as usual on the approach of winter for their hunting grounds I am able to confidently state that it will be an easy matter to procure an average of at least ten children during the winter months, and of course more as soon as navigation opens, so I think in the interests of this school it would be well to keep it open as long as we can procure a fairly good average daily attendance.\n\nHoping you may see your way to granting our request,\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) Thos. H. Pritchard.\n(Missionary and Teacher)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit a copy of an application from Rev. Mr. Pritchard of Lac Seul Mission to have the Treaty Point School kept open until December 31st. next, and beg to recommend same since it appears that it is in the interest of said school. This school in the past had been authorized to be open for four months in the year - June - September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary to the Indian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 23rd September, 1899.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant enclosing a copy of an application from Rev. Mr Pritchard of Lac Saul Mission to have the Treaty Point school kept open until the 31st December next; and in reply I beg to say that, under the circumstances, the Department approves of this being done.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nHas there ever been any correspondence in reference to the establishment of a Boarding School at Fort Smith? \n\nSchool Board \n20.10.05\nOttawa, February 3rd, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department regrets very much that Your Lordship's letter of November 22nd, last, in reference to day schools at Lac Seul and Islington was inadvertently overlooked.\n\nThe Department is fully cognizant of the existing conditions on these reserves and appreciates the difficulty of conducting permanent day schools. Your Lordship's suggestion that teachers be sent in to these two points to work among the Indians during the summer months meets with approval, and, if it is possible to secure the services of energetic, interested young men or women, there is no doubt that much good can be accomplished.\n\nIt is realized that summer schools are not and cannot be as efficient in respect to class-room work as those conducted throughout the whole year, but on these reserves an enthusiastic teacher would find much scope for his or her efforts among the Indians themselves. In fact, the Department would be disposed under present conditions to lay more stress upon this feature than upon the class-room work.\n\nThe Department would like to see effected some improvement in the method of living among these people. Something might be done towards improving sanitary conditions and inculcating habits of cleanliness; and if, in\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nRenfrew, Ont.\naddition to this, instruction in plain cooking and the home treatment of common ailments could be given, the benefit to the Indians would be of inestimable value. The Department in suggesting this line of work is speaking in the light of recent experience. On one reserve in Saskatchewan a trained nurse and qualified teacher was placed in charge in September last, of a school conducted under the auspices of the Church of England, and, in the short time that has elapsed, the results achieved have even exceeded the expectations of the Department. This is not an isolated case. On other reserves in the west and in British Columbia splendid success along these lines is being met with. The Department is of opinion that if Your Lordship could obtain the services of nurses who would be willing to undertake this and the school work for a few months during the summer that the interests of the Indians would be better served than by the appointment of male students, whose attention would be given principally to the school work. To such persons the Department would be willing to pay salaries of $50.00 a month.\n\nHowever, if not found practicable to carry out this suggestion, the Department will be glad to have you nominate two student workers, who will be paid at the rate of $500.00 per year. In this event very much will depend upon the character of those engaged. Perfunctory service will not be productive of the desired results, but Your Lordship's varied experience in Indian work and knowledge of the necessary requirements will enable you to make fitting selections.\n\nThe Department will be glad to hear from Your Lordship at an early date in regard to the proposition above stated.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant\n\nSecretary.\nMarch 4th /10\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of Feb 3rd Re schools at Lac Seul and Islington.\n\nI am most anxious to see a general improvement amongst our Indians but the conditions in this section of the country are so entirely different to Saskatchewan and British Columbia that we simply cannot follow their plans or expect the same results. We could not, in fact I would not send a nurse to either Lac Seul or Islington, unless we had a man whose wife was a nurse, and unless the Dept was prepared to spend $1000 over a house etc for them as well as pay them $1000 a year Salary.\n\nI am willing to assist the Dept to the full extent of my power, but at the same time I am also sure that nothing but Boarding schools will ever do any real and lasting good on the Reserves in this District.\n\nI have the offer of a man for Lac Seul, a Mr F. Aldous, he was for some fifteen months at the St Paul's Mission, Macleod, is a capable teacher, and strongly recommended by the Rev G.B. Gale. He would I think do good work.\n\n1st. Will the Dept appoint him? at $500 a year.\n\n2nd What can be done about fixing up the school, getting school materials etc. There has been no school at Lac Seul for years, and I do not know in what state the school is or even if it is fit to use.\n\n3rd Where can the school teacher live? The Mission is nearly three miles\naway, across the lake, and at times in both Summer and Winter there is no getting across.\n\nI am going out to Lac Seul for Easter and then could make some arrangements if you will kindly let me know what the Dept will do.\n\nI am hopeful that in a very short time we may be able to arrange for a teacher for Islington. Here a man could live in the Mission House which is not occupied, and which is not too far from the school.\n\nBelieve me\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 8th, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 4th instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher at Lac Ste. Anne, in which you state that you have an application from Mr. F. Aldous, formerly teacher at the Blood (C.E.) Boarding School, for the position.\n\nIn reply to Your Lordship's inquiries I beg to say that the Department will pay Mr. Aldous a salary of $500.00 a year and will make any necessary repairs to the building, which has not been in use for sometime. The necessary school material will also be supplied.\n\nA report from Your Lordship upon the conditions as you find them when you visit the reserve at the coming Easter and any recommendations that you may wish to make with regard to the building and the best means of having repairs made will be gladly received.\n\nA further communication in reference to the appointment of a teacher for Islington will be awaited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nKenora, Ont.\nTo the Secretary,\n\nDept of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI returned from Lac Seul last week, found the Indians well, and greatly delighted at the prospect of the school being opened again.\n\nThe school building is in fairly good shape with the exception of some of the window panes being broken, and there being no stove.\n\nMr Aldous has left Toronto for Lac Seul, and trust he will get in there shortly, though he may be somewhat delayed owing to the early Spring. I have asked him to purchase a stove and take in with him, and to replace the glass. There may be a few other necessary repairs to do, but Mr Sanderson our Missionary will see that the school is made fit for use, and will send in charges to me to forward you.\n\nThere is little or no school material, will you kindly send in a full supply, including Register etc. Please address Rev M. Sanderson, Lac Seul via Superior Junction, Ont. I trust this will be sent as soon as possible.\n\nBelieve me\n\nsincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, April 18, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 11th instant.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department is glad to learn that the Indians of Lac Seul are pleased at the prospects of their school being re-opened. The accounts for the necessary repairs to the school building and the stove will be paid upon presentation and a requisition for a supply of stationery has been forwarded today to the Government Stationery Office. Should Mr. Aldous require further supplies of any particular kind he will be good enough to ask for them, but these will enable him to commence his work.\n\nI have the honour to be Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

A fuller report from you dealing generally with your work in this field will be very gladly received.\n\nIn regard to the biscuits I may say that your previous request apparently did not reach the Department as no record of it can be found. You will be good enough to state what authority, if any, you had for the purchase from the Hudson Bay people and also the price that you are paying for their biscuits. Owing to the fact that this school has been closed for sometime no biscuits have been supplied by the Department during the past two years and as soon as the information above asked for is received it will be decided whether a supply will be sent in to you or whether the present arrangement may be continued.

We have now the machinery that 2 brewhouses per day produce an excellent beer so I propose to barrel some of the current day's crop. The price is $3.00 per 100 lbs.\n\nSince then all the barley was used up, they not having more I bought 50 lbs from the place. I have about 20 lbs on hand when used up I will be able to procure Barley from the C.B. as they have a good stock.\n\nI hope it will be possible to keep the school open all the year. When I find that the number likely to attend...\nwill not warrant the school being kept open until immediately notify you. What would you consider a minimum number?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank H. Alden\n\nTo: The Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nP.S. I find the children here with 3 exceptions have had no schooling whatever. We method I adopt for teaching English is a modified Beatty system in which I am familiar they have used with success. The children show great aptitude for this latter which is rather unusual. Their natural shyness and fear of ridicule makes it a difficult matter to teach them to talk in English. To do this I use the blackboard draw them on interesting pictures when they are just beginning to describe. I have had poor\nsuccess in drilling & physical exercise generally will be of great benefit to the children both in the matter of health & discipline. They are the healthiest lot of Indian children I have yet had to do with.\n\nC.\nExtract from remarks of teacher on quarterly return for the Canoe River (Lac Seul) school for the quarter ended June 30, 1910.\n\nI opened the school at the house of the Rev. Mr. Sanderson at Lac Seul on the 2nd May. I had there besides the Treaty Indians shown on the Register a number of Non-Treaty Indians and half-breeds, these I have not put on the Register. On the return of the Canoe River Indians to Canoe River I moved to that place on 23rd May, 1910, and have averaged 13.27. This I consider very satisfactory. I am trying to find out how many children I can rely on for the winter and will let you know and then you can let me know if it is worth while keeping the school open all winter or not.\n\nShould you decide to keep open all winter the school-house will require a good heating stove and pipes (there being none) and the teacher's house will require a small cooking stove and heater, the stove I am now using is loaned me by an Indian.\n\nI found no articles such as are enumerated in the list on the back of this and should welcome a complete outfit, all the articles for the children's cooking, etc., I have so far supplied myself. I consider good progress has been made. The children are well behaved and fairly clean and healthy. The great drawback is the way they are always moving, making it hard for the children to get to school. I have a very good drill class and the children are very fond of drill and physical culture.\n\n(Signed) Frank H. Aldous,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, August 19, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in reference to your work as teacher of the Lac Seul school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to see that you have met with a fair measure of success.\n\nIn reference to your inquiry as to what would be the minimum number of pupils which would warrant the Department in keeping the school open the year round I beg to say that it is thought that the average should not drop below that which you have been able to secure during the summer months.

His school seems to be very successful and he is greatly encouraged. I would propose that this school be kept open for the winter, at least for one year, as Mr Aldous rightly says, his work will be thrown away if the school is now closed. His average is good and he thinks there would be no difficulty in keeping this up.\n\nMr Aldous has also been giving the children tea and a good meal at least on Fridays. This he has done out of his own supply, and he simply cannot afford it. Could the Department help him at all in this?\n\nThere is every prospect of this being a very good school, and Mr Avis the best teacher we have ever had, but not more than 1/10 of the children are or can be reached.\n\nJ.

These supplies are to furnish a simple mid-day meal for the pupils of the school to supplement the lunches brought by them from home. The average attendance at this school has been thirteen and it is not expected that it will be any higher during the winter. A few simple cooking utensils for the purpose of serving this meal will be necessary and you may purchase them at the same time. All these goods can then be sent in by rail to the reserve.\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop will be requested to have all returns, vouchers, etc., in connection with this school forwarded through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

Aldous,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, January 20, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of September 26th, last, in which you were authorized to purchase from the Hudson's Bay Co., Winnipeg, a limited quantity of certain supplies to provide a simple lunch for the children attending the Lac Seul day school.\n\nIn this connection I may say that the accounts which have just come to hand show an expenditure of approximately $132.60, which, taking into consideration the small average attendance, should be sufficient to provide a simple mid-day meal, such as the Department contemplated, for more than two years. Included with these supplies is 100 pounds of rolled oats. The Department would like to know what these are to be used for. As you were advised in official letter of September 26th, last, the object of the Department in furnishing these supplies was to supplement the lunches brought by the children from their homes and, in view of this fact, it is considered that some explanation is necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. S. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th instant, No.117897, I beg leave to say that this school was re-opened without me knowing anything about it, and has been solely under the orders of His Lordship Bishop Loftus, I have never received any returns from this school, whatever, and the only accounts I have received has been from His Lordship. Although you told me in your letter of the 26th sept last, that all returns and accounts was to be sent through this office.\n\nWith reference to the purchase of the supplies for the school, from the Hudson Bay Co., I may say that I had a talk with His Lordship, and the articles purchased was as he directed, the rolled oats, was supposed to be for to make porridge for the children, and had I purchased all and every thing that was asked for the bill would have been much larger than it is.\n\nI regret if I have over-stepped the mark in this matter, but would say that I done the best I could under the circumstances, and cut down the bill quite an amount, I may say that the teacher out there in my opinion has an idea that he can just purchase all and every thing he likes, I see the amount of biscuits he has made use off in exorbitant, and something should be done to put a stop to his expenditure, I feel this is also the opinion of His Lordship.\n\nI regret that I am unable to give any more information on this subject at present, but will look into the matter when next I visit that Reserve; I trust this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nThe Secretary:\nDept of Indian Affairs:\nOttawa,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, January 31, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department considers the supplies provided for the Lac Seul day school, taking into consideration the small attendance, were altogether excessive. The teacher is being written to by this mail and also the Bishop and advised that the greatest economy must be exercised in the distribution. In future no accounts for any supplies whatever purchased without authority will be paid. All returns and accounts will also have to be forwarded to the Department through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. G. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, January 31, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nAn account received by the Department for supplies furnished the Lac Seul day school shows that the quantities of some of the articles purchased were excessive and other articles were purchased for which no authority was granted.\n\nIt was only the intention of the Department to provide at this school a simple mid-day meal to supplement the lunches brought by the children from their homes and taking other schools in which this system is in operation, of which there are many, as standards the supplies purchased for this school should be sufficient to last for more than two years, taking into consideration the attendance. The accounts have, however, been paid and the teacher is being written to direct and informed that the greatest economy must be exercised in the distribution of these supplies. In future no purchases for this school either in the way of equipment or otherwise should be made without the consent of the Department and accounts for authorized purchases as well as all returns from the school should be forwarded through the office of the Indian Agent.

It is noted that an expenditure of $152.60 was incurred. The object of the Department was only to supply a simple meal to supplement the lunches brought from home by the children and taking other schools in which similar meals are provided, of which there are many, as standards these supplies should be sufficient to last the Lac Seul school for some two years, taking into consideration the attendance. The Department will expect you to exercise the greatest discretion in distributing these supplies.\n\nYou will be good enough to forward through the Indian Agent at your earliest convenience a report showing approximately the amount of the supplies used by the end of January and the number of meals served. These reports will be required at the end of each month hereafter.\n\nI have also to inform you that no purchases must be made without the authority of the Department and all returns should be forwarded through the office of the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrank H.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. S. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nTo the Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Rev L.C. Banks has been appointed Missionary at Lac Seul Reserve in place of the Rev M. Sanderson.\n\nFor many years there has been no school at Lac Seul, and it is one of the largest Missions in this District. There are I believe over 100 children of school age on the Reserve. The Dept promised some time ago to establish a Boarding school there, but nothing has been done.\n\nI should be very glad if the Dept would place Mr. Banks on their list of school teachers, giving him the Grant of $500.00 a year. He is a fully qualified teacher, being a graduate of Wycliffe College Toronto.\n\nHe has been teaching school since he went in there in May last.\n\nBelieve me Sincerely Yours.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishopstowe.\nKenora, Ont.\nOct 5th 1912.\nOttawa, October 9, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 5th instant stating that the Rev. L. O. Banks, who has been appointed missionary at Lac Seul, has been teaching the school at that place since the first of May, last, and asking the Department to make a grant of $500.00 a year for the teacher's salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is glad to learn that the school is now in operation and will accede to Your Lordship's request and allow a salary at the rate above mentioned from the first of July, last.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nKenora, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI thank you for yours of the 9th inst re appointment of the Rev L.C. Banks as school teacher at Lac Seul.\n\nI think and trust that Mr. Banks will be able to keep on this school during the Winter, but it is a difficult matter as the school is across the Lake from the Mission, and not at all easy to get to. Am writing to Mr. Banks on this matter.\n\nMay I be allowed to say that I am very anxious about this place. The Indian Agent here informs me there are over 100 children on this Reserve of school age, and that the only way of getting them into a school is by building a Boarding school. The Department have promised this for the past three years, but nothing has been done.\n\nThere is certainly more need for a Boarding school at this place than any other Indian Mission I know in the whole country. The Roman Catholics have Boarding schools on Reserves with less than half the numbers of Indians, and are seeking to get some of our children.\nWe are very anxious to see the school at Lac Seul restarted, and there is very great need for it, there being a very large number of Indians on this Reserve. It may be a difficult thing to get the children together for the Indians are going much further away in their hunting than formerly, but think we may be able to get a fair average.\n\nThe Rev F. Eley is now Missionary at Lac Seul, and doing very good work, he is quite willing to try the school if the Dept. will reopen it. I have therefore much pleasure in recommending his appointment at the usual Salary of $500. a year.\n\nThere would need to be a complete outfit sent into Lac Seul Desks etc., as there is nothing whatever there for the school, except bare walls. It would also be well to ask the Agent to insist upon the Indians providing firewood for the school as otherwise it would be impossible to carry it on in the Winter.\n\nI remain\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJUL 5 1915\nOttawa, July 12, 1915.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 25th ultimo recommending the re-opening of the day school at Lac Seul.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it is not in a position to carry out Your Lordship's recommendation this year.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nKenora, Ont.\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esquire,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am glad to be back to the office to do what work awaits me, from time to time.\n\nDuring the latter part of my superintendency of this \"Lake of the Woods Inspectorate\", I have had before me, and have endeavoured to gain the approval of the Department for certain new features of our work which would certainly result in benefit to the Indian people and their children.\n\nMy thought has centered on three things as follows:\n\n1. The building of a Boarding School at Pine Portage (old name) or Rolling Portage as it is now named since it became a Post Office. This for the accommodation of some of the many children of that locality, who have not had any advantage of that sort, either in day school or any other school for the last few years.\n\nI do not feel that I could leave this field of duty without once more calling the attention of the Department to the great need for carrying out these suggestions which appear to me to have good substantial reasons behind them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Semmens,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nNovember 22nd, 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Semmens,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of November 18th, and am glad that you are able to be back at the office. I have noted the suggestions you make, and have to say that I will give careful consideration to your recommendations.\n\nYours very truly,\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J.

Mr Sanderson took up the work in September, and we are most desirous that he should open an Indian Day School as soon as possible.\n\nWe have recently received a letter from Mr Sanderson asking for information as to supplies for a School, and we should be greatly obliged if you could advise us as to the necessary procedure in securing these supplies.\n\nFurther we would respectfully request that a full school grant be made for the work, and if such can be done, that the same be paid to us at this office.\n\nThe Rev M.Sanderson is particularly fitted for the work at Lac Seul on account of his knowledge of the people and his wide experience. He was formerly for a number of years in charge of the mission at Lac Seul, and returned to us after doing excellent work on the Peguis Reserve in Manitoba. We trust that in the near future it may be possible for with such a man in charge to considerably advance the educational facilities for the Indian children in that District.\n\nHoping to hear from you as soon as possible, I am,\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(Signed) J.Jofthouse.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a letter received from Rev. Canon Lofthouse which speaks for itself.\n\nI consider a School is needed very badly at Lac School as the children from that and other adjoining Reserves do not get any education, and the Indians will not send their children to the Shoal Lake or Kenora School owing to the distance, and the fact that these Indians never come to Kenora.\n\nI know Mr Sanderson, who is the best person that could be got for the position, he has the confidence of both the Indians and the White people.\n\nWe would have preferred a Boarding School, but the Canon says funds will not run to it yet, however he says there are enough children who will be able to attend the School to make it a good proposition.\n\nThere were two schools on the Reserve, but one was pulled down last winter getting rotten and the other is in very much the same state, but there is a building on the Mission property which no doubt Mr Sanderson intends using.\nI do not know the procedure in these cases, and so ask your advice as to what information you require in this connection.\n\nCanon Lefthouse has written me a personal note asking that I use my influence to get as good a grant as possible for the School work at Lac Seul, and he thinks they should get a grant of not less than $600.\n\nAs regards the supplies he presumes these would be sent direct.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending that something be done if possible for these Indians as I have lived amongst them and know their needs so well.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 16, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 10th instant, enclosing copy of letter from the Rev. Canon Lofthouse, both referring to the re-opening of the Lac Seul day school. I have noted that you consider a school is badly needed at this point, but the Department is desirous of more information before authorising the commencement of any teaching activities.\n\nConcerning a suitable location, I have noted that you are of the opinion that it is the intention to use a building on the mission property. If the school that still remains on the reserve is not fit for occupation, the Department would be pleased to receive more information concerning this church building to which you have referred. Would the Missionary authorities expect a rental if we held school on their property?\n\nHas the Department any equipment on the reserve for school purposes, such as desks, black-boards, texts, etc., that could be used at this time? The procedure in getting school supplies is to have the teacher requisition to the Indian agent, on the form for that purpose. This would be forwarded by you to the Department.\n\nThe Department also desires to learn something of the qualifications of the Rev. M. Sanderson, who is nominated by the Rev. Canon Lofthouse, as Teacher. It is the intention of the Department to secure the services of teachers that are properly qualified, if at all possible. The salary that is allowed is commensurate with the qualifications of the teacher employed and the success of the school. When you\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nhave replied to these questions and given the Department further information, we will be in a position to intimate our intention in connection with the re-opening of the Lac Seul Indian day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant No. 130-4-1, re proposed school at Lac Seul.\n\nRe location, Canon Lefthouse informs me that he believes Mr Sanderson intends using the building on the Mission property instead of the old School house on the Reserve, as it will be just as convenient for the Indians, in fact more so, for the Treaty No 9 Indians who are living close to the Mission house, since it is quite close to Mr Sanderson house, and if the Department gives a good grant there will be no rent charged for the building, if a rent is charged it will only be a nominal one of a few dollars per month.\n\nThe proposed building is a log building, that was built for the Mission by the Indians about 1913.\n\nThe School House on the Reserve could be made suitable if some money was spent on it for windows, roof, and plastering but I am of the opinion that the Mission building would be the best.\n\nAccording to a letter on file here there was in 1913 7 desks, Table, Chair, Globe, Teachers desk and Stove,\nand other articles of stationery left with Councillor James Bunting at Frenchman's Head Band. I cannot find any record of what was done with the Lac Seul School articles.\n\nWe have written to Mr Sanderson to visit the Schools and the Chief, and find out what is of use and let me know as it is impossible to get up to the Reserves at the present time. Then if a school is decided upon, we can get him to requisition for school supplies needed.\n\nMr Sanderson was in charge of the Indian Mission and School at Peguis where they had a grant, and the Arch Bishop promised Canon Lefthouse that he would apply to have the grant transferred to Lac Seul with Mr Sanderson, perhaps you have some record of this.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa about the 12th or 13th December and hope to have the pleasure of meeting you and discussing several questions as to the Indian Schools and education with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edward,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq.,\nSupt of Indian Education.\nOttawa.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, Nov. 29, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 28th instant, concerning the proposed re-opening of the Lac Seul Indian Day School. I have noted that you believe it is advisable to use the church property rather than our old school building; I am of the opinion that if we gave a grant of $600.00 we would not be expected to pay rental.\n\nI have looked up the record of the Reverend Sanderson, and I find that he gave good service in Manitoba in connection with our work, and the Department would agree to his appointment as teacher if we decide to open the school.\n\nIf you will make definite inquiries as to the exact amount of school equipment available, we will discuss the re-opening of the Lac Seul school in January, during your visit to Ottawa on December 12th or 13th. I will make arrangements to be in my office on those days and will be glad to have you take the matter up with me personally. We will then be in a position to make a recommendation to the Deputy Minister.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nReferring to previous correspondence rea School at Lac Seul.\n\nI have received a letter from Revd M. Sanderson asking me to send him about a dozen books, primers and No 1 Books, Nos 1 and 2 Copy Books, a few scribblers and some ink and ink well. As he has rigged up a room inside the house that will accommodate the few children there are about the Reserve for the present time. He would also like a few biscuits.\n\nIf the Department considers it advisable, he would do what he can to teach the few children around, but in my opinion a day school would be of very little use as the children will not be staying in one place long enough to take advantage of what they may be taught, and I think it a waste of time and energy until we get a Boarding school started, but as he asks for so little this might be sent him and I will discuss the matter further with him at Treaty time.\n\nIf the Department considers sending him these supplies, they could be shipped direct to\n\nRevd M Sanderson,\nLac Seul Reserve,\nHudson Station,\nRolling Portage, P.O.\nOntario.\n\nI shall be glad to hear what the Department's decision is in this case.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secy,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent,\nOTTAWA, May 12th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, concerning the re-opening of a school at Lac Seul by the Rev. M. Sanderson. It is noted that he has fitted up a room in the mission house sufficient to provide accommodation for the few Indian children on the reserve at the present time. We are requesting the Government Stationery Office to forward the books, scribblers, etc., asked for, but we are not prepared to send in any biscuits at the present time.\n\nWe agree with you that there is very little use in starting a day school at this point, as the children do not remain on the reserve long enough to receive any great benefit. Before we can definitely decide the providing of a grant towards salary, we will await your further report when you visit this school at Treaty time. You should state the number of children in attendance, or that will be likely to attend, the accommodation that has been provided, and whether you would recommend that this school be continued. As soon as this information is received, we will decide as to the amount of salary that can be allowed. Returns should be forwarded by Mr. Sanderson at the end of June, showing the attendance, days taught, etc.\n\nIf this school is continued, could arrangements be made to carry on the work in the mission house and, if so, would any further equipment be required, or any rental charged, and the amount of same?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find returns from the Day School started by Rev M. Sanderson for the quarters ending 30th June and 30th September.\n\nThe majority of the children are by White fathers but there are quite a number of Indian children that attended the school.\n\nSchool was held in the principal's own place, and the pupils were taken from the Indians' families living all summer close to the Hudson's Bay Company Post and the Mission.\n\nNo arrangements were made as to what salary Mr Sanderson should receive, but I may state he is a very great benefit to the Indians and the Bishop has decided to have him live in Kenora so that he will be able to visit the Indians on the Lake of the Woods and also those Reserves along the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railways. He is now at Islington Reserve for the week end visiting the Indians and holding services there.\n\nHe has asked that the Department send the salary to him in my care at Kenora.\n\nRev Sanderson is a very clever and capable Indian and he has informed me he has written his Agent as he now desires to get out of Treaty.\n\nShould the Department desire it he will no doubt open a school at the same place next summer and will have more pupils.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, October 16th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing returns showing the attendance, days taught, etc., in the day school conducted by Rev. M. Sanderson at Lac Seul during the past summer.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that these returns show that Mr. Sanderson had this school open 105 days. He is being allowed salary at the rate of $600 per annum, and a cheque for $315.00, being the amount due at the above rate covering the days taught, is being sent him in your care. The above amount is in full payment of salary due, and to cover the cost of any rental or building used for school purposes.\n\nIf Mr. Sanderson intends to conduct a school next summer at Lac Seul, he should forward a request through your office stating the date he intends to commence duties and full particulars as to where the school will be conducted and receive the authority of the Department before undertaking the work. He should also state approximately the number of Indian children who would attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

He is, therefore, entitled to only 65 days' salary.\n\nA cheque for $315.00 was sent to you for Mr. Sanderson on the 16th instant, and it is noted from your letter of the 20th that you will return this cheque as soon as you receive it.

I am glad to hear that Mr. Murray has been appointed to the position of Inspector of Indian Affairs in your district. It is a great honour to be appointed to such an important position.\n\nI understand that Mr. Murray has been working hard to improve the conditions of the Indians in your district. I am confident that he will be able to make a positive impact.\n\nI am also pleased to hear that Mr. Murray has been working closely with the local authorities to ensure that the laws are being enforced properly.

Mr. he has been taking it on to the Reserve and that it is used freely by both himself and wife. And I have to deeply regret that such firms should ever be employed to teach the young and ignorant. A good example is, I may safely say, an essential thing among such a people, and drink has long been known as the greatest drawback toward the civilization of such races; therefore I believe that a teacher should be a temperate and industrious person. And it is a great pity that the services of one who, even educationally speaking, has never been a success, should be retained, when numbers can be found who would rather a far deeper interest in the advancement of such an unenlightened race. Mr. Indian Agent, but myself, is very anxious to see the school prosper and has written to me, stating that he would be glad to see a firm with more energy take charge of the school. I trust you will not think this letter too hasty or written under the impulse of a moment. My statements are by no means in exaggeration of what do really exist. It is the wish of one, who, for the past ten years, has been taken a deep interest in both the temporal as well as the spiritual welfare of the Indians, to do all within his power to improve their condition and in so doing present a few facts for your kind consideration.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGeo Brewer\n\nMissionary (C.E.) for the Warpon District. C.P.R.\nDear Sir,\n\nUpon the Minister being informed of the good work which you had done in suppressing the liquor traffic among the Indians at Rat Portage, he directed that the thanks of the Department should be conveyed to you, and that you should be highly commended for your services.\n\nI may say that it gives me much pleasure to carry out the Minister's directions, and I sincerely hope that you have been able to bring about as good results at Selkirk as you did at Rat Portage.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRat Portage, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant. I am taking steps to have enquiry made respecting the conduct of the teacher upon the Wabigoon Reserve, and I need hardly tell you that the Department will not countenance any such conduct as that with which he is charged, for it is well aware that one of the essentials for such a position as he holds is temperate habits.\n\nI am pleased to note your commendation of the action of Mr. Murphy, whom the Department despatched to Rat Portage with a view to putting a stop to the traffic in liquor among the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Supt.

George Prewer, a missionary in the Wabigoon district, informs the Department that the teacher employed upon the Wabigoon Reserve is addicted to intemperance, and that his wife has the same failing. Mr. Prewer states that he is not in a position to say whether the teacher has ever given liquor to any of the Indians, but that he has authority for charging him with taking liquor on the Reserve which both himself and his wife use freely. This charge against the teacher if well-founded is a very serious one and certainly shows that he is not a fit person for his position. I have, therefore, to request you to take immediate steps to have the matter investigated and the Department advised of the result.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Supt. General\n\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nE. McColl Esq.,\n\nInspector, &c.,\n\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWabigoon Mission\nMarch 18th 1895\n\nTo Mr. Coll & Co.,\nSup' Indian Affairs - Wabigoon - Man\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to the John's liquor case,\nI am informed by Mr. Indian Agent Mr. Butler that I am required\nto substantiate or withdraw the charges made to Mr. Hayter Reed\nin my letter of Jan 24th. I wish to say that in the aforementioned\nletter I accused Mr. John with importing liquor on to the Reserve\nand also that it was used freely by both himself and wife. The\nfirst charge has, I think, been sufficiently proven for Mr. John acknowledged\nthe fact himself to Mr. Butler, and the latter was founded\nupon information laid before me by Mr. C. C. Sinclair formerly of\nthe N. B. Co., who said that he had seen both Mr. John and his wife\nin a semi intoxicated condition. I have written to the last named\nperson asking him to make a statement to Mr. Butler but he has not\ndone so. As far as I am personally concerned, I have never seen either\nMr. John or his wife under the influence of liquor, nor have I ever\nmade statements to that effect either to yourself or Mr. Indian Agent\nMr. Butler nor yet to Mr. Hayter Reed.\n\nI trust this statement will be sufficient explanation. I\nremain\n\nYour obedient servant\nGeo. Brewer\nI hereby certify that on the 7th of Dec 1894 I saw a case evidently containing whisky addressed to Henry J. John, Harbour Lake Reserve, lying some three or four yards from the Mission House, and that at my request I removed the same and placed it inside the Mission House. The case, from the outside, evidently contained several cases of wine, and, if asked, I should say it contained liquor to the best of my knowledge. A short time after this, I discovered a case containing whisky used for wrapping bottles. I was also present when my brother asked Mr. C. Sinclair, the officer then in charge of the H.B. Company's interests at Harbour, if he had received notification of any goods being shipped to the aforementioned Henry J. John, and heard him reply in the affirmative, and that the shipping bill described the cases as follows viz., \"2 cases, wine,\" \"1 case, liquor.\" The last named case was weighed in my presence and proved to weigh 24 lbs gross weight. I also saw the case being laid out ready, with the two other cases, for transportation to the Reserve on the 12th day of the above mentioned month.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Brewer\nI John the son of Wabysen do certify that on the 13th of Dec 1874 I saw a man, which I was told afterwards contained liquor being packed on a sled drawn by dogs with two other men, addressed to Mr. Johnson, teacher on the Wabysen Reserve. I also saw the same carried on to the Reserve but did not go delivered to the inmates.\n\nI hereby sign my name to this statement.\n\n[Signature]\n\nWitness: Geo. Palmer\n\n[Signature]\nFort William\nMarch 25th 1895\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 17th instant also letter dated July 2nd requesting the charges made by the Rev. Mr. Brewer against the teacher of the Lac Seul Indian School. I informed you in my letter dated the 3rd instant, fact that Mr. John had acknowledged having liquor on the Reserve which he said was for medical purposes, but I omitted to inform you in said letter that he did not have a medical certificate.\n\nI enclose statement in duplicate made by John McTavish and J. Brewer respecting the liquor forwarded to the Reserve. I also enclose a letter handed me by the Rev. Mr. Brewer to forward to you so far as I can learn Dr. C.C. Sinclair is the only person who has seen Mr. John under the influence of liquor.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn W. Irvine\nIndian Agent\nSir, I am in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, reporting on the result of your investigation into the charges made against the teacher at Wabipon by the Rev. Mr. Pierson; that Mr. Johnson admitted having liquor on the Reserve, but that it was for medical purposes only, and that Mr. Pierson is prepared to substantiate any charge or statement he has made.\n\nThis is the sum and substance of your investigation. You did not apparently ascertain whether or not he had any medical certificate for having intoxicating liquor on the Reserve. You do not show in your report that Mr. Johnson and his wife used the liquor freely as represented by Mr. Pierson to the Department. You have therefore failed to give any valuable information to your report to the Department.\n\nIn my letter of the 19th ultimo to you in the matter requested you to call on Mr. Pierson to produce evidence in support of his charges against the teacher, Mr. Johnson. And again in another paragraph,\n\nIndian Affairs. School Files. (RG 10, Volume 6030, File 139-6-1, part D)\nParagraph I asked you to make a thorough investigation into all the charges made against Mr. Jones by Mr. Brewer, and report the same for the information of the Department.\n\nNow all you did in the matter was to question Mr. Jones, who admitted he brought liquor for medical purposes to the reserve, which is under a medical certificate to his benefit of the law whatever, but apparently you made no inquiries whether this was so or not, neither did you, as requested, call upon Mr. Brewer to produce evidence to substantiate these allegations or not; but said that you questioned Mr. Brewer, and that he is prepared to substantiate whatever statement he has made hitherto respecting the importation of liquor into the reserve, and the teacher conduct generally. If he is prepared to substantiate these accusations, why did you not hear him do so then and there, for you were sent there for that very purpose, and the investigation should be made in all fairness be made in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Jones, in order to afford them an opportunity of defending themselves. All statements made by any of the parties\nparties concerned as well as the evidence of witnesses should be taken down in writing by you, and after having these read over to the different parties, have each one sign his own statement or evidence.\n\nIn fact you should have sat in a magisterial capacity on the case and after trying it either convicted Mr. Johnson or acquit him of the serious charges made against him of using liquor freely, or in other words, of being drunk on the Reserve.\n\nYou will therefore demand of Mr. Peers to produce evidence in writing, signed by the parties upon whom he relies to substantiate his charges, and send a copy of the same upon receipt to Mr. Johnson for his remarks thereon, or for submitting evidence in rebuttal, if he can.\n\nMr. Peers told me he was prepared to prove this or that, and therefore you were sent there to give him an opportunity to do so, and how he must submit his evidence, or retract his charges.\n\nVery, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Signed) H. E. Coll\nInspector of Ind. Affairs\nFort William\nJanuary 30th, 1895\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 17th instant enclosing copy of letter from the Department referring to certain charges made against Mr. Henry Johns, teacher of the Wabigoon Indian School.\n\nOn the 26th instant proceeded to the Wabigoon Reserve and found Mr. Johns ill in bed, but upon hearing of my arrival he got up. I informed him that he had been charged with having liquor on the Reserve, and he at once admitted the charge and informed me that he had received six bottles of liquor along with his flour, purchased from the Hudson Bay Company, Winnipeg. Mr. Johns says the liquor was for medical purposes only, and that he did not know that it was against the law to have liquor under those circumstances.\n\nEnclosed is\n\nIndian Affairs. School Files.

H. Smythe\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nEnclose you herewith a copy of a letter which I received from the Department, and I have to request that you will kindly proceed without delay and investigate the charges against Mr. John contained therein. You will call upon Mr. Brewer to produce evidence in support of his charges against the teacher. I may mention in this connection that Archdeacon Plain wrote me the morning that it is desirable in the interest of the Indian School there, the Indians themselves, and of the Mission, that a change should be made in the School teacher. The school is dwindling down to a fare and no value is given for the money spent on it. Of course we all have our sympathy for anyone who may be thrown out of employment, but these schools are not established as charitable institutions, to provide a living for those who cannot earn their livelihood anywhere else. The main and only object of the Department is the Education of Indian Children in Establishing Schools.\n\nJ. McIlroy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort William.\nAmong them, and it is to be regretted that so absolutely little is accomplished in them.\n\nYou will see that according to Section 94 of Chap. 43 of the School Act, it is illegal for any person to have any intoxicating liquor in his possession on any Indian Reserve. You will therefore make a thorough investigation into all the charges made against Mr. Johnson by Mr. Brewer, and report the same for the information and action of the Department in this matter.\n\nYou will keep this letter's contents to yourself, and it is written for your guidance.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) P.

Johnson, teacher of the Indian School at Wabigoon, relative to the charges made against him for interference and bringing liquor to the Reserve, and requesting me to investigate the matter and report thereon for the information of the Department.\n\nIn reply I beg to submit for your information that in my\n\nThe Deputy of\nthe Right General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nmy letter of the 27th of March last, I recommended the dismissal of Mr. John's owing to his admission to Mr. Indian Agent Mr. Jutte that he took intoxicating liquor to the Reserve without a medical certificate, and to the Rev. Mr. Brewer's statement that both he and his wife used it freely, as the Reverend gentleman alleged that he was informed by Mr. E.C. Sinclair, an officer in charge of the Hudson's Bay Co.'s post at Wabigoon, but Mr. Brewer has failed to obtain, although repeatedly asked, a letter from Mr. Sinclair corroborating his accusation against Mr. John, who denies the charge and challenges an investigation into the matter.\n\nThe Reverend Archdeacon Blair called upon me a few days ago and after exhaustively discussing\ndiscussing the whole affair we concluded that whether he was guilty of the charges preferred against him or not, probably it was the wisest policy to retain his services at least for another quarter, upon the distinct understanding that there would be no occasion for a repetition of the charges made against him, and that there would be an evident improvement in the attendance and advancement of the pupils under his charge, for we are both of opinion that the school has not progressed as it should have done under his instruction during the past five years. We came to this conclusion especially as Mr. John has rendered considerable services in teaching the Indian girls\nto knit and sew. Mr. Johns has gone to considerable expenses in building a dwelling house for himself and family in the vicinity of the school-house, but neither this nor any other consideration should be taken into account in retaining his services after another quarter unless there is a manifest improvement in the school.\n\nI will however thoroughly investigate the whole matter upon my next visit to the Reserve and report as directed by you the result of my investigation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nE.

I have a copy of said\nspecifications, but I regret to say that they are all\npacked, preparatory to being shipped, among other\npapers, and it would be a difficult matter to put\nmy hand on them just now. I saw Mr. Leveque last\nnight and showed him your letter; he states that\nhe has the plans and correspondence on the matter\non file in his office in Rat Portage, but of course\ncannot get them before leaving for Lac Seul. He\nhas promised to write you on the matter, and to\ncertify that all is correct. The building has\nalready been handed over to the Indians and is being\nused by the teacher.

Original on File 427081-30\n\nWABIGOON RESERVE.\n\nThe school building was found to be in very poor shape, the foundations are giving way and the frame is leaning over to one side. I found 8 school desks here, the stove and stove pipes had been removed and nearly all school supplies have disappeared.\n\nagd. John Semmens,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, September 22, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Simmons in his report on the Wabigoon Reserve states that the school building is in very poor condition. The foundations are giving way and the building is leaning over to one side. There are eight desks there. The rest of the school supplies have disappeared, including the stove and stove pipes.\n\nThe Department would like to know if some arrangement could be made for taking care of these desks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

No.117760/5.\n\nReference to the eight desks in the Wabigoon reserve School house.\n\nI beg leave to say that the only thing could be done with the desks would be to have them taken over to the Hudsons Bay Coy at Dinorwic and store them there until they would be required, but as this would cost considerable as I would have to send down a man to have them brought over and stored, and then pay storage on them I am of opinion, it would be more than the desks are worth, I think they will be perfectly safe where they are until next treaty payments when they could be brought over without much cost, However I will be guided by your instructions.\n\nWith regards to the stove and pipes, as the stove was well used up and broken, also the pipes, I gave the Chief permission to take them and make use of them for his own benefit.\n\nWith regards to the school building, may say it is fairly good only that the foundation has rotted away, and would require to have a new foundation put in to make it safe and good, but if this school is not likely to be made use of in the near future, I would beg leave to recommend that it be given over to the Chief, or otherwise a new foundation put in and kept for a paying house.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary:-\n\nDept of Indian Affairs:-\n\nOttawa, Ont:-\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, October 3, 1913.\n\nMr. Paget,\n\nPlease note what Mr. Agent McKenzie says with regard to the old school building on the Wabigoon Reserve. We are not likely to use this building in the near future at least for day school purposes. I do not think we should give it over to the Chief. Would it be worth repairing to be used as a place to pay treaty, as suggested by the Agent?\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.B.M.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, October 8th, 1913.\n\n120-17\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 28th ultimo, relative to the school-house on the Wabigoon Reserve, I have to request that you will report whether this building could not be sold and if so, what valuation you place on it.\n\nWhen you have furnished this information you will be further advised in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. S. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 9th. Instant No.117,760-5.\n\nI beg leave to ask if this building could be sold at outsiders, or would it have to be sold to members of the Band. When I have this information I will be in a better position, as if the building is sold to some outsider, they would have to take it down, and in that case it would not bring much, but if sold to some of the Indians of the Band, it would be worth much more, and could be charged up to their trust account.\n\nAnd may I suggest, that if the building is sold, that the seat of this school and the Eagle Lake school would be sent here and given to the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School as they are short of seats in that school.\n\nIn the mean time I have written to the H. B. Coy' at Dinorwic, asking them to let me know if there is any one down there who would care to purchase the building. When I have received a reply and one from you will then communicate again with you on the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary:-\n\nDept of Indian Affairs:-\n\nOttawa, Ont:-\n\nIndian Affairs.

B. Coy's Manager that I thought we should get at least $100.00, for the building, but am satisfied we will not get that much. I would be pleased to have your views on the matter, and whether I should sell it or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary:\nDept of Indian Affairs:\nOttawa.- Ont:-\nOttawa, January 16, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant in reference to the school building on Wabigoon Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should sell this building on the best terms possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Laird, Esq.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAnother suggestion I should like to make is re the attendance of Indian children at school, we are put to much trouble in this way, those in the school are boarders while their parents are away hunting are all right, but when the parents come in they want them to go home to sleep, then we have trouble. Would it not be possible to have some compulsory measure or at least some gentle pressure brought to bear on them it would help us much and certainly would be better for them, children are growing up without education or such as can not be of use to them.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRobt. Holmes.\nOttawa, May 19, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 12th ultimo in which you ask whether it be possible to compel Indian parents to leave their children at the Christ Church Mission school I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to take any such steps. This school, in so far as its relation to the Department is concerned, is a day school and if the influence you are able to exercise will not overcome the trouble spoken of it is not seen how the Department can aid you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Holt Holmes,\nChrist Church Mission,\nPeace River Crossing, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nBecause of the war there is a shortage of funds. Our Bishop feels it necessary to close this School. He has asked me to go to Wapusta, taking the three Indian children with me.\n\nDr. Donald would like to give his consent, but thinks you may object. They come from St. John's. Their father Wolf has several wives, from 26 to 30 children. These children are by different mothers, and two of them with their mother were cast off to starve. St. John's mother died when he was 2 yrs old. How the child lived through the severe winter which followed is a mystery. He was only clothed with an old shirt and one small blanket tucked under his arm. He crawled into camp at night. I just picked up his living. He was found by some surveyors wandering about. I was taken by them to the Hudson Bay Co. who sent him down to the Mission here. I have had him 3\u00bd years. I look upon him as belonging to me. I have clothed him, taught him, done everything I feel towards him as a Mother. The other child who was deserted is a little older. I have had her 1\u00bd years. She was not quite in such a pitiful\nstate as the boy. There is no one to lay claim to them. Their father said, \"I don't want them; I have thrown them away.\" The third child is an older girl. When her mother died, she was given to an old crippled woman, but was sent by the Police down here, for she was neglected. These children have no mother or relative except a father who has deserted them.\n\nI want you to give consent for me to take them to Wapusk, the two younger ones anyway, for they have no one but me. I am greatly attached to them, & will feel it deeply if they are taken from me. They were given to me. Other children have been taken from one mission & placed in another, passing over two missions, because the one who took them felt the same as I do. They were left in her charge? There have been given to me.\n\nMr. Laird knows me & he knows the children. Will you consent? I am anxiously awaiting your consent. Will you either telegraph it or send by letter as soon as possible, before the children are sent elsewhere.\n\nThe Bishop has asked me to go in December. I would like to get your permission as soon as possible, so that I may be able to pack. Trusting to get a favorable reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Miss) L. Miller\nCanadian Pacific Railway Company's Telegraph\n\nREAD THE NOTICE AND AGREEMENT ON THE BACK\n\nSend the following Message, subject to the terms printed on the back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nOttawa, November 30, 1924.\n\nMiss L.

They had been neglected and deserted by their parents and, as Miss Millen takes a great interest in their welfare, she was granted permission on the closing of her school to take them with her to Wabasca.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

They say if there was a boarding school here they would assist in every way they could in helping to maintain the school such as drawing wood and cutting it, scrubbing, washing and clothing their children rather than have them sent away to other schools where they cannot see them regularly as they say they are very dear to them. They would like to see them get education in the English language & to live with like the English with whom they are surrounded and with whom they have to deal with every day. They have asked me to help them in this matter & I see they are very anxious in it as they have signed a petition hoping the officials will do something in the matter.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nFarmer R.

I think the children would do much better than living at home, as the house influence is bad, they are fond of their children which is one redeeming feature about them and want to see them educated. At present they have no day school as no teacher has been here since Mr. Hartland left & I don't think his services were any use. If arrangements could be made to use the Mission House for keeping the children & to use the church for a School House it could be worked with very little expense, as I am satisfied the day school will always be a failure as after seeing the Indians go away to work & of course take their families with them other places when they go hunting.\n\nYours truly,\n[Signature]\n\nFEB 10 1896\nOTTAWA 11th February 1906\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant enclosing a petition from the Oak River Sioux Indians for the establishment of a Boarding School on their Reserve; and in reply I beg to say that the Department has no funds at its disposal for the establishment of a Boarding School in this locality, even if it were thought advisable to do so.\n\nThe Day school on this Reserve which has been in operation up to the end of December Quarter last, has had such an unsatisfactory attendance as to quite discourage the Department. If the Indians are as anxious for the education of their children as their petition would lead one to suppose they should not object to letting them go to either Bighorn or Regina, where they would receive far greater advantages than at a Boarding School, supposing one were established on their Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo.

I was glad to see the Indians around Lake Athabasca in good health and prosperous, but as you have learned already, the Indians of Fort McKay & Fort Mc Murray have been struck by the terrible Spanish influenza last winter and I was very much grieved to see too many poor children left without father or mother and the others who are not orphans are deprived of all means of learning. Therefore, come to you with earnest prayer that you may help me in the work I feel in duty bound to undertake. You know that all these Indians, Chipewyans and Cree are Catholic, there is a boarding school at Fort Chipewyan but it is so far away more than 200 miles distant from Fort Mc Murray and already full. I believe that something ought to be done and I ask you to be allowed to open a boarding school at Fort Mc Murray for 25 children. If you give me some hope, I would try to put up some building where Sisters of Charity would take care of the most destitute among the children, not this year of course, but before the end of next year.\n\nI have the honour to be, Dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\nE. Edward Scott, Superintendent Indian Affairs\n\nAugust 9th 1919\nAugust 27th, 1919.\n\nRev. and dear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of August 9th. Allow me to express my satisfaction that you were able to complete your trip to the missions on Lake Athabasca, etc., in good health and in safety. I note your request that you be allowed to establish a boarding school at Fort McMurray for 35 children. As you are no doubt aware we must have a Parliamentary appropriation before we can be authorized to open any new schools, but I shall take this matter up with the Hon. the Superintendent General at an early date and make full representations to him upon your application.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt.

Besides these two there are residential schools at Fort Chipewyan, Fort Vermilion and Wabasso Lake, all of which are conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church.

Sutherland\nOctober 4, 1918.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have given careful consideration to your letter with regard to the matter of the establishment of a boarding school at Fort McMurray in view of the large number of Indian children who are left as orphans owing to the epidemic of influenza. As you are doubtless aware, it is the policy of the Government to exercise the greatest economy in incurring expenditures of this character at the present time in view of existing conditions. It is recognized, however, that this case is of an urgent and unusual nature and it is accordingly proposed that it should receive special consideration.\n\nIf you were to erect a suitable building, I think that we should be able to arrange provision for a per capita grant on the same basis as that paid at the other boarding schools in the north. It must be definitely understood, however, that the Government is not at any time to be involved in any expenditure other than the per capita grant in connection with this proposed school, that is to say twenty-five pupils at $145 per capita.\n\nFr. Rev. E. Grouard, O.M.I.,\nGrouard, Alberta.\nI should be glad if you would let me have detailed information with regard to the character of the building that you would propose to have erected.\n\nI need hardly say that I greatly appreciate your devoted interest in the welfare of these Indian children, and I am fully in sympathy with your wishes in the matter, which I shall endeavour to comply with, subject, of course, to the limitations that are of necessity placed upon us with respect to expenditure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Scott,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your kind letter of the 4th instant, and thank you very much for the special consideration you have given to my request.\n\nYou ask some detailed information with regard to the character of the building that I propose to erect. Well, dear Sir, it will be as all our other buildings in the North - wood frame - 50 ft x 30 - 2 stories high - hot air furnace - I would have Grey nuns of Montreal to take charge of the children.\n\nNow there is nothing done yet, but I hope that the house will be ready for September next year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSincerely & respectfully yours,\n\nE. G\u00e9rard\n\nAt Athabasca\nSir:\n\nAs it is reported that the Government is being asked for assistance towards establishing an Indian Boarding School at this place, to be under the management of the Grey Nuns, I would respectfully recommend that, should such be the case, the matter should receive favourable consideration.\n\nFor the past two years the Willow Lake Band, who have some twenty-three children of school age, has asked for a Day School, but knowing that, owing to the nomadic habits of the Indians and other reasons, it would not meet requirements, I have not favourably reported on the matter. It is regretted however that these children should not grow up in complete ignorance. If an Indian Boarding School was built and maintained here, these and others could be trained for the competitive struggle of life. There are also a number of other children at the Pembina Reserve and also at Fort McKay who are similarly situated. I have no doubt that the proposed school would be full to its utmost capacity from the beginning.\n\nAs there is likely to be some development here in the near future it would appear to be expedient that there should be an institution where the Indian children could be fed, trained and clothed, as well as protected from the allurements of a frontier town.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 27, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, concerning the advisability of establishing an Indian residential school at Fort McMurray. There are many pressing claims on the Appropriation for Indian Education; and, before the Department extends its educational system, careful consideration must be given. When plans for the future are being determined your representations will not be overlooked.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nGerald Card, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort McMurray, Alta.\nNoms des enfants indiens,\nFort Mc Murray Band; Treaty No.8.\n\n| Noms                  | Date de naissance | Nom du p\u00e8re |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Madeleine Powder      | 15 janvier 1914   | Jos.

FERRIER,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHis Lordship Bishop C. Joussard, O.M.I., of Fort Chipewyan, has sent me the enclosed list of the Indian children belonging to Fort McMurray Band, Treaty No. 8. This list has been prepared by Reverend Father Laffont, in charge of the mission at Fort McMurray. His Lordship is under the impression that the Reverend Father has missed a few names.\n\nThe object of the present letter is to ask if the Department could consider the building of a residential school; 90' x 40', two stories high, with concrete basement. In the estimation of His Lordship, the total cost would be about $12,000. I have no definite proposal from His Lordship regarding this construction; whether the Department will be asked to erect the building or give the grant if said building was erected. If supplementary details are required, I would be pleased to give them; meanwhile, I leave this matter to your consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJoseph Henry, O.M.I.\nSeptember 29, 1926.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, enclosing a list of the children of school age belonging to the Fort McMurray band. I note that His Lordship Bishop Jossard urges the Department to erect, or grant assistance for the establishment of, a residential school at Fort McMurray.\n\nAs you are aware, there are many pressing claims on the Appropriation for Indian Education, and careful consideration must be given before the Department extends its educational system. When plans for the future are being determined, your representations will not be overlooked.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Jos.

They are further very anxious that their children should receive an education though they have a strong aversion to sending them to the Industrial schools as some of the parents have sent their children to Industrial schools and the death rate has been heavy, some of the families having had several children die and they attribute this heavy mortality to the close confinement.\n\nTo overcome this the Indians wish to have a Day School on their reservation and the children will live at home and attend school in the daytime.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. J.H.Grayson.\nOttawa, February 26, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nOn the first occasion on which you visit the Wood Mountain Reserve the Department would like you to look carefully into the matter of the establishment of a day school for these Indians and report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have a letter from J. H. Thompson of Wood Mountain with reference to the possibility of a Day School being established on the Reservation there. The Indians there are very much averse to sending their children to an Industrial School as their experience of 15 years ago in that regard was a very unfortunate one. Many of the children they sent at that time under compulsion never got home. They are very desirous of having a Day school established on the Reserve with an efficient teacher. There are some 14 to 20 children of school age whose parents promise attendance. To establish a School at that point will tend to keep these people on the Reserve during the summer with the exception of the men who go out to work in the harvest fields. I wrote in my report of June 1912, regarding this matter but have had no communication from you as to whether there is a possibility of acceding to the demands of these Indians. I will be glad if this matter is taken up at an early date and notification sent me.\n\nYours with regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nApril 30th, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Campbell -\n\nI have your communication of the 16th instant in reference to the establishment of a day school on the Wood Mountain Reserve. This is a matter which had been previously given consideration by the Department, and in 1913 it was decided that owing to the comparatively small number of children of school age and the location of the families the success of a day school was doubtful.\n\nI would like to know if these Indians are now permanently located, and if so, what distance they could be from a school centrally located. Supposing there are from 14 to 20 children of school age on the Reserve it is doubtful if the attendance that could be secured would justify the Department in making the outlay necessary to provide a suitable building, etc.\n\nI would be quite favourable to giving a day school a trial if there is any building that might be\n\nGlen Campbell, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nused temporarily for the purpose and if it could be possible to secure the services of a teacher and a suitable lodging place.\n\nI should be pleased to hear from you further in regard to this matter at your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir:\n\nINDIAN SCHOOL SUPPLIES: TROUT LAKE\n\nThe arrangements as outlined in your letter of the eighth instant, covering a shipment of school supplies for Trout Lake, are quite satisfactory, and we will see that they are safely delivered to destination.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHUDSON'S BAY COMPANY,\n\nPer\n\n[Signature]\n\nDISTRICT MANAGER\n137-1-1 CLOSED\n\nFROM 23/2/12.\n\nTO 11/4/24\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6031)\n\nFile 134-3-1, part 1\nFort Smith - Fort McMurray Roman Catholic Boarding School - General Administration. 1919, 1926\n\nFile 134-7-1, part 1\nAlberta - Fort Fitzgerald School - General Administration. 1931-1935\n\nFile 136-1-1, part 1\nPeguis Reserve - Fisher River School - General Administration. 1915-1922\n\nFile 137-1-1, part 1\nMoose Jaw Sioux - Wood Mountain School - General Administration. 1912-1914, 1924\n\nFile 150-1-5, part 3\nBritish Columbia - Inspection of boilers in Residential Schools. 1940-1948\n\nFile 150-9, part 1\nHeadquarters - Admission of Halfbreeds to Residential Schools. 1894-1938\nPublic Building,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDate: October 2nd, 1940.\n\nMr. C.

J. Arnell, S.P.F. Engineer of the Dominion Department of Public Works, at the following Indian Residential Schools in B. C. :\n\nSt. Mary's Indian Res. School, Mission, B.C.\nSechelt Indian Res. School, Sechelt, B. C.\n\nCopies of Certificates covering the Boilers at the above-mentioned Schools are also enclosed.\n\nCopies of the aforementioned enclosures have been forwarded to the Indian Agents concerned; and Certificates have been sent to the respective Principals for posting in the boiler rooms at the Schools.\n\nThe Agents have been requested to take up with the Principals any remarks in the Reports on Boilers that should be brought to their attention.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept., of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of June 30th, covering travelling expense account for expenditure incurred by Mr. T. J. Arnall, S. P. P. Engineer of the Dominion Department of Public Works in the amount of $42.00.\n\nI am advised by the District Resident Architect that up to the present no cheque has been received to cover the account.\n\nIt would be appreciated if this matter could be given attention.\n\nFor: D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, September 14, 1944.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nEX'D.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 31, in which you request that a cheque for $48.00 be sent to Mr. T. J. Arnall, for travelling expenses incurred.\n\nIn April 1, 1944, a cheque for $150.00 was sent to Mr. Arnall. This was a standing advance for travelling expenses in connection with the inspection of boilers at Indian residential schools in British Columbia.\n\nThis Department has been instructed by the Treasury Board to eliminate all standing advances not required and to reduce the advance where the expenditure does not justify the amount advanced.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 1943-44 the total travelling expenses incurred by Mr. Arnall amounted to $90.80. It has been decided, therefore, to reduce the amount advanced to $75.00 and to change it from the category of a standing advance to a special advance, to be accounted for when the inspection service is completed.\n\nAs Mr. Arnall's expense account enclosed with your letter of June 30, 1944, amounted to $42.00, there is still a balance of $108.00 for which he should account.\n\nR.

MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Indian Residential Schools Generally -\nBritish Columbia.\n\nHaving reference to your letter of the 21st instant\nwith regard to expense account in favour of T.J. Arnall,\nS.P.P. Engineer of this Department, I beg to advise\nyou that the amount of the advance, namely - $75.00 -\nrecommended by the Treasury Board is not of any value\nto Mr. Arnall as Boiler Inspector.\n\nGranted that last year his expense accounts were small,\nbut this was because travelling conditions were such\nthat it was impossible to make reservations, and a\nlarge number of the boilers were not inspected.\n\nMr. Arnall has already spent practically $150.00 this\nyear on trips he has made and he still has to go to\nLeJac and Alert Bay.\n\nAlso, the work at the Coqualeetza School will have to be\ninspected at least twice before it is completed.\n\nUnless the travelling advance is given these inspections\ncannot be made.\n\nThen, if any of the schools need an inspection during the\nwinter in cases of emergency, Mr. Arnall is expected to\nmake a trip and submit a report. Here again unless he\nhas sufficient travelling advance he cannot make the\ninspections.\n\nA great deal of your work is done in conjunction with\nthat of this Department and the minimum amount is charged\nto your Department.\n\n\"C. F. Dawson\"\nDist. Res.Architect\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 150-1-5\n\nInformation contained in your letter of September 14th, regarding proposed reduction in Mr. T. J. Arnall's travelling advance was conveyed to Mr. C. F. Dawson, District Resident Architect, a copy of the latter's reply dated September 23rd being enclosed herewith for your information.\n\nIn view of the contents of Mr. Dawson's letter, it would appear that further consideration may be given to the amount allowed Mr. Arnall for a special advance.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n-HN\nOttawa,\nOctober 3, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo,\nwith reference to the travelling advance for\nMr. T.J. Arnall.\n\nThere is no intention on the part of\nthe Department to curtail Mr. Arnall's inspections\ndue to lack of funds. However, as stated in my\nletter of the 14th ultimo, the Treasury Branch's\nrequirement is simply to reduce the number of\nstanding advances. If Mr. Arnall has not funds\non hand at the present time to make any further\ntrips that you consider necessary, please let me\nknow the approximate amount of money required\nfor these trips and this will be forwarded to\nyou at once.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to advise that I am in receipt of reports, in duplicate, of the inspection of the boilers and machinery at the undermentioned Indian Residential Schools from the office of the District Resident Architect, Department of Public Works, Victoria. Certificates, in triplicate, issued in connection with the boilers, were also received from Mr. Dawson's Office.\n\nKootenay Indian Res. School, Cranbrook, B.C.\nKamloops\nSt. George's\nAlberni\nKuper Island\n\nThe original Certificates were sent to the Principals of the Schools concerned for posting up in the boiler room, and the respective Indian Agents were supplied with a copy, each, of the reports and certificates covering the boilers, etc. Copies of the above-mentioned documents were retained for our files.\n\nMr. Dist. Resident Architect Dawson advises that two copies of these reports are sent direct by his Office to Ottawa, and one of these copies is sent from the Public Works to the Indian Affairs Branch, in Ottawa. It is presumed that this one copy will meet the requirements of the Department.\n\nD. M.

The condensate\nfrom Laundry boiler; either returned to the laundry boiler, or\nwasted to sewer. The present method has been in use for several\nyears and the new engineer is not to blame for the condition of\nthe boiler. A sample of the\n\n(over)\nboiler water should be sent to a reliable firm and the treatment recommended, started right away. Four tube stoppers will have to be used for the tubes that leaked badly, and if many more fail, provision will have to be made to retube the boiler. The air eliminators in the system have all been plugged, so new parts or new eliminators will have to be installed. A condensate pump would improve the circulation in the heating system. In the event of a pump being installed, there would be no necessity to replace the air eliminator because the air could be directed to the pump vent. Several of the traps are worn out and new parts are needed. The pump installation and renewal of parts can be done by the Resident Engineer, who has had considerable experience repairing machinery and on new installations.\n\nJ. E.

As to their presence interfering in any way, I would say that it takes up a good portion of the teachers' time which might be directed to the advancement of our own children; such correspondence does not make a better school as if there were no children allowed to attend them. It seems that such children will be a very serious consideration, as most of our children have been sent away to industrial schools.\n\nIf you decide to allow them to attend, I think the parents ought to be made to pay for the cost of the school during winter and spring, as they are supplied with the control of the school by the Indian Affairs Department, not the Church.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Keefe\n\nIndian Affairs Office Caribou\n22nd March 1894\nOTTAWA 25th April, 1894\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from Mr. Agent Keith with reference to the unauthorized attendance of non-treaty children at the Mistawasis and Attakakooops Schools; and in reply I beg to inform you that in view of the small attendance of Indian children at these schools, and of the statement made by Mr. Keith that the presence of the half-breed children will not interfere in any way with the progress of the Indian children, the Department will not object in this instance to their attending the schools, provided their parents will, as suggested by the Agent, deliver a few loads of wood at the school in the winter.\n\nThe control of the schools will not of course pass from the hands of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner\nRegina, N.W.T.\nJuly 21, 1896.\n\nMy dear Mr. Reed,\n\nAt the meeting of the Synod of the Diocese of Saskatchewan, held at Prince Albert on June 17th, the following resolution was adopted. May God bless the kind attention of the Bishop General and yourself both.\n\nThat this Synod, while expressing with thankfulness the support given by the Indian Department of the Dominion Government to the Boarding and Industrial schools, set aside for the education and training of Indian children hereby expresses its deepest concern and regret that there are so many children in different parts of the Diocese whose parents have been allowed to leave their homes and who are now in a worse position than the Indians on the Reserve. These children are growing up in utter ignorance without any opportunity of receiving an education whatever. The Synod would respectfully request the Bishop to communicate with the Department, and endeavor to secure their sanction to the admission of...\nsuch children to the boarding and industrial schools on the same or on an equal footing as the children of treaty Indians.\n\nSir,\n\nvery respectfully,\n\nWilliam Saskatchewan and Calgary\n\nHayter Reed Esq.,\nChief Sup't General,\nIndian Dept.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\n\nJuly 30th, 1896.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of 21st instant, communicating to the Department a resolution by which the Synod of the Diocese of Saskatchewan asks for reasons given to have children of half-breeds who have been permitted to leave Treaty admitted to Indian Boarding and Industrial Schools, and in reply to inform Your Lordship that this matter has in the past been repeatedly brought to the attention of the Department, and fully considered by it, but the only conclusion arrived at has been that this Department has no power, even were it deemed advisable in the face of the large and always increasing demands on the limited resources available for education of the children of Treaty Indians, to divert its funds in the direction indicated, and matters affecting the class referred to are not within its jurisdiction.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMy Lord,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHAYTER REED\n\nHis Lordship,\n\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan & Calgary,\n\nBishop's Court,\n\nCalgary, A.W.T.\nDepartment of the Interior,\n\nOttawa, 25th July, 1899.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to send you herewith, for such action as may be deemed necessary to take in the matter, an extract from a letter dated the 19th instant from the Rev. Father Hugonard, respecting the admission into the Industrial Schools of Half-breed children whose parents have withdrawn from Treaty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract from a letter dated the 19th July, 1899, from the Rev. Father Hugonard.\n\nAnother question which concerns also the Half-breed, is the education of those of their children related with or under the charge of treaty half-breeds, specially orphans\u2014such children not being treaty half-breeds, or having been wrongly thrown out of the treaty by the fact that their parents left the treaty are growing uneducated, being a perpetual danger for educated Indians and the community. There is room enough in the existing schools to accept them without injury to the Indians, as they cannot fill the vacancies. This has been done to a certain extent in the past, and could be done by the authorities of the Indian Department without any law to that effect. It would make up for the injustice done to the children who were forced out of the treaty by their parents and the Government, and for the support due to Half-breed children born after the last rebellion, and who although not Indians still cannot be considered as white people, and in fact remain in a far worse condition than the Indian children who can be educated. Some Half-breeds can have their children educated. It is not a question of such Half-breeds\nHalf-breeds; it is question of orphan Half-breed children, or children of worthless Half-breeds who leave their children without education, and under the charge of their relatives in the treaty. Mr. Laurier has been here and will readily understand the question. It is a pity that political reasons prevented from applying to education the money given in scrip, which will be of no or little use to them.\nOTTAWA, 1st August, 1929\n\nSir,\n\nThat portion of your letter of the 16th instant which deals with the question of the education of half-breed children, especially orphans, has been transferred to this department, and I am directed to acknowledge the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Secretary\n\nRev. J. Hugonnard,\nPrincipal Industrial school,\nQu'Appelle, N.W.T.\nOttawa, 13th October, 1899.\n\nMemorandum Mr. Smart,\n\nThe Indian Commissioner is to be informed, in reply to his letter of the 19th ultimo, that I have given the subject referred to therein careful consideration, and that I cannot approve of the absolute rule which he has laid down that none but treaty children are to be admitted into Indian schools. A well-defined line can be drawn between halfbreeds, properly speaking, and Indians. While I do not consider that the children of the halfbreeds proper of Manitoba and the Territories should be admitted into Indian schools and paid for by the Department, I am decidedly of the opinion that all children, even those of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not, who live upon an Indian Reserve and whose parents on either side live as Indians upon a reserve, even if they are not annuitants, should be eligible for admission to the schools. It must be remembered that boarding and industrial schools were not established for the purpose of carrying out the terms of the treaty or complying with any provision of the law, but were instituted\ninstituted in the public interest, so that there should not grow up upon reserves an uneducated and barbarous class. The North West Government cannot provide for the education of non-annuitants upon reserves; and if we exclude them from our schools, they will practically be debarred from all means of education.\n\nsd. CLIFFORD SIFTON.\n\n(Supt. General)\nIndian Industrial School\n\nabout it - their nomadic life makes it impossible for them to send their children to any day school; they have no legal right to attend schools; consequently, their children remain uneducated and are exposed to all kinds of vice, especially immorality, drunkenness and stealing.\n\nThe fact bears out this statement.\n\nMost of the half-breeds are not fit to have free access to liquor, and it can be stated that eight out of ten will take it in excess. The fact is too well known to be ignored. Liquor has reduced them to poverty and children learn to drink when they are still young. Not only do they drink, but they are the means of introducing liquor into the reserve and Mr. Graham of Idle Hills has obtained about fifteen convictions against half-breeds for giving liquor to Indians.\n\nThe half-breeds are to be blamed for their present condition, but it was a mistake to treat them as white people and to allow them to get liquor, to sell their land and to leave their children uneducated.\n\nSome of them were in the treaty will, Indians.\nIndians are considered as minors; still all the future of their children and of their posterity was placed in their hands when they were allowed to deprive them of land, of education and of other privileges of Indians.\n\nLegally they have no right to any favor more than white people but the public in their own interest have still a moral obligation, a being partly Indians and partly wards of the Gov't of the country.\n\nVery little however can be done for them, but at least their children should be educated and saved from ruin if possible, why the parents are willing. They have no right to have industrial schools for themselves, but why there are vacancies in Indian Industrial schools which cannot be filled by Indians, the Government would be justified to admit half-breed children, especially orphans or those away from day schools.\n\nPresently it is done to a small extent but limited to children of half breed living on or around reserves while all the half breeds of the North are very contact with Indians, especially in summer they living in tents and are apt to intermarry with them.\nIn the States, half breeds are admitted into school. Now should there be any fear that it will be done in excess; very few are willing to send their children to school unless they are orphaned or at least motherless or fatherless.\n\nIt might be worth consideration also to allow to admit into the reserve the educated half breed children where they and Indians would be willing, and here also very few would be willing to join the Indians except orphaned. The joining of the Indians by the reserves would protect them against liquor and the laws of the reserve is now more than sufficient for the Indians left, as their number has decreased considerably since the treaty was made.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIt is well known that they did not appreciate land and that they sold their lands and scripts for very little, and that the little they received for it has been spent by too many of them in liquor. Those who took homesteads have sold them or will sell them and have no land for their children nor to farm for themselves. They are reduced to make their living by working, chiefly around towns where their children are in contact as well as themselves chiefly with all the white people addicted to drinking or immorality. I would refer to the records of the N.W.T. Police and of the courts as to the fact that out of 10 convictions around Fort Qu'Appelle last year, eight were against half breeds, about liquor or stealing. Mr. Donald of Fort Qu'Appelle and Mr. Graham Indian agent and others would support the above statement.\n\nEducation is another question on which half breeds hold different views than white people; they make no sacrifice and take very little trouble about\nIndian Industrial School\n\nat Qu'Appelle\n\n252545 Dec 23 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report with regard to the half-breeds who have left the reserve or living near by.\n\nThe condition of the half-breeds in the North West is such now that it calls for the attention of all those who come in contact with them. Their rights to the land has been legally distinguished by the granting of scrips, and those who did not join the Indians on the reserve, or who were allowed to leave it are now considered as white people and enjoy the same privileges. The scrips were granted at their demand and they would not likely have been satisfied with the privileges of Indians; their present condition is a striking proof that the scrips have not been much of a benefit to them and have not made white people of them.\n\nThere are three things for which they should not have been placed on the same footing as white people, that is land, education and liquor.\n\nIt is\nOTTAWA, 5th January, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRev. Father Hugonard's letter of 23rd ultimo, dealing with the half-breed question does not properly come within the province of this Department but as he refers to the question of their education, I quote for your information a memorandum from the Superintendent General having reference to this,-\n\n\"The Indian Commissioner is to be informed, in reply to his letter of the 19th ultimo, that I have given the subject referred to therein careful consideration, and that I cannot approve of the absolute rule which he has laid down that none but treaty children are to be admitted into Indian schools. A well defined line can be drawn between Halfbreeds, properly speaking, and Indians. While I do not consider that the children of the Halfbreeds proper of Manitoba and the Territories should be admitted into Indian schools and paid for by the Department, I am decidedly of the opinion that all children, even those of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not, who live upon an Indian Reserve, even if they are not annuitants, should be eligible for admission to the schools. It must be remembered that boarding and Industrial schools were not established for the purpose of carrying out the terms of the treaty or complying with any provision of the law, but were instituted in the...\"\n\"public interest, so that there should not grow\nup upon reserves an uneducated and barbarous\nclass. The North West Government cannot pro-\nvide for the education of non-annuitants upon\nreserves; and if we exclude them from our\nschools, they will practically be debarred\nfrom all means of education.\"\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n6 points not clear in your report, and the ruling stated, is how far these remarks apply to half breeds as a race. As I understand better arguments, he is alluding to half breeds as a class generally, and I do not include them under the present minister's ruling. If same cannot be said, the question arises consideration in a larger sense\u2014whether like & known or what about the whole matter has ever been before this dept\u2014\nOTTAWA, 11th January, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn reply to your enquiry hereunder, I beg to say that there can be no doubt as to the status of half-breeds in Manitoba who have shared in the distribution of scrip not being accounted as Indians, as express mention is made of them in the amendment to Section 13 of the Indian Act, 51 Vic., Cap. 22.\n\nWhat the actual status of half-breeds in the Territories is, I am not prepared to say, although Mr. Rimmer in a memorandum on the admission of Manitoba half-breeds to Treaty, turned out on file 260,070 herewith, says \"There are differences as to half-breeds in and Manitoba in the Territories, but the practical deduction from the opinion of the Deputy Minister of Justice seems to be that whether in Province or Territories, a half-breed whose Indian title has been extinguished otherwise than by Treaty cannot be converted into an Indian, as defined in the Indian Act, so as to give him all the advantages of the Treaty.\n\n\"There may be urgent reasons of policy demanding that some half-breeds who are practically leading the Indian life should be accounted Indians. If there has been change in the policy of the Government it does not alter the law; but the strong or the reasons for the Government's policy, the strong or are the grounds for asking Parliament to amend the law to conform to the policy\".\n\nFather Hugonnard's remarks apply to the\nhalf-breeds as a class and are not limited to those living with the Indians on reserves. The only documents I can find relating to the half-breed question are on the file above referred to, which is placed herewith.\n\n[Signature]\nEXTRACT FROM MEMORANDUM OF D. C. SCOTT, ACCOUNTANT,\nDATED DECEMBER 11, 1906, TO THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL,\nRELATIVE TO THE ADMISSION OF HALF-BREEDS TO INDIAN SCHOOLS.\n\nIn conclusion I may refer to a letter of the 24th October, 1899 (File No. 150148/1) written by Mr. Smart to Commissioner Laird, in which it was stated that the Minister could not approve of the absolute rule which Mr. Laird had laid down that none but treaty children should be admitted into Indian Schools. The letter read as follows:\n\n\"A well defined line can be drawn between half-breeds, properly speaking, and Indians, and while the Minister does not consider that the children of half-breeds proper, of Manitoba and the Territories, should be admitted into Indian Schools and paid for by the Department, still he is decidedly of the opinion that all children, even those of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not, who live upon an Indian reserve and whose parents on either side live as Indians upon a reserve, even if they are not annuitants, should be eligible for admission to schools. It should be remembered in this connection that boarding and industrial schools were not established for the purpose of carrying out the terms of Treaty, or complying with any provisions of the law, but that they were instituted in the public interest so that there should not grow up upon reserves an uneducated and barbarous class. The North West Government can not provide for the education of non-annuitants upon reserves, and if we exclude them from our schools, they would practically be debarred from all means of education.\n\nWhile the foregoing does not approve of half-breed children, whose parents do not live upon reserves as Indians, being admitted to the schools, yet it takes into consideration the fact that there are circumstances under which in all justice half-breed children should be admitted to such institutions; and I have quoted therefrom in order that you may have the full facts before you, and also as I consider the ruling in question strengthens my view of the case.\n\nI have been accustomed to deal with cases of this nature upon grounds of humanity and expediency, rather than rules or regulations laid down by law, written or unwritten. It seems to me that this case is one which should be so dealt with. I therefore recommend that these children be taken into Treaty, placed upon the pay-list, and accepted as grant earners at the Kenora School.\n\n(Sgd.) D. C.

Deputy and Secretary.\nSt. Joseph's Industrial School,\nDaviesburg, Alberta, 30th Sept., 1911.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nIn his first report on Indian Schools, dated 1st June, 1910, the Superintendent of Indian Education states:\n\n\"Not only do our schools every day removing intelligent Indian children from evil surroundings, but they are very often ministering to a class which would be outcasts without such aid; refer to the illegitimate offspring of white men and Indian women who are thrown upon their mothers for support, and who have no legal status as Indians. This great charitable work, which parallels the efforts put forth by white communities aided by Provincial, Municipal, or private endowment, must be carried on by the Dominion Government, aided by Christian missionaries and missionary societies.\"\n\nThat statement appearing in a report of a high official, in a report publically published and circulated by the Indian Department, I take to indicate a reversal of the policy recent when it was written, of excluding such children as the Superintendent refers to from Indian Industrial and Boarding schools, for I know not of any other agencies through which the Dominion Government can provide for the education and ethical training of those unfortunates.\n\nI was greatly pleased when I read the statement, and\nflattered at finding it so much in accord with the views which I hold on the subject and which I have taken frequent occasion to impress upon the Department. But I am equally disappointed at finding that the practice of the Department has not yet come fully up to the Superintendent's view. Perhaps the Principals, who were so emphatically made aware of the Department's determination to keep Indian schools exclusively for Indians of legal status, are waiting for more direct advice of the reversal of policy, while the Department may be waiting for the Principals to move in Half-breed cases before taking particular action in accordance with the Superintendent's view.\n\nIt, therefore, occurs to me to suggest that a circular be sent to Principals of Indian schools, embodying the view of the Superintendent as summarized in the statement I have quoted, and requesting the Principals to send a detailed report each as to the Half-breed children in the schools on whose behalf the per capita grant has been refused, or who have been admitted without consulting the Department, so that the sound policy expressed in the Superintendent's statement may be put into full and effective operation without further inevitable delay.\n\nI find the following Half-breed children at this institution:\n\nLizzie Muskrat and Lillie George, the illegitimate offspring of a Half-breed woman leading the Indian, who some years ago abandoned the children on the Blood Reserve and left the country. They were taken into the Catholic Boarding School on the Blood Reserve and cared for by the Sisters until...\nthey were transferred some six or seven years ago to this institution and placed under the care of the Sisters here.\n\nAlbert and Sylvester Helcourt, born of Half-breed parents following the Indian mode of life in the Lac Ste. Anne country, and unable to so bring up the children as to make them useful members of the community.\n\nNapoleon, Joseph, Agnes and Louise McCullis, children of Halfbreed parents. The mother is dead. The father is old and somewhat infirm; is occasionally able to work, but has a hard enough time to support himself.\n\nMary and Agnes Hall, from Medicine Hat. The mother was a Half-breed woman named Brasseau. She is dead. The father's whereabouts is unknown.\n\nAlbertine McKay, a Half-breed, whose both parents are dead. The mother, Mathilda Bishop, was a regularly authorized pupil of this institution.\n\nI submit these cases for consideration by the Department as to whether they do not form part of the \"great charitable work\", referred to by the Superintendent of Indian Education, and which, he states, \"must be carried on by the Dominion Government, aided by Christian Missionaries.\"\n\nIt might, of course, be argued that the statement's scope is confined to the illegitimate offspring of Indian women of legal status. But such a narrow and technical interpretation would defeat the object of a policy designed to save from becoming outcasts and menaces to society children of mixed blood for whose proper upbringing there are no other agencies than our Indian Schools. The policy as I interpret it\nwas given a measure of effect to when Inspector Graham, acting under Departmental instructions, gathered at Medicine Hat and placed in this institution a number of non-annuitant children of mixed blood. I can see no difference between these children and those I have mentioned. They are plainly of mixed blood; indeed in one in particular the white blood has allowed of no external evidences of red. There can be no objection to Principals of Schools being allowed to do what the Department had Inspector Graham do, and I shall be glad to hear that the wise policy referred to is not to be confined in its operation to what was done through him.\n\nThere is a case in Lethbridge to which it seems to me the policy should apply. Louise Rabaska, an ex-pupil of this School, and, I understand a treaty Indian, married one Godin, a Halfbreed. He is in the Penitentiary. There are three children, I am told, of school age. The mother is unable to provide for their education and proper upbringing. They are in the way of degradation. I would suggest that the Principal be authorized to take these children into the School.\n\nI should be pleased to be advised of the Department's attitude towards the position taken in this communication.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLL.D.,\nI.R.C.I.S.\nOttawa, October 17, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 30th September on the subject of the admission of half-breeds to residential schools I have to inform you that the paragraph which you quote from the Superintendent of Indian Education's report, published in the Annual Report of this Department for the year ended 31st March, 1910, was written before a variation of the former policy was decided upon. You will find it set forth in Clause B of Section 4 of the first part of the agreement to be made between the management of Boarding Schools and the Department. A circular to the following effect was on the 26th January, last, sent to the Principals of all Industrial Schools:\u2014 \"I beg to advise you that it has been decided not to permit in future the admission of half-breed children as grant earners in Industrial Schools conducted by the Department for the education of Indian children. Furthermore no half-breed children shall be admitted to any of these schools unless Indian children cannot be obtained to complete the number of pupils for which a grant is provided in the Parliamentary appropriation; in which event the Superintendent General may permit the admission of any half-breed child but the Department will not pay any grant for such half-breed child nor any part of the cost of its maintenance or education whatever.\" The Principals of Boarding Schools are, of course, in possession of\n\nJ. A. J. McKenna, Esq.,\nInspector of Roman Catholic Indian Schools,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nof the facts through the contract under which their schools are now operated. Any cases of neglected half-breed children can be dealt with under the new ruling.\n\nThe admission of Indian children gathered at Medicine Hat by Inspector Graham to the High River Industrial School is no departure from the new regulation. Mr. Inspector Graham was instructed to take only Indian children and his notes on their parentage show that only Indian children were taken. They have accordingly been admitted as grant earners at the High River School and will be so considered, although different action might be based upon your remarks and the question of their parentage might be re-opened. The removal of the children from Medicine Hat, I may remark, was merely part of a larger scheme for the removal of Indians from the vicinity of that town.\n\nIt is the duty of the Provincial Governments to provide education for half-breeds and, while the Department does not intend to exclude those already in residence or to refuse under certain restrictions to take in additional half-breed pupils, it is only under condition that no expense will be fastened on the Dominion Government which should be borne by the Provincial Government.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nWinnipeg, 9th Nov., 1911.\n\nThe secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nOn my return from the farther west about a week ago I found awaiting me, among other letters, yours of the 17th ult., in reply to mine of the 30th September, last, in which, in advocating the admission to Indian schools of the children of half-breeds leading the Indian mode of life in accordance with the former policy of the Department - a policy which I regard as having been wisely designed in the public interest -, I drew attention to the inconsistency between the views in that respect expressed in the Report of the Superintendent of Indian Education, published in the Department's last appearing Blue Book, and the present practice of the Department.\n\nI note your statement that what I \"quote from the Superintendent of Indian Education's Report, published in the Annual Report of this Department for the year ended 31st March, 1910, was written before a variation of the former policy was decided upon\".\n\nIf you will refer to the Superintendent's Report, you will find that it is dated \"June 1, 1910\". On reference to the pamphlet entitled \"Correspondence and Agreement relating to the Maintenance and Management of Indian Boarding Schools\", you will find that there is printed therein a letter, dated November 25th, 1910, covering \"memorandum and draft contract\", which are stated to be \"the result of a conference held in Ottawa on November 8th\". And I was given to understand that at that conference a similar draft contract was submitted for consideration.\n\nNow, allowing a reasonable time for the gestation of the scheme embodied in the contract, its conception comes so\nclose to the time of the writing of the Superintendent's Report that I thought it was warranted in reading the contract in the light which that Report seemed to me to shed upon the Department's educational policy. I am sorry I was mistaken. And my sorrow is the greater in that I had so rejoiced at an official expression of what I took to be a policy, and a policy so in accord with the view I hold and have frequently pressed upon the Department since it departed, some considerable time before the framing of the said contract, from the practice of admitting to Indian schools as grant earners children of Half-breeds leading the Indian mode of life.\n\nIt is all very well to say, as you say in your letter, that \"it is the duty of the Provincial Governments to provide education for Half-breeds\"; but it is well known that there are no Provincial institutions in which the same can be provided, and that our Indian residential schools are the only existing agencies for the proper up-bringing of the unfortunate class of children referred to in my letter of the 30th September, last, and in other communications.\n\nThere are many people of mixed blood in treaty, who have in consequence the legal status of Indians; and there are Indians, as well as Half-breeds, not in treaty. I presume that it would not be thought of excluding from Indian schools the children of Indians not in treaty. But it is not easy to distinguish between natives of wholly Indian blood and those who have an admixture of white. Why, then, draw so hard and fast a line excluding all Half-breed children? It certainly seems arbitrary; and the ordinary observer, at least, cannot understand it.\n\nThe Government of the Dominion never took the position that it had no obligations at all as to Half-breeds. It recognized them as possessing, in a degree, an aboriginal title to the land of this country, and took measures to extinguish it. In other ways and at different times it helped these people. And having once given their children the right of entry as regular pupils of Indian residential schools it is hard to now debar them.\n\nIt is particularly hard, nay, it is unjust to exclude from these schools the illegitimate offspring of Indian women. There is no more unfortunate class in the country. In various\nreports and letters have brought several such cases to the attention of the Department. What is to keep them from becoming outcasts and menaces to society if they be not taken into Indian schools - schools established and maintained, be it remembered, not for the mere purpose of fulfilling the conditions of Indian treaties, but in the interest of the commonwealth. The Indian Act, under which the department itself exists, presupposes membership in Indian Bands for such children.\n\nSection 12 enacts as follows:\n\n\"Any illegitimate child may, unless he has, with the consent of the band whereof the father or mother of such child is a member, shared in the distribution moneys of such band for a period exceeding two years, be, at any time excluded from the membership thereof by the Superintendent General\".\n\nIt follows from that that the illegitimate child of an Indian woman who has membership in a band is ipso facto a member of the band to which the mother belongs, and can only be removed from membership in such band by the Superintendent General, if he sees fit to exercise the power conferred upon him by the law; and that, if the child has participated for over two years, with the consent of the band (and acquiescence would, I contend, constitute consent within the meaning of the provision), in the moneys of the band, then there is no authority under the law for his removal from membership.\n\nI submit that the illegitimate children of Indian women should be recognized as having membership in the band to which the mother belongs, unless the Superintendent General exercises his right to exclude him within the period aforesaid, which exclusion cannot be by way of a general order excluding all such children from band membership, but must be by specific order in each case; and that every such child not so excluded is entitled to all the benefits of band membership, including Indian educational privileges.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nLL.D., I.R.C.I.S.\nMr. McKenzie\n\nI knew we\nshe was up\nMrs. McKenzie\nwith Mr. J.\nalcohol.\n\ntel\nSir,\n\nBy an agreement between this Department and the different churches under whose auspices Indian boarding schools are conducted, which went into effect on April 1st, 1911, it is provided as follows:\u2014 \"That no Half-breed child shall be admitted to the said school unless Indian children cannot be obtained to complete the number authorized by Article I, Sec. 1, and Sec. 4 (a) of this agreement, in which event the Superintendent General may in his discretion permit the admission of any Half-breed child; but the Superintendent General will not pay any grant for any such Half-breed pupil provided under Article II, Sec. 1, of this agreement, nor any part of the cost of its maintenance or education whatever.\"\n\nOn the 26th of January, 1911, the same limitation was placed upon the admission of half-breeds to the Indian industrial schools throughout Canada.\n\nIt is considered advisable that your Department should be aware of these rulings. I enclose herewith a schedule of the boarding and industrial schools in the province of Alberta.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. S. McKenney, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 10th inst., in which you outline the limitations placed upon the admission of Half-breeds to the Indian Industrial Schools of Canada, also the list of such schools in the Province of Alberta. These will be found very useful for reference purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, May 2, 1912.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Rogers,\n\nWith reference to the question of the admission of halfbreed children to the Qu'Appelle industrial school, it appears from a report from Inspector McKenna that upon his examination of the register and the copy of the September quarterly return, it was evident that there were 64 pupils on the roll of this school who should be at once discharged, the reason given being that some were over age, others of the full age of 18 years, some at home without prospect of returning, and others were properly required at home. These 64 with two others who had recently been discharged left 66 vacancies. The Inspector says that, \"Fortunately there were many non-grant-earning pupils at the school, from among whom it was easy to select an equal number of metis of the same class as those Inspector Graham gathered in southern Alberta, on a tour specially authorized for\nfor the purpose, and placed as grant-earners in the St. Joseph's industrial school. As evidence of that I have endorsed my recommendation on each application for admission. Sixty-six, 31 boys and 35 girls, were selected, so as to bring the number of the authorized attendance up to that fixed by the Department.\n\nThe authorized attendance for this school is 225 and the per capita grant $130.00. The returns from the school for that quarter show a total attendance of 240, of which 225 were grant-earners, and 16 non-grant-earners. Mr. McKenna states that in his inspection he found 290 pupils there, or 66 non-grant-earners. This discrepancy is certainly one which calls for explanation on the part of the school authorities.\n\nThe following are the ages of the pupils discharged by Inspector McKenna:\n\n| Age Range | Number |\n|-----------|--------|\n| 8 - 10 years | 4 - 11 years |\n| 11 - 17 \"   | 2 - 10 \"   |\n| 2 - 16 \"    | 1 - 9 \"    |\n| 7 - 15 \"    |           |\n| 8 - 14 \"    |           |\n| 11 - 13 \"   |           |\n| 10 - 12 \"   |           |\nRegarding the sexes of these 64 the ages are as follows:\n\n**Girls**\n\n7 - 18 years  \n4 - 17 \"  \n1 - 16 \"  \n4 - 15 \"  \n2 - 14 \"  \n5 - 13 \"  \n4 - 12 \"  \n4 - 11 \"  \n2 - 10 \"  \n\n33\n\n**Boys**\n\n1 - 18 years  \n7 - 17 \"  \n1 - 16 \"  \n3 - 15 \"  \n6 - 14 \"  \n6 - 13 \"  \n6 - 12 \"  \n1 - 9 \"  \n\n31\n\nThe school age for grant-earning pupils is from 7 to 18 years. Of the 64 children discharged 49 are given as Indians with their bands named, and 15 as non-treaty Indians, bands not designated.\n\nThere may have been a few halfbreeds among these latter, but it is not so stated to the Department.\nThe 66 children recently admitted are given as half-breeds. No sufficiently detailed explanation is furnished to show why the pupils under 18 years of age should have been discharged. The absentees so far as the returns show, were 4 and these had only been home for a month, which leave they are allowed. At any rate the full number were paid for in that quarter as being present, according to the returns.\n\nThe proper course, and I assume that both the Rev. Father Hugonnard and Mr. McKenna were well aware of this, was to have reported the proposal to discharge the pupils, to the Department for ratification and to forward the application for admission, instead of this the discharge of 64 pupils and the admission of 66 apparently took place at the same time, before notification to the Department.\n\nIn the case of the children who were placed in the St. Joseph's industrial school by Inspector Graham, referred to by Mr. McKenna, the instructions to Mr. Graham were to recruit Indian children only, and his report is that he followed these instructions and none but Indian children were gathered by him for the school. If Mr. McKenna's contention that\nInspector Graham has taken Half-breed children when he knew or ought to have known such to be the case, is to be further considered, then Inspector Graham should be called upon to explain, although he is very emphatic in his report that he took none but Indians.\n\nThe question is once more raised as to whether the Department of Indian Affairs should provide educational facilities for Half-breed children. Legally the Half-breed is a white person, and the education of the whites belongs to the province, not to the Dominion. This is the law: how far should an exception be made?\n\nIn 1899 the matter came before the Hon. Mr. Sifton, then Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, who gave a ruling, a full copy of which I herewith attach and from which I quote, \"A well defined line can be drawn between 'Half-breeds properly speaking, and Indians. While I do not consider that the children of the Half-breeds proper of Manitoba and the Territories should be admitted into Indian schools and paid for by the Department I am decidedly of the opinion that all children even those of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not, who live upon an Indian Reserve and whose parents on either side, live as Indians upon a Reserve, even if they are not annuitants, should be eligible for admission to the schools.\"\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Sifton in his ruling confines himself to those of mixed blood living as Indians upon a reserve.\nand throughout the whole of his ruling he does not go beyond that.\n\nIn 1910 a Conference was held with the various churches interested in Indian education, and as a result of this Conference it was decided amongst other things that the Boarding schools should enter into an agreement with the Government relative to the conduct of the school, and one of the clauses of the agreement is as follows:-\n\n\"Section (4) -(b) That no Half-breed child shall be admitted to the said school unless Indian children cannot be obtained to complete the number authorized by Article I, Sec. 1, and Sec. 4 (a) of this agreement, in which event the Superintendent General may in his discretion permit the admission of any Half-breed child; but the Superintendent General will not pay any grant for any such Half-breed pupil provided under Article II, Sec. 1, of this agreement, nor any part of the cost of its maintenance or education whatever.\" This agreement, of course, does not apply in terms to Industrial Schools, but on the 26th January, 1911 following the principle laid down with reference to Boarding Schools, a letter was sent to the principals of all the Industrial Schools imposing on them a similar condition as to the admission of Half-breeds. A copy of the letter is herewith enclosed. I may say in this connection that the same churches are interested in the control of Industrial as well as of Boarding Schools.\nEducational institutions established and maintained by the Indian Department are certainly for the Indians, and if the door is opened to allow the admission of a section of the population legally classified as whites, and who in no other way are sharers in the work of the Indian Department, to make use of these schools, when their education belongs to an entirely different jurisdiction, we are face to face with a pretty large and serious problem. The wholesale admission of the 66 Half-breeds to one Indian school is an indication of how extensively this work may be carried on if allowed to apply to the 19 industrial schools and the 54 Boarding schools. Furthermore it is not shown that the province has not included these Half-breeds as forming part of the population for whose education provincial funds are provided, and so far as the Department is aware, these Half-breeds are shown in the Census returns as whites.\n\nFrank Padley\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, June 1, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo in reference to the half-breed children admitted to the Qu'Appelle Industrial School on October 1st, last, and at present resident therein.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the circumstances of the admission of these children, the Department will allow the grant for them, but upon the distinct understanding that all of them are to be removed from the school as quickly as possible and all to be out of the school within one year from the 30th of the current month (June). Their places can then be filled with Indian children up to the number authorized for the school.\n\nYou should prepare and forward your March quarter return as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Hugonard,\nPrincipal,\nQU'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\nOTTAWA. October 16, 1913.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nI have discussed with the Minister the question of the admission of halfbreeds to our boarding and industrial schools.\n\nPrevious to January 26, 1911, halfbreed children were admitted to these schools under certain conditions. While it was not considered that the children of halfbreeds proper of Manitoba and the Territories should be admitted into Indian schools and paid for by the Department, it was conceded that all children, even those of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not who live upon an Indian reserve and whose parents on either side live as Indians, even if they are not annuitants, should be eligible for admission to the schools.\n\nIt has been decided to revert to this rule. Abuses, however, must be guarded against and every application for admission should be accompanied by satisfactory evidence that the applicant is a halfbreed to whom the rule applies, and not a person who has been\nadopted by or otherwise brought into association with Indians with the express purpose of gaining admission to our schools.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, March 20, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIn the new agreement with boarding schools, which goes into effect on April 1st next, no children under seven years of age are to be admitted to these institutions and, in order that there will be no discrimination, the Department has decided that seven should be the minimum age of entrance to industrial schools also. Each and every application for admission to both boarding and industrial schools must either come through the office of the local Indian Agent or have his approval, before being submitted to the Department.\n\nIt has also been ruled that in future half-breeds will not be allowed in residence in these schools unless the number of Indian children for which there is accommodation cannot be obtained, in which event the Department may authorize the admission of half-breed children as non-grant earners.\n\nI would ask you, therefore, in each case to check carefully all applications that come before you having particular reference to age and status of the applicants.\n\nKindly notify the Principals of schools in your Agency of the requirements as to applications, and acknowledge the receipt of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst Deputy & Secretary.\nSir,\u2014\nThe Department desires to emphasize a very important feature of the work of Indian Agents, viz., their duties respecting Boarding and Industrial Schools, especially their attitude towards recruiting for these institutions.\n\nOn many of the reserves the Indians show a disinclination to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the residential schools to obtain an education for their children. The Department has endeavoured, and it is believed with considerable success, to raise the standard of these schools, not only as regards the class-room work, but also the buildings, sanitary conditions and equipment. Notwithstanding this, the apathy of the parents is in many cases apparent, and there are some schools which are not able to obtain their quota of pupils.\n\nIt is considered that the active influence of Indian Agents and other officers of the Department would, to a large extent, overcome this indifference. As you know, the Department has power under Sections 9 and 10 of the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children (a copy of which is inclosed herewith) to place in these schools children who are not being properly cared for or educated, and you are specially directed to bring all such cases, if any, in your agency, to the attention of the Department, in order that Sections 9 and 10 of the Regulations may be enforced, if, in the opinion of the Department, such action is deemed necessary. In dealing with cases of this class, you should make a separate report on each case, giving full particulars as to the names, condition, and religion of the parents or guardian, also band to which they belong, age, sex, physical condition and band number of the child to be dealt with; and also state whether the child has attended school previously or not.\n\nYou will be required to give this matter your careful and sympathetic attention and at once confer with the Principals of the Boarding and Industrial Schools who may recruit in your agency, with a view to co-operating with them and lending them every assistance in your power. When recruiting, orphan children and children neglected by their parents should have the preference.\n\nIn order that these instructions may be given effect to, you should, at the end of each quarter, submit a list of the children of school age in your agency not attending school, with explanation as to the cause of their absence.\n\nAs you are aware, Boarding Schools are now operated by the different religious bodies under contract, and a copy of this contract is inclosed herewith in order that Agents may familiarize themselves with it. The Department desires that Agents shall visit and thoroughly inspect Boarding Schools, and Industrial, if any, within their jurisdiction at least once every three months. The inspection should include all the various features of the work as referred to in the contract. In addition to these inspections entailing extended reports, the Department will require monthly visits, if practicable, in order that any matters needing immediate attention may be dealt with. Short reports should be made after each of these visits.\n\nI shall be glad to have an acknowledgment of this letter.\n\nDUNCAN C. SCOTT,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nOff ve, September 9, 1912,\n\nSir,\n\nOn March 30th last, the Department requested the Principals of all Normal and Industrial schools to submit each quarter an additional return showing the enrollment of pupils other than the recognized Indian children for whom the grant is allowed.\n\nNo such return accompanied the regular June quarterly return from your school. It is necessary, therefore, that you have no children in your institution such as are referred to in the third paragraph of the instructions of March 30th; but, if this be so, you will be good enough, in future, to make a statement to that effect and attach it to the usual return of attendance.\n\nA second copy of the memorandum above referred to is attached hereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\nLetter 20 ags\n\nre admission to\nBoard school\n\nMr. X affirms wrote\ncovering letter 2 show whether\nchild is a charge or not\n\nalso religion O.C.\nIndian Boarding School\nFort Alexander, Man.\nMarch 9/14\n\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to ask to be kind enough to let me know in what consists the recent ruling concerning the admission of half-breeds into the Indian Schools and which was put in force last October.\n\nMany Half-breeds are speaking to me about that new law; and I do not know anything about it.

As you are aware since the 1st April, 1911, Half-breeds have not been admitted as grant earners to any of these schools. This line of action has proved in some cases to work injury to a certain class of Half-breeds and it is this that the Department wishes to remedy.\n\nIt has been decided to admit children of mixed blood whether legitimate or not who live upon an Indian Reserve and whose parents on either side live as Indians even if they are not annuitants.\n\nIt is not proposed by any means that this Department should furnish educational facilities for Half-breeds proper and every application for admission must be accompanied by satisfactory evidence that the applicant is a Half-breed to show the rule applies.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

At the Crooked Lake Boarding School, Cowessess Reserve, I have just learned that there are not less than ten of these children who should not have been admitted. In forwarding the report of the Qu'Appelle School a short time ago, I drew your attention to the case of a child who should not have been there, and I am informed by the Agent at Crooked Lake that this is not the only case, but, as a matter of fact, that there are five or six cases of children who should not be in this school. I am of the opinion that this condition of affairs prevails at other schools in the Province. You will remember the great difficulty we had in this connection about five or six years ago - fully 20% of the children attending the Qu'Appelle School being those of non-treaty half-breeds, whose duty it was to look after their own children's education. It took me about two years to clean the situation up, and I was under the impression at that time that there would be no recurrence of it, and that safeguards had been taken to prevent the\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n----------\nthe admission of any but bona-fide Indian children to our Schools, etc., I am told that these half-breed children are there with the consent of the Department. If this is so, it seems to me that we are rapidly putting ourselves into the same position as we were in some years ago. What I would like to know is: Is the intention of the Department to allow half-breed children to be admitted to our Indian Schools and draw a grant? You are aware that numerous schemes are resorted to in order to make it appear as if the Department were responsible for the care of certain half-breed children who were admitted. For instance, half-breeds' children are handed over to Indians for adoption in order to evade the regulations of the Department. I was labouring under the impression that we had a close check upon this matter, and that there was no chance of a recurrence of the situation that prevailed in the past, but it seems to me, from reports I have received from Agents and Principals, that half-breed children are being admitted to our Schools. I am quite satisfied, however, in regard to the Gordon's and File Hills Schools that no half-breeds have been admitted to these Institutions. Unless, therefore, some decided step is taken to put an end to the practice of admitting non-treaty children to our Schools, the Department is bound to be faced with difficulties later on in regard to same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK. Oct. 29th, 1921\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReferring again to my letter written to you recently regarding the half-breed children who have been admitted to our Indian schools throughout the Province, I beg to say that a short time ago a representative of the Soldiers Settlement Board was visiting Cowessess Indian Reserve, and reported that there were Indian children not attending school in a certain house, where a man was drawing a pension. I made enquiries, and find that the house in which the children referred to were, was not that of a Treaty Indian, but a half-breed living on the edge of the Reserve. However, the Agent tells me these children are admitted to the Cowessess school with your authority, and should have been in attendance.\n\nTo be frank, I am afraid we are admitting far more half-breed children into these schools than we should, to the detriment of the Indians. In Cowessess school, there are at the present time nine non-Treaty children, and two more have gone forward for approval. At File Hills I have not admitted one non-Treaty child in the school, and there are other schools throughout the country that are carrying out the Department's wish with regard to admitting Indian children only. But, I am afraid the privilege granted has again been abused, and we are practically in the same position now as we were seven or eight years ago, by having our schools over-run by non-Treaty Indians.\n\nAnother matter I would like to have a ruling on\u2014Once these children are admitted, have we jurisdiction over them? Can non-Treaty parents take out their children from school and decide when to send them back? I regret exceedingly that these children are in school. At one time, we had a good clean-up, and it was an easy matter to have kept the schools freed from children, who, in my opinion, have no right to be there.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOttawa, October 27, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 20th instant with reference to the admission of half-breed children into the various Indian boarding schools of Saskatchewan. I have noted that you have learned that there are not less than ten of these children who should not have been admitted at the Crooked Lake boarding school, Cowessess reserve.\n\nAs you know, the policy of the Department has been to admit to our residential schools half-breed children who are living the Indian mode of life on a reserve. It has been the practice of this Department to ascertain, upon the receipt of an application for the admission of a half-breed child, if the applicant comes under the rule that has been followed. I had the file for admissions to the Crooked Lake boarding school searched for any possible oversight, and I am convinced that reasonable care has been taken to ensure authority for admission for those half-breed children only who are living on a reserve and have adopted the Indian mode of life.\n\nIf you will be good enough to look into this matter more fully and give me specific information concerning the names and numbers of such pupils as you believe should not have been admitted to the schools of Saskatchewan, the Department will be in a better position to look into your request.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nNovember 4, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 29th ultimo referring further to the admission of half-breed children into our Indian residential schools in Saskatchewan. Before replying in detail, I will await your answer to my communication of the 27th ultimo in connection with this matter.\n\nI might state, referring to the applications of the two non-Treaty children into Cowessess boarding school, that this Department wrote for further information to Mr. Agent Taylor. His reply is to hand this morning and is such that it will be impossible to authorize their admission. I have instructed the Schools Branch to prepare a circular letter to all agents, asking them to exercise care before endorsing the application of any child for admission to a residential school. In the past it appears that our employees in the field have neglected to notice that when signing the application they were stating that they believed the applicant to be eligible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nNovember 9th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department directs your attention to the necessity of the most careful examination of application forms in favour of Indian children who are presented for admission to residential schools. I have, therefore, to invite your attention to, and compliance with, the subjoined facts and instructions.\n\nOn the \"Application for Admission\" form the agent signs the following declaration: \"I hereby approve of the admission of the above child and certify that he is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\"\n\nThere is a departmental ruling to the effect that half-breed children living the Indian mode of life on a reserve are eligible for admission to the boarding and industrial schools, or, more fully: \"While it was not considered that the children of half-breeds proper of Manitoba and the Prairie Provinces should be admitted into Indian schools and paid for by the Department, it was conceded that all children, even those of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not who live upon an Indian reserve and whose parents on either side live as Indians, even if they are not annuitants, should be eligible for admission to the schools. Houses, however, must be guarded against and every application for admission should be accompanied by satisfactory evidence that the applicant is a half-breed to whom the rule applies, and not a person who has been adopted by or otherwise brought into association with Indians with the express purpose of gaining admission to our schools.\"\n\nAt the time you forward an application, write a covering letter in the case of half-breed or non-Treaty children, giving your reasons for believing the child to be a charge on the Indian Department.\n\nWhen you have reason to believe that the accommodation of the boarding or industrial school is limited, preference should be given to orphan children or those that are neglected by their parents.\n\nExercise every care to ensure the placing of the child in a residential school under the auspices of the religious denomination to which the parents adhere. No Roman Catholic child shall be sent to a Protestant school, and vice versa. You will please adhere strictly to this provision of the Act. (See Section 10 of the Indian Act). Concerning the ages of applicants for admission to our residential schools, only in very exceptional cases will the Department authorize the admission of any child other than between the ages of 7 and 13 inclusive.\n\nCheck carefully all applications that come before you, paying particular attention to the age, religion and status of the applicant before asking the Department to admit them as grant-earning pupils to a Boarding or industrial school.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nCowesses Boarding School as the adopted children of William Trottier, an Indian, whom it was claimed was their Uncle. These children are under the law white children, and it is the duty, not of the Indian Department, but of the Government of Saskatchewan to look after them.\n\nANDREW LAVALLIE, School No. 801, son of Napoleon Lavallee a half-breed living North of the Reserve.

This child is the daughter of Robert Lavallee, a non-treaty man, who does not live on the Reserve. This man works for white settlers and follows the mode of life of a white man, and is a white man in the eyes of the law. The girl's mother was a treaty woman.\n\nSERAPHINE LAVALLIE, School No. 071. The father of this girl is a non-treaty half-breed who does not live on the Reserve. This man works for white farmers and follows a white man's mode of living.\n\nJ. P. FLAMMOND, School No. 67. Both the parents of this child died of influenza. They did not live on the Reserve. The child was placed in the Cowesses School as the adopted child of J. B. Spavier.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 27th ultimo, No. 150,000-9, with reference to the admission of half-breed children to our residential schools, I may say that I was quite aware of the Department's policy in regard to the admission to our schools of Indian children who are living the Indian mode of life on Reserves, and, of course, had this in mind when I wrote you on the 20th ultimo.\n\nI note that you think that reasonable care has been taken to ensure authority for admission to our schools of the children referred to in my letter. The following is a list of non-treaty half-breed children admitted to the Schools, viz:\n\nDORVIA, MARY and ESTER HELLINGER, School Nos. 074, 076 and 078 respectively. The father of these children was a half-breed living on his own land off the Reserve, and he enjoyed the privileges of a white man. Both the father and mother died of influenza, and the children mentioned were placed in Cowessess.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCowessess Boarding School as the adopted children of William Trottier, an Indian, whom it was claimed was their Uncle. These children are under the law white children, and it is the duty, not of the Indian Department, but of the Government of Saskatchewan to look after them.\n\nANDREW LAVALLIE, School No. 80; son of Napoleon Lavallee a half-breed living North of the Reserve. The child's mother is a member of the Cowessess Band. Napoleon Lavallee is a non-treaty half-breed, and follows a white man's mode of life. This boy should not be in the Cowessess Boarding School.\n\nFLORENTINE LAVALLIE, School No. 078. Both the parents of this child are living. The father resides on his own place off the Reserve. He has no connection with the Department, and follows a white man's mode of life.\n\nPHILIP FLEURY, School No. 77. Both the parents of this child are dead. Adopted by William Trottier, who also adopted the three Belliveau children, and I doubt if any of these four children ever spent a single day in this man's house.\n\nMARGUERITE LAVALLIE, School No. 068. This child is the daughter of Norbert Lavallee, a non-treaty man, who does not live on the Reserve. This man works for white settlers, and follows the mode of life of a white man, and is a white man in the eyes of the law. The girl's mother was a treaty woman.\n\nSERAPHINE LAVALLIE, School No. 071. The father of this girl is a non-treaty half-breed who does not live on the Reserve. This man works for white farmers and follows a white man's mode of living.\n\nJ. B. FLAMMOND, School No. 67. Both the parents of this child died of influenza. They did not live on the Reserve. The child was placed in the Cowessess School as the adopted child of J. B. Spavier.\nSpavier, an Indian of the Cowesses Band. This, in my opinion, is a case for the Saskatchewan Government, and not for the Indian Department.\n\nROSE ADRIELLE, ATHOLE ROSE and ALPHONSE\n\nPELLETIER: The father of these children is a non-treaty half-breed, who does not live on the Reserve. Although their father is living, these children have been placed in the Department's School as the adopted children of Edward Pelletier, an Indian. Of course, you can see why this man's name has been used as the adopted parent.\n\nThere are also two children of Napoleon Lavallee attending the Qu'Appelle School who should not be there, and there may be many other children in the same position as far as I know.\n\nI might point out that when we discharged some thirty-three half-breed children out of the Qu'Appelle School several years ago, in nearly every case it was claimed by those in authority that the children were adopted by Indians, but the decision of the Department at that time was that these children were not wards of the Government, and they were accordingly discharged from the School. The present cases are no different from those dealt with at that time. If the Department has changed its views since then I was not advised of the fact, and if children, such as I have referred to, are to be admitted to our Indian Schools, I can assure you that we will have no difficulty in filling them. At the Pile Hills and other Schools I know of, the authorities have not attempted to bring in non-treaty children.\n\nVery often cases of half-breed orphan children are brought to my attention in different ways, and I have always taken the view that it was the Provincial Government's duty, and not our Department's, to look after them. However, I would like to have the matter straightened out again, so that there will be no misunderstanding.\n-ing, and also to enable me to advise our Agents just what children the Department are prepared to look after as our policy must be uniform.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 10, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the admission of half-breed children into our residential schools. I have noted carefully the details that you give in connection with specific instances of half-breeds who are grant-earning pupils in the Cowessess boarding and Qu'Appelle Industrial schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the correspondence and application forms have been carefully examined, and, generally speaking, the facts at the disposal of the Department agree with the details that you have enumerated.\n\nDevine, Mary and Ester Belliumer, School Nos. 077, 072 and 075 respectively. These children are orphans, and whereas the application for No. 077 was signed by the guardian, William Trotter, the applications for the other two girls were over the signature of the grandfather, whose name is Landry. In the case of the application for No. 077 it was stated that she was paid annuity on Ticket No. 148. In these cases, as in the others that will be enumerated, the application forms were signed by the agent. In connection with Nos. 072 and 075, Mr. Agent Taylor forwarded a covering letter, strongly recommending their admission to the Cowessess school.\n\nAndrew Lavallee, School No. 80. The application for this boy was signed by the mother, who draws annuity on ticket No. 165 of the Cowessess band.\n\nFlorestine Lavallee, School No. 078. The application for this girl was signed by the mother, who draws annuity on ticket No. 193 of the Cowessess band.\n\nPhilip Fleury, School No. 77. The application for this boy is over the signature of the grandfather, named Landry; both parents are dead.\nMarguerite Lavallee, School No. 068. The mother of this girl, who was a member of the Cowessess band, is dead.\n\nJ. F. Flanmood, School No. 67. The application for this boy's admittance was signed by the mother, who is paid annuity on ticket No. 194 of the Cowessess band. There was a covering letter from the agent, recommending admission.\n\nRose Adelle, Athole Rose and Alphonse Pelletier. It was stated on the application forms for these three Pelletier children that they were all paid annuity on ticket No. 106 of the Cowessess band. The mother is dead and the children have been adopted by Edward Pelletier. This last named man, according to our own records, is paid treaty for these three children. This suggests to my mind that the adoption was seriously undertaken.\n\nSeraphine Lavallee, School No. 071. The case of this girl is the same as that of two others of the same family, school numbers 0560 and 588, at the Qu'Appelle Industrial school. The father signs the application forms in all three cases; the mother draws annuity on ticket No. 165 of the Cowessess band. In covering letter Mr. Agent Taylor states that the parents are following the Indian mode of life. I have noted your statement that Napoleon Lavallee works for white farmers and follows a white man's mode of living.\n\nYou will observe that the information at our disposal on application forms and in covering letters agrees, with one or two exceptions, with the details of your letter to which I am referring. In your letter all the facts why these children should not be admitted into residential schools are presented; in the information that we have, additional details make it appear that the children are charges upon the Indian Department, under the ruling that we can admit Indian children who are living the Indian mode of life on reserves.\n\nYou will now appreciate the difficulties that the Department faces when it comes to making a fair ruling in connection with the admission of children. In many cases, where insufficient information is to hand, before the admission is approved, it is our habit to write to the agent...\nin the field for more details. It has not been customary to approve for admission all children whose applications are at hand, even when they are over the signature of the agent, who declares that he approves and certifies the eligibility of the Indian child to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nThe half-breed problem always will present its difficulties, and the Department sometimes admits children who are destitute orphans, as much upon the dictates of charity as of duty. You will remember, in connection with our correspondence regarding the admission of half-breeds into treaty, that in April 1919 you felt that men who had been allowed to live upon a reserve and who were recognizing it as their home, were eligible for annuity payments.\n\nThe result of this correspondence is that the Department is impressed with the advisability of a closer check upon all applicants seeking admission to Indian residential schools. The School Branch has received its instructions from me, and a circular has been prepared in connection with this and related matters. This will be forwarded to all agents in Ontario and Western Canada. A copy will be mailed to you under separate cover. The Department is clear as to the general rule that will be followed, as outlined in this circular letter. Specific cases where the child is a non-treaty half-breed or is doubtful for any other reason, will be dealt with from time to time as the applications are brought to our notice. It is not considered necessary to ask for the discharge of the children that have been under review, but I can assure you that in the future still more care will be exercised in connection with this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nRe your circular letter of November 9th. in the matter of examination of application forms of children presented for admission to Residential Schools; I would like to ask your advice in the following specific case:\n\nA half-breed man whose father and mother reside on a reserve marries an Indian woman and has children. The law of B.C. allows the husband to take up a pre-emption in the ordinary way under the land act. He does so and removes with his family to it. The pre-emption is bordering the reserve. He has not crown granted the pre-emption but may do so in a few years or he may return to the reserve. Am I to regard that until he crown grants his land and cuts loose entirely from the reserve on which he was born, that he is in a stage of transition; (as I consider that he has still an interest in the reserve), and that his children are eligible for admission to Industrial and Residential Schools or am I to consider them not eligible?\n\nI wish to state that I have had two cases of half-breeds starting out on a plan to get a pre-emption and cut loose from the reserve, and then after a year or so, considering that they were better off on the reserve, abandoning their pre-emptions and returning to the reserves.\n\nProvincial Schools are averse to taking breed children and you can understand that the families that I instance are far removed from any chance of a Provincial School for some years to come.\n\nKindly advise.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.J.McA.; JHFL.\n\nInd.Agt.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your circular dated the 9th inst., regarding the necessity for the most careful perusal by Agents of the application forms in favour of Indian children presented for admission to our residential schools. Your circular appears to me to clearly set forth what children are eligible, and if your instructions are carried out should meet the situation.\n\nThe thought has occurred to me that a further safeguard would be added if the Agents were advised to forward the applications through this office, as we have a knowledge of the Indian families as well as a large percentage of the half-breed families residing in the Prairie Provinces. We have had our greatest trouble in connection with applications for the admission of half-breed children at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, and I am familiar with the families residing upon, and surrounding the Reserves from which the pupilage of that school is recruited. I offer this as a suggestion believing thereby having a double check on the applications we will to a large extent eliminate the trouble. It is my earnest desire to co-operate fully with you in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, Nov. 28, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 17th instant, in which you acknowledge receipt of our circular concerning admission to residential schools.\n\nYou have asked for a ruling on the children of a half-breed who marries an Indian woman and takes up a pre-emption bordering on the reserve. The Department is of the opinion that, until such time as the Crown grants him patent to his new land, he still has an interest in the reserve, and that, while in such stage of transition, his children are eligible for admission to industrial and boarding schools.\n\nHowever, it is our wish that in any case of this type, full particulars be forwarded in a covering letter along with the application form.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

The School Branch has been instructed to exercise every care with the application forms that come to their attention, and in cases of doubt they will not hesitate to refer to your office, cases that are difficult to understand.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M.

Taylor for the admission of Maurice and Maggie Lavallee to the Cowessess Boarding School. Agent Taylor states in his letter that in view of the recent ruling of the Department above referred to, he considered it advisable not to make a recommendation, but to forward the applications on to me for my opinion in regard to same. I have written to Agent Taylor that these children are not eligible for admission into the School, and as this is the first refusal in this respect that has taken place in recent years, I would ask the Department to stand by the decision I have made and not admit the children into the School. The fact that non-treaty half breed children have been admitted to our Schools and are being paid for by the Department is no reason why the Rev. Father Carrierie should think that these particular children should receive any consideration in this respect. I am returning the applications to Agent Taylor, and instructing him to advise the Rev. Father Carrierie that the children cannot be admitted to our Schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 3, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 28th ultimo, referring to the applications of Maurice and Maggie Lavallee to the Cowessess Boarding School. I have noted that Mr. Agent Taylor was in doubt as to the eligibility of these children and sent the applications to Regina for your recommendation, and that you returned them and instructed him to advise the Reverend Principal that the children could not be admitted.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that I am pleased our agents are beginning to take a personal interest in this question of eligibility for admission to Indian residential schools. Will you secure these applications of Maurice and Maggie Lavallee and forward them to the Department, with Mr. Agent Taylor's and your own recommendations. The facts concerning all applicants, whether successful or not, should be kept on file at Ottawa.\n\nIf our agents in the field will make favourable or unfavourable recommendations in cases of doubtful eligibility, the Department will be in a good position to keep a careful check on half-breeds who are seeking admission to our Indian residential schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Dec. 2nd, 1921\n\n560589\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 28th ultimo with reference to the admission of Indian children to residential schools.\n\nIn this connection I may inform you that I have instructed the Inspectors to look carefully into all cases of half-breed children attending our residential schools, and to inform the Principals that only half-breeds who are bonafide residents on the Reserves and who follow the Indian mode of life, are entitled to have their children admitted to our schools.\n\nSince your circular was issued to Agents and Principals, I have been in receipt of two applications for the admission of half-breed children whose homes are outside of the boundaries of the Reserve, and consequently not entitled to admission.\n\nIt goes to show that apparently no matter how carefully you issue instructions they are misunderstood in some instances. Therefore, it will be necessary to exercise the utmost precaution in connection with this question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.W. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

I also enclose copy of Mr. Taylor's letter of the 13th inst., from which you will see that he does not recommend the admission of these children on the ground that their parents are non-treaty Indians. I endorse the remarks of the Agent, and cannot recommend the admission of these children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCrooked Lake,\nBroadview, Dec. 12th, 1921.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter #304/14 B dated December 9th 1921, I am returning herewith applications of Maurice and Maggie Lavallee for admission to Cowessess Boarding School, as requested.\n\nAs I stated in my letter to you of the 23rd ultimo, the parents of these children are non-treaty Indians, and as it is against the rule of the Department to admit children of non-treaty to Boarding Schools, I forward the applications to you as I could not see my way to recommend the admission of these children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) E. Taylor,\nAgent.\n\nW. W. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nSir,\u2014 I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Nov. 9th ultimo with reference to \"the admission of children to Residential Schools.\"\n\nIn this Agency, we have a number of \"illegitimate\" children, and it is difficult to distinguish the difference between half-breeds and Indian children, in many cases. In fact, if we judge by appearance, many of the children are half-breeds; but the \"legal\" parents are Indians. A few of the Indians leave their legal husbands and wives, and live with other Indians, and, in some cases, with whites. We take care, in keeping whites from residing on Indian reserves, and will not allow privileges to children of persons married (Indian women) to whites.\n\nWe have but one residential school available, for our Indians, at Coqualeetsza Institute, many hundreds of miles removed from the Agency, on the mainland of B.C. It is under the auspices of the Methodist Church, while the Massette, the large Band, are all Anglicans. We sent seven children to Coqualeetsza Institute, recently, and making arrangements to send six more. No Anglican Residential school open for these children, and none of the Massette attended any Anglican school, in recent years, for the reason that no such school is available.\n\nNo Roman Catholic children in this Agency; hence no question regarding the religion of the pupils.\n\nThe principle of Coqualeetsza Industrial Institute requires that children shall be twelve years of age, or under that age; this precludes many, although some have been taken, over twelve years of age.\n\nFifty more children would attend a residential school in this neighbourhood, or in the vicinity. Many parents object to sending their children so many hundreds of miles from home. If the education of the Indian children is sought, the Day School, attended only a few months in the year, will not assist very much, in the education of the Indian children, growing up and increasing in numbers.\n\nChildren, returning from far-away schools, appear foreign to the surroundings here, and are not making good members of the community. In fact, they are the worst element we have.\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIt may be possible, that we expect too much from the Indian returning from a residential school; but results show for themselves. We are aware that the residential school, attended by our Indians, is conducted in the best manner possible, by earnest workers; but the young men and women come home, with ideas and ideals at variance with those of their parents, and consider themselves charges on their people, instead of getting out, and making homes for themselves. They revert back, to the old customs and habits of their forefathers, instead of progressing further, morally, socially and intellectually.\n\nI have always carefully looked into the status of those sent to Coqualeetza Industrial Institute, and will comply with the instructions contained in your communication. The younger children are more interested in obtaining the fruits of education than ever before; unfortunately they are taken away, to canneries and fishing camps, during the Spring and Summer. If we could place all of the children in Boarding Schools, the year round, they would all be on a level, and good results would follow.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\n(Kindly note that I am suffering from a \"broken collar-bone,\" and compelled to write with the left hand.

Harris, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Simpson,\nN.W.T.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nNovember 9th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department directs your attention to the necessity of the most careful examination of application forms in favour of Indian children who are presented for admission to residential schools. I have, therefore, to invite your attention to, and compliance with, the subjoined facts and instructions.\n\nOn the \"Application for Admission\" form, the agent signs the following declaration: \"I hereby approve of the admission of the above child and certify that he is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\"\n\nThere is a departmental ruling to the effect that half-breed children living the Indian mode of life on a reserve are eligible for admission to the boarding and industrial schools, or, more fully: \"While it was not considered that the children of half-breeds proper of Manitoba and the Prairie Provinces should be admitted into Indian schools and paid for by the Department, it was conceded that all children, even those of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not who live upon an Indian reserve and whose parents on either side live as Indians, even if they are not annuitants, should be eligible for admission to the schools. Houses, however, must be refused against any every application for admission should be accompanied by satisfactory evidence that the applicant is a half-breed to whom the rule applies, and not a person who has been adopted by or otherwise brought into association with Indians with the express purpose of gaining admission to our schools.\"\n\nAt the time you forward an application, write a covering letter in the case of half-breed or non-Treaty children, giving your reasons for believing the child to be a charge on the Indian Department.\n\nWhen you have reason to believe that the accommodation of the boarding or industrial school is limited, preference should be given to orphan children or those that are neglected by their parents.\n\nExercise every care to ensure the placing of the child in a residential school under the auspices of the religious denomination to which the parents adhere. No Roman Catholic child shall be sent to a Protestant school, and vice versa. You will please adhere strictly to this provision of the Act. (See Section 10 (a) of the Indian Act). Concerning the age of applicants for admission to our residential schools, only in very exceptional cases will the Department authorize the admission of any child other than between the ages of 7 and 15 inclusive.\n\nCheck carefully all applications that come before you, giving particular attention to the age, religion and status of the applicant before asking the Department to admit them as grant-earning pupils to a Boarding or Industrial school.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am instructed to express through you to the Department of Indian Affairs the feeling of the Anglican Church in the Diocese of Moosonee regarding the regulation governing the admission of Halfbreeds to our Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nMoved by Rev George Prewer\n\nSeconded by Rev R.S.Cushing and resolved,\n\n\"That this Synod places itself on record as not being in favour of the present ruling of the Department of Indian Affairs with reference to the Education of children of Indian mothers with White fathers, commonly called Halfbreeds; the Department having ruled that all children born of White fathers take the status of the father and are not eligible for admission to our Indian Boarding Schools.\"\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of Synod.\nOttawa, May 22, 1925.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, relative to a motion by the Synod of the Anglican Church in the Diocese of Moosonee, regarding the regulation governing the admission of half-breeds to Indian residential schools.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that the Department has not ruled \"that all children born of white fathers \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 are not eligible for admission to Indian boarding schools.\" Our ruling is to the effect that half-breed children living the Indian mode of life on a reserve are eligible \u2014 or, more fully, half-breed children, whether legitimate or not, who live upon an Indian reserve, or, in the case of Northern Ontario, in an Indian community, and whose parents on either side live as Indians, even if they are not annuitants, are eligible for admission to the schools.\n\nAbuses, however, must be guarded against, and the Department asks that every application for admission should be accompanied by satisfactory evidence that the applicant is a half-breed to whom the rule applies, and not a person who has been adopted by, or otherwise brought into association with, Indians with the express purpose of gaining admission to our schools.\n\nI should be pleased if you would make the interested members of the Synod acquainted with the Department's wishes in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., APRIL 17TH, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th inst., No. 105-1-10, acknowledging mine of the 4th inst., with regard to certain half breed children who are reported to have been in attendance at Duck Lake Boarding School.\n\nIn the last paragraph of your letter, you draw my attention to the fact that certain half breeds are admitted to Indian Residential Schools. I may say, I was perfectly aware of this. I am surprised, however, to learn that in order to be considered eligible they have to be living the Indian mode of life. The question is, where is the distinction between the life they are living and the Indian mode of life? Eighty per cent of the half breeds in this country might qualify for admission to schools, if that were all that is required. If living the Indian mode of life makes them eligible to be admitted to our institutions, I have been on the wrong track for the last six years.\n\nI think this refers only to half breeds living on Indian Reserves; and this was the ruling I had at one time from the Department. I had thirty-five children discharged from the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, who were taking up space that belonged to Indians, and who were being fed and educated on money voted by Parliament for the care of Indians. When these children were discharged from the School at Lebret, the claim was made that they were living as Indians; so they are, they are living in log houses out near Reserves, or in old houses in the suburbs of towns. This, I suppose, would be classed as living as Indians.\n\nI notice that you are taking care to ascertain if the applicant comes under the Department's ruling. Might I ask what precautions are taken? Is this left entirely to the school authorities, or is there a Government officer making a report on this matter? For the Department's information, I may say I turn down about twenty applications every year.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nyear, for admission of children to schools, on the\ngrounds that it is the duty of the Provincial author-\nities to look after cases of non-treaty half breeds\nwho neglect their children.\n\nOnce more, I would draw the attention of the\nDepartment to the fact that I worked hard and got\nevery child out of the Qu'Appelle School who had no\nright to be there; but I am not going to keep re-\nfusing these applicants if it is decided by the\nDepartment, that we should admit half breeds living\nas Indians, on the reserves; and if this is the\nclass of persons you want to admit to our schools, I\nwill fit the Elkhorn School in three weeks. Personally\nI think the Department are making a serious mistake.\nOnce the thin edge of the wedge is in, there will be\nno curtailing, and all half breed cases are prac-\ntically on a par. You can see the position I am\nin, refusing them here, and then getting elsewhere and\ngetting them admitted on the recommendation of the\nPriest or Principal of the various schools. I would\nlike your final ruling on this matter. Qu'Appelle\nschool returns have been coming to this office for\nthe last five years, so that they be checked up very\nclosely, to see that there were no children admitted,\nwho should not be there.\n\nYou see what has happened in the case of Alphonse\nGirard. The Soldiers Settlement Board never expected\nthat this boy would be in a school, being looked after\nand paid for by the Government, and at the same time\nanother Department paying for his keep.\n\nI would like to have a definite ruling, as I say,\nas it would complicate matters if I kept on refusing\napplications and the Department kept on admitting the\nchildren on the recommendation of other officers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 24, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 100-11B of the 17th instant, relative to the status of certain children at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School and the general question of the eligibility of half-breeds. In reply to your request for a general ruling, I have to state that the last decision and circular relative to the admission of half-breeds is dated November 3, 1921. A year later the attention of officers of the Department was again drawn to this question. Please note the enclosed copy of circular letter.\n\nDecisions are made on the basis of this ruling and I believe if you re-read my No. 109-1-10 of the 9th instant, you will note that your understanding in this connection is in harmony with mine. May I quote in part from my letter ...\n\n\"I have to inform you that certain half-breeds are admitted to Indian residential schools. As you have been informed, half-breed children living the Indian mode of life on a reserve are considered eligible.\"\n\nWhen there is doubt concerning the eligibility of applicants for admission to Indian residential schools, I correspond with the Indian agent in every case and continue such correspondence until such time as sufficient information is on file to make a decision. The possibility of the Department admitting a child whom you had ruled ineligible is a remote contingency in view of our harmony concerning the policy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF COMMISSIONER GRAHAM,\nHIS NO. 305-11B, DATED MAY 16, 1924.\n\nOriginal on 109-1-10.\n\nIt would appear, therefore, that my fears are well grounded that pupils are and can be admitted to schools without the knowledge of the Department, and the principals of schools ought to be instructed that no child should be taken in without the sanction of the Department having first been obtained.\nOttawa, June 5, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your No. 305-11B of the 16th ultimo relative to the admission of children to Indian residential schools without the sanction of the Department having first been obtained. The Department agrees that institutions which are primarily for Indian children should not admit pupils who are not potential grant-earners, without our sanction. I understand that you have corresponded with the Rev. Principal of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School in this connection, and, if you learn that there are non-grant-earners in residence at other institutions, I should be pleased if you would inform the Department.\n\nYour letter brings up also the question of insisting upon official admission before a child enters the school. There are several self-evident reasons why principals and agents should be allowed to place a child in a school and then seek the approval of the Department. Church and Department representatives have been, and will be asked to send only those children to residential schools whose eligibility is more or less certain. Principals and agents have been warned to first correspond with the Department when there is doubt concerning the eligibility of an applicant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

They ask for educational grant or assistance.\n\nThe Commissioner asks if they could be given room in the boarding schools belonging to the Department of Indian Affairs, and if so what would be the cost to the Province of Manitoba per pupil.

The information which the Department has shows quite clearly that they are not wards. I note that you make a plea on their behalf because it is charitable to admit them to the school. But I have to remind you that the Indian Department is not conducting charitable institutions. There are provincial homes for cases of this kind, and the principals of our schools must not take in children for sympathetic reasons.\n\nI would not be true to the trust imposed on the Department by Parliament if I allowed non-grant-earning Indian children into our residential schools. All the capital expenditure is from the Appropriation for Indian Education, and the per capita grant allowed for current expenses for the Indian children in a school should be used exclusively for those children and not strained to cover charity cases. Under the circumstances, I have to request that the Labelle children be discharged without delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. J. Riou, O. M.

In the case of children about whom there may be a dispute, such cases and the claims of such children should be submitted to the Department through the local Indian agent and a departmental decision obtained before such children are permitted to enter our institutions.\n\nThis decision will not apply to students enrolled at residential schools prior to the first of September, 1937.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nTo Inspectors, Indian Agents, and Principals of Residential Schools:\n\nThe Principals of Residential Schools, when writing to the Department, have referred on more than one occasion to a departmental regulation by the terms of which certain half-breed children were eligible for enrolment at residential schools, provided their parents were residents of Indian reserves and living the Indian mode of life.\n\nThis regulation is dated Ottawa, October 18, 1899, and is signed by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. The purpose for which the regulation was enacted at that time is clearly set forth in the regulation itself. The last paragraph reads:\n\n\"The North West Government cannot provide for the education of non-annuitants upon reserves; and if we exclude them from our schools they will practically be debarred from all means of education.\"\n\nYou will readily appreciate, therefore, that this regulation was passed at a time when the provincial governments and the government of the North West Territories were not in a position to provide educational facilities for the children of certain half-breed residents in the outlying sections of the Dominion.\n\nThe terms of this regulation have been carefully reviewed by the departmental officials, who have felt for a number of years that the regulation itself should be drastically modified or repealed.\n\nIt is difficult to determine exactly the rate at which the Indian school population is increasing, but it is\nestimated that the Department is called upon to provide for an annual increase of between two and three hundred pupils at our Indian day and residential schools.\n\nThere has never been, nor is there now, any statutory obligation upon the Dominion Government to provide educational facilities for half-breed children. The Government is, however, wholly responsible for the education of Indian children as defined by the Indian Act. Half-breed children are definitely the responsibility of the provincial governments, and it is our opinion that these governments are now in a position to look after the education and welfare of these children.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, it has been decided to repeal the regulation of October 18, 1899, and to inform the principals of Indian residential schools that, in the future, per capita grants will be made only in the case of children of Indian paternal descent. In the case of children about whom there may be a dispute, such cases and the claims of such children should be submitted to the Department through the local Indian agent and a departmental decision obtained before such children are permitted to enter our institutions.\n\nThis decision will not apply to students enrolled at residential schools prior to the first of September, 1937.\n\nT.

I beg to say that I have two such children in the School at present time. I did not recruit these children and am in no way responsible for their coming. They are the children of Norman Elliott of Ladysmith in the Cowichan Agency. I wrote to Mr. Indian Agent Graham and in his reply on October 1st he suggested that I write direct to you. The Elliotts of the Quamichan Band are classed as Indians, but it seems that the Elliotts living on the Indian Reserve at Ladysmith, who are related to the other family, are not classed as Indians. I regret that I can find no record of my having written you, although until this morning I was quite sure I had done so. These two children, Laura aged seven and Edmund aged eight, have been here since the first of the School year. There is no possibility of them getting schooling other than at a Residential School, as there is no Day School at Ladysmith. I know the parents and have seen them at the fishing village at Cape Mudge amongst the other Indians, and they are typical Indians living the Indian mode of life in every way.\n\nIf you feel that you can make an exception of these two seeing that they are already here, with the understanding that they be discharged at the end of the present School Year, I shall be glad. But if you wish to enforce the decision of the circular letter above referred to, I shall comply with your wishes, and discharge these two children at once. I hope, however, seeing they came in at the very beginning of the School year, that they may be allowed to stay and in this way I shall have lots of time to make arrangements with the parents.\n\nAwaiting your reply, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nOttawa, January 21, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, the Department approves the two Elliott children remaining in the Coqualeetza Residential School until the end of June next, at which time they should be returned to their parents.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Legally, what constitutes a \"half-breed\" in British Columbia?\n\n2. Section 26 of the Indian Act defines an Indian as \"any person of Indian blood reputed to belong to a particular Band\" and subsection \"b\" of the same Section defines a \"Band\" as one interested in Reserve Land, and therefore Annuitants. Of course, eugenically speaking most Annuitants are half-breeds but are called \"Treaty Indians\". But am I correct in assuming that the Indian Act affects only \"Treaty Indians\" in British Columbia?\n\n3. Is a half-breed, not a Treaty Indian, entitled legally to a Liquor Permit on an equal footing with a white man, even though that half-breed is living the Indian mode of life and trapping a trapline in the midst of Indian traplines and spends his time with those Indians? The application being that certain half-breeds, or rather non-treaty Indians are able to get in liquor under legal liquor Permits from the Gov't Control Liquor stores and this liquor is taken to the trapping grounds where all adjacent Treaty Indians have access to it.\n\nIt is to be borne in mind that these Indians do not live on Reserves but on more or less remote traplines.\n\n4. What constituted the old \"Scrip\" or \"Script\" which\nwas issued in lieu of Treaty money. A lexic cardinal took \"Script\" and is therefore not a Treaty Indian, although he lives with our Indians on the trapline, and his son is a Treaty Indian, having been placed on Treaty while attending the Indian Residential School at Grouard. May I enquire what this \"Script\" proposition was, please?\n\nI trust I will not weary you with the above; but I was called upon not long ago in court to define a \"Half-Breed\" during the course of a liquor trial and I found myself at a loss.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A.W. Brown M.D.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa.\n\n5. What is the per capita grant to Indian Residential Schools for resident Indian children?\nApril 14, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to Indians and half-breeds in British Columbia.\n\nAs you are aware the Indian Affairs Branch is responsible only for the welfare of Indians as defined by the Indian Act. The Indian Act defines an Indian as:\n\n\"(1) any male person of Indian blood reputed to belong to a particular band,\n(2) any child of such person,\n(3) any woman who is or was lawfully married to such person.\"\n\nPersons of Indian blood transmitted through the female line are not considered Indians and are usually referred to as half-breeds. In the Province of British Columbia they would have the same status as other white residents of the province and be entitled to the same privileges.\n\nWith regard to your inquiry in connection with \"scrip\", I have to advise you that when the Indian Treaties were being made the half-breeds were given the option of being recognized as Indians and admitted to Treaty, or of being considered whites. If they elected not to take Treaty they were entitled to scrip as recompense for their interest in the land being surrendered. Scrip was issued to all half-breeds making application, and about the year 1905, the class comprising those who were born between 1876 and 1885 were dealt with.\n\nThe issue of scrip was discontinued in 1911, the last group being provided for were those residing in the Mackenzie River district in the Northwest Territories.\n\nThe Indian Act does not cover the question of half-breeds.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent, Fort St. John, B.C.\n\n[Signature]\nNew Secretary.\nTo Mr. Phelps,\n\nLetter from D. Brown\nApril 5th Para 5.\n\nPlease\n\n2. Mrs. Young.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoveshell\nOttawa,\nApril 21, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 5th instant I may say that by agreement between the Department and the Church concerned per capita grant is allowed at Indian Residential Schools for a certain number of pupils whose admission has been approved by the Department.\n\nThe actual per capita paid at different schools varies owing to certain conditions. Please let me know the name of the Residential School about which you require information in connection with the per capita grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. A. W. Brown, Esq., M. D.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort St. John, B. C.\nDepartment of Mines\nand Resources,\n\nRegina, March 25, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRef. Your letter of March 22nd,\nNorman and Peter Simpson\n\nAccording to Department regulations, half-breeds are not admitted to Indian schools, and personally I am opposed to it, not on the grounds of an additional expenditure by our Department, as I fully realize it matters not whether our Department foots the bill or yours, as the cost must be paid by the taxpayer in any event. My main objection is that it is a step backward; the children are in that case brought up under Indian subjects instead of white. I have realized, however, that there are quite a number of cases where the children could be given better care and probably be further advanced by admitting them to Indian schools, at much less cost to the taxpayer than if the Province had to find homes for them.\n\nI understand that the Hon. Mr. Patterson is going to Ottawa soon after the close of the session. I would suggest that this matter be placed in his hands, and he go into the matter fully with Mr. Crerar, and see if some arrangement cannot be made covering your most difficult cases. I feel that this is the only way there is any possibility of making a satisfactory arrangement, as I am satisfied that if I take the matter up by correspondence, it will be rejected by the Department. I will take no further steps in the matter until I receive your ideas on it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.) Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nL. B.

C. M. Dunn,\nMinister, Bureau of Child Protection,\nLegislative Buildings,\nCITY.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Norman and Peter Simpson - half-breeds\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter received from Thomas Robertson, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies, for this province.\n\nI may say that the above two boys are half-breeds, and their father was Overseas. The mother deserted and the father is shiftless, and the children have to be looked after.\n\nI wanted to get the boys in to the Indian school at Lebret, and I understood from the Indian Department some little time ago that if the two boys were adopted by an Indian that they would be allowed to go to the school. However, before the adoption went through I was informed by the Indian Agencies that they would not accept the boys at all, and the adoption has been held up.\n\nI may say that the half-breed problem is very acute in this province at the moment. There is hardly a week that we are not asked to take half-breed children. We cannot find free homes for such children and we are very much afraid that we are going to have a lot of them to board for a considerable period. If we could make some arrangements for handling them in the Indian Schools it would solve the problem to some extent, at least. They seem to do very well in the Indian Schools.\n\nI would be very glad indeed if the Hon. Mr. Patterson could take the matter up with the Hon. Mr. Crear and endeavour to make some such arrangement. At the present time we have to pay $12.50 per month in the Indian Schools, and it might be possible that even a better arrangement than this could be arrived at. In fact, I believe Mr. Robertson would be almost willing to take these two boys without charge if the restrictions on half-breeds could be lifted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nL. B. Ring, Commissioner.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\n\nDepartment Memo.\n\nFrom C. M. Dunn March 30th, 1938.\n\nTo Honourable W. J. Patterson\n\nMr. L. B.

You will remember that this memorandum and certain correspondence attached thereto related to the desirability of having half-breed children enrolled for instruction at Indian residential schools in the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nI may state that this matter has been referred to the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department and I am enclosing herewith, for your information, a copy of a circular, relating to the eligibility of half-breed children for admission to residential schools, dated December 10, 1937. You will note that this Department is called upon to provide for an annual increase of approximately 500 pupils. This means the construction of at least 10 Indian day schools each year or 5 Indian day schools and a residential school capable of accommodating 150 pupils. I am informed that, while we have at present 14 residential schools in the province of Saskatchewan, at none of them is there accommodation for half-breed children.

McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nRe: Education, Northwest Territories.\n\nAs you are aware, there have been discussions from time to time about the education of white and native children in the Northwest Territories. We are preparing a memorandum on the subject, having regard particularly to -\n\n(1) How the white children, and those half-breed children who desire it, can obtain a reasonable amount of education.\n\n(2) Whether the training that is given the native and half-breed children in the Mission Schools is sufficiently practical to fit them for the life that they will follow when they are grown up.\n\nWe would appreciate the assistance of the officer of your Branch who is handling this matter for you so that the whole picture may be presented at the one time. If you are agreeable, will you please have him get in touch with Mr. F. Clifford of the Bureau of Northwest Territories and Yukon Affairs.\n\nDeputy Commissioner.\nINDIAN SCHOOLS\n\nThe following are notes from an interview with Mr. P. N. L. Phelan of the Indian Affairs Branch, in reference to Indian schools:\n\nThere are about 270 day schools, a few of which are seasonal only, and about 80 residential schools, all supported by the Dominion Government. They are scattered throughout the Provinces, the Northwest Territories and Yukon Territory.\n\nThe schools are operated by Mission authorities - Roman Catholic, Anglican, United, Continuing Presbyterian.\n\nThe Government grants are along the following lines:\n\nDay Schools\n\n(a) Erection and maintenance of schools with necessary equipment, repairs, fuel, etc.\n(b) Payment of teachers' salaries.\n\nResidential Schools\n\n(a) Erection and maintenance of schools with necessary equipment, repairs, fuel, etc.\n(b) Per capita grant based on pupils in attendance. This varies from $155 to $170 generally, but ranges to $200 in certain isolated areas, and to $250 in the Yukon Territory.\n\nTeachers\n\nThe teachers are required to have first or second class certificates issued by the Provinces. They are selected to conform with the religious views of the Indian communities where the schools are located. The majority of the day school teachers are appointed by the Department but in a few instances the church authorities are permitted to make selection. About 20 or 25 of the teachers are Indians. In the residential schools the churches engage the staff.\nInspection\n\nThe schools are inspected regularly, usually once a year, in the case of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia twice a year. In New Brunswick and British Columbia there are Departmental inspectors, but in the other Provinces inspection is made by Provincial school officers, the Department paying for their services.\n\nThere are also inspections by Indian agents and inspectors who report on the condition of the buildings and equipment, meals, clothing, dormitories, and any other features bearing on the physical condition of the children.\n\nCorrespondence Schools\n\nThere is very little training received by the Indian children through correspondence school courses. These courses depend largely for their success on the assistance given by parents or guardians, and the Indians are not generally qualified to give this assistance. The courses may be used, however, by Indian students seeking advanced education beyond the capacity of the Indian schools.\n\nCurriculum\n\nAs the teachers provided have received the training required for Provincial schools, the curriculum of the Indian schools naturally conforms reasonably close with the curriculum of the public schools. In some instances the Department supplies a somewhat simpler form suitable for the Indian pupils.\n\nManual Training\n\nExcept in the case of the Indian schools in British Columbia where there is a special grant for manual training, the practical training of this kind is limited to the immediate resources of the schools. Manual training involves the providing of equipment and frequently special teachers, and it is not the practice of the Indian Affairs Branch to make any extensive provision for this purpose.\nwhere it is practicable to do so the Indian boys are taught the principles of animal husbandry, general farming, or any other occupations for which training equipment is available. The girls also receive a certain amount of training in cooking, sewing and suchlike occupations.\n\nThe day schools are not considered very suitable for manual training, the children being there only a few hours a day and engaged in other studies. The residential schools, however, are well adapted for the purpose.\n\nT.G.

There are seventeen day schools and four residential schools listed in the records. Those in the Mackenzie District are located at Fort Smith, Resolution, Hay River, Providence, Simpson, Norman, McPherson and Aklavit. Those in the Keswatin and Franklin Districts are at Cambridge Bay, Coppermine, Baker Lake, Chesterfield, Eskimo Point, Lake Harbour, Pangnirtung and Pond Inlet. Some of the day schools do not operate continuously.\n\nThe Government grants for the day schools range up to $500 annually, and at Fort Smith and Simpson payment of $680 is made through the Indian Affairs Branch toward the teacher's salary. The grants to residential schools are $400 each with an additional allowance based on the number of pupils. This allowance is either $130 or $200 per annum for each child according to location. The Government also incurs some additional expense for equipment and supplies.\n\nThe policy of the administration in regard to schools in the Northwest Territories conforms with the policy in respect of Indian schools generally, in so far as their operation by the Missions assisted by Government grants is concerned. The amounts of the grants vary according to location or other conditions.\n\nThe standard of education can hardly be considered as high in the schools throughout the Northwest Territories as in the Indian schools generally. Except at Fort Smith there is no rule requiring the Missions to employ only teachers having previous qualifications as is done in the case of the Indian schools. Most of the teachers in the Northwest Territories are the missionaries stationed at the various points. In the Indian day schools most of the teachers are appointed by the Department but in the Northwest Territories the matter is left to the Missions.\n\nA further difference noted between schools in the Northwest Territories and Indian schools in the provinces is that the latter are inspected regularly by school inspectors. These are concerned with the educational features of the establishments as distinct from the general welfare of the pupils which is reported on separately by the Indian Agents. In the Northwest Territories the administration does not make any regular inspections of the schools from an educational standpoint.\n\nOwing to the large area of the Northwest Territories and the distances between the points where the schools are located the educational facilities provided by the Mission schools are not fully adequate to the requirements of the population. In a few instances the residents have taken advantage of the opportunity to provide education for their children through correspondence school courses supplied by the Department of Education, Alberta.\n\nThere is considerable interest shown by the resident population in correspondence school courses, and this means of providing education for children living at some distance from established schools, or who through disability are unable to attend...\nsuch schools, might be developed to much larger proportions. With this end in view inquiries were recently made at the offices of the provincial Departments of Education, at Regina and Edmonton, and some material collected bearing on the subject of correspondence school work.\n\nThere has been furnished a copy of the Annual Report of the Department of Education of the Province of Saskatchewan, 1936, showing that public school courses are supplied free of charge to children whose homes are not situated in school districts and also to children who because of ill-health or other disability are not able to attend the local rural school. The lessons may also be supplied to adults whose education has been neglected, and who now wish to work on the public school course. While the report refers mainly to Saskatchewan, it is understood from the Director of these courses that the Dominion Government might reasonably ask that the service be extended to children residing in the area north of Saskatchewan, provided it could be shown that Alberta was educating children in the area north of Alberta who had no other way of obtaining education. Enrollment forms and other details were provided.\n\nInformation along the same lines has been obtained from Edmonton, and includes also sample copies of the lessons provided in Grades I to VIII in the correspondence course. There are fifteen pupils in the Northwest Territories already enrolled and further applications are being considered.\n\nFrom the information supplied it is apparent that there is considerable benefit to be derived from the study of educational material available in these correspondence courses provided by the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, although a great deal of the progress of students depends on the assistance they receive from their parents or guardians in carrying out the instructions given by mail. Except for private tuition, the only means available for the education of children beyond the capacity of the mission schools is the higher grades included in the correspondence school courses.\n\nIt seems desirable to explore any avenues which might lead to improvement in the general situation as regards educational facilities in the Northwest Territories. The Government outlay in supporting the Mission schools represents a considerable contribution toward education and it is doubtful if this could be materially increased. It is, however, possible that improvements may be effected without incurring any considerable additional expense.\n\nThe recommendations made in this respect are as follows:\n\n(a) That steps be taken to secure and disseminate through the Northwest Territories as much information as possible concerning correspondence school courses available in the provinces bordering on the Northwest Territories which are or might be extended to include residents of the Territories.\n(b) That full information be obtained in regard to the subjects taught in the mission schools and where considered necessary the Missions be urged to include considerable manual training in the curriculum. In the case of native boys this might include first aid, practical training on engines and motors of all kinds available; making and mending boats, nets, dog harness, sleighs and snow-shoes; and the tanning of hides. The girls could learn first aid, cooking and serving meals, child welfare, sanitation, dressmaking, tanning of hides, and the manufacture of skin clothing.\n\n(c) That arrangements be made for an inspection at least once a year of the schools in the Northwest Territories by a school inspector with qualifications equivalent to those required in the provinces, the inspector to be authorized to examine closely the degree of education provided, submit suggestions for improvement and report the progress made by the pupils in each institution year by year.\n\nAttached hereto is a statement containing information respecting the average school attendance and grants made to the various residential schools and day schools in the Northwest Territories during the fiscal year 1937-38.\nOttawa, December 1, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. P.

The grants are authorized by \"An Ordinance to Regulate Public Aid to Schools\", chapter 31 of 1901 (chapter 106 of Consolidation of 1905, Alberta), which provides (sec. 6) for the payment of special grants to schools whether organized according to law or not.\n\nThe residential schools now in operation are located at Resolution, Providence and Akavik, there being two at the latter place. Many schools are operated in conjunction with the residential schools and also at a number of other places as shown in the attached lists.\n\nThe annual grants to residential schools by the Northwest Territories Administration are $400 each with an additional allowance based on the number of indigent pupils. This allowance is either $150 or $200 per annum for each child according to the location of the school. The grants to day schools by the Northwest Territories Administration range from $200 to $500 annually, payable quarterly for the periods the schools are operated. The attached list marked (a) shows the amount of these grants during the fiscal year 1937-38. A separate list (b) relates to grants by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nOn the 29th September, 1938, Council considered applications by residents of the Yellowknife district for government grants to assist in the operation of public schools at the Yellowknife settlement and the mining properties, respectively, and it was decided that if suitable schools were provided and teachers with proper qualifications, who would follow the curriculum of Alberta or Saskatchewan, were hired, a grant of $500 might be made in each case. The residents of Yellowknife settlement are raising funds by voluntary subscriptions and have also considered the possibility of local taxation for school purposes. They have been referred to the provisions of \"The School Ordinance\", 1901, c. 29 s. 1 (chapter 76 of Consolidation of 1905, Alberta) which sets forth the procedure for creating a school district. A resident of Fort Smith, who inquired respecting a public school district at that place has also been referred to the provisions of this Ordinance.\n\nThe standard of education provided in the Northwest Territories is not generally as high as in the Indian schools throughout the Provinces. Except at Fort Smith and the proposed schools at Yellowknife there is no rule requiring the Missions to employ only teachers having provincial qualifications as is done in the case of the Indian schools mentioned. Most of the teachers in the Northwest Territories are the missionaries stationed at the various points and it would appear the small attendance of pupils in many cases would hardly justify the employment of professional\nteachers. In the Indian day schools throughout the Provinces most of the teachers are appointed by the Department. In the Northwest Territories the selection of teachers is left to the Missions.\n\nA further difference noted between schools in the Northwest Territories and Indian schools in the Provinces is that the latter are inspected regularly by school inspectors. These are concerned with the educational features of the establishment as distinct from the general welfare of the pupils which is reported on separately by the Indian Agents. In the Northwest Territories the administration does not make any regular inspections of the schools from an educational standpoint.\n\nThe educational facilities in the Northwest Territories provided through the missions are not adequate to meet the requirements of the white residents, and in some instances they have taken advantage of the opportunity to provide education for their children through correspondence school courses supplied by the Department of Education, Alberta. This means of providing education might be developed to much larger proportions and with this end in view inquiries were recently made at the offices of the provincial Departments of Education, at Regina and Edmonton, and some material collected bearing on the subject of correspondence school work.\n\nThere has been furnished a copy of the Annual Report of the Department of Education of the Province of Saskatchewan, 1936, showing that public school courses are supplied free of charge to children whose homes are not situated in school districts and also to children who because of ill-health or other disability are not able to attend the local rural school.

It is, however, possible that improvements may be effected without incurring any considerable additional expense.\n\nThe recommendations made in this respect are as follows:\n\n(a) That steps be taken to secure and disseminate through the northwest territories as much information as possible concerning correspondence school courses available in the provinces bordering on the northwest territories which are or might be extended to include residents of the territories.\n\n(b) That full information be obtained in regard to the subjects taught in the mission schools and the mission authorities be urged to improve the professional qualifications of their teachers, particularly where there is a demand for a higher standard of education than is now provided. It might be represented to the mission that considerable manual training should be included in the curriculum. In the case of native boys this might include first aid, practical training on engines and motors of all kinds available, making and mending boots, nets, dog harness, sleighs and snowshoes, and the tanning of hides. It might also be possible to develop the art of ivory carving. The girls could learn first aid, cooking and serving meals, child welfare, sanitation, dressmaking, tanning of hides and the manufacture of skin clothing. The art of weaving as a native handicraft might also be taught. Information in this respect can be obtained from the Guild of All Arts, Scarborough, near Toronto.\n\n(c) That arrangements be made for an inspection every year or two of the schools in the northwest territories by a school inspector with qualifications equivalent to those required in the provinces, the inspector to be authorized to examine closely the degrees of education provided, submit suggestions for improvement and report the progress made by the pupils in each institution.\n\nThe attached statements contain information respecting the average school attendance and grants made to the various residential and day schools in the northwest territories during the fiscal year 1937-38:\n\n(a) Northwest Territories Administration\n(b) Indian Affairs Branch.\nInformation respecting schools in the Northwest Territories operated by the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches and supported by Government grants during the fiscal year 1937-38.\n\n### Residential Schools\n\n| School          | Authorized pupils | Annual per capita grant | Grant earned during fiscal year 1937-38 |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Aklavik R.C.    | 40                | $200 less 5\u00a2             | $ 3,668.48                             |\n| Aklavik C.E.    | 50                | 200 less 5\u00a2              | 4,475.95                               |\n| Providence R.C. | 65                | 200 less 5\u00a2              | 11,596.93                              |\n| Resolution R.C. | 80                | 200 less 5\u00a2              | 12,088.76                              |\n| Hay River C.E.  | 15                | (Closed Aug. 31, 1937)   |                                        |\n\n### Day Schools\n\n| School          | Average Attendance | Grant earned for teacher if school open | Portion of year operated | Amount paid |\n|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------|\n| Fort Simpson R.C.| 11                 | $ 650                                   | 10 months                | $ 650.00   |\n| Fort Simpson C.E.| 4                  | 650                                     | 1 month                  | 65.00      |\n| Fort Smith R.C. | 11                 | 650                                     | 10 months                | 650.00     |\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. H.

Scott\n\nAss't Deputy Commissioner\n\nThos. Cary Esq.\nIndian Agent\nCarlyle Sask.\nMoose Mountain Agency\n\nJanuary 20th, 1914\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your circular of the 12th of Jan., 1914, I have the honour to submit the following on the Ex pupils mentioned.\n\nJoe Allan\n\nAfter this boy was discharged from the school he came here to the reserve, for a short time he worked with his stepfather at the haying and harvest and worked out threshing for a while, and then he left to go back to work for the principal of the Industrial school again as he said that he wanted him he remained up among the north reserves until May of 1913 when his stepfather sent him money to bring home when he returned he was suffering from the effects of an attack of pleurisy and was not able to work, in July he married a young girl that was just out of the day school he married her on the sly and in the Indian fashion but I insisted on his marrying her properly which he did, he left here for Piapot reserve last fall and as far as I know he is there now. I tried hard to get this boy to do something useful to settle down and go to work but he said no; he did not intend to stay here any way that he was going to Montana where his father is and in any case he would not accept any help from the Dept unless that it was unconditional this of course was out of the question. I do not think that he will ever amount to anything and all he has to show for 14 years in the industrial school is that he talks English fairly well, he said that he learned a little shoemaking and a little farming while at the school but not enough about shoe making to make his living by it and I think still less about farming as far as I know about him at the present time he is well.\nMary Rose Bear\n\nMarried while still at the industrial school, Died in April 1913 of consumption.\n\nLetitia John\n\nUnmarried, Died at the school of consumption in Feb. 1912.\n\nEdgar Napaystia\n\nHas no settled place of abode is perfectly healthy, unmarried an utterly useless harmless prowling vagabond wont work for any body would starve first not any to bright mentally, says all the work he ever did at the school was a little gardening spends nearly all of his time among the reserves up north will get up and go off without saying a word to any person and will stay away for months at a time.\n\nAusten Nahbexay\n\nNear Carlyle, health good, unmarried working for a white farmer this man is a cross between a mighty bad negro and not any to good a squaw, for a long time after he was discharged he hung around the school and the north country he served a month in jail for being drunk and flourishing a revolver, this happened before he came here to stay after he came here he always worked at anything he could get to do for whitemen off the reserve and never missed a possible chance to get liquor, in Oct. of 1912 I sent him to Regina jail for three months for the same trouble on the reserve but since his return I have never heard the least whisper against him in any way I believe that he is keeping very straight, I have been thinking of trying to start him farming on the reserve but I hardly know how it would do as he has no relations among the Indians and is a kind of an outcast among them says he learnt some blacksmithing at the school but not enough to enable him to take a job in a blacksmith shop and do the work properly has a rather violent temper hit one of the priests at the school and laid him out.\nI am very sorry that I am not able to send you a better report on those pupils but I suppose what you want is the truth there is belonging to this reserve 11 ex pupils of the different industrial schools without counting the women what have we got to show for it, it must have cost the Dept. $10,000.00 to educate them. Of them are farming 4 more of them were farming and dropped it one because he was married to an old squaw who would not let him farm another because he could not do what he liked and two because they were too lazy to look after their teams and do their work. I have ex pupils of the day school on the reserve farming who only went to school for two or three years who are doing better than any of the industrial ex pupils and are much easier to manage.\n\nI don't want to disparage the value of the industrial schools, but I believe that the Indians best interests are to be chiefly promoted by increasing the educational facilities on the reserves. The reserve is the home of the Indian. He can be educated there more conveniently to him and with less expense to the Dept than at one of the industrial schools. The schools on the reserves contribute vastly to the amelioration of the community life there, improving moral as well as intellectual standards, and deepening the Indians sense of responsibility. They stand as constant reminders to him of his integral part in his life of the country, a living guaranty of the Departments active interest in him and its promise to do well by him. Another very potent argument in favour of the reserve school, is its greater advantage in cultivating home life.\n\nD.C.

Fred Peters, an ex-graduate of Regina Industrial School, her health is very poor, and she and Fred are not making much headway.\n\nJas. Chaski, resides at the Sioux Village, but at present he is in the Industrial training School for boys, at Portage La Prairie, being sent there on account of Misconduct, when home during holidays, I understand from officials of the Industrial training School, that he is doing fine, he is perfectly healthy, and a good hand around the farm and with horses.\n\nFrank Alexie resides at the Sioux Village, Portage La Prairie, with his parents; he is single and a good strong healthy boy, works around among the farmers. This is the boy off whom the Department wrote some time ago, asking if it would not be possible to have him placed with a white farmer, for a year or so, in order that he might obtain practical instructions in framing, but when approached in regards this matter he and his father, and mother all strenuously objected, to any such a proposition being carried out.\nFlora McKinney Resides at Long Plain Reserve, she is a half-breed girl, married to No. 132 Archie Myran, of Long Plain reserve, she is healthy, and a good housekeeper, her husband is a good worker and, if he had a chance would probably make good.\n\nAlex Sutherland, Resides at the Sioux Village, Portage La Prairie he is a big strong fellow, unmarried and perfectly healthy looking, spends a lot of his time around the pool rooms, and is making no progress.\n\nFred Daniels, Resided at Long Plain Reserve, up to the month of October, 1912, when he died of tubercular trouble.\n\nAnnie Rose, Resided at the Sioux Village, up to the month of November, 1912, when she died of Tuberculosis.\n\nFred Peters, Resides at Swan Lake Reserve, is paid under No. 115, married Nellie Daniels, of Long Plain Reserve, Fred is a big robust looking fellow, but has his left leg amputated, on account of tubercular trouble, he has purchased for himself an artificial limb, but claims that he cannot wear it, as it hurts the stump, and it surely will until such time as the stump becomes used to carrying the weight of the body on it. Fred is a graduate of the Regina Industrail School, and learned printing, he having worked for nearly two years here in the printing office, and then went farming, the Department supplying him with a team of horses. The first year Fred had a good crop, but last year he fell away behind, having not nearly as much acreage as he might of had in.\nFlorence Matooa, Resides at Swan Lake reserve, is married to Moise Starr son of No.64. Sandy Bay reserve, paid as No. 116 Swan Lake Band. Florence is a healthy woman and should be a good housekeeper, her husband is rather an ambitious young man. He works out among the farmers.\n\nMaggie Menno Cappo, Resides at Roseau Rapide Reserve, is married to son of No.115, (Jim being his first name)\n\nMaggie is a big robust woman, healthy, and a fine worker, has not a lazy bone in her body, but her husband I am told is a good for nothing, as useless as they are made.\n\nTrusting that this information may be what the Department requires,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

Scott\n\nAss't Deputy Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of above date and number asking for certain information regarding ex-pupils of this Agency discharged from the various residential schools during the past three years. The following is a detailed report on each pupil mentioned in your letter.\n\nDavid Bird. At present residing on the File Hills Colony, is in splendid health, married in January 1913. This young man is doing very well. He has been farming only two seasons and his last crop amounts to 2056 bushels of good grain. He has 75 acres ready for crop and has bought and paid for a good team of heavy work horses. He owns a good equipment.\n\nJack Walker. At present working for the Minister of Agriculture where he has been engaged for a year. The training he will receive there will be of great benefit to him. I expect he will start farming on the Colony in 1915. This boy has not yet married. He is strong and healthy.\n\nHarry Assineawasis. This man has not yet started farming. He was working out on the Government road gang most of the summer, making good wages. He is not married and is fairly healthy. I think it will be only a short time before\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nbefore he will want to start farming. It would be a mistake to force him to begin until he can see for himself that he can do better at it than by working out. He has a good reputation and is making good use of the training received at school.\n\nNora Keewaydin. This young woman has made a splendid showing for herself since leaving school. She has been acting as maid in the home of Hon. W.R. Motherwell for over a year and the reports I get from time to time are very favorable. Last Spring this young woman had an operation for appendicitis, the cost of which was largely borne by herself. She is a good girl and is savings her earnings to make a home for herself some day.\n\nAlex Assineawasis. This man is a brother of Harry Assineawasis mentioned above. He has been working out ever since he left school and has expressed no desire to start farming. He makes a good living and is steady. He has good health.\n\nGeorge Lavallie. This young man is a non-treaty halfbreed educated at the File Hills School. After his discharge he went to Maple Creek where I understand he has been working steadily ever since.\n\nEliza Lavallie. This girl is on the staff of the File Hills Boarding school. She is a good, healthy girl and has greatly benefitted by her education.\n\nRebecca\nRebecca. This girl married direct from school to an uneducated Indian of Piapot Band. I can tell you nothing about her.\n\nCelina Big Sky. Married to Adelarde Star Blanket of Star Blanket Reserve and an ex-pupil. She keeps a good house and will do better still when her husband builds a better home. She is strong and healthy.\n\nMary Agnes Peskutch. Married to Alan Star Blanket of Star Blanket's reserve. I hope to see her in a better home next summer. She keeps a clean house and is a good wife; does not enjoy very good health.\n\nJohn Bellegarde. Since his discharge from school this boy has been assisting his father who owns a number of cattle and farms in a small way. He has been out of school only a short time but I expect he will be the means of enlarging their farming operations. He is strong and I have good reports of him. He lives on Black Bears Reserve.\n\nEdwin Nokesis. This man is a little weak minded. I started him at farming but he did not do well. He needed almost constant watching which I could not give him. He is now at the Agency where he acts as mail carrier and does odd jobs. I fear he would get into trouble if allowed to go off the reserve. His health is good.\n\nArch.\nArchibald Nokesia. A brother of the above and is not strong mentally. Has been working for others most of the summer. File Hills is his home.\n\nSarah Nokesia. Married to an uneducated Indian of Piapot reserve.\n\nLouisa Chief Hawke. This girl is in very delicate health. I doubt very much if she will live long. She lives at File Hills with her people.\n\nAlex Desnommes. This boy has done remarkably well. He is a hard worker and will do well as a farmer. He is at present assisting his father and breaking up a farm for himself. He has splendid health.\n\nAdam Blackfoot. Died Feb. 28th. 1911. Tuberculosis.\n\nMatthew Lowe. Has been farming on the Colony for two years and has done well. This year he had 767 bushels of grain, principally wheat. He broke 20 acres of new land this year and has now 52 acres under cultivation. He is married, has a neat frame cottage and one child. All enjoy good health. As a farmer he will do fairly well.\n\nVeronique Dumont. This young woman has been out at service most of the time since her discharge from school. I understand she will shortly marry one of the young men of the Colony. She has a good record and will make a good wife.\n\nTrusting that the above information is what you require.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp. of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nI beg to herewith enclose the information asked for in Departments letter dated 12th January, 1914, No. 150,000-14, regarding the ex-pupils of Sandy Bay Indian Boarding School.\n\nJos.

Has two boys, one 1 year & 9 months old & 1 one month.\n\nGeneral Progress - Lived with her father Geo. McKay, No.15, Clearwater Lake reserve, No.61A. Employed at the usual work about her home. Married Geo. Shanocappo in May, 1911. She is a fairly good housekeeper. Has a sewing machine and is a good needle woman. Her home is well provided with the necessary kitchen utensils. Takes good care of her children. Her husband is a good provider and his house is a log one with shingled roof.\n\nTo\n\nThe Assistant Deputy\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nName - Jean McKay (Jean Bird) ex-pupil, Birtle Boarding school.\n\nResidence - Clearwater Lake Reserve, No.61A.\nBand, No.76.\n\nState of Health - Excellent.\n\nMarried or Single - Married to Andrew McKay, No.76, Clearwater Lake Band, No.61A.\n\nPresent Occupation - Wandering about with her husband.\n\nGeneral Progress - This young woman up to the time she was married, lived with her sister, Mrs. Hunting Hawk, No.51. Preferred to live on the reserve and would not accept service as a domestic. She is inclined to go back to the Indian mode of living. Her husband Andrew McKay, is now about to be transferred to the Rolling River reserve, and is making preparations to build a good log house with shingled roof, on this reserve, which will be built by him next summer. When Jean settles down in her new home, she may show if her education and training has benefited her. Her husband is a good worker, but inclined to roam about.\n\nName - Donald Runner, ex-pupil Birtle Boarding school.\n\nResidence - Rolling River Reserve, No.67. Lives with his parents.\n\nHealth - Scorfulous, but sores now healed up. At present in very good health.\n\nMarried or Single - Single.\n\nPresent Occupation - Getting out firewood & selling same Works on the farm with his father & and also works out during harvest & threshing seasons, and at other times when not needed at home.\n\nGeneral Progress - Since his discharge from school, has been assisting his father on the farm, having worked out during the harvest & threshing season.\nseasons. His father has a small team of horses, which Donald works, but he is handicapped, in the way of not having horses or a yoke of oxen of his own and has to depend on his father for the use of his team. He is getting out logs for a house, this winter, as I understand that he is to be married next summer.\n\nName XXX Martha Bird (Martha Bird) ex-pupil, Birtle Boarding school.\n\nResidence - Rolling River Reserve, No.67, Band No.8.\n\nState of Health - Excellent.\n\nMarried or Single - Married to Peter Bird, son of No.8, Rolling River Reserve, No.67.\n\nPresent Occupation - Care of her own home.\n\nGeneral Progress - A very good housekeeper & needle woman. Has a swing machine and makes her own clothing. Keeps her home in excellent order. The home is nicely furnished and good care is taken of it. She had some assistance from the Department. Her husband never attended a school, but is an excellent provider and has built a log house with shingled roof and upstairs apartments. Martha is very reticent and will hardly converse with any one in English, and then in so low a tone as makes it almost impossible to carry on a conversation with her. The assistance given her has had good results.\n\nName -- Jared Bunn, ex-pupil Birtle Boarding school.\n\nResidence--- Bird Tail Sioux reserve, No.57.\n\nState of Health--- Excellent.\n\nMarried or Single - Married to Ela Ben, widow late Andrew Ben, No.38.\n\nPresent Occupation - Farms on a small scale and works out during the threshing season. Works for Indians on the reserve, hauling firewood, hay & in the care of stock.\n\nGeneral Progress - Rather too fond of travelling to the Sisseton Indi...\nthe Sisseton Agency, South Dakota. His wife owns a quarter section of land there, left her by her father the late James Enoch of that Agency, and they are trying to have the same sold. She receives a rental of $50.00 per annum, from the land, rented as a grazing lease. This land keeps Jared from settling down, as he makes frequent visits there to hurry up the sale. He had in crop the past season, 20 acres of wheat and 7 of oats and put up 10 ton's hay. Worked well for other Indians on the reserve and was fireman on the steam engine, during the threshing season on the reserve. Has no house of his own and generally stays with his uncle, Moses Bunn or his grandfather John Bunn. He has steadied down the past summer, and there is hopes of betterment in the future.

They are however all doing well, being earnest and willing workers. The men hunt furs, fish, work on survey parties, and on steamboats. Their knowledge of English stands them in good stead, and they are much sought after by travellers for this reason. The girls do not make the use of English that the boys do, not having the same chance, but they are cleaner in their habits than those brought up on the reserve. The assistance given by the Department to these pupils, is always much appreciated, and well used. When lumber has been supplied it has been used to complete their dwellings, while the girls upon marriage are supplied with a little furniture, which they take pride in keeping clean and tidy.\nOttawa Jan, 12th. 1914\n\nSir,-\n\nThe following are the names of the ex-pupils about whom the Department requires the information asked for in the circular letter dated Jan. 13th.\n\n| Name                  | School attended by ex-pupil | Band       |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| Christina Bruyere     | Fort Frances Bdg.           | Couchiching|\n| Mary Ann Vincent      |                            |            |\n| Mary Guillaud         |                            |            |\n| Wm.

They have 41 acres of land cultivated and appear to be ambitious but are rather hampered in their progress through lack of the means of obtaining proper equipment. This will be overcome I hope in time and they should do well.\n\nCharles C Pratt No: 5 Gordon Band.\n\nThis man is an ex-pupil of the Elkhorn and Gordon schools. He is unmarried and lives with his brother on Gordon's reserve.

She is a clean, tidy house-keeper and deserves to be assisted.\n\nHer husband has erected the log walls of a commodious dwelling house but has not the means to purchase the lumber to finish it with.\n\nThis woman is healthy and has been benefitted a great deal by her school training.\n\nPaula Pawistawat, No: 43 Gordons Band.\n\nThis girl is married to Paul Simon Ochcho No: 52 of Gordons Band.

She has two children. They live in a house of their own on Day Stars reserve and I am pleased to say that the house is always found in a very clean condition. The children are also well cared for.\n\nThis couple were both very young when they married and have received very little help. They deserve to be encouraged.\n\nTheir home is much superior to that of the girls parents and I have no hesitation in saying that the improvement is due to the training which she received while attending school.\n\nRobert Keahkewaypew, Gordons Boarding School.\n\nThis boy was an incorrigible truant and was discharged before he had completed his term at the school. He is unmarried and has no settled home and does not appear to have any ambition to settle down and work.\n\nMaude Bitternose, Gordons Boarding School.\n\nThis girl is married to Albert Cyr of Gordons reserve and lives with him, they have two children.

They live with her husband's father, but Albert has got out logs to make a house for himself but so far has not had the means with which to purchase lumber to complete it.\nThey are a well behaved couple and deserve encouragement.\n\nLouisa Cyr, Gordons Boarding School.\n\nThis girl married Harry Bitternose of Gordons Band and resides with her father on the reserve. They were only married last Fall and I have not been able to judge regarding her capabilities as a housekeeper but am of the opinion that she will prove to be clean and tidy.\n\nThe young man has shown a great aptitude for work since his marriage.\n\nJoe Harry Favel, Muscovequon Boarding School.\n\nThis man is a non-treaty half-breed and does not reside on the reserve. He is single and healthy but I cannot report favorably regarding his character as he has been twice convicted for supplying intoxicants to Indians since leaving school.\n\nThis boy was a good worker at school and was very civil but the half-breed influence with which he has been brought in contact since leaving the school has been very detrimental to him.\n\nJustine LaPierre, Muscovequons Boarding School.\n\nThis girl was bright and capable while at school but as she is a non-treaty half-breed she has returned to her parents and does not come under my supervision since her discharge.\n\nJohn Green, Muscovequons Boarding School.\n\nThis boy is unmarried and lives with his mother on the reserve; he is not ambitious and I have a great deal of difficulty in keeping him steadily\nat work. I have found him a disappointment and he has not carried the lessons of industry taught at the school into his life on the reserve.\n\nFrancis Desjarlais, Muscowequons Boarding School.\n\nThis man has married a daughter of the Chief of Poormans Band and resides at that reserve. He is healthy and strong and now that he is married appears to be anxious to get an equipment with which to start farming.\n\nThis man was given a yoke of oxen when he left the school but as he showed no disposition to make good use of them I took them from him and gave them in charge of another ex-pupil.\n\nI believe that he is now worthy of being given another chance.\n\nSarah Green, Muscowequons Boarding School.\n\nThis girl is married to a non-treaty half-breed and resides with him on his farm, they have one child and live respectably. I have heard nothing but good reports regarding this girl since her discharge from the school.\n\nMarie Desjarlais, Muscowequons Boarding School.\n\nThis girl is a non-treaty half-breed and resides with her parents at some distance from this District. I have not had a report regarding her since her discharge.\n\nCharles Bruce, Muscowequons Boarding School.\n\nThis boy is unmarried and lives with his parents on the reserve, he assists his father in caring for the stock and with his farming operations.\nhe is fairly industrious and should do well if he were only started for himself and married.\n\nJean Baptiste Nesjarlais, Muscowequons Bay School.\n\nThis boy is unmarried and lives with his father on the reserve. He made a fair start at farming but is not strong and the indications are that he has consumption in an advanced stage.\n\nMary Tanner, Muscowequons Boarding School.\n\nThis girl resides with her husband Norbert Bruce on Muscowequons reserve. She keeps her house clean and tidy and as her husband now has a fair acreage under cultivation and is increasing his stock I am hoping that with luck they will soon make a creditable showing.\n\nMargarite Bruce, Muscowequons Boarding School.\n\nThis girl is married to a Half-breed named Baptiste Pelletier and as he is a worthless fellow the girl has not had a chance to take advantage of her training as they have no settled home.\n\nI believe that were she given the opportunity she would have made a good housewife.\n\nDamehilda Denomme, Muscowequons Boarding School.\n\nThis girl is a non-treaty Half-breed and lives with her parents at some distance from the reserve.

Donnelly Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSintaluta Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the information concerning ex-pupils belonging to Carry-the-kettle's band as requested by your letter dated the 12th ultimo.\n\nWilliam Birrel Grey was a pupil of the Regina Industrial school during part of the time that it was in operation. After this school was closed he was transferred to the Brandon Industrial school, but only remained there a short time, escaping by night and walking all the way back to his people who live on this reserve. The late agent Mr. Grant reported his return to the principal of the Brandon school but no action was taken in having him returned. This boy is fairly well educated and has proven to me to be a good worker with every prospect of making a good showing in the future. Since leaving school he has resided mostly with his father assisting him in many ways. His health is good and is still unmarried. During the past summer I gave him a yoke of oxen and harness. The breaking season was past when he received them, but he is making preparations to commence farming on his location in the early spring. I will be very much disappointed if this boy does not make good progress.\nJames Medicine Rope was a pupil of the Qu'Appelle Industrial school. Since leaving he has lived at home with his parents. His health was very poor when he left school but he appears to be getting stronger. He is still single and occupies his time with his father and brothers by attending to stock and farming. Sometime he may start out in life for himself.\n\nLena Kennedy was a pupil of the Qu'Appelle Industrial school for about three months during the year 1910 and her brother Daniel was also a pupil for the same length of time. I have made special inquiries with reference to the placing of these children in the above school from their father Daniel Kennedy who is residing on this reserve. He informs me that it was his intentions to have them educated in that school, but it appears that the head master gave his boy who was then only six years old a severe punishment which caused bodily injuries and he may be affected for life. This he strongly objected to so he brought his children home. Shortly after these two children were sent to the day school at this Agency and have attended up to the present. The health of these pupils is good. They are making good progress considering they are living five miles from school.\n\nSamuel Whit-Cap graduated from the Qu'Appelle Industrial school a year ago last July. He is now residing on this reserve and occupies his time mostly by working for other Indians. From this source he obtains sufficient money to cloth and board himself. He is still single. His health appears to be good excepting that at times his\nmind seems to be deranged and he acts very foolish. I don't think it would be wise to start this boy for a little time yet because he would not be capable of managing his own affairs, viewing it from a progressive standpoint.\n\nRobert Medicine Grower graduated from the Qu'Appelle Industrial school in June 1912 at the age of eighteen. His health has been good since leaving school but I am sorry to say he is badly deformed. One of his legs was severely injured when he was young and has not grown as long as the other. This necessitates him using a crutch. He is still unmarried and occupies his time by working for other Indians on this reserve. It is surprising how smart and sincere he is with his work. This boy if he was not crippled he would certainly be an object lesson for some of the others. I have not made any effort to start him on his own resources as yet because I believe he would rather be working for wages until he gets over his boyish ways, but when I think he is competent then I will advise him along these lines.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nof Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa Jan. 12th. 1914\n\nSir,\n\nThe following are the names of the ex-pupils about whom the Department requires the information asked for in the circular letter dated Jan. 12th. --\n\n| Name                  | School attended by ex-pupil | Band       |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| Bella Prince          | Kenora Bdg.                | St. Peters |\n| Rhodian Childs        |                            |            |\n| Rosalie Kippling(Parisian) |                        |            |\n| Lizzie Cromarty       | Brandon Industrial         |            |\n| Bert.

This girl is married to another school boy from this school, Dick Beef Tea. They are doing well living on the reserve. The woman is a good clean housekeeper and healthy, as are their one child.\n\nAnnie White Rider. This girl is now married to Joe Ely also an ex-pupil of this school. After leaving school she went on a wild career for three months. I attribute her then dissolute life to the fact that she was married against her will and desire to an unsuitable mate. She left him served three months in female gaol; on her return to the reserve she again married; she since seems to be living a quite uneventful life but suffering from diseases contracted during her first three months out of school.\n\nHarry White Rider. This boy is married to an uneducated Indian girl is living on the reserve. I am not able to say anything in favor of his progress, who he has never been in any mischief to my knowledge. Rather an inside sort of boy lacking the spirit to do either much good or much wrong.\n\nMamie Wearing Old Clothes. This girl is married on the reserve to a worthless Indian, Iron Shirt. I believe she would have been a good woman had she been given a fair chance; but the cupidity of her relatives forced her into an unwished for marriage that has brought her much injury. She is a clean healthy young woman, tidy in her dress pleasant in her manner.\n\nJanie Neely. This young woman is married to James Gladston a half-breed graduate from the same school. She has lived in the town of Lethbridge nearly all the time since she was married where her husband is about for the Mrs Gladstone R N W M T. At present they are living on the reserve at her father's home. This young woman is one of the few instances of the second generation being educated her father being the first Blood Indian that received an education. As a result marked progress is noticeable in all the children in this family.\n\nClean living; good vegetable gardens milk and butter are their daily fare, as a result progress is very marked indeed.\n\nEdith Clem. This girl is married to Harry Mills also an ex-pupil is a good girl but has had a great deal of trouble with her eyesight. When they first became sore her friends forced her to allow Indian doctors to attend them as a result her sight was nearly ruined. After she obtained proper treatment, she gradually recovered. Edith otherwise the woman is quite healthy and progressive. She lives on the reserve and she and her husband are among the most progressive set.\n\nRuth Cotton. This girl eloped from school and married Indian fashion with an Indian who had been married three times previously. She is healthy, clean; but the crassly unreliable characteristics of the Indian are her predominate qualities. It is a question whether school life has not been detrimental to this girl.\n\nJim Realy. Quite inside sort of fellow incapable of either much good or harm. Will never show either much progress or get into trouble. Lives on the reserve with his father.\n\nElgie Standish. This young woman is married to a worthless Indian Alone Rides In the Day Time. She is a good house keeper and healthy. She has two children. Is a good mother will progress rapidly.\n\nIda Weasel Fat. This girl is married to David Mills a negro indian half breed. Seems to be a good girl but will never amount to anything with her mate. She is healthy and a good worker. Lives with her husband's father.\nDick Deer Fox... This boy is a good worker married to Noi on this list they are doing well. Lately there has been some trouble about his health, some indisposition caused from the eating of too much meat. Also they now have some vegetables grown this year in their own garden yet their tastes still cling to the exclusive beef diet.\n\nJack Bird Bull. An ex-pupil of the R C school seems to be a fairly good worker is clean well dressed and he is becoming anxious to get any work in sight. He is very healthy and will progress. Is not I unmarried. Lives on the reserve. With his father does a good deal of freighting.\n\nMaurice Many Fingers. This ex-pupil of the R C school is a good clean young fellow and is a very industrious worker. I am going to have him start farming the coming season. He is married and to Annie Doe also a graduate of this school and they have a good clean home well kept. They are healthy well dressed up industrious will advance rapidly.\n\nMany Bears. This young man is one of the best workers on the reserve. He is married and one of our best farmers. I look for this young man to lead the way in progress among all the people with whom he comes in contact.\n\nTerry Plain Woman. This young man is also a splendid worker and industrious. He is unmarried lives with his father who is a farmer and who thru the winter months works at our cow camp. The boy as well as farther are two of the employees here. This boy will make good.\n\nTom Eagle Child. This young man also a graduate of the R C School is a good worker a hustler but not so careful as I would like. He strives to make great last\ngreat headway but lacks that balance which makes for effective advance. It will turn out well and be one of our very best Indians. He is married to Fanny Face, an ex-pupil they have a good clean home. He is also one of our farmers and at the present time he is engaged as scout and interpreter for the police.\n\nJoseph Spike........ This boy is dying with consumption at the block hospital having been sick almost all the time he has been out of school.\n\nDavid Mills....... This boy is the son of the assistant interpreter David Mills is not a treaty Indian. He is no good and I question if he ever will be. The admixture of Indian and negro blood in this case has been a failure. He lives with his father off the reserve and is married to Ida Weasel Fat an Indian ex-pupil. He is no good, a sneak thief.\n\nBertha Charcoal. Not on the reserve, is no good and it is questionable if education has not made her a worse Indian than if she had not gone to school.\n\nTom Weasel Shoe. No good has got in with a bunch of would be bad men, and is nothing but a tough.\n\nMary Frank now Mary Sweet Grass girl cleanly in her habits, has a fairly good husband but unfortunately is living with her husband's parents who with whom there is constant friction. This has almost led to a separation from her husband. I have brought this young girl to my own home where she is now my wife's domestic, until such times as the weather is warm enough for she and her husband to live in a tent. This young woman if given any chance will make good.\n\nMaurice Prairie Hen. This boy has been transferred to the Peigan reserve where his mother lives. I believe he is a good boy but cannot give you detailed information.\nPolly La Chappelle. This girl is married to an ex-pupil now Joe Bullshield. She is a good wife and mother has as yet no home of her own but will have this summer I am going to make her husband one of our farmers this year. She is healthy cleanly and sensibly dressed. This woman has made good use of her training and I am satisfied she will continue to do so.\n\nArthur Bullshield. This boy died two years ago in Edmonton penitentiary where he had been sentenced to a term of two years for horse stealing. As far as I can learn his sentence was not deserved. He died of Bronchitis.\n\nAlbert Mountain Horse. This boy has as yet shown no strong inclination to go to work. He is a very bright boy and not given to anything harmful but innocent. He is healthy. Is at present living with his mother on the reserve.\n\nEthel Crazy Crow... this is a splendid woman. She is healthy and married now to another ex-pupil Red Tail Feathers. Has two children\n\nRed Tail Feathers. This woman's home is as clean and well kept as the average white home. She is progressive in every way and has and will make great use of her training. She will influence strongly for the better any Indian with whom she comes in contact.\n\nWillie Blose... is subject to fits which has affected his mind. I hardly ever see him. He lives on the reserve with his aunt.\n\nMinnie Jokers... This girl is in a peculiar position, she lives with Miss Wells her late teacher in the C of E School who now lives on the reserve devoting her whole time and attention to the advising of her one time charges. Miss Minnie has been raised by Miss Wells and is such a splendid young woman that she seems too far in advance of any Indian boy too to entertain the idea of marrying one. I do not know of an Indian that I would like to see Minnie marry. She is a good seamstress always industrious,\nindustrious.\n\nMinnie Secker. A good housekeeper. She has had some trouble with a swelling on her knee, but this disease seems to be cured. This is a peculiar circumstance, a girl educated, trained in a manner too far above the only station in life her parents allow her to fill. I shall take a deep interest in watching and guiding the outcome of this young woman.\n\nLucy Gladstone. After this half breed girl left school she did not come on the reserve, and I do not know her whereabouts so can give you no information.\n\nFanny Page. This girl is married to Tom Eagle Child, is a good housekeeper clean and healthy. They live on the reserve and are one of our farmers.\n\nMary Bare Jack. This girl is married has as yet no home of her own but is a good wife, clean and healthy. She lives with her husband in the home of her uncle.\n\nMar Iron Horn. This boy is no good a sneak thief has served several jail terms, is worse than the Indian that has never went to school.\n\nRobert Steel. This boy lives with his father is as yet unmarried is a clean trim looking rather insane boy not given to do anything mean, yet not much good.\n\nFrancis Red Crow. This boy is one of the brightest young men on the reserve if he could keep his cleverness rightly applied. I have had a great deal of trouble with him. We give in many respects one the idea of being the educated fool, just enough education to give him a swelled head. The I look for him to steady down and become a good man. He is married has a family has a good home, and plenty of property. Is healthy clean well dressed and mannerly.\nErnest Moon Calf  \nThis boy is a good worker clean and healthy lives with his mother on the reserve.\n\nGeorge Young  \nThis boy is still unmarried lives on the reserve, is healthy and industrious.\n\nEmile Chief Moon  \nThis boy is healthy, industrious is one of our farmers will progress rapidly.\n\nTom Gammon  \nGood Worker and healthy, lives with his uncle on the reserve, unmarried.\n\nFanny Face  \nThis young woman married another ex-pupil is a good house keeper, clean and healthy as are her children.

I have sought to obtain you as definite information as possible, but on account of the extensive area comprising this reserve I have not become as intimate as I would wish with the scattered population.\n\nGenerally speaking there has been a marked advance derived thru the influence of the mission schools especially so in reference to cleanly appearance and living. But the Indian traits, superstitions and beliefs seem to be so strongly fixed that it is in many cases almost a hopeless task to uproot them. The greatest discouragement to the ex-pupil is that there is now too great a gap between school life and lodge life which often has ruinous results on the young women especially. In the few isolated instances where the children of ex-pupils are attending school there is a marked improvement over the native condition.\n\nThere is now a strong inclination on the part of the parents to send the children to school and our two schools have no difficulty in getting their full complement.\n\nDespite the religious instruction given I question if there are many of the ex-pupils who have any faith in our religion. They attend church especially so if there is a feast in sight.\n\nA little later when I feel that I am competent to form a comparative idea I will send you a letter giving you a comprehensive view of the school conditions here. As an ex-school teacher, there are many\nconditions that I do not like in connection with our two schools here especially the C of E school. I have refrained from writing you on this subject until I acquainted myself with what was expected from the missions, and gained a comparative idea with other school of the same class.\n\nThere are several radical improvements needed in the C of E school, though to make it acceptable both to my views and also the expectations of the ex-pupils who have children. I have wanted to become thoroughly conversant with the conditions under which the principal was laboring before suggesting anything to the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo the Deputy Superintendent Indian Agent.\n\nGeneral\n\nOf Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 16th, 1924\n\nSir,\n\nThe following are the names of the ex-pupils about whom the Department requires the information asked for in circular letter dated Jan. 12th.\u2014 copy of which is enclosed,\u2014 \n\n| Name               | School attended by ex-pupil | Band |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------|------|\n| Kate Starlight     | Sarcee Big.                 | Bullhead |\n| Didymus Hunter     |                             |      |\n| Andrew Hunter      |                             |      |\n| Peter Wense' Foot  |                             |      |\n| Winnie Crowchild   |                             |      |\n| Jessie Many Swans  |                             |      |\n| John Starlight     |                             |      |\n| Elizabeth Big Wolf |                             |      |\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nT.J.

Health good, married to Fred Allary. Two children, one is a girl, sex of other unknown. Allary withdrew from treaty about 1886. Earns living principally by working out. Hand to mouth existence.\n\nJoseph Robillard:- Living with father, Alec Robillard. Never was in treaty. Living on Quarter Section adjoining east boundary Pasqua Reserve. Fort Qu'Appelle P.O.

Married to Michael Trottier, supposed to be in treaty around Fort Ellis. Had one child which died. Trottier earns living principally as a labourer. Circumstances and progress unknown. Agent Wheatley may be able to supply more accurate information.\n\nThe Secretary Henry Daniels:- Son of non-treaty Half-breed. Living at Pine Hills. Health good. Single. Occupation labourer. Parents dead. Hand to mouth existence.\n\nHenry Daniels:- Son of Charles Racette (non-treaty) (non-treaty)\nhalf-breed. Living with parents at Lebret. Is about fifteen years of age. Health good. Single. Chores around home. Chance poor for much progress.\n\nAntonia Obey:- Father dead. Mother married to Chief Standing Buffalo. Antonia married to Gilbert Stone, Standing Buffalo Band. Stone is making only fair progress, farming in a small way, and working out. This girl has hip disease.\n\nJulius Tahkwisk:- Living on Muscowpetung Reserve. Son of No.61 Muscowpetung Band. Health poor. Suffering from spinal tuberculosis. Was operated on lately for tuberculosis of the hip. He may live for a long time, but will always be a cripple. He is unmarried.\n\nMary Bird:- Living on Muscowpetung Reserve, of which Band she is a member. Health good. Sometime after leaving school she went to work as domestic on Mr. Graham's farm, where, through illicit relations with one of the hired men, became pregnant. Returned to Muscowpetung, and shortly before quarantine (December 10th, 1915) gave birth to a child.\n\nRachel Mewson:- or Tuckwaynow:- No.98 Muscowpetung Band. Living at Qu'Appelle Industrial School. Health - deformed with spinal tuberculosis.\n\nAngus Katowens:- Residing on Pasqua Reserve. Married to daughter of No.92 same Band. Health excellent. Farming on own account, and making good progress. Is a bright, intelligent, and steady going man. One conviction for using intoxicants registered against him, for which he served one month. This was at the beginning of his career. Since when he has been a model example.\n\nLeon Fournier:- Residing on Pasqua Reserve, No.49 same Band. This boy was discharged from\nfrom Qu'Appelle School some six years ago, in very bad shape from scrofulous glands, and appeared to have no chance of living. He has, however, grown stronger and more robust, until today he is in a very fair way to do for himself. He is about 19 years old, and is unmarried.\n\nMaurice Missens:- No.165 Pasqua Band. Living at File Hills Agency, where his father, Missens, No.21 Pasqua Band, moved to shortly after Pasqua Band surrendered a portion of their Reserve, and has remained there ever since. Maurice is healthy, but has grown at such an abnormal rate, that he is not very strong. He is doing very little, if anything for himself. This boy married Veronique Peltier, No.108, Cowessess Band, Crooked Lake Agency. They have two female children.\n\nDaniel Tabasco:- No.266 Piapot Band. This boy was discharged from the Qu'Appelle Industrial School in 1910, and married Rebecca Mosey Bird, daughter of No.42 Little Blac k Bear's Band, File Hills Agency.

He made a start for himself after leaving school, but gradually weakened, until he died in May 1915, from tuberculosis.\n\nAnthony Ironchild:- No.264 Piapot Band, resident on Piapot Reserve. This boy was discharged from Qu'Appelle School in 1910, and married Clementina Rock Thunder. Health excellent. Made a good start for himself before he was married, but owing to some trouble with his brother fell away last year. He is a good boy, and now that he is married, I expect that he will turn in again, and make good progress.\nJohn Gabriel:- No.268 Piapot Band. Married widow of No.251, same Band in 1912. This boy made a very weak attempt to do for himself, and naturally failed, although effort was made to keep him going. He has been living at Battleford Agency since last Treaty payment.\n\nPaulus Piapot:- No.271 Piapot Band. Resident on Piapot Reserve. Went to Qu'Appelle school when about fifteen years of age, and returned to the Reserve when about eighteen years old. Married Sarah Nokosis, daughter of No.42, Peepeekisis Band, File Hills Agency. Both the man and woman have weak lungs. The man does a little in the way of farming. He is not fit physically to expect very much of him.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSgd.,\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent.\nIn reply to your Circular letter of December 22nd 1913, I beg to say that it is impossible for me to make the Report asked at present, as I have not visited my Reserves this Winter.

He complains of being ill as an excuse for not working, but is well to the front in all Brotherly exercises.\n\nAdam Basquito\nThis Indian lives on the Stony reserve.

He is a good worker and I believe he will make a success of his life.\n\nHenry Higgins\n\nThis man resides near Prince Albert, and is in very fair health. He is single and at the present time, so I am informed is working for a farmer in that vicinity. He is a steady industrious young man, and is trying to improve himself.\n\nJessie Benaga\n\nThis woman lives on the Stoney reserve, where she is married to an Indian by the name of Warmshark.

She is married to Sam Tobaccojuice, who is not a very industrious man.

She assists her mother at home, and occasionally works out for a month or two. She has given satisfactory answers wherever she has worked.\n\nEdward Nicetino (Tobaccojuice)\n\nThis young man resides on the Red Pheasant reserve, is single and his health is fair. He does practically no work and is lazy like the rest of his family. He makes the excuse that he is ill.\n\nLydia & Maria Cardinal\n\nI know nothing about these two women.

It was very gratifying for me to read that your missionary's efforts might have failed, had it not been for the character-building influence of the Portage la Prairie institution.\n\nI shall be grateful if you will acquaint the Department with the further results of Mr. Ross' activity, and it might be well to have him prepare a report on the ways and means of following up graduates of Indian residential schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Success.\n\nIn 1914 the cards were brought up to date by a circular letter to agents, asking for information concerning:\n\n1. Graduate's Home.\n2. State of Health.\n3. Married or Single.\n4. Occupation.\n5. Progress.\n6. If deceased, the date.\n\nThe aim at this time (1914) was to secure complete records and to determine what were the general results. Were the large expenditure for plant and the more generous per capita grants for residential schools warranted?\n\nIn 1914 there was also a circular to principals and agents, giving special instructions concerning the discharge of graduates of residential schools. The aim was to give assistance wherever possible, so that graduates could immediately put into practice the training received. Prior to graduation the individual pupil's needs were considered and preparation for the most important event in the school life was requested. The discharge was not to be a mere matter of form. Principals and agents were to communicate concerning a proposed discharge and make recommendations to the Department concerning provision for the graduates' future. The medical officer was to report upon the health of the pupil. If a male graduate was to establish a home of his own, agents were requested to select favourable locations and to consider the advisability of grouping ex-pupils in colonies or settlements somewhat removed from the older Indian centres. At times equipment was given or loans were made to male graduates who commenced farming on the reserves. Female graduates were assisted at time of marriage or if they were helpful to their parents. Marriage between graduates was to be encouraged.\n\nIt is proposed to again stimulate the efforts to make graduates self-supporting and good members of their communities. Certain office machinery has to be set up for the purpose of securing the necessary information and compiling records.\n\nI propose to have principals apply for the discharge of pupils who are leaving residential schools - such application to be approved by the Indian agent. The printed form might be as follows:\nThe attached form would be sent out at least once a year to each Indian Agent.\n\nIn forwarding this form to the Agent, the department would supply on the form the name of each graduate, the band and number and the date of discharge.\n\nThe Agent would be expected to complete the form and on its return the information contained therein would be embodied in the \"Annual Record of Graduates\".\nHISTORY OF GRADUATE\n\nName ...........................................

The history of each graduate will be secured and proper records compiled. Before approving the discharge of a pupil, the Department will ask both the principal and the agent to sign an application form, give information concerning the pupil's plans and make recommendations concerning helpful action to be taken.\n\nI am prepared to arrange for larger appropriations for the assistance of ex-pupils and the Department will be guided by the recommendations of church and department representatives. Principals will be asked to keep a register showing the record of graduates and agents will report on progress and changes in residence and status each year.\n\nBoth church and department representatives will be asked to consider the individual pupil's needs and to prepare him or her for graduation - the most important event in school life. The principal will be asked to correspond with the agent before a pupil's graduation in an effort to determine the best way to provide the graduate into worthwhile activity. If a male graduate is to establish a home, agents will consider the advisability of grouping ex-pupils in settlements and will select a favorable location. Equipment for the farm or dwelling can be granted and loans made, if considered advisable. Further, marriage between graduates will be encouraged.\n\nPlease give this programme thoughtful consideration and offer constructive criticism. Any contributions to this scheme that you or your inspectors can make, will be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nYou will remember that we discussed the ex-pupil problem when you were in Ottawa. I am convinced that more definite steps must be taken to prepare pupils for graduation and to guide them into lives of usefulness. Much thought, many efforts and large expenditures by the Church and this Department are being put into Indian educational activity and there is no reason why the ex-pupil should not receive more of the attention and energy than heretofore.\n\nAcademic instruction in Indian residential schools has been stimulated from time to time and more satisfying results are being obtained. We must now emphasize particularly the vocational training received in Indian residential schools. This training must be coordinated with conditions under which the graduate will live and to be effective should be applied soon after leaving school.\n\nI propose to inform the church authorities that principals of Indian residential schools are to be asked to cooperate with the Department in the effort to secure efficient instructors for vocational training. Every effort must be bent to secure properly qualified incumbents who will ever bear in mind that the pupil's school life is a preparation for useful membership in his or her home community. In all provinces girls should receive\nthorough domestic training. In farming localities boys should receive instruction in farming, gardening, the care of stock and the handling of tools. Where Indians do not and cannot farm, the boys should be trained definitely for the earning of their livelihood.\n\nIn the second place, steps should be taken to surround the graduate with influences and aids that will make him or her self-supporting and a good member of the community. There are many inherent difficulties to this phase of the problem and I am writing to you and one or two others to assist me with the preparation of a programme of supervision and assistance for ex-pupils.\n\nI should like to enlist our present staff of agents and other workers on reserves for this activity. As in the past, the Department will make grants for equipment and will allow loans for buildings, etc., when such action is wise. It might be well to consider settlements for graduates who are establishing homes.\n\nPlease let me have suggestions at your earliest convenience.\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOctober 9th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning, October 16th and 19th, and I should like to come in and see you during the morning of the 19th in order to discuss matters affecting the Indian work in this Diocese. I have no particular object to urge, but I would like to discuss the future possibilities of -\n\nThe large question of the after-care of pupils from the residential schools, and in this connection developing the new Reserve and taking over parts of John Smith's Reserve for Indian settlement.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.)

These have been discharged from school in the last five or six years and since leaving school have not accomplished one single thing. In most cases they are living with their parents. Some of them are married but have left their wives and both parties are now living with their parents. In many cases both men and women have served terms in jail during the last three years. William Quewezance has four boys at home - all graduates of Lebret School, and two of them married. They were all clever at school, and to meet them at their home or at the agency office they appear to be very fine boys, but although it is anywhere from two to ten years since they left school, they have not accomplished a thing and have not even a decent place to live in. Louis, the eldest boy, received some assistance, but I do not believe the other three have received anything. There are many other cases of one and two boys, school graduates, in a family, who are doing nothing, and I consider this a question which should receive special attention. I would hesitate to make any recommendations, as before anything could be accomplished some money would have to be spent, and I feel it is wiser to think over the situation for a while and discuss it thoroughly with you. I am writing you a special letter regarding the question of morals amongst the school graduates on these two reserves.\nThere are a number of young men on Cote and Levesquehouse who are graduates of Lebret, File Hills and Battle schools and an odd one from Brandon.

I would hesitate to make any recommendations, as before anything could be accomplished some money would have to be spent, and I feel it is wiser to think over the situation for a while and discuss it thoroughly with you.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMarch 30, 1932.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nUNITED CHURCH SCHEME FOR PLACEMENT OFFICER\n\nIN BRITISH COLUMBIA,\n\nAS OUTLINED BY PRINCIPAL RALEY.\n\nThe Churches and the State have partly eliminated the Inferiority Complex of the Indian student but have by no means solved the problem of the Indian graduate. The problem resolves itself into (1) How can the ideals of the school be kept alive? and (2) What occupations can be provided for the graduate?\n\nIn the past, the effort was to make the Indian healthy, to train his mind and to save his soul. However, with the influx of the white man, the Indian's freedom has been curtailed (e.g., Fisheries and Game Acts, White Man's competition) and the Indian, with his inherited tendencies, his culture and traditions, has been swallowed up. The golden age for the B.C. Indian has come to an end and he has to throw in his lot with the white man. The Churches and the State have thrown a mantle of protection around the Indian, or the white man's contaminations would have made conditions worse than they really are.\n\nThe problem of the graduate, always keeping in mind the inherited tendencies of the Indian, resolves itself into (1) Health, (2) Academic Attainment, (3) Vocational Training, (4) Character. The Department and the Churches have pretty well solved the first two problems. Certain schools have done exceptionally well with vocational training and all of them are giving a good moral training.\n\nAfter graduation, we find the real problem. There are drifters in the cities and other centres of population. Others go to the canneries before returning to their villages. Work is a salvation but the great majority find the old life comparatively easy, free firewood, free fish and occasional labour at good prices. The graduate does not feel satisfied that he has made good. He has a constant urge for a better place in the world. Further, he does not always fit into the old reactionary environment, as his education has not fitted him for primitive conditions. There is a chasm, separating him from the people. He cannot follow the old trail and would like to blaze a new one. He goes to the city to find work. Here, he knows no one and good jobs are at a premium. Pretty soon, he becomes a drifter and is living in a poor section of the city.\nwhere drinking is common and vice is open.\n\nThe girl graduate who marries solves her own problem, provided she becomes a good mother and housekeeper. The level of the people is raised with each generation. The chief danger for girls is in the canneries and at casual labour, in cafes, etc. Girls, as a rule, however, like to improve their homes and living conditions. They are often considered snobbish and so many give up the struggle and seek work in the cities. Others make undesirable marriages. Unless those wishing to enter domestic service have made previous arrangement, they get into undesirable lodgings and are soon drifting where the colour line is no barrier.\n\nAs far as British Columbia is concerned, the most immediate and pressing problem is the future of the graduates, both boys and girls, who are moving into the cities. The city of Vancouver would be a good place to try out a new scheme. An Indian supervisor could be appointed, who, if he had a good knowledge of Indians and was able to maintain a check on graduates in the city, might be of great value in having young Indians placed in safe boarding places and in suitable positions. The success of this scheme would depend on the supervisor appointed.\nParry Sound, Ont.\nMay 19, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nYours of May 14th, 150-14, Circular letter to Indian Agents and Principals of Residential Schools, received.\n\nI have read this circular letter over very carefully and am delighted with the contents of same.

Indian Education,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI have just received a copy of your circular letter dated Ottawa, May 14, 1932, #150-14 and addressed to Indian Agents and Principals of Residential Schools. I will present your letter to our Commission at their next meeting, but I feel sure that the members would like me to thank you very cordially for the action you have taken towards a more careful supervision of the activities of graduate pupils, and towards helping them to make the best use of the knowledge they obtained while in residence in these institutions.\n\nFor some years past this has been a matter of great concern to the authorities of our Church in general, and to the authorities of our Missionary Society in particular. So great indeed was their concern that, at the General Synod which met in Toronto last September a Resolution was adopted authorizing a careful investigation of the whole subject. Careful action is being taken in keeping with the terms of that Resolution and the special committee which has been appointed to deal with the whole question has been quite busy in collecting data which may help them to formulate a system that will place the whole matter on a more satisfactory basis, than that on which it has rested hitherto. The members of this special committee have a strong feeling that, without the whole-hearted sympathy and co-operation of your Department's representatives, and especially of the Indian Agents, the work of supervision and direction of graduate pupils can never be made a success. Our Church through the Bishops in charge of Dioceses...\nand the missionaries in those Dioceses, will help to the fullest extent of their power, and it is greatly to be hoped that the direction you have given in your circular letter may be productive of the results which, I feel sure, you earnestly desire to secure.\n\nOn behalf of our Commission, I beg to thank you very cordially for your circular letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nMay 26th, 1932.\n\nMr. Russell T.

I have found in my travels a strong conviction that it is at this point we need to strengthen our work. There is a feeling that just here is the missing link in our educational system, and I feel sure that we will have the hearty co-operation of all the men who are working under our Board in connection with this effort which the Department is putting forth.\n\nWith kindest wishes,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Bannister\n\nAB:NEF\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nMay 21st, 1932.\n\nSir-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt\nof Departmental Letter No. 150-14 of the 14th\ninstant, with regard to instructions to Principals\nof Residential Schools and Indian Agents in connection\nwith the welfare of Indian children after they\nreceive their discharge from Residential Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental circular letter No. 150-14 of May 14, 1932, with reference to assistance to be given to pupils upon being discharged from Kootenay Residential School.\n\nI am pleased to report that the Reverend J.M. Patterson, Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School and missionary to the Reserve in this Agency, co-operates in every possible way with this office. He takes a very keen interest in the pupils of the school, and close attention is being given to those who have been discharged and returned to their homes, with a view to having them make profitable use of the training received at the school.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nChief Portage\nJuly 28th 1937\n\nMr. J.W. Warden\nDear Sir,\n\nI am very glad to answer four of your questions:\n\n1. Yes, every time I am glad that I was but a treaty.\n2. Yes, a great deal.\n3. The best can be done to an Indian who has a little education to make him a good citizen in franchise from his country, means a great honor to him. My friends white people and Indians were very glad to get so honored.\n4. My neighbors were more than glad when I got enfranchised so I was now considered as a white man by law.\n\nJoseph Biginece Sr.\nPlease write to me some time when you are in the humor and give me your views on the following:\n\n1. If you had the opportunity again would you apply for enfranchisement or would you remain in treaty.\n\n2. Do you think you have benefitted yourself by obtaining enfranchisement.\n\n3. What does your wife and your family think about the whole business, do they regret your action in obtaining enfranchisement.\n\n4. What do your neighbors think, do they talk about it or do they accept you as one of themselves now.\nGlad to have got your letter some time ago. We are all well at present and quite happy. Robert Tobacco came here a few days ago but left for Split Lake by lake his old fort there and got so to his trapping ground. Robert is doing well and we make last lot of money in winter time. Elyal Tobacco and the brother R. Tobacco just send in his application to Ottawa to get out of treaty in the mean time. Elyal will be trapping while hopes along the east of Bay where Nick St. Croix, to White Rapids from Shetley. Portage, I was down the Pao last month to see old Doc Cook. I am applying for pension\u2014this me getting it I might push so well get it. If I can get it, the time was dead, hard times everywhere no mining activity all the way. We still keeping a few claims, just enough to keep us going for a while\u2014everything went to pieces when the cruel came and many people went broke and some others badly hurt.\nOld town is still alive and that's about all, even by as the very devil in town since he is doing no business at all. No one likes him. Bob Miller got all the business which going in the town. Bob nearly got broke too spending too much on worthless mining claims, but we put him in his last of air. Rob was quite plentiful last spring, but the price was simply enough although we can pick lots of snow last fall before old weather set in. We had thirty four hour snow storm. Snow was nearly two feet deep to start with. That stop all my trapping, very poor winter for trapping any way. Our town is improving. We have two big sections houses and a coal bin, also one watch tower for fire rangers and one milk punch. Wells is still here. One of my boys got married last month to one of the old jin. Butten's girls. Mr. Fraser Principal of the new school was here for the reunion. I'll soon feel like an old man.\nMatthew Wood is now Chief for the Nelson House Band and James Harvey the present Chief of Split Lake Band will resign his job next year. It seems this Swede fell fellow the Indians agent-up here unpopular among the Indians in this agency. I do not know anything about this fellow Donald Lindie, the son of W.C. Lindie and another trapper got their traps from dead white traps last winter they were out along the coast of N.Bay that fall while foxes came South much earlier than former years it happens often that there was a rain but this river was open the foxes could not get across so these two trappers went to work and put their shot guns to work when shells were exhausted they got out their .47 rifles and simply moved down the foxes in great style until they got over six them dead. Great luck\nMy old father is still living but he's still working as hard as ever, but the old fellow is getting old now.\n\nMy only brother Alex got married last summer\u2014much work is going on along Hudson Bay Railway but it's impossible for any body to get a job now. Mr. Booth has not wanted these foreigners and they just keep coming here, no room for any other but them. I am having very much trouble to get a job at Churchill for the last three years but with no avail. I hope your family are very well. Please do not take trouble to answer this letter, only I thought you might want to hear some news from this most northern part of the country.\n\nVery best regards from my family to all of you\u2014very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAug 31, 1931\n\nquesions I will try and answer them\nto the best of my ability.\n\n1. If you were in treaty now would you\napply for enfranchisement or would you\nremain under treaty?\nTo be frank I would still apply to\nbe enfranchised.\n\n2. Have you better yourself and family\nby taking enfranchisement?\nBoth bodily and spiritually we have.\n\n3. Does your wife and family regret your\naction or are they pleased that you are\nenfranchised?\nNo, they do not regret and I have\nnever heard them complain.\n\n4. Do you find any better relations with\nwhite people as a free man or do they\ntreat you still as if you are a treaty\nperson, in other words do they accept\nyou as one of themselves.\nI certainly do and I am treated\nwith respect and when in town\nassociate mostly with white people.\nI think that I have answered your few questions as frankly as I can. You know yourself that before I was enfranchised I was forever getting into trouble about using too much alcoholic beverages. Now since I have been enfranchised I have not got into a single trouble (2 years) because if I feel inclined to a drink I have the privilege of walking into any beer parlor and purchasing my thirst just the same as our M.P.'s for Wilson and all Indian agent do or any citizen who is entitled to do so. Another thing why I believe in enfranchisement is that it teaches and causes a man to be self reliant. He has to work to maintain himself and his family. He does not look forward to his annual treaty payment or his interest money or to any rations. He has to work or starve also when he has accomplished a certain task he knows that he has done it himself and feels happy and encourages him to further efforts.\nI have not got on as fast as I hoped to on account of non-employment. None of us has been able to secure work on account of old hands being taken on first but however I am progressing. I also believe in enfranchisement to those fit for it as you say. Since you left the following have applied for enfranchisement but none succeeded. I do not know whose fault it was whether the Chief or Indian Agent and I am sure a lot of them could make a better living outside than in the Reserve. Joseph McGillivray, Esq., Sarah and Peter Rigell, Anna Ralph Young, Zachariah Young, Peter Rigell, Mr. S. R. Cook, Miss David Mink. Out of these the above five are returned men from our 65 pupils of different schools only one went to a day school. I think that I have told all the news. I have been elected as President of the Half breed association for this district and all correspondence necessary also approach the commissioners.\n150-14 VOL. 2 CLOSED\n\n30 JUN 1960\n31 AUG 31\n\nSTATUS OF DISCHARGED\nPUPILS\n\nCLOSED 11 MAR 48\n\nSEE VOL. 3\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6032)\n\nFile 150-14, part 2\nHeadquarters - Status of Discharged Pupils\n- Indian Schools. 1900-1931\n\nFile 150-34, part 1\nHeadquarters - Teachers Attending Institutes\nand Conventions. 1922-1933\n\nFile 150-37, part 1\nHeadquarters - Regulation Holidays -\nResidential Schools. 1911-1947\n\nFile 150-39, part 1\nHeadquarters - Red Cross - Indian Schools.\n1920-1946\n\nFile 150-40A, part 1\nHeadquarters - Compulsory Attendance of\nPupils - Indian Schools. 1904-1933\n\nFile 150-41, part 1\nHeadquarters - Supplementary Reading Books\nfor Indian Schools. 1931-1942\nGovernment of the Province of Saskatchewan\n\nCanada\n\nDepartment of Education.\n\nRegina, Sask.,\n\nDec. 20th. 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nInspector Hutchison, you will note, suggests that teachers of Indian Schools be asked to attend and participate in such teacher gatherings as institutes, conventions, school fairs, etc., which may be in their neighbourhood.

With the sanction of the Indian\nDepartment and the cooperation of the Indian agent, much\nwould be done to help these teachers to improve their\nmethods.\"\nOttawa, Jan. 30, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Bartlett:\n\nI wish to refer to your report, following the inspection of the Peguis Centre Indian Day School. You will remember that you informed this Department that you were considering the advisability of holding a one-day demonstration conference at some convenient point where the teachers could meet, discuss their difficulties and have their methods tried out in actual classroom teaching.\n\nI will be very grateful if you will make a definite suggestion in this connection. Provincial public school inspectors in Saskatchewan have taken concerted action, having invited the teachers of Indian schools to attend and participate in teachers' institutes and gatherings. In that province this Department has made arrangements with Regina for the inspection of Indian schools; in Manitoba, as you are aware, we communicate direct with the individual inspectors.\n\nPlease intimate the Indian schools that you could group for a one-day institute, and make a suggestion as to what remuneration should be allowed to you. Upon receipt of your answering communication, we will direct official letters to the Indian agents and teachers concerned.\n\nThis Department thanks you for the interest you have shown. I am enclosing a printer's copy of a recent writing, relative to the general problem.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. W. Bartlett, Esq.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nEriksdale, Man.\nRe Demonstration Conferences\nIndian Schools\nyours no 1-1-1\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter re above, I beg to explain that my plan was simply to hold a gathering (day) of the teachers of the three schools on the Peguis reserve, and the two teachers on Fisher River Reserve, at which each school seems, on further consideration, to be most generally convenient. I may be able to do something in some other way for the teachers on Lake Manitoba Reserve, who is greatly in need of guidance.\n\nMy idea would be to hold a one-day school, and giving the teachers a chance to assist as much as possible, and also to question and discuss procedure. Our chief obstacle to efficient help on our visits is that so much routine work encroaches considerably on the time for assisting them in the best methods of handling the class-work.\n\nIf the Indian agent would cooperate (as I am sure he would) in getting the teachers to the centre chosen and the teachers are allowed the day, without deduction, as is customary in white schools, I would ask no remuneration other than the right to send in a travelling and living expenses account.\n\nYours Truly,\n[Signature]\n\nErie, October 3rd, 1927\nOttawa, Feb. 19, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. G. W. Bartlett, of Eriksdale, Man., the Public School Inspector for the area in which your agency is located, has offered to hold, for the benefit of the teachers on the Peguis and Fisher River Reserves, a one day demonstration conference. I have suggested to Mr. Bartlett that he communicate with you, regarding the time and place for such a teachers' gathering.\n\nIt is intended to close the schools in your agency on the day such teachers gather at a central point; the pupils in attendance at the school chosen for the demonstration should be present. You will arrange to have the teachers of all the schools gather at such time for the purpose of meeting with Mr. Bartlett and enjoying the privileges of the demonstration teaching and the discussion on pedagogical methods.\n\nPlease give Mr. Bartlett every assistance in this connection and arrange to have all the teachers in your agency present, if possible. In the spring, you might write to the Inspector and receive definite information regarding his plans.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nM.

Tod,\nInsp.\nOttawa, April 24, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your report on the Lake St. Martin Indian Day School, dated the 15th ultimo, in which you state that it would be well to encourage teachers of Indian schools to attend the teachers' conventions. I am grateful for this evidence of interest in our wards, and, in the near future, I will correspond with each Public School Inspector in the Province of Manitoba, in an effort to secure permission to instruct our teachers in line with your suggestion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJames Ted, Esq.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nAshern, Man.\nINSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS\nMANITOBA\n\nEriksdale June 17th 23\n\nR. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa\n\nRe Fisher River Agency\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI held the teachers conference for above named agency on Friday the 9th inst. All teachers of the agency schools were present except the Jack Head Teacher, whose isolated position make it impossible for him to be present without considerable loss of time. We also had the cooperation and attendance of Indian agent McCuish, who has always shown the utmost readiness to cooperate in educational efforts.\n\nThe teachers showed great interest and availed themselves of every opportunity for question discussion, and elucidation. I believe they all feel greater confidence in the possibilities of their work and clearer ideas of how to realize these possibilities.\n\nI enclose herewith an outline of the subjects and problems considered and demonstrated.\n\nConsiderable emphasis was placed on the practical aims of a good Indian school as compared with a white school; and how best to work these out. Training in self-reliance and good citizenship were also fully considered. The correlation of school and out-of-school interests was also emphasized.\n\nA Boys' and Girls' Club was organized, of which the Department will no doubt be advised by the Officers.\nInspector R. Ferrie Esq., Inspector of Schools, Manitoba\n\nInspector R. Ferrie, who was at Hodgson at the time, came up with me, and gave us valuable assistance in our conferences.\n\nThe teachers passed a resolution expressing a wish that such a conference might be held twice yearly at Peguis and Fisher Reserves alternately; provided that I could arrange to hold same.\n\nI pointed out that the matter would have to come before the Dept. of Indian Affairs before any decision was arrived at. Speaking for myself, I could meet this plan if the fixing of dates were left in my hands, on the understanding that I should notify the Indian agent at least a month in advance of date fixed.\n\nIn this case, I would charge only my expenses, which would probably be about the same as those to this conference. (About $10.00 together with any expense bill the Indian agent may put in for board and driving on the Reserve.)\n\nI am also sending through the regular channels a supplementary report of water supply at Peguis Centre and North.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.W. Bartlett\n\nP.S. I found that every teacher on the reserve had some training in St. John's ambulance or first aid work. It therefore seemed advisable to recommend a small first-aid outfit for each school, to practice the bandaging, dressing of wounds, stopping of bleeding, etc.\n\nIf such purchase is not approved, the dispensers might be instructed to lend the teacher such supplies as are needed for demonstration.\n\nG.W.B.\nINSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS\nMANITOBA\n\nDemonstration Pugiscentte School, 8-6-22\n\nA Practical Aims in Indian Education: how attain\n\n1. Cleanliness and observation of elementary laws of health, and decency.\n\n2. A pride in self-support, and usefulness.\n\n3. A rational attitude to practical problems rather than away of tradition and superstition.\n\n4. Appreciation of the beauty of useful work well done\u2014a well-kept garden, a clean house, &c., conversely, a distaste for carelessness and slovenly work. The foundation for the appreciation of good taste and simplicity in decoration, dress, etc.\n\n5. Good manners & Relation to foregoing\n\n6. Good morals\n\nB School attendance Conference, in which we were greatly assisted by the Indian agent and the Anglican missionary.\n\nC How to interest Indian children\n\n1. Adaptation of school program to their experience and environment.\n\n2. More observation and manual work as source of information usually gathered from books.\n\n3. Arithmetic, English, and other subjects based on real problems of the Indian boy or girl.\n\n4. Study the Indian child; talk to him about school interests; get acquainted; win his confidence.\n\n5. Do not be too critical at first. Show appreciation of the smallest effort toward good work. Accept the crude decoration of colouring at first, and work gradually to better.\n\nP.T.O.\nSpecial Subjects\n\n1. Number Work: Explanation & objects of the work outlined in progress latest.\n   (a) Value of use of rule and measure.\n   (b) Chronological order in fundamental.\n   (c) Fill in essential data in the Indian School.\n   (d) Never allow pupil to attempt to work a prob.\n      which he does not know the meaning.\n   (e) Short snappy lessons of specific aim.\n\n2. Reading:\n   (a) Must first arouse a desire to read.\n   (b) Read interesting story to pupil.\n   (c) Talk about interesting topic and write simple words of sentence board.\n   (d) Danger of beginning in the book too soon.\n   (e) Danger of mechanical routine procedure.\n   (f) Select appropriate lesson folly of the \"cover to cover\" method.\n   (g) Supplementary reading.\n\n3. Spelling:\n   (a) Stress on familiar words in common use.\n   (b) Written superiority of sentence dictation to word lists.\n\n4. Geography:\n   Necessity of home geography and study of environment as foundation for formal study.\n\nIndian School Graduates\n\nThe subsequent career of graduates from different schools was considered somewhat minutely, and so far as concerns this agency, the results are not encouraging.\n\nConsidering various cases, the failure to make good seems due to the sudden change of condition from the environment of school to outside, especially in Boarding Schools. It would appear that at this stage and for a year or two, until the pupil gets definitely established at a vocation some follow-up system might be devised, or existing agents adapted to advise, guide, assist, and report on each case. The loss of the right leadership from these pupils in later years, is a serious matter.\nOttawa, June 19, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Fletcher:\n\nMr. Public School Inspector J. Tod, of Ashern, intimates that it would be well to encourage Indian school teachers to attend the local conventions and institutes under the auspices of your Department. The value of keeping in touch with other teachers and hearing discussions of their problems is evident, and I should be pleased to have your permission to cooperate with the Provincial Public School Inspectors who visit Indian schools, with a view to having them invite Indian school teachers to attend and participate in the local gatherings. I have reference, of course, not to the annual teachers' conventions, but to the local institutes which are supervised by your field officers.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that Mr. Inspector G. W. Bartlett, of Brixdale, has, with our approval and support, held a conference for the Indian school teachers of what is known as the Fisher River Indian Agency. Much good has resulted from this activity, and the Department has seen fit to compliment and thank your officer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. Fletcher,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, June 19, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has received a report from Mr. Public School Inspector Bartlett, with reference to the conference held for the teachers of Indian schools of the Fisher River Agency. I have complimented and thanked the Provincial Department officer for his interest and assistance in this very constructive activity. He has reported that you have given cooperation and have always shown the utmost readiness to assist in educational matters. I have expressed the Department's wish that these conferences be repeated each year, and I should be pleased if you would cooperate with this Department in this effort in the future, without further instructions. If you have been to any expense, other than that attendant upon your regular duties, I should be pleased if you would submit a voucher in your favour and refer to this file number.\n\nPlease instruct the dispensers to give the teachers of the schools such supplies as are needed for demonstrations in First Aid work. Mr. Bartlett intimates that the teachers are all qualified to give some training along these lines to the pupils of the respective schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nM. McCuish, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway P. O.,\nMan.\nOttawa, June 19, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, relative to the Teachers' Conference in the Fisher River Agency. I have noted that the teacher of the Jackhead Indian School was the only absentee and that great interest was shown by our workers. I have examined your agenda, and the Department wishes to congratulate you and Inspector Tod on this very constructive and valuable work. This activity should be repeated from year to year and will receive the Department's hearty support and approval.\n\nA cheque will be forwarded, under separate cover, for your expenses in connection with this gathering. I shall also see that Mr. Agent McGilsh is reimbursed, if he is out of pocket because of this activity. I am directing him to instruct the dispensers to provide the teachers with such supplies as are needed for purposes of demonstrating First Aid.

Mr. Bartlett offered us his services and arranged, in conjunction with Mr. Agent McNish, for a gathering of the teachers of Indian day schools in the Fisher River Agency, and the least we could do was promise to pay his expenses.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

I should be grateful if you would invite to these institutes the teachers of any Indian schools that are in your inspectorate.

At these institutes, the discussions on pedagogical methods and the general associations have proved a source of much helpfulness to school teachers. These meetings are local teachers' conventions and take from one to four days per year.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs will permit Indian schools to be closed any day, or days, on which there is a teachers' gathering in the vicinity. Days on which school teachers have been present at an institute will be credited as \"days taught\" when salary is being paid. Indian residential schools, also, have permission to close classrooms on such occasions, if the teachers are attending an institute.

Most all the teachers were present at this conference except Miss McCall, the junior teacher at Fairford, who had been very ill and was still suffering from a severe cold. In point of intelligent practical grasp of the problems\u2014both detail and the larger aspects\u2014I think I may say this conference has been our best. We had the benefit of some assistance from agricultural instructors Mr. Waite and Dr. Blake of Ashern, who was at the reserve on medical work.\n\nI think I am in a position to submit a proposition regarding the new departure in Indian Practical Education concerning which we had some correspondence the time of my last report. I shall submit this under separate cover herewith.\n\nYou will be pleased to hear that all the schools have made good progress during the year. Fairford operating under most favorable conditions still holds the lead but is being overtaken by Little Lake St. Martin school through Mr. Carwood working alone there with scanty equipment under unfavorable environment, and a heavy rural ungraded school, all are doing well however. Mr. Wheaton of Little Saskatchewan has done much more efficient work this year; and the school shows substantial progress.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nGeo.

Bartlett, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nBriksdale, Man.\nRed Bank, N.B., Aug. 1st, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe the teacher's convention, I have teachers preparing papers. We would like to hold same from the 5th to the 9th of Sept. at Woodstock, N.B. There should be 14 teachers present. I am trying to have the Bishop of St John present to address them. Mr. Lockery will read a paper.\n\nAs the teachers from this side have a great distance to travel, I feel that the Dept. should provide a grant of at least $150.00 to cover R.R. tickets &c. The week that the Dept. will allow them will pay for their hotel bills. I feel that such a meeting is the only way whereby we can get things in line and have uniformity, progress and system in our schools. Much time & energy is certainly wasted from the lack of system. A good, far surpassing the expenditure, is sure to come from such a convention. There will be a sacrifice of time & an inconvenience to myself & teachers, yet little progress is ever accomplished without sacrifice.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nFrederick C. Ryan.\n\nP.S. Should the Dept. have any suggestions to offer that might further the progress of such a Convention, I would be pleased to have same. I am booking many Notes, that I have, from time to time, found, that may be of more than little interest to our teachers.\nOttawa, August 5th, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nRelative to that portion of your letter of the last instant regarding the holding of a teachers' convention at Meductic from the 5th to the 7th of September, next, to be attended by all the teachers in the Indian schools in New Brunswick, I beg to say that the Department approves of this conference being held at the time mentioned. It is hoped that all the teachers will be present at this conference and that much benefit will be derived by them in their work. I would suggest that school management, classroom work and the interesting of the children therein, and the teaching of domestic science, be among the subjects discussed. We will allow the teachers leave of absence from the 5th to the 12th of September in order that they can attend this conference, and salary will be paid them during that period.\n\nWe will allow a grant not exceeding the sum of $150 towards the expenses of the transportation of teachers. We will forward this amount to you upon request, and you should administer the same in the payment of transportation and other expenses. You should obtain from the teachers, if possible, receipts covering the cost of their transportation, and you should prepare a voucher, in duplicate, accounting for the expenditure of the amount allowed.\n\nThe Department will leave the arrangements and details for the holding of this conference in your hands, and I shall be pleased to have a report from you after the conference is over giving the names of the teachers who attended, the various subjects discussed and the general results achieved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. O. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, North. Co., N.B.;\nRev. Fathers & Sisters, Fellow Teachers:\n\nIt gives me great pleasure to be present at this convention of Indian School Teachers\u2014the first of its kind to be held in the Province of New Brunswick. I have been asked by Rev. Tucker to pay my esteemed Inspector of Indian Schools for the province, to offer a few practical suggestions on the teaching of some of the most difficult subjects which are taught in our Indian Schools.\n\nThe motivation of teaching consists in planning or teaching the work of the school so that the tasks of the pupil are made significant & purposeful to each child, by relating them as closely as possible to his childish experiences, questions, desires and needs. The child's work is not motivated whenever he sees a real use in it, or when it helps him to attain a definite end. If the different subject were presented in an interesting manner, children would not consider their school work such a drudgery.\n\nLet us consider Arithmetic. To be compelled to study...\nor to engage in certain occupations whose interest is utterly lacking is work; if the interest is sharply engaged, it is play. Mathematics, the stumbling block of many children's lives, can be made a joy by treating it as a science of quantity. Their imaginations should be developed by giving them practical examples of every day life, such as playing store, etc.\n\nLet them play games on the blackboard, such as composition in addition, subtraction, multiplication and division tables, by having teams to see which side wins out by the rapidity and accuracy with which they play the game. I think it would be a great help if a copy of Kennedy's O'Hearn's Arithmetic could be secured as a hand-book for teachers to assist them in selecting practical examples. To my mind, the present day Arithmetic by O'Brien is not practical, especially for fractions.\n\nLet us next consider grammar, which ranks second only to mathematics, as a mental discipline study. Yet it need never be irksome as a really enthusiastic teacher can make it one of the most fascinating subjects of the course. In the lower grades, instruction in English should take the form of language lessons, which merely emphasize what is correct or correct what is wrong, without teaching...\na system of rules; for instance they should be taught to say, \"I saw it,\" he has gone.\" It is true she has done it without knowing exactly why; for grammar is a science, and the minds of little children are as yet too undeveloped to grasp scientific principles. When they come to the study of formal grammar, they learn the logical reasons for these things, and then they begin to take a real pride in speaking correctly. In teaching the parts of speech, the teacher should lead the child to see that the same word is not always the same part of speech, but may serve in a number of capacities\u2014verbs as nouns, nouns as verbs and adjectives\u2014for instance, \"The good is always beautiful;\" \"The beautiful is good;\" both \"good\" and \"beautiful\" are used once as noun, and once as adjective. And so on through the different stages of this subject, I think the teacher can make it very interesting.\n\nOur present day History of Canada does not seem to appeal to the childish mind. As you all know children are fond of story-reading, and for this reason, I think that a history written in the form of a continuous story, and containing but very few dates would be\nmore easily studied and remembered by the children.\n\nGeography may also be taught in many practical ways, for instance in map-drawing. A map is not a picture but merely a representation. Have the children make a map of their class-room (this should be done on a scale) marking desks by horizontal lines, the teacher's desk by a square, the heater by a circle, etc.; or they may make a map of the school grounds, their own home & grounds. Later they may map their village and so on. In teaching definitions, such as island, peninsula etc., when possible have the children go to river bank & really make an island & peninsula. In this way I think the impression will be lasting. So I have already detained you too long. Thank you for your kind attention.\nDifficulties in an Indian class-room\nHow to overcome them.\n\nNo matter what occupation one takes up in life, difficulties are bound to arise. They may be small or great. The outcome of these difficulties, very often lies in the ways and means one takes to overcome and conquer them. Once a difficulty has arisen and is overcome, then one can be on guard to see that it does not occur again; and if it should then at least one knows how to overcome it from our previous experience. So in the long run, the optimist will not view a difficulty in a tragic light, but rather as another rung in the ladder of experience.\n\nSo it is with various difficulties which arise in an Indian class-room. In this paper I will try and deal with a few which have come within the range of my experience. These may be familiar to you, if again, you may not have met them.\n\nFirst, let us consider\nthe two starting difficulties, namely those of \"Beginning school\" and \"Regular Attendance,\" which we as teachers know to be so important, if the child is to accomplish anything.\n\nThe Indian child, by nature, is a lover of a free outdoor life, so naturally dislikes the idea of being enclosed within the school room for a period of five or six hours a day. Even again, the child may have been prejudiced by older complaints against school life, and had developed a dislike for school before it actually commences. We should always discourage such talk among older pupils and warn them against speaking of their class-room troubles before smaller children. This will in a measure overcome the starting difficulty. It has also aids us, by requiring all children of school age on the Indian reserve, to be enrolled at the Indian Day School and it is the duty of the truant officer, to see that this attendance is continued; thus lifting the burden from the teachers' shoulders to a\ncertain degree. Let us say now that the child has begun school life. The second difficulty now arises\u2014that of regular and punctual attendance; and this one I believe, the teacher alone must cope with. The one great method of overcoming this difficulty, is for the teacher to create an interest for the child in school. Make those five or six hours so interesting, that the boy or girl will feel, that he or she is losing a great deal by not being present when the bell rings for the first morning session. Similarly for the afternoon. We all still have our own original ideas as to arousing this interest. May I suggest one or two ways. For instance, the first period of the morning, given to religious instruction, why not begin that period, not with a demand for the home prepared lesson, but by some simple interesting story dealing perhaps with the lesson which is to follow, again have a series of holy pictures for the children to examine, which are always inspiring for\nanyone, more especially to the child who can retain what he sees more readily than what he hears. The lesson then following will be of interest for the children, because through story and picture study they have a knowledge of what it is about. Tales events follow one another in regular order, so as in the end to have one long complete story. Then the interest will be redoubled, and the child will always be in place in class, in order not to miss one event of the grand story which takes place daily in his or her school-room. Again, knowing the story and being able to recognize it in picture form, will make them eager to study and find out things for themselves. So I think that with a little originality on the part of the teacher, this simple plan could be followed not only with regard to the Catechism classes, but to all other classes as well.\n\nInstruction\u2014another great class-room difficulty. The lesson is being explained\nby the teacher, and at its close she may inquire of a pupil, some fact connected with it. How discouraging to find that the pupil cannot give the required answer so soon after hearing it. The result of inattention on the part of the pupil\u2014yes, and I can safely add, on the part of the teacher. Do not wait until you are all through talking before consulting pupils. Talk, explain and question as the lesson advances also have the children question you. Knowing what is then expected of them, pupils will have no time for their minds to wander off to what we term \"Day Dreaming.\"\n\nCleanliness\u2014The absolute necessity of the school-room. Insist that the boys and girls are particular about their personal appearance. Every teacher, sir, I am sure, extremely thankful for the establishment of Domestic Science, in our Indian schools, due to the untiring efforts of our Reverend Inspector. You will all agree that this branch of our work is\ntheir original ideas in dealing with classroom difficulties. These I know would be of benefit to all of us.\n\nEileen Delaney.\nThe Best Methods in Guiding Indian Children\n\nThe greatest privilege an Indian child can receive is a sound education. We may define education as the training of an individual to enable him to succeed in whatever he undertakes during the future course of his life. Education includes the training of the mind, the body, and the moral faculties in order to reach the desired goal.\n\nIn our schools the mental training takes up most of our time. The results obtained from a lesson correspond with the methods employed by the teacher. To be effective a lesson must first of all be interesting. Many things may render a lesson attractive and interesting. The most important of these are concrete objects such as pictures, specimens, drawings on the blackboard, and samples. At a very early stage it is necessary to make the lesson especially attractive by using bright-colored pictures, letters, and figures, action pictures, and motion songs. At this early stage it is not possible to do away with concrete objects when teaching arithmetic; let the child see, feel, and hear the lesson that is taught. The senses of feeling, hearing, and seeing working in harmony should produce better results than one by itself. This rule is followed when the teacher explains the lesson, provides concrete objects, and lets the child handle them.\n\nTeaching must be as natural as possible, that is, the work in the schoolroom must be linked up with the outside world.\nworld and should spring out of the element of life. Experiences provide natural means of teaching and are splendid for the teaching of nature study and geography.\n\nIn order to stimulate the memory of the child, examinations and reviews should never be omitted. The introduction of recitations and plays also serve the memory. Mechanical teaching cannot be done away with, but it must never take the place of teaching through ideas when possible. For example, spellings, addition and multiplication tables must be studied mechanically but if a pupil was asked to study and remember all his lessons in a mechanical way without reasoning he could never remember them. The classification of a child deserves notice for if he is classified too far ahead for his ability he cannot progress; on the other hand if he is classified below his ability he will lose interest. A careful preparation of the daily lessons by both the teacher and the pupils is necessary.\n\nThe seatwork like the classwork should be made interesting and it is the teacher's duty to see that it is always done in a correct and neat way.\n\nThe physical training is as important as the mental training for if a child is not physically fit, he is likely to be mentally defective. A class will be more alert if comfort is provided and it should be seen that pupils have proper light, material, desks and a properly heated\nand ventilated room. A five minutes period of physical drill during each school session not only promotes correct habits in standing and walking but furnishes a variety of work after which the child feels and works better. These exercises are of much more benefit if taken in the open air. If physical drill is given at ten and two o'clock and recesses at eleven and three, all the pupils are prevented from helping to their seats longer than an hour and in this way their health is safeguarded.\n\nThe necessity of cleanliness should be impressed upon the mind of the child by insisting upon his keeping of himself and his school property clean and neat. The class is to regard the school as their own to beautify and care for.\n\nA course in domestic science not only helps the child by furnishing him with clothing but provides him a training that he will need in after life. While the girls are busy at sewing, the boys may knit, unmake old clothes, mend slates, books, maps and other things. This course is an incentive in itself.\n\nThe religious training that the child obtains at school and elsewhere is of utmost importance for his behavior in later life depends upon it. Nothing can inspire more to religious ideas than the opening of the school day with religious exercises. These should be repeated before closing.\nSchool. Holy pictures and stories seem to impress the Indian child.\n\nIf a teacher really wishes to aid his Indian pupils he must use every means in his power to overcome the difficulties that cross his pathway. He must ever be gay and encouraging and never falter so the children will follow his example.\n\nAlice Tremblay\nPractical Education for Indian Children.\n\nThis Convention of the teachers of the Indian schools of New Brunswick is the first gathering of its kind ever held in our province. And it might be fitting to remark, that the pretty town of Woodstock so beautifully situated in the heart of what was once the pride of Indian territory, is one of the most suitable locations that could have been chosen for this meeting.\n\nI assure you, Rev. Father, that I consider it no small honor, to be selected one of the speakers at this Convention, but I feel that my qualifications for performing such an important duty are so limited, that I fear I shall not be able to say anything which would add much to the deliberations of this Convention.\n\nHowever, I assure you, that I appreciate the confidence which you have placed in me, and have attempted in my humble way to prepare a paper on the subject on which you asked me to speak, namely, \"Practical Education for Indian children, both as to school work and in Domestic Science.\"\n\nEducation consists of training, discipline, development and instruction. The proper meaning of \"Education\" is not only a drawing out, but also a training up, as a vine is trained to lay hold of and rise by means of what is\nstronger than itself. In true education man's whole being, that is his physical, intellectual, and religious nature is developed. The object of education is to form habits of right thinking and doing. The aim of Practical Education is to enable the individual to co-operate with his physical, social and religious environments; to form good and wise men and women. The material with which the teacher works, is furnished by the home, the state and the church, and unless the school works in harmony with these three great forces, little is accomplished. The pupils of many Indian schools, when they return to their tribe, quickly lose what they have gained, because they are thrown into an environment which annuls the ideals that prevailed in the school. The controlling aim of the teacher should be, therefore, to bring her teaching into harmony with what is best in the life of the child. The teacher's attitude must be that of sympathy with her pupil.\n\nThe subjects which should be included in the Course of Instruction for Indian schools are, reading and spelling, elementary arithmetic, Canadian history, with special emphasis on the history of New Brunswick, geography of New Brunswick, and the general geography of the world,\nEnglish composition, physical drill, drawing,\ndomestic science, music and religious\ninstruction.\n\nAll children before leaving school,\nshould know how to read fluently\nand with expression, and should know\nhow to spell all the ordinary words\nfound in their school books and words\nof common use. In arithmetic, they\nshould know the fundamental operation\nof addition, subtraction, multiplication,\nand division, and should be able to\napply these to whole numbers, fractions,\nmixed numbers and decimals, and\nshould be able to work easy problems.\nMental arithmetic should be practiced\ndaily in class. In composition, they\nshould be able to write simple\nnarratives and to know how to\nproperly write a letter both of business\nand friendly types. They should know\nhow to use capitals and the principal\npunctuation marks. Domestic science,\nshould include sewing, mending and\nknitting for the girls. I might say,\nsome of the older girls of my school,\nbecame quite expert at knitting. They\nare now able to make sweaters for\nthemselves of the latest styles and\npatterns. While the girls are working\nat their domestic science, the boys\nare occupied at drawing.\n\nThe chief concern of the teacher is\nto develop faculty, to form character,\nto point out the means whereby knowledge may be acquired and if need be communicated. Her aim is not to make learning easy, but to accustom the pupil to labor, since nothing but one's own industry can develop faculties or give them grasp of mind. In our elementary schools, pupils are trained mainly to habits of work; in the higher schools, they are educated to self-activity, made capable of helping themselves, and of fulfilling any duty that may be assigned to them. Schools must be places of order, punctuality, obedience and honesty, where attention and industry are kept constantly awake. In such places work grows to be a habit, and delight in work is the result.\n\nThe teacher's resolve then, is to aim at making, first of all, men and women, whose hearts are pure and sympathetic, whose minds are open and enlightened, whose motives are benevolent and generous, and whose purposes are high and religious.\n\nMary T. Hughes.\nThe First Day in a New School.\n\nReverend Father Inspector, Reverend Father, Reverend Sisters and Fellow Teachers,\n\nHow often have we heard and how often have we used the expression, \"Vacation is over, we go back to school today.\" But how many realize the importance of the first day.\n\nWhat depends on the first day in a new school\u2014The success of the whole school year and every one should be prepared for a successful beginning.\n\nTo insure success a well-planned programme should be prepared and carried out systematically and carefully thus securing the confidence of the pupils.\n\nNot later than 8:30 on the morning of opening the teacher should be at the school and the school must be ready for the reception of the pupils at least fifteen minutes before opening.\n\nAs each pupil enters the room he should be kindly greeted by the teacher and if time permits engaged in a brief conversation. It is of great importance that the children receive a good impression of the teacher; it will make his own work in the school-room easy and will secure at once the\ngoodwill and favor of the pupils thus providing the conditions under which success may be expected.\n\nWhen the bell rings it is wise to let the pupil take any seat he may have in mind if necessary a change may be made later.\n\nThe Opening Exercises should be followed by a talk with the pupils. The object of this talk is to gain the confidence of the pupils not to impress rules and regulations on them, or in other words to give the pupil the impression that he understands his work and is quite confident that it will be a success.\n\nThe next step is to assign work to each class. The programme which has been prepared should be put into effect. This should be done promptly in order to avoid any confusion.\n\nA class of new beginners are usually lazy and backward, and so special attention should be given them. They are not accustomed to classes so the first lesson may be taught to any class other than the primary. Pictures and books if supplied them will keep their attention for a few hours until they become\naccustomed to their new surroundings.\n\nSmall classes on the first day the lesson should not be too long as the pupil will find it difficult to start the new routine of study. After the holiday,\n\nDuring the day Physical Training and Social should not be neglected.\n\nDuring recess on the first day of the teacher will go out on the play ground the pupils will feel that he is interested in their games and this will also help to gain the confidence of the pupils.\n\nThe teacher should make a point of doing some effective teaching in the various subjects so that when the hour of dismissal comes the children will feel that the first day at school has been both profitable and pleasurable. To have this impression carried into the various homes of the community is to commence work under the most favorable conditions.\n\nThoughtfulness is always an excellent characteristic in any teacher but is especially noticeable in the experience of his first day in a new school. Kind and considerate treatment is due every child. The teacher should not parade his authority.\nnor exhibit any desire to repress the pupils' indulgence whatever is to be extended but all should be treated with dignity fairness and sympathy.\n\nThe teacher should be perfectly natural in his attitude towards his pupils as an assumed manner is readily detected.\n\nThe teacher should not assume the whole responsibility for the day's work as it deprives the children of one of their most important rights that of learning to do things for themselves and others.\n\nThe teacher must also be optimistic. He must expect success and work hard to attain it. At all times during the first day and every day the teacher should concentrate his attention upon the duty in hand and at no time should he worry over the mistakes of the past or be too solicitous about the future. Many emergencies will arise during the day and some surprises may await him; but the teacher who exhibits a genuine interest in his school and conducts the work in a thoughtful and optimistic manner is on the road to success.\n\nEstelle O'Brien.\nPhysical Drill and Ventilation.\n\nReverend Dr. Inspector Reverend Bailey,\nReverend Sister and Bishop Brother.\n\nPhysical Culture is one of the several terms that have come to be applied to the development of the physical organism. The person who undertakes to apply its principles must know the value of exercise, pure air, ventilation, and proper breathing. Certain forms of gymnastics will build up and organs, or muscles, while another kind of exercise will affect an entirely different set of muscles. Club swinging, for example, develops the muscles of the arm, wrist, back and shoulder. The diving exercises develop the waist, hips, and abdominal muscles, giving flexibility and grace to movement; running not only strengthens the leg muscles, but by forcing deep breathing brings about better chest expansion and lung development. It is this feature of adaptability to individual needs that makes gymnastics so helpful, for by carefully following the course of exercise prescribed one can correct almost any defect in his physical organism.\nwhich all physical training should aim.\n\nIt is a matter of note that educators are giving more and more attention to bodily development as an essential part of education, and are obtaining good results in the course through physical exercise.\n\nThe ventilating problem is a two-fold one, involving the exclusion of impure air and the admittance of fresh air. Unless there is a constant circulation of air in a room, such a room speedily becomes unhealthy and unsuited to be inhabited. It is not enough in providing for the ventilation of a room to open the windows from the bottom. Fresh air cannot enter unless the warm impure air is allowed to escape. This may be provided by opening the sash from the top. It is one of the most important duties to see that bedrooms are ventilated so as to provide proper room.\n\nVentilation should aid thought and work; improve health and comfort, and decrease fatigue and errors. The most important help is an ordinary reliably thermostatically placed in the room four feet from the floor on an inside\nAn important thing in all gymnastic work is to know where to stop. It is dangerous to carry an exercise so far that any part of the body is developed at the expense of the rest. All-time strain should be avoided. Moderate exercise leading toward good all-round development of the body is the ideal for brain training, rather than abnormal development in any one direction.\n\nA large part of the benefit from gymnastics aside from the muscular development comes from the fact that the exercise makes it necessary to breathe harder and more deeply. For this reason the room in which the exercises are performed should invariably have its windows open to admit plenty of fresh air. Still better of course it is to do the work out-of-doors. The exercise keeps forcing more air into the lungs than would ordinarily be inhaled. This gives pure, vitalized blood to the heart and sends a healthy glow through the body. The action of the stomach and other organs is stimulated, the appetite increased, and the digestion improved. These all make good health, and good health is the goal at\nwall, not too near a door window radiator, stove or other influence. The temperature should be read every half hour by the person responsible for the temperature and change of air. It should never be warmer than 68\u00b0, and if people are working or creating heat by their own effort, the temperature of 60\u00b0 or lower is more pleasant. Dried cool air should come in through the open window. If it is zero outside and 65 inside, a very small opening will allow a large amount of fresh air to enter.\n\nBasically it must be emphasized in closing the discussion that the problem of overheating is the primary essential in all systems of ventilation. Air change, direction of flow and all other facts are secondary, but should be well in mind that however simple or however complex an apparatus may be installed for air conditioning, a constant and intelligent vigilance in regard to operating and maintaining is the price of health and comfort.\n\nFrancis Sheppard.\nThe subject which I have been asked to discuss here today reads: \"A General View of what is required for the progress of our Indian children at School. What we are to consider, to discuss, to suggest, to oppose etc... is therefore very clear and in order to render this discussion more real and more practical, let me for a few moments repair to our own individual classrooms.\n\nWhen have we met them last Thursday, September the first? All met no other but the Indian child. And vice versa, whom and what has the Indian child met there on his or her first schoolday? He met a language and an education alien to his own. Thirdly, whom will both the Teacher and the Indian child meet there twice in the year? What is the purpose of this most welcomed Visitor? To ascertain, on the part of the Province of New Brunswick and the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa the progress of the Indian child at school.\n\nBut how is this progress, exacted of the teacher, to be realized and what is required to realize it? Such is the purpose of this meeting.\nUnfortunately I am the first called upon to give my views on the subject and I hope that after listening patiently to what my limited experience will allow me to say on the matter, I shall be gratified with other and more experienced views than my own.\n\nOn a Reservation the teacher meets no other but the Indian child. A close insight into the nature of that child is to me a first requisite, and the main characteristic discovered in his suspicious nature. The child consequently has the same attitude toward all classroom activities, and like the stoic of old will not betray one expression, one ray of enlightenment, not even a satisfactory response.\n\nOn the other hand he looks forward to some word of approbation from his teacher; he therefore secretly wishes to please those to whom he is entrusted, and if always disapproved of will easily get discouraged. If the Indian child is therefore informed of our ideal of a bright, smart, clever child he will secretly strive to attain this ideal, and a firm hand but compassionate heart will cause the child to move in this direction with the result that the child will readily\nrespond to the classroom teaching. His suspicious nature will gradually give way in the presence of an upright, frank, and open living example.\n\nWhen once aroused the child has quick perception but his mind is not retentive, and he cannot concentrate for any length of time. The subject matter to be taught must therefore be presented in a striking way and briefly. He is also fond of stories, so that all subjects which lend themselves to story form can be made use of and arranged in such a way as to arouse his curiosity.\n\nThe Indian child is also very obstinate his home motto being - do not contradict me - and the child is thus fostered to even feign anger in order to attain his end - to do as he pleases. The Indian child is not therefore an obedient child but he easily submits in the presence of unrelenting firmness.\n\nI have, as you see, based the first requisite for progress on the education of the Indian child, and instruction will, to my opinion, be successful inasmuch as the child is led away from the three above mentioned defects of his nature - suspicion.\nLethargy, stubbornness\u2014not forgetting his counterbalancing qualities: desire to please, quick perception, fondness for stories. Tribes possibly differ one from the other, and I should be thankful to know if you found the same natural characteristic.\n\nOn the other hand the Indian child, on his first school day, meets with a language and an education alien to his own\u2014the former being naturally the greater drawback to the child. The latter has just been discussed. What we require for the successful teaching of English to the Indian child is the next item to consider.\n\nThe first requisite here is plenty of blackboard space for every lesson taught in terms with difficulties of all kinds, and unless the child be given a chance to visualize these difficulties he or she will never be enabled to master them and the teacher's efforts and the teacher's time is spent uselessly for repeated drill is required for both spelling and proper enunciation.\n\nEasy and well-illustrated supplementary reading in literature, history, geography and nature study and covering the work contained in the school course.\nwould also help immensely for the reading of the text books is rather trying for the child and must necessarily be and in rather brief and therefore of little interest to him. The teaching likewise has to be brief. Difficult words would thereby lose some of their monotony and from mere words would become real existing persons or objects and consequently something worth while learning about.\n\nMy third requisite in the teaching of English to the Indian children is some means of creating competition among them. They are susceptible to this training and I know through actual experience for we dissuaded an Indian mother from taking her child from school on the ground that he was first in his class. A monthly report of some kind, and suited to meet the purpose for which it is intended, would serve both as a stimulant and as a test of the child's mastery of the subject by requiring a written test from the older pupils, and an oral one from the younger, or both, to award class standing, and a reward of some kind to be given to the successful ones. This would mean a little more work to the teacher and a little expense to\nthe government but I think that the re-\nsults would prove worth while attempt-\ning. It is possible that this system is\nalready introduced in the schools.\n\nThe Indian child also meets\nwith new surroundings and these must\ncontrast with his home surroundings\nin cleanliness, tidiness, order and arrange-\nment or disposition. The reason for this\nis quite obvious.\n\nBefore passing on to my last\nword I should like to stress particu-\nlarly the need in our schools of plenty\nof material for illustration work, and\nwhenever possible, the object itself.\n\nBoth the Teacher and the Indian\nChild meet twice in the year our kind\nInspector whom we all know and\nwhose visit we all enjoy. He is the\nconnecting link, if I may so express\nmyself, between the Educational Depart-\nment and the School. I shall not com-\nment on this subject very lengthily, but\nshall summarize all by recalling that\nhe is the organizer of this Convention,\nand shall therefore be but too pleased to\nfavor us with advice for the time being,\nand both advice and material mentioned\nfor the future, as he has done in the past,\nin order to forward education in our\nschools. I should therefore be thankful\nto hear some of you complete the numer-\nous missions on this so important\nsubject to the Teachers of: \"What is required\nfor the progress of our Indian children at\nschool,\" and to discuss these requirements\nin the presence of Representatives who can\nbe and hope will be of immense help\nto us in the pursuit of so sacred duties\nas we are called upon to perform on\nthe Reservation confided to our care, and\nto foster in the hearts of these Indian\nchildren the true sense of duty to their\nGod, to their fellow creatures, and to\nthemselves.\n\nI thank you.\nThe Best Method to adopt in teaching Economy to Indians.\n\nBefore adopting a method of teaching economy to Indians, let us briefly consider their mode of living.\n\nDo our Indians, and here I refer to the majority, dress according to their condition in life? Do they distinguish between working clothes, Sunday clothes, and clothing for other circumstances? Do our Indians buy for the wear they get out of the articles bought? And these articles when once procured do they care for them as they should? Do they buy useless articles when financially unable to afford them? These questions I leave to you to answer. The only two articles which I noticed they seldom get is an umbrella, to protect them from the rain, and rubbers for their patent-leather shoes. Do you consider this economy? All other articles they find means to obtain. To repair, to clean, to press etc., are little known to them, they would rather entrust these to their kind protector the St. John. Shoes found along the lanes show that their only harm is a worn out sole. At very little cost\nthese could have been repaired for weeks.\n\nSo much for raiment. Let us now turn to their food articles. Do our Indians try to raise all the vegetables they can in order to store them for the winter? Some raise a little, others nothing. They have land for this purpose but claim they have no cellars. They either have to walk or pay their fare to some centre where these articles may be procured, and here again taste often prevails over substantiality, even at the risk of buying their food the next day. A few manage to put a little money in the bank, but these are the exceptions.\n\nIt is true that their homes present to them very little comfort, but they easily put up with this state of things by remaining in them as little as they can, and make up for this want of comfort by amusements. The neighboring cinemas find in their audience a good number of our Indians.\n\nOutside labor is their only means of subsistence. Do all take advantage of it? Many are good workers but how many are constant workers? Still many manage to pull through but the majority are thriftless. What they lack therefore is want of economy. But how are we\nto teach economy to them?\n\nWe could talk to them days at a time on this same subject but to no effect. We could strive to give them the most practical personal example but with no better result. The only way that I see open to attain this end is a practical follow-up system. To introduce the system and then carry it out successfully would require a little time for the confidence of these people would first have to be won. Through repeated meetings and agreeable conversations with them the subject could be easily approached and timely suggestions and common good sense lead the way.\n\nThe teachers have the Domestic Science Class to come to our help, and on the Observations where all the ladies are supposed to attend, a move has been made in that direction, but two hours work per week would prove insufficient for all that is to be done, and more time can hardly be devoted to this branch since the women can attend at no other time but class hours.\n\nFurthermore, the Indians readily accept all that is given to them gratis, but would they consent to buy the material to be cut and sewed at the Domestic Science Class? They would\nrather buy ready-made clothing so as to follow the style, and spare themselves the trouble of making it. The teacher would have to shoulder both duties of teacher and dressmaker, and be quite skilled in the art of cutting in order to attract or win over the women to make their own clothing. Cooking and manual work form part of the Domestic Science Course, but Household economy is not the only form of economy to be taught. Who is to teach the other forms of economy? It seems that a home industry of some kind employing the men and women of the Reserve would keep them at home and in this way favor labor and greatly reduce expenses.\n\nA number of poor families call at the Dispensary for clothing etc., these calls could serve the intended purpose of suggesting economy means to them. Account books could be suggested for the homes and there occasionally verified at the Domestic Science Class. But here again I fear that much would be left out of these account books, both in way of revenue and expenses. Still there is a beginning to everything, and with time deceit would give way to sincerity.\nA yearly exhibition of vegetables raised might prove a great incentive for home gardening.\n\nThese suggested means would serve the purpose of indirect follow-up work in economy teaching thus giving time for more direct means to take root and develop.\n\nI have suggested a method of teaching economy to Indians\u2014the practical follow-up system\u2014and mentioned the Domestic Science Class as the chief agent in the teaching of Household economy as well as hinted means of indirect follow-up work. As to the best method to adopt in teaching economy to Indians I leave to this Convention to pick out.\n\nI thank you.\nDomestic Science.\n\nThe Domestic Science classes which our Reverend Inspector has established in the Indian schools are a source of great benefit to the Indian people. For in our classes we instruct not only the school children but also the Indian women in the art of sewing and cooking. It is necessary to give frequent lectures to the women on economy, so that the Indian people are familiarized with the use of material which could be put to good use.\n\nWe believe at times from the Indian agent's store of old clothes, these ladies repair, mend, and make into garments for the boys many of whom cannot afford to attend school through lack of clothing if they had been sewing classes.\n\nThe girls and women are delighted to make articles of clothing, also to knit stockings, sweaters, caps, and mittens.\n\nAll Small Pieces &\nof material are used in making quilts these attract the Indian women, as quilts are rare, and when they see the small pieces which they have always discarded put into such good use they are pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe cooking classes are more attractive to the Indian women and children than the sewing.\n\nThe first thing they're taught is to have a stove in their kitchen and keep it in good order.\n\nWe watch our classes closely to see that the dishes and pans etc., used are washed clean.\n\nMany arrangements can be made in the division of the cooking classes permitting me to draft my plan.\n\nEach class five girls were chosen to do the cooking while the remainder of the classes sewed or knit. One of these girls is chosen as housewife while the remaining four are subject to her authority, supervised by the tea chef.\nThe housewife sees that her cooks copy the recipes and that their dishes are washed, and the hand towels are hanging in their proper places. This gives the pupils a sense of responsibility.\n\nThe homes of the schoolteacher also aided the Indian people by her special work. The First Communion class and their pupils at the Board School were dressed entirely with clothes made in the Domestic Science classes. The boys' white blouses and caps were made by the mothers, also the girls' underwear and dresses.\n\nIn the feeding classes many of the little children who were at times without food in their respective homes were given pancakes, porridge, fish cutlets, etc.; these classes were not established in the schools many of the children wanted more than without food at school.\nDuring the school year especially during the winter months many of the people and the children were ill. The Domestic Service teacher accompanied the doctor to the different places and aided him in tending the sick, acting on the physician's advice and instructions. Poultries were applied and medicine given at the stated time. The Indian people are grateful for these acts of kindness and prayers often attened the Domestic Service classes because they wish to please the teachers who aided them in their illness.\n\nThank you,\n\nEvelyn L. Brown,\nAgent Church,\nIndian Service.\nThe best method to maintain order and attention of the Indians' children in the class room.\n\nEssential to good beginning is the first day of the term. By phrasing manners and first day of the term the respect and confidence of your pupils will grow from the hearts of the children; your influence without limit.\n\nEvery teacher ought to know something of the family life, habits, and the history of the parents of the Indians' pupils. It is an advantage to become personally acquainted with the parents.\n\nMy hopes deals with the best methods to maintain order and the attention of the Indians' children in the class-room. First let us consider order in the class-room. The pupils should be trained to perform\nthe necessary movements as methodically and as quickly as possible; so that they may be given every morning for the first two or three hours throughout the day. During these hours the teacher will explain to her pupils what she expects them to do, the mistakes she has noticed and at times a few words of praise. The pupils have done fairly well in the past, and have been taught by the teacher herself. They will enter the class in an orderly fashion. They same order should be used in dismissing the classes. Certain signals should be observed when calling classes from their seats. For example, the pupil will not squat himself until the teacher gives the command. All the pupils must stand while answering questions, and the answer...\ndelivered in a tone loud enough to be heard by all in the class.\n\nSpecial privileges such as raising the hand getting a drink etc. It is well to arrange for quiet signal code, such as raising two fingers between the pupils and yourself by which the request or granting of any privilege or interruption caused by spoken words.\n\nMuch of the routine work of the school ought as collecting and distributing books, anything serving etc., should be done by certain pupils appointed after a definite period. This work by the pupil as a privilege, hang up cases for misconduct these privileges may be withdrawn.\n\nIt is important that pupils do their work promptly, and keep their school supplies arranged in their desks. Each pupil should\nbe held responsible for the\nfloor in the neighborhood of\nthis great. Brooming of the\nfloor should not be\nforbidden. No rough or\nboisterous conduct should\nbe permitted in the class-\nroom either before opening\nor at recess. Corporal punishment\nshould not be used\nexcept in rare cases, or\nfail. The following is an\nexample of a fine for\nbreaking the rules. One little\ngirl in the primary class\nbrought gum to school\nand chewed it during\nschool hours. For punishment\nshe was made to stand on\nthe floor with the gum\nin her thumb, this proved\nto be a most effective\npunishment.\n\nTo maintain the\nattention of the children,\nthe teacher has\nreport of many original\nideas. Prizes, gold stars\nand such rewards prove\nas an excellent stimulant\namong Indians. Children\nmust be firm\nquiet kind to her little hand. When the teacher has the pupils under control she says words proper and short and all that is necessary. The teacher speaks in a quiet yet decisive manner and if she fails to suppress any tendency to disorder merely by changing the tone of voice, could talk for an hour.\n\nMarion Mahoon.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nRoll of Teachers\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      |         |        |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nF.

F. C. RYAN, Inspector & Supt. of Ind. schools for N.B.\n\nTo the Dept. of Ind. Affairs\nOttawa,\n\nIt gives me much pleasure to report on this our first Convention\nof teachers for our Indian Schools, in N.B. -\nAll teachers were present and read their very interesting papers\nthat I had assigned them.\nI opened the Convention by laying before teachers the work to be\nfollowed during these days of session, -a synopsis of which\nyou will find inclosed. -however, many other important matters,\nnot included in the said paper, were brought before this Convention,\nand fully debated on.\n\nOur first PAPER -by Mrs. Stella Kehoe, -entitled \"TEX-BOOKS\"\nwas carefully read and then thoroughly debated on. -The\nConvention unanimously adopting the following:\n\n(1) That the Progressive Series in ARITHMETIC by KENNEDY &\nO'NEILL be used in conjunction with the present N.B.\nArithmetic (CAGED), as found in the N.B. white schools;\n(2) That for beginners, ONE NUMBER a day is all that can\nbe well mastered by the PUPIL;\n(3) That each method should be clearly taught, and thoroughly\nunderstood by the pupil, before taking up another.\nexample, Multiplication, well known before DIVISION is\ntaught, &c., &c., &c. Never mixing the two together, until\nboth were well known by pupil.\n(4) That before taking up the different parts in the Arithmetic,\na good plain instruction be placed before the Pupil, showing\nthe need of, and how useful, & necessary that part of Arithm.\nwill be to him in life &c., &c., this will give him a great\ninterest in same and he will naturally work harder to accom-\nplish same.\n(5) That Games & be used on \"BLACK-BOARD\" to interest all pupils\nin all their work, as far as possible.\nExample for Arithmetic, -Rev. Sister Eleanor of the\nWoodstock White school, gave a wonderful demonstration\nto all our teachers in this method.\n\nAs the Month of Sept. is always known as the month for\nthe EXHIBITION at Woodstock, and for all of N.B., -She\ndrew on the \"BOARD\" with different colored chalk, \"TROTTERS\"\n& tracks, each horse corresponded in COLOR to each track,\nnumbers of the multiplication tables that were then known\nto the pupil were placed along this TRACK. Now, each child\nchooses its TROTTER & track, its name is the name of the\nPUPIL, -off each child starts with the numbers, all other\npupils watching, --The child going the fastest and with\nthe least mistakes wins the RACE, -\nduring the Month of October, -An apple tree is drawn on\n\"Board\" shown apples on tree & on ground, the Multipli-\ncation tables in the numbers known to child are placed\non the APPLES on ground or tree, -the one who goes the\nbest over these numbers gets the most apples &c., &\nThe Month of Nov, a forest is drawn on BOARD with deer\n& moose &c., heads, reflecting faintly from trees, on\nthe ground are many bullets and on the bullets are the\nmultiplication tables, -the pupil that does the best is\nthe most successful hunter, &c., &\nThe Month of Dec, is Christmas, -forts & snow balls are\nused. The snow balls have the Muli; tables on same, the\nbest pupil takes the fort, -On-in all these games, -\ntwo teams can be chosen with \"teams\", -the side doing\nthe best work wins, In this case, the leader of the team\nis often seen at RECESS & noon hour instructing the dull\nmembers of his team so he will come out first.\nFor the Month of March, floating ice cakes are taken, -\nApril, Easter eggs are used,\nMay, the May poll is used with the num-\nbers on the stringers hanging from the POLE.\nThus throughout all the Months are the different things chosen to interest the pupils.\n\n(6) Sounds, ----\n\nRev. Sister Mercia of the Woodstock Ind. school simply held our teachers' attention during one of the most interesting instructions given at this convention, and that on a subject that forms the most trying work for the teacher.\n\nShe took up the sounds of all the letters\u2014then the many sounds that apply to the same letter, or a combination of one or two letters.\n\nExamples:\n\nFor the short (A), she drew on the BOARD, a LAMB bleating.\n\nFor (B), two DOVES making their accustomed guttural sounds, &c., &c.\n\n(F) a cross cat snarling &c., &c.\n\n(J) a JUG\n\n(G) a bottle lying down with water gurgling from it.\n\n(P) a steamboat puffing along, with a heavy load.\n\n(L) a very tired boy showing how he was puffing going up hill &c., &c.\n\n(M) A cow mewing, &c., &c.\n\n(V) a fly buzzing, &c., &c.\n\n(W) a tree showing the sound of wind going through its branches, &c., &c.\n\nand thus she continued with all the LETTERS.\n\nTo facilitate this method of teaching, she used games, such as\u2014\n\n\"The post office game.\"\n\nThis represents a mail box in a post office, so the pupil that will get the most sounds correctly, will get the most letters, &c., &c.\n\nShe used what she termed the \"GUESS GAME.\"\n\nThe teacher thus simply asks the pupil this question:\n\nWho can tell me the word that I am thinking about, that will rhyme with\u2014\"HAT\"? The pupil guesses \"RAT,\"\u2014the teacher says no,\u2014at the same time print this word RAT on board, and thus continue through the whole class, giving each child one or more chances, but writing down all words guessed, then the teacher places the proper word on BOARD at the end of all the guessed words. This retains the attention of all pupils.\n\nAnother method is adopted in the building up of words. A house is drawn on BOARD, \u2014say called the \"AN\" house. The pupil is required to place in this DRAWING only such words as belong to the \"AN\" family, as\u2014can, man, fan, ran, &c., &c., the one getting the most words wins the game.\n\nPractical methods were adopted for the study of Geography, requiring the pupils to go to the shore and with a shovel make a LAKE, BAY, ISLAND, CAFE, &c., &c., &c. The full class watching for mistakes, &c., &c. Currents, tides, &c., &c., could also be thus taught.\n\nIn the same way GRAMMAR could be taught, as the thing made called a noun, the making of same, the verb &c., the size, the adjective, the speed in making, the adverb, &c., &c.\n\nThus along these lines, the Convention found wonderful methods that will make their schools both interesting and progressive.\n\nMiss Cahoon's paper on \"The best method to retain order in the school room,\" attendance at school, was listened to with deep interest.\n\nThe convention adopted the following:\n\n(1) As all Ind. children have a deep RELIGIOUS disposition, and do reverence holy objects, All teachers agree that, if a small table (like a table like an ALTAR, with a statue on same & light burning,) the school would so resemble a church, that they would respect same, this I have tried out with perfect results.\nHow to keep order in school continued -------\n\nSIGNS to be used in school -&-:\n\nONE FINGER RAISED, must go out,\nTwo \"s\" \"s\" \"s\", get a drink,\nThree \"s\" \"s\" \"s\", permission to ask a question,\n&c.\n\nAll school material not required for present work going on in school, but later required, is to be kept on teacher's desk, and distributed by the most worthy pupils at RECESS, or such time that will not disturb the silence of school room, &c. Each Ind. child considers it a mark of honor to give out books during this period, and do try hard to attend school, and give good attention &c., &c., &c., in order to do this work, &c.\n\nAll teachers claimed for Attendance, --the best and only method lay in the channel of LOVE, affection, and in making SCHOOL LIFE more attractive than their home.\n\nRev. sister Mary of Victory read a beautiful paper on what is required for the progress of the Ind. child.\n\nAll teachers agreed to use the BLACKBOARD system more, also the reading of short stories that will leave a moral effect on the pupil, and aid him in his school work, &c.\n\nAlso to use the system of EMULATION, &c.\n\nBeing brief in explanations, yet simple, & clear,\n\nMiss Delaney read a paper on the difficulties in the classroom.\n\nAll practical suggestions, in said paper, were adopted, as religious pictures, for emulation purposes, The making of school room attractive.\n\nGood ventilation, Pleasant surroundings, A variety in work, &c.\n\nAfter difficult work, change to that work that would be pleasing to pupil &c. Keep INTEREST ever living in the school-room.\n\nMiss O' Brine's paper on physical drill & ventilation &c., gave teachers an added interest in this.\n\nA series of exercises will be adopted for all schools.\n\nAt recess, games will be encouraged by the teachers being present and even taking part in them, &c.\n\nGood ventilation, &c., Warmth in school rooms will be avoided.\n\nLectures, (one per week) will be given, on different subjects pertaining to Health, Temperance, thrift, Habits, The necessity of work to keep the body healthy and strong, and all other useful subjects that will uplift the Ind. child.\n\nMiss Alice Tremble read paper, entitled --Aiding Ind. children.\n\nWe adopted the need of opening and closing all our schools with prayer, &c., and keeping schools clean & attractive & well ventilated, &c., as adopted from other papers, &c., &c.\n\nMiss Mary Hughes read paper, entitled best methods in aiding Ind. CHILDREN, in general.\n\nWe adopted the following,\n\n(1) The use of mental arithmetic,\n(2) Simple composition\n(3) Any and all legitimate methods that would encourage the Ind. child to work and love work &c., how work soon grew to habit, which meant bright and happy children, &c., men & women, bringing prosperity, riches with economy & long lives & health.\n\n(4) Teachers to have great affection & kindness for the Ind. child learning a new language, and often coming to school with but little to eat, or wear.\n\n\"DOMESTIC SCIENCE.\"\n\nMiss E. Cahoon read a paper on this branch of our work.\n\nThe following methods were adopted -------\n\n(1) To induce all Indian women to interest themselves in this branch of work\n\n(2) Lectures on various subjects pertaining to the importance of this branch of science\n\n(3) Divide RESERVES into five sections, thus, each section would represent, with other lines, a day's work, in this way each Ind. house would be visited weekly. Then some day taken, every two or three weeks, not known to the Ind. women, a general visit of all houses to see if instructions given were being followed out, &c., &c., Where it is found that Indians will not try to follow out instructions on HEALTH.\nHEALTH &c., then, if such families are receiving poor aid, means should be adopted to stop same until this family attends to the fulfillment of all instructions, &c.\n\nTo successfully interest the Indian woman in this important work, great care & precaution must certainly be taken in the first visits to their homes.\n\nThe first, even second or third visit may seemingly meet with little recognition, yet if the Domestic TEACHER would on these first visits reach the mother's heart through her little children, which certainly is the true road\u2014what confidence would soon be placed in this teacher. Always delight on the good looks of the little child, its growth, its nice eyes, & all its good qualities, & all the little ones about the house &c., showing always a great interest and love for them, &c.\n\nThat the Field Matron should teach all rules governing health, &c., and spread about the Ind. homes LITERATURE, pictures showing the different stages of disease, &c.\u2014cards in the form of large signs containing health rules & regulations, &c., that might at all times educate & interest the Indian home. Thus they would not avoid vaccination, and would at the same time keep their homes clean, &c.\n\nTEACHERS PRESENT VOTED to petition the Dept. of Ind. Affairs to provide \"foot-wares\" for all Ind. children of school age. It was claimed that the little children suffered greatly from the want of shoes & many were sick from heavy colds, &c., largely due to the want of covering for their feet. Many cases were most pitiful and INHUMAN.\n\nALL SUGGESTED that the Dept. buy a set of GUM-RUBBERS, say about 150 for Oct., &c., about 250 for Dec., have the Ind. AGENT buy a few cow-hides, have same well tanned and cut into different sizes and sewed and be given to the children for Winter, this would be a cheaper way than about 40 March supply them with another pair of GUM-RUBBERS\u2014thus all school children could be cheaply provided with footwear. Parents could buy, if able, shoes for SUNDAY for their children. Thus children could attend school, and much sickness & deaths prevented among them.\n\nNote: We PETITION the Catholic Women's League of N.B., for all the old clothes available, to be sent to different centers to be made over for our Ind. children; at the same time we expect the Dept. to furnish yarn, &c., anything, from time to time that will aid us in our work. The Indians, &c., today, are face to face with grave difficulties. They can get but little employment, very little demand for their wares, with no profits from HUNTING, less from fishing, little or no fish, or material to work with, or at such long distances from their Reserves, that it is almost impossible for them to get same. From the above, the Dept. can readily see that it is faced with the problem of providing foodwear & much clothing to all our Ind. children.\n\nRev. SISTER Mary of Victory, &c., a parmer\u2014\"The best method to adopt in teaching ECONOMY to INDIANS.\"\n\nWe adopted\n\n(1) Lectures to be given daily, if possible, or, as often as time would permit, on how to buy food, clothing, how to cook all foods, &c., how to care for clothing. In many cases the teachers claimed that there was a great waste about the Ind. homes, that must be corrected.\n\n(2) The follow-up system in cooking was adopted, that is a daily memorandum of their meals and how they prepare same, the cost, &c., then followed by such instructions that will bring about better results in economy, &c.\n\n(3) To advise INDIANS to use rubbers, umbrellas, &c., that they may save their clothing.\n\n(4) To teach the Ind. women how to cut out their own garments, &c., children's husbands, &c., also how to spin & weave, &c., card, make mats, &c., quilts from old clothes that would otherwise be thrown away. Also to have Children & mothers save all their STOCKING LEGS, the wrists of mittens, torn sweaters, &c., that they may be repaired, new feet knitted into these old legs, new bottoms for the mittens, and new pieces knitted into the sweaters, &c.\nNOTE -\n\nAll teachers claim that it will be impossible to continue successfully the Domestic Science, if the Dept. will not provide their schools with sewing machines. On any Reserve where there are over 16, or 18 children attending school, it is very difficult to provide all with clothes by hand sewing.\n\nMr. Fraser read a paper on Current EVENTS.\n\nAll teachers adopting many of his views which they noted down.\n\nRev. Father Lockery read a paper on religious Instruction, as his paper was quickly put together, it is not among those sent. However all adopted the practical methods as given by him:\n\nHe asked teachers to have children write out their prayers so they would better know all words well, and have a clearer understanding of same.\n\nHe pointed out many very simple and clear ways for the teacher that will aid them to bring about greater success in this branch of work.\n\nThe CONVENTION closed after two long days of real hard, but interesting work, covering, so the teachers claimed, more practical work than they had ever seen at any convention of teachers for the white schools.\n\nAll teachers had their NOTE BOOKS and all methods adopted were written down to be put into use at once.\n\nThus, all teachers have returned to their schools with more than joy, expecting to make in the school year before them, a wonderful improvement. Work that was before so difficult to both teacher & pupil, is now made easy, &c., &c., &c.\n\nYou will note that the deepest stress, at this Convention, was laid on the first GRADES, from the first to the VI, included, from this Grade up, we have little trouble, the practical methods adopted in white schools could then be followed, but the first grades are most trying, and so little progress achieved, it takes so long for Ind. children to reach the VI, & VI1, Grades. It is just this that we have set out to conquer, and all teachers claim that we have this progress well our way, since the convention.\n\nIt is therefore, with much pleasure that I submit this my REPORT (rather in a form of a SYNOPSIS) of our first Convention of the teachers of the Indian schools in N.B., thus bringing to a close one of the most important STEPS ever taken by the Dept. of Ind. education, in the history of the said schools in our Province, --one that will bring without doubt, lasting results of greater progress, not only to children, but to all our Indian people in general.\n\nWe, therefore, are most thankful in offering to the Dept. of INDIAN EDUCATION our sincere gratitude for its never tiring ZEAL, as well as its deep devotion, that has ever been manifested in our Indians and their schools in the PROVINCE OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\n\nHumbly and faithfully submitting same to the Dept. of Ind. education for their kind and faithful consideration.\n\nInspector & Supt. of Ind. education for the Province of New Brunswick.\n\n----- A LIST OF TEX-BOOKS ADOPTED, WILL BE ATTACHED TO REPORT -----\n\nVery hardly written - due to heavy rain & wind.\nCharge & address laid before the convention of teachers of the Indian schools for N.B. - Canada. Sept. 6th, 1927.\n\nRev. Fathers, Professors and teachers,\n\nI know not a greater privilege than this fortunate occasion in being able to address this, the first Convention of teachers of the Indian schools in the Province of New Brunswick.\n\nThis achievement is the crowning event of anxious years of labor and as such our Province is certainly indebted to the generosity of the Rt. Hon. Minister of the Interior, Mr. Stewart, his worthy deputy, Mr. Duncan Scott, as well as to the zeal of Mr. Ferrier Supt. of Ind. education for the Dominion of Canada, Mr. Sutherland and other faithful members of the Indian Dept. at Ottawa. Their unbounded devotion to the education of the INDIAN and their generous have today opened this broad avenue through which must now march success and progress to the two great branches that form our work in connection with the Indians and their schools in our PROVINCE, namely, that of Education and Domestic Science.\n\nWe are therefore called together for a great work, that we may seriously and carefully consider while here the many problems, that from time to time has rather impeded the course of our labors and unless solved must necessarily hamper ever desired progress. With this end in view, and with but a few days to act in, I hastily sent out to you, the teachers of our Ind. schools, subjects to be written up, which you gracefully received without a murmur, as to the shortness of time allowed for their preparation and are now about to read same, which will be listened to with deep interest, at this convention.\n\nThe idea of Christian education -----\n\nTrue education must include every element or means of INTELLECTUAL and SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING, that is, Education must apply to the uplifting of the soul, and be able to meet every capacity of the soul, bringing out everything and every power that is in man's soul, and not at any time sacrificing ONE for ANOTHER, but equally faithful to the full development of ALL. At the same time carefully educating the HEART, the AFFECTIONS, the WILL, -- This later education, is as important as that of the soul, even much more so than that of the INTELLECT, -- for MAN'S MORAL life is determined by the education of the WILL and the HEART. Let man's intellect be a tower in education, this will not necessarily make him GOOD, HONEST, PURE, and OBEDIENT. Have we not today many an INTELLECTUAL man lying in the GUTTER and DEBRIS of his own FILTHY heart. Let us strive to educate the HEART, the AFFECTIONS, the WILL, then, and then alone will the mind bring out these powers STAMPED with the ONE DIVINE RESEMBLANCE thus fixed within them. -- thus having the heart, will and affections prepared, all knowledge can now be poured into the intellect, leaving to us for citizens, truely \"MEN-OF-GOD\".\n\nI have only lightly touched this matter of Christian education in passing, as Rev. Fr. Lockery, our benificent host has kindly consented to address the Convention on this subject.\n\nIt will be our duty while here to discuss and go deeply into methods that might be adopted to facilitate the teaching of LETTER SOUNDS, --- &c., The Rev. Sisters of Charity, at Woodstock, have more than a natural talent along this line, that will provide us an excellent treat on a subject that forms the most trying work for both teacher and pupil. We all realize how difficult are the sounds applied to many of our LETTERS. Our CONSTANTS cannot be perfectly uttered unless joined with a vowel; then there are the different sounds given to each vowel, & letter combinations &c., &c., &c.\n\nHow very hard must the Indian child labor and what a nervous strain must constantly be upon the teacher over the seemingly slow progress of the BEGINNER. An interesting paper will be presented on this subject at this Convention.\n\nThe need of order in the CLASS ROOM\n\nOrder in the Class room is indispensable for the success of the pupil. All here realize the restless nature of the Indian child due to the environment that daily surrounds the child in an almost FREE and UNGOVERNED HOME. You can, therefore, realize that the Indian child enters upon its first training on the day it enters SCHOOL. It will be our duty while here to discuss the best methods that should be adopted to always maintain GOOD ORDER in the Class Room.\nLessons made EASY at home -\n\nI note that Ind. children take deeper interest, and do so much better prepare their work at home when the teacher previously explains lessons assigned, that is at the time such lessons are given. At the same time the teacher could point out some method to be followed at home that might facilitate their home work for school. Many a road I feel could the teacher thus open to the child that would make home study more interesting.\n\nLessons made easy in the school room -\n\nCould not a subject that an Indian child had a fondness for be used occasionally to give it a deeper interest in harder studies? --\n\nExample --\n\nWe all realize how passionately fond of drawing are Ind. children, then could not this their beloved work be used to strip the dryness from Geography, or from certain parts of history, or other studies, --for the geography lesson, --the Ind. child could draw a map or part of same, naming rivers, lakes, bays, mountains, towns, populations, race, imports, exports, &c., &c., or whatever would correspond to that day's lesson, Or as a REVIEW, he could draw a CANOE TRIP say from Montreal to St. John indicating on same waters to be passed through, gulfs, straits, seaports, bays, names on the way, towns, people, industries, government, people, race, when and by whom were the said places discovered, dates, &c., &c. Thus three or four subjects could be brought out together without confusion, and in such a practical way as to make a lasting impression of class work on the mind of the child. The merit of such methods, &c., will also have our consideration at this convention.\n\nEmulation -\n\nEmulation should be encouraged among all Ind. children by a method that the Rev. sisters of Charity will clearly place before our convention, which certainly is bound to stimulate all school work making it less burdensome to both teacher and pupil.\n\nTextbooks -\n\nFor textbooks we have closely followed those of the WHITE schools of N.B., except in READERS, all Ind. schools using the Sadlier's series.\n\nRe. the Arithmetic, about all teachers even in the White schools find it far from being practical, that is the McMillan edition. We therefore could use in conjunction with the above edition, the old progressive school series of KENEDY & O'HEARN. More practical histories & grammars are demanded for our Indian children.\n\nI have a series in British history by Cecil Kerr; & Forbes, and a Canadian History by J.E. Bigby, and a number of other books that are used elsewhere in our Ind. schools for grammar, so the Teacher can use practical methods adopted by herself and so laid down by this Convention An able paper on TEXTBOOKS will be read at this gathering. However it must be our one determination to keep as near as possible to the school books as are in use in the White schools of our Province. Our standards at least from the FIFTH GRADE must ever keep abreast of the White schools, so with this IDEA before us, we will discuss this matter on its merits during this convention.\n\nSupervision of playgrounds -\n\nAs successful teachers exercise ever care that pupils give their best attention to all instructions, and that proper order is always maintained in the classroom, so in like manner should the faithful teacher supervise the playgrounds. Games should be encouraged, that would afford active amusement, and every legitimate means should be taken to have pupils enjoy same. The GIRLS could be provided with such games apart from the boys, that would surely aid in building up in their feminine LIFE, that dignity and refinement, so essential for the future success of their RACE.\n\nRecreation is a period that means so much for good or evil. On such occasions children often take an extravagant view of life, and what seems to them but childish pleasure in the present, later on brings but a blush of shame. Nature, the weakest at this age must be strengthened to meet its conflict later. What bright and snappy children you will find in a class room after good hearty active play. The teacher too is refreshed, so that the whole class-room resounds with progress and vigor.\nRe ventilation of the classroom, I feel you ever give careful consideration. We all realize that an overheated classroom renders pupil inert, unfitting them for mental action.\n\nDomestic Science.\nSome years ago, I found it necessary for both the progress of the Indian and their schools, to inaugurate this branch of work. In many of our schools, the Ind. child came very scantily clad, and without the morning meal, and always very untidy. This branch of work is today carried even beyond the school, by faithful field matrons, into the very homes of the Indian, instructing the Indian woman in sanitary methods, good housekeeping, care of infants, the sick, economy in cooking, teaching them how to turn old things into new, and useful articles, as saving old clothes and making quilts and mats.\n\nIn school, both boys and girls are taught to economize, also to sew, to knit; many boys as well as girls now making their own stocking caps & sweaters. They must also be taught to keep their school books clean, and repaired, and taken given as to the cost of these books, had they bought same for them.\n\nHealth conditions were low on many Reserves\u2014the simplest rules along these lines were frowned upon. Astounding ignorance in sanitary methods about everywhere manifested itself. Thus-tubercular conditions gained rapid headway, and in many instances was fast encircling & depleting the ranks of this race, at the same time, offering rather a serious menace to the WHITES wherever they came in contact with the INDIANS. I am pleased to state, at this convention, that such conditions are largely under control, yet not without sacrifice. It will be remembered well, that Rev. Sister Agnes gave her life, and many others theirs health for this great cause.\n\nWe must yet admit, that this branch of Domestic Science is but in its infancy with many, nodoubt, workable conditions still unsolved. Your valuable papers will, with our open discussion on this subject, bring about, I feel, at this Convention, other methods that will assure greater success in this most important branch of work.\n\nA teacher's life in our Ind. schools.\u2014It can be readily seen from my general outline and your own experience, that a teacher's life in our Ind. schools is one of great sacrifice, yet an interesting one, where the teacher is devoted to duty. I cannot but deplore a statement made by one of our teachers some years ago, to the effect, that teaching in our Ind. schools, lacked interest as well as work. Now what was really wrong in this case? This particular teacher had no room for INDIANS and much less for their children\u2014thus school (as well as all other work) was opened and closed under an atmosphere of indifferance. There was no home preparation on the part of this teacher for the school room\u2014less in the study of principles, or methods that might facilitate lessons, so as to leave a lasting and clear impression on the pupil. Arriving at school, nodoubt, she was often confused as to where or how the day's work should begin. Thus confusion ever reigned\u2014therefore no success. Faithful teachers must understand, that they, like the pupils, must also prepare schoolwork after school hours. There are the weekly lectures, on honesty, Temperance, Thrift, Obedience, economy, &c., to be prepared also METHODS to be studied in order to interest pupils, as well as different ways thought out, so as to aid the Ind. child to grasp more readily the tasks assigned, &c.\n\nIn consideration of what I have here outlined and from what I will further place before you while here, together with your well prepared papers, on these and other subjects that I have not here touched, I feel we will have sufficient material for a very interesting Convention. It will, therefore, be our pleasure during these days, after a full discussion of all matters, to digest from the whole what may practically be applied for the better advancement of the work among the INDIANS so intrusted to our care in the PROVINCE of NEW BRUNSWICK.\n\nFaithfully and humbly submitted to you at the opening of our first Convention, on this the 6th day of September, 1927.\n\nInspector of Indian schools for the Province of N.B.\nOttawa, September 20, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your report on the teachers' convention held at Woodstock, N.B., from the 6th to the 8th instant, at which you presided, and at which all the teachers of the Indian schools in New Brunswick were present. The minutes of the convention, together with the various papers prepared and read by the teachers, were also received.\n\nThe Department has read with a great deal of interest the address made by you before the convention, as well as the various papers prepared by the teachers on the different matters affecting their work in the schools. It is noted that stress was laid on the teaching of the first grades and to the textbooks to be used, also that the work of instruction in domestic science was fully discussed. The suggestion that footwear be provided for the Indian children of school age, and that sewing machines be supplied, has also been noted. It is hoped that the convention will have beneficial results both for teachers and pupils. The Department desires to offer its sincere thanks to yourself and the teachers for the interest and trouble taken in making the convention a success.\n\nThe requisition for textbooks, etc., forwarded by you is receiving consideration. Do you desire the books which are supplied sent direct to yourself for distribution to the teachers, or do you prefer that the Department send same to the various teachers? In the latter event, it would be necessary that the quantities for each teacher be furnished by you.\n\nThe account which you submitted covering the travelling expenses, etc., of the teachers and yourself will be paid, and cheques will be sent in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell F.

You may arrange for this conference at the time most suitable to those concerned, and I trust that the sessions will prove of much interest and value to those engaged in our work. The teachers may be granted leave of absence, with salary, for the week of the conference.\n\nThe Department will allow a grant of $150 towards the expenses of the transportation of the teachers. You may apply for this amount when required and you should account for it in the usual manner, forwarding receipt showing the travelling expenses. A covering voucher, in duplicate, should be prepared and certified to by yourself.\n\nThe Department relies on you to make the necessary arrangements and to furnish a report with roll of those who attended and indicating the agenda. There is attached to this letter a list of suggestions for your sessions. You may be able to use a few of these at the coming conference.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. F. G. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank,\nNorth. Co., N. B.\nThe best method or methods for efficient work and attention in the school room.\n\nTo teach effectively, the teacher must know facts clearly and accurately.\n\nEvery teacher, as a rule, knows enough about the subject to be taught; the problem then is the best method or methods to be employed in presenting the subject to our classes, that we may give the best results to our pupils.\n\nIf our method be one, which will arouse interest on the part of our pupils, then we will have a basis on which to ground our efficient work.\n\nFirst of all, our school must be well organized and governed. This organization includes proper classification of the pupils, arranging the equipment, planning the daily programme, assigning distinct duties to the pupils, making provision for a record of their attendance and work, and giving them instruction of a general nature.\n\nIn the government of the school,\nfavorable conditions for health and work must be maintained, time and energy economized, the pupils' interest secured and retained, good habits formed and progress made toward accomplishing the end for which the school is organized.\n\nThe school must be organized and conducted in such a way that all its activities shall contribute to the development of high qualities of character in its pupils, and to their practical equipment for efficient members of society. It is essential that pupils should be taught in such a way that they may be able in later life to fit themselves into the conditions that exist or to bring about a change in those conditions, that are favorable to their activities. This adjustment affects our relations to people, to the things around us, and to new ideas about things.\n\nIt is necessary that teachers possess this power of adjustment, as we are often confronted with the problem of a new subject introduced in school, for it may be in dealing with some\nabnormal pupil, a defective or a genius. Such a teacher will be able to lead his pupils to make adjustments, and thus secure real educational activity, as making an object larger than the model, but of the same form and proportions.\n\nMaking an article for a definite purpose, suggested by the pupil, as to cover a book etc.\n\nSuch adjustments could be required in any subject taught.\n\nThe successful teacher is he, who organizes his school, and teaches his classes that through the regular, daily work of the school, he is able effectively to inculcate the school virtues, moulding the character of his pupils, and developing their power of self-control, self-activity, and self-expression, and so make them efficient members of the social order, in which they are to find their fitting place.\n\nAll work here should be so conducted, as to relate as far as possible, the work of the school to the experiences of later life.\nThe problems in Arithmetic should therefore deal with matters that come within the range of practical experience.\n\nThe exercises in Grammar should be assigned with direct reference to the effect upon the pupil's power of using and interpreting language.\n\nGood teaching, proper assignment, and intelligent application to study, will gradually develop in pupils habits of thought and action, that will make them efficient members of the social organization in which every man should be ready to play his part.\n\nTwo important functions of the school are: the correction of bad habits and the formation of good ones.\n\nOccasions may arise for the establishment of the habit of punctuality in school.\n\nThe first step is to show the pupils the need of punctuality. In addition to the loss of time by the pupil who is late, the whole school is disturbed when he enters.\n\nA reference to the loss of time when working for pay by the hour, will show\nPunctuality is regarded in business.\n\nThe second step toward making up our mind to form the habit, as a promise of all the habits to be punctual.\n\nThe third step is to seize every opportunity for the practice of the habit, and to allow no exception to occur, until the proper habit is established.\n\nThis will probably call for a daily reminder of the promise, with perhaps some interesting lesson.\n\nThe teacher of course being a pattern of punctuality not only in coming to school, but in beginning each lesson, and in closing the school.\n\nAll the school routine should become habitual by practice, until it goes on from day to day with machine-like precision.\n\nBut the teacher has also to reform the habit of the pupils\u2014a much more difficult task than that of forming good habits, since there is the resistance offered by the old habit.\n\nThe same steps must be followed\u2014but in addition, the conditions must be made\nvery favorable for forming the new habit,\nand unfavorable for continuing the old.\n\nIn correcting the habit of speaking indistinctly, the correct habit of speaking should be impressed upon the pupils by calling his attention to some good examples, or should also be pointed out to them, that distinct speaking in class, on the telephone, and in the shop saves time, and avoids misunderstanding.\n\nPupils while speaking require a proper position, with the absence of disturbing noises.\n\nCorrections made such as these, with subjects made interesting, and the proper form of questioning, cannot fail to demand attention from the pupils while reciting.\n\nIn every recitation there are two distinct parts:\u2014the handling of the lesson that has been prepared for the occasion, and the assignment of a new lesson.\n\nIn assigning lessons to pupils, the teacher must make each lesson stand out in the child's mind, as something definite to be done.\nMuch attention must be given to the nature and training of the child. Each pupil must be appealed to in terms of his interest, and knowledge of the subject in hand. In this way he will be taught how to study his subject intelligently\u2014that is, he will exactly know what is demanded of him in the preparation of his lesson.\n\nIntelligent study demands accurate observation, concentrated attention, and memorizing what is observed. The child will then have used his senses, his reason, and his memory\u2014which have results in his later life.\n\nOne of the school's greatest sources of waste is the teaching of facts in isolation. A fact learned from any book is more or less isolated, so far as its real meaning for the child is concerned, until it has been found in some other relations.\n\nGood books, maps, etc., may be used for such helps, or perhaps some books than one used on the same subject, with for reading, or studying, is helpful.\nSuch preparatory work has an interesting effect upon the lesson of the following day. With this interest from pupil and teacher, the class will unconsciously have an absorbing interest in the lesson, which will in itself demand the attention required in school on the part of the pupil.\n\nSister M. Ravedes,\nPrincipal Tobique Indian Day School,\nMaliseet\u2014P.O.,\nVictoria Co.,\nN.B.\nDear Fathers and Fellow Teachers,\n\nWe are assembled in Convention today as we were also two years ago, to mutual benefit and for the purpose of discussing educational problems, which especially concern our work among the Indian children of New Brunswick.\n\nI have been invited by our Provincial Inspector to bring to your attention and discuss for a few moments a subject of vital importance in the educational work being done in entirety of the Indians.\n\nDoes a religious atmosphere in the school room influence the Indian child in more efficient class work?\n\nChildhood is the impressionable period. It is the impressionable stage, and the importance of things taught is measured by their effect on conduct. The child must early be accustomed to consider actions from the viewpoint of right and wrong. A religion of the head, and of the heart\u2014intellectual, spiritual, spiritual and ethical\u2014should form part of the child's life.\n\nIf the child grows in knowledge of secular things, vital truths should be imparted to the end that his development may not be one-sided\u2014that he may grow in knowledge of God and right.\n\nIn the purely secular school, only the secular morality may be taught, and whatever our opinion of this system of ethics may otherwise be, it is manifestly deficient in the power which appeals to the heart and the conscience.\nThe child lives in a world which imagination creates, where faith, hope, and love, appear as images of beauty and delight. The spiritual and moral virtues, which are to become the very life-breath of his soul, are thus presented mystically, not confusing, but in a wonderful way, and thus the child learns automatically as he lives without effort, eyes fixed to see that he is a child of God, the infinitely good and all-wonderful.\n\nAnd we prefer to believe instead, and yet avoid the name to be spoken in the lock-room, where we seek to train the little ones as is done in the Baptist schools?\n\nEducation is the end of education, such as Christ gave the schools, the ideal character, who for over nineteen hundred years has been the chief inspiration to righteousness, and heroism; to whose words patriots and reformers have appealed in their struggles for liberty and rights, and to whose planning the modern age owes its faith in the brotherhood of man?\n\nWhat is the value of education? Education equips for the struggle for existence; for the race for wealth and place. It gives command being the capacity for higher life, for finer pleasures, for the highest freedom. It is the key which unlocks the secrets of nature; it is the password to the delightful world of the best human thought and achievements, making the wisest and noblest, who\nhave lived since my being, the familiar acquaintance of all rightly cultivated minds. It makes us able to gain a livelihood, and what is infinitely more precious it inspires the wisdom which shows us how to live.\n\nThe teacher's main business is to awaken and confirm interest in the things which make for power and value; life for interest, comfort, and kindly attention, and interest and attention result in education, and amazement which are the characteristics of cultivated minds.\n\nIt is easy to live in things which interest us. In rightly educated minds, intellectual culture is inseparable from moral culture. Real character is the only foundation on which the temple of life can stand symmetrical and secure; and hence, the aim and end of education is to form character. It is youth by right education to make saints discreet, heroes of words, truth lovers of laws, tragic super-mindfulness to the curious, and nobility to the amanuendus.\n\nThere is urgent need in our day that the young may be made to feel that virtue is power, courage, wisdom, joy, sympathy, and blessedness; that they may learn reverence and obedience, respect for others, that genuine progress is progress of spirit, that in all stations, human and divine, piety is the indispensable thing, useful alike, for the life which now is and for that which is to be.\nThe religious atmosphere is the natural medium for the development of character; in religion is the actual element in character.\n\nA religious atmosphere in the school room promotes the spirit of reverence, of gentleness, and of obedience, of modesty, of purity, which is very essential for the well-being of the school; it also tends to give the Indian child a desire for what is excellent. It is good for health, strong, brave and hardy, but it is also good for virtues and way. In this way he is stimulated to do better work and to perform his lessons more carefully. This striving after perfection, blessed and dignifies life.\n\nSpiritual exercises, such as prayers, loud songs, etc., exercise the faculties of the soul, the memory, the intelligence, the will, and make him stronger in the path of right willing, and right living and thus bring out the better self.\n\nAll this being true, what serious fact, should we not want to give our Indian children a firm well-grounded and deep religious instruction and training in their schools. To better effect this end, nothing could be more suitable than to have an altar erected in the school room, before which they could regularly offer up their prayers.\n\nIf we can interest them sufficiently to assist us in the erection of an altar in the schoolroom, our hope of directing\nand guiding their minds and hearts in His will is quite secure.\n\nThey first act daily before routine work begins in school, to think of God and to pay Him what He rightly deserves, first and foremost in their minds and hearts.\n\nNext, kneeling in respectful posture before the altar, with all diviner conditions suggestive of humility, reverence, faith, and adoration, they offer their prayers and ask for the favors which they need for themselves and blessings thereby for the success of this work.\n\nNext, too, they consecrate their thoughts and their work daily to God, so that all their actions are as prayers in His sight.\n\nOn the altar stands the statue of the Sacred Heart, bringing to their minds the holy life, the noble deeds, the pure mind, the generous heart of Him whom it represents, and encouraging and urging them to follow His example.\n\nHere also shines the light, which burns for their attention and which tells them that Christ is the light of the world, living in the world, ready to help those who are willing to help themselves. And therefore are led to make up their minds to spare no pains to get for themselves a good education, and to upbuild their being to its full height.\n\nFrequently during the day, their\nminds are directed towards God by the recitation of ejaculations and the whole school atmosphere is aglow with God's holy light. If the close of the day's work, special prayers are offered. And so the work proceeds from day to day, and from week to week, until may we hope, strong habits are formed in the young and growing minds of order, regularity, punctuality, obedience, reverence, respect, truthfulness, honesty, industry, and above all, the seeking after, and the desire to know Him, love Him, and serve Him, and be happy with Him forever in heaven.\n\nIf it could be so thoughtless as to say that a religious atmosphere in our schools does not act as a strong factor in helping us to make of ourselves what God intended them to be\u2014men and women whose minds are open and enlightening, whose hearts are pure and sympathetic, whose purposes are high and religious. And if they become such stimulus both to what pursuit they may turn in after life, for whatever their occupation, honor, truth and intelligence, shall go with them bearing like mercy, a blessing to Him that gives and Him that takes.\nGordie\n\nSept. 1st 79\n\nRev. Mr. Smith\nInspector of Ind. Schools\nCold Bank, Ont.\n\nDear Reverend Father,\n\nI am informing you of our father's death which took place last night. We attended the funeral service at the church yesterday afternoon. The doctor said that he died peacefully in his sleep. We are very sorry for your loss.\n\nFather was unable to attend the convention due to his critical condition. The doctor advised us to remain at home. The crisis is now passed and the doctor has every hope for mother's recovery. Please pray for her speedy recovery.\n\nYours respectfully,\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nhow to counteract any evil influence that might be found in appearance so that the Indian child would not lose its school training.\n\nThat the school and the home are united is evident. Children go to school with their hearts open, and they return at night carrying it in mind that the spirit of the school will aid progress.\n\nThe Indian child, as a rule, has a very unfavourable home life, chiefly due to lack of equipment, unsanitary conditions, and home training. When the Indian child begins school, he enters a new environment entirely. The life of the Indian child hitherto had been one of absolute freedom, for Indian parents make little effort to train their children. The child must now adjust himself to an entirely new environment, one in which order, discipline, and discipline are predominant.\n\nThere is a great difference between children from different homes; we find among our Indians\nPupils but comparatively few who have acquired habits of cleanliness, quietness, and orderliness. When the teacher has to face fifty or more pupils from as many homes, it is not strange that school affairs do not always run as smoothly as desired.\n\nNaturally, all todays families discover for itself what special handicaps its pupils face, how the child's influence of the home so that the training in school will be profitable to him.\n\nIt is therefore desirable that the teacher should know the child's home conditions; the more disadvantageous those conditions, the more training pupils from those homes will require.\n\nAs my subject I will take as one of the chief influences of any Indian child, which may be carried into the school, \"Unhealthiness.\" It is found in the majority of cases that those parents who are careless in regard to their homes will be often lazy in caring for their children and will send them to school unclean and untidy. The child itself may receive no training along that line and consequently is careless not only in regard to his personal\nappearance, but also with his books\nand not carefully supervised\nwith attention to the school\ndesks or walls.\n\nThe teacher, by means of\nnotice to parents, that the pupils\nare often warned to keep the\nschool property regarding their\nchildren's conduct, appearance at times,\ntheir desks, chairs, and other\nsupplies themselves on the play that\nthey are too poor to dress their\nchildren properly. We must therefore\nourselves through the children\nthemselves.\n\nTeachers should insist that\npupils do their work neatly, also\nthat the books and other school\nsupplies should be neatly arranged\nin their desks. They should not\nbe allowed to fill their desks with\nwaste papers or other useless articles.\n\nEach pupil should be held\nresponsible for the cleanliness of\nthe neighborhood of his own seat,\npapers and other refuse thrown on the\nfloor should not be tolerated.\n\nThe pupil should not be\npermitted to enter the class-room\nuntil he has made sure that his\nshoes are free from mud.\n\nThe teacher should strive to make\ntheir class-rooms so neat and attractive\nthat the pupil may easily see the\ncontrast between the school and his home.\nThis may be done by arranging the\nequipment of the class-room, pictures of the walls, furniture, maps, globes, charts, etc., in the most interesting manner possible, and by drawings on the blackboard which may be used for instructive purposes and kept serve as decorations. In these and in many other ways the teacher may assist his pupils to form habits of neatness which will aid him in his school life and also at home.\n\n[Signature]\n[Place]\nThe best method of winning the hearts,\ninterest and loyalty of the Indians.\n\nIt is very difficult to gain the\nhearts and loyalty of the Indian\npeople, for the Indian is by\nnature childlike in manner,\nand resents many things which\nwere meant only for his benefit.\nIf we do not win their hearts\nit is difficult to interest them\nbecause it is then only through\ncompulsion that they will take\nany part in the classes.\n\nThis of course refers to the\nolder people. The School children\nare usually anxious\nto progress; if the Parents are\ninterested the child will be\nlikewise, and even if the Parents\nare only willing to send their\nchildren to school because it is\na law, if the teacher has won\nthe parents' hearts, the child can\ncanily be influenced while in school.\n\nThe teacher receives her salary for the performance of her duties, but those teachers who reside on the Indian Reserve are often called upon to perform other little acts trivial perhaps in themselves, but which require time and patience. I refer to the writing of letters for the Indian people, carrying blankets to the sick which may have prepared after school-hours, explaining instructions written on medicine prescribed by the doctor, making up accounts for those who have had any business transactions, and many other acts too numerous to mention.\n\nThe Indian is very grateful at the moment of his exaggerating what he terms \"our kindness,\"\nbut we are not surprised when a short time later his opinions are reversed.\n\nWe do these acts willingly and cheerfully and would often be discouraged if we did not understand the Indian nature.\n\nThose who proclaim themselves our great friends today are our enemies tomorrow and vice versa.\n\nWinning the hearts and loyalty of the Indian people depends to some extent on the teacher herself. Rules which would work out to advantage in some homes would fail in another.\n\nBy visiting the homes the teacher becomes acquainted with the Indian parents; she knows those families who are inclined to make trouble and those who are the fault-finders.\nSome Indians are seemingly grateful until they call upon the teacher for some favor which we do not find convenient to grant, then all our previous favors are forgotten.\n\nOthers Indians are grateful and will often bring little offerings as thanksgiving. Then again there are persons to whom the more favors granted the more they expect.\n\nShould an Indian parent be lazy in sending their children to school we deduct their poor aid, this often causes disturbances. Perhaps a good plan would be to refuse to do anything apart from the regular work for those who have forfeited the right to our favors by their conduct.\n\nEndeavor by all means.\nto keep on friendly terms with\nthe Indian people, but we\nmust not show them in any\nway that we are obliged to\ncatch to them for the Indians\nquick to take advantage when\nunder this impression.\n\nOn visiting to the homes\nexplain to the mother anything\nnecessary, in regard to her\nhome, the care of her children,\nrelief for the sick etc., but let\nthis be all. We find some\nIndian woman ready to gossip\non all and every event and\nshamed me being prudent\nenough as to raise our\nopinion we may find a\nstory circulated, greatly\nexaggerated, as to what the\nTeacher said and thus cause\ndisturbances.\n\nBe kind, faithful in the\nin the performance of duties,\nsympathetic in sickness, ready\nto aid all within reason,\nthis is all the Teacher can\ndo if at times we fail to\nplease, we must not be\ndiscouraged.\nHow the Instinct of Reverence may be used to promote efficiency in the class-room.\n\nReverend Father Inspector, Reverend Fathers, Reverend Sisters and Fellow Teachers.\n\nThe subject of my paper is the important part which the sense of reverence plays in the class-room. Reverence means holding in religious respect, and with my knowledge of Indian life, I find religion is an important part in the life of an Indian and one of the greatest factors in training the Indian child.\n\nReverence for Authority: Authority comes from Almighty God and children should be taught to respect authority for that reason. Advantage should be taken of every opportunity to teach obedience to authority and respect for the property and rights of others. If this is impressed on the pupils the teacher will have very little difficulty in enforcing regulations.\n\nAnything that is taught to pupils as part of their religion will be remembered longer and more assiduously adhered to than if taught as part of a school programme where the teacher\ngains her ends by asserting authority as coming directly from her alone, and any breach of a rule must be satisfied to her and her alone. If we make a child see that this breaking of rules is contrary to the teachings of our religion and in direct opposition to our Lord's desires, we have a remedy much simpler and better than any meted out by a mere teacher and thereby promote more efficiency in the class-room by saving both time and labor as it lessens the number of punishments usually used by the teacher.\n\nAn altar to the Blessed Virgin should be erected in every class-room. The pupils may have full care of this altar under the supervision of the teacher. The pupils gaining the greatest number of merits for the week, have the privilege of caring for the altar during the following week. This has some very good effects\u2014It promotes devotion to the Blessed Virgin, a devotion dear to the heart of every Indian child; it causes the child to regard the class-room as they would the church and thus eliminates to some extent the un-necessary noise.\nmisconduct etc found in many class-rooms.\n\nCharacter Building. The home influence is of course the best character builder, but as this influence is lacking in most of our Indian homes this development falls upon the school. If there is something about the school such as pictures, statues and other religious articles which effectively though silently speaks of the Presence in the world of an All-seeing Power and reminds the pupils that each one has to answer to that power for the deeds of life you may readily see the influence on character which will follow.\n\nDevelopment of Sense of Reverence. We find the sense of reverence may be developed in teaching the different branches of our curriculum, for instance, in teaching Literature we may develop this sense by singing hymns, by the lives of the Saints and by the many parables found in our readers. We may also develop manners and morals by examples of character and conduct.\n\nIn teaching nature we find both man and nature are manifestations of the great\nDivine Mind, therefore we must train the child to see in Nature the Spirit of Deity.\n\nLikewise with the majority of our studies, if the pupil perceives in them this sense of reverence he will more readily put into practice the instructions of the teacher.\n\nAugust 23, 1929.\n\nEstelle O'Brien\nIndian Day School\nKingsclear\nN.B.\nThe part that religion plays in Indian education\n\nOf the three factors of education, namely the mental, moral and physical training, the moral training is by far the most important. At the reserve school many Indian children do not seem to make any use of their education but their character remains with them through life.\n\nHabits form your character. Good habits conducive to right living and noble character; bad habits to the opposite. The task remains almost totally to the teacher to break the bad habits of the Indian children and to install good ones in their stead.\n\nAs habits are often formed unconsciously by command has little effect in preventing the formation or breaking bad habits. Have the child understand that such habits mean failure in all things and perhaps despair to our fellow creatures.\n\nIf a teacher wishes her pupils to be kind, peaceful, truthful, charitable and the like, she must above all be living examples of these qualities. Many important morals we attempt to impart to the child do not seem to impress him, but your actions especially if wrong speak louder than words.\n\nThe catechism lesson offers an opportunity to form the character of a child. This subject like all other school subjects must be made interesting. Short original stories that correspond to the lesson not only interest and help the child to understand but may impress\nhim so much that the moral will remain with him always.\n\nIn all classes but especially in the lower grades the simplest and most effective way to impart religious instruction is through the use of songs. Large coloured ones are most impressive. That this method be successful the teacher's collection of pictures must be extensive and she must renew it frequently to prevent monotony.\n\nCare should be taken that the catechism lesson be not too mechanical. The pupils may be asked to repeat their answers by heart but they should also be able to explain their meaning. She requires an explanation by the teacher when assigning the lesson the previous day.\n\nThe teacher should use every means within her reach to promote greater faith among the Indians by encouraging them to receive communion frequently and to hear Mass every Sunday. The child's environment tends to counteract this attempt and it is only by convincing the child of the importance of these religious duties that the desired goal may be reached.\n\nEach school session should be opened and closed by prayer. Require a different child to say the prayers each time. This acts as an incentive towards learning and remembering their prayers.\n\nThe little altars introduced in our schools certainly brought about a spirit of greater devotion. I believe that they have provided a source of common interest to the pupils, parents and teacher. For example...\nSome time ago I asked the people if they would like to have a flower garden, but I did not get much response. This year I asked them again if they would bring seeds in order to have flowers to decorate our altar and all who could brought some, and when Harbour Day came how they worked hard at this garden. In every other way this altar seems to bring about a spirit of good will.\n\nA few sacred pictures and a cross should be in all Catholic schools. The words \"God See Us\" written on our blackboards reminds the scholars that their work of the day is for God. In order that these words will not be forgotten I require the pupils to write them on top of their slates before beginning to work.\n\nWhen teaching other subjects such as literature and reading by using stories that come up casually the teacher may do much good to determine the child's ideals.\n\nGood discipline in the classroom should lead to right actions. For example discourage fighting and you are teaching peace. In this manner you may impress upon the minds of the Indians the need to be honest, peaceful, charitable, obedient, industrious and the like.\n\nIf you can get the Indian children to conduct themselves well, not through force but because they know that fair play is the only right way, you have accomplished a lot. The habits formed in childhood remain nearly always throughout life.\n\nMrs. Tumblay\nRev. Inspector, Rev. Sisters, Fellow Teachers:\n\nI have been asked to discuss the methods used to overcome the natural shyness of my Indian pupils. If since our last meeting, in the opinion of our Reverend Inspector, I have made some little progress along this line, I am very grateful for the opportunity of passing along to those engaged in the arduous duties of instructing the young Indian population of our Province the methods which, to my mind, are most likely to produce results in this direction.\n\nWhile the shyness of the Indian child is noticeable in many ways, the one with which we are most familiar, is the shyness or timidity which manifests itself in the reading of lessons or the answering of questions concerning the lesson we are dealing with. The first requisite in overcoming this condition in our schools, is the possession and use by the teacher, of a voice which is loud and distinct. I realize fully well that our voices are not all strong enough to stand up under the load imposed upon the voice by continual loud speaking. But if we wish to meet with success, we must use this potent agency as much as possible. If we speak to our children with a voice which is devoid of timidity, in a very short time the child in reading and answering questions with considerable less shyness than previously displayed.\n\nHaving arrived at the point where your school has shown some improvement in speaking louder, the teacher must not feel that she may rest on her new laurels, and I find that the expression \"Please speak loud\" is never amiss and should be repeated indefinitely.\nI think we have all, at some time or other, felt humiliated when an unexpected visitor stepped into our school, and when a class was called to read, to find that they suffered for the time being, a loss of voice and naturalness displayed when with the teacher alone. This is a form of shyness which I believe is best overcome by the encouragement of visitors to the school. It helps considerably to have the visitor, on certain occasions, hear the lesson or address the class.\n\nA great deal of the shyness displayed by the Indian child comes from fear, and consequently a teacher can make little progress in overcoming shyness in her pupils unless there is an understanding between the two. We must treat our Indian children as friends, and encourage conversation between the pupils and ourselves. Shyness is also present due to the fact that most of our children are not overly familiar with the English language. I find that certain periods set aside for English conversation between the pupils, with the teacher making necessary corrections, not only overcomes shyness, but makes them familiar with the language we are endeavoring to impart. I insist at all times on English being spoken on the school grounds and in the school house, and although the enforcing of this regulation requires strict vigilance on the part of the teacher, the advantageous results are soon noticed and the teacher may feel well repaid for whatever she puts forward in this direction.\n\nCompetition between the pupils themselves is an aid in doing away with the shyness the children manifest in the class room. I find aid along this line is derived by allowing the children to engage in debates, dividing the older children into two sides and the teacher assigning some simple subject for debate. Allow each child to\nWrite his or her own impressions and read them at the proper time before one of the class who acts as chairman. The rivalry established for the time being, between the two sides, inspires each with extra confidence which gradually helps to dispel the natural shyness of the children of both sides.\n\nI think you will all agree with me that in most cases the bright child is not troubled with shyness as much as the duller child. Therefore any exercise which tends to really brighten the child's mind is an aid in overcoming natural shyness. During the last year I have used the following method considerably. I place before each child in turn the same picture. I allow each child, say, one minute to examine the picture, and then set down in words the different objects the child noticed in the picture and what impressions he received concerning the objects. It is really surprising the number, color and description which are transmitted and imprinted on the Indian child's mind in the short space of a minute. There are many ways in which this exercise may be performed and I find that each time it is tried it helps somewhat in removing some of the natural shyness of the Indian child.\n\nTo my mind one of the greatest chances the teacher has to overcome the natural shyness of the Indian child, is during the two periods of the day which are devoted to recreation. Play with your children on the school grounds, and the realization soon dawns on the child, that the teacher is somewhat human, and not a cold, austere pedagogue whose only duty in life is to preserve order and decorum in the class room. The more the children realize that the teacher is a human being, the further into discard is pushed the former shyness displayed by the child.\nI am a great believer in teaching Current Events, especially those which have to do with the civic life of our country, to our Indian children. The Indian child is interested in this study, and I know of no better way of overcoming shyness than by occasionally giving this work some little place in the curriculum of the school.\n\nThe foregoing are the methods I have used to overcome the natural shyness of my pupils. In summing up I would say:- Speak loud and distinctly at all times and insist on the child's answering in the same manner. Have frequent visitors to the school and have them examine the pupils. Endeavor at all times to be on a friendly working basis with your pupils. Introduce as frequently as possible into your class, competitive and brain building exercises. Play with your children at recreation periods. Interest your Indian child in the country in which he lives, and above all insist upon your Indian child speaking English at all times when under your supervision.\nThe Indian Child's instinct of Justice in Right and Wrong Punishment.\n\nThe subject of punishment in Indian Schools is one that will bear a great deal of discussion, and one that always presents a multitude of arguments for and against.\n\nChildren are all agree to punishment of every kind; yet the child's instinct which has developed points out to him right from wrong must naturally lead him to see the justice of punishment for wrong actions, as he respect and delight in rewards for good. Very often the child may through ill training develop a one sided view of this argument. Here then is a task that lies with us teachers to administer punishment in such a way, so that the instinct of the Indian child will grasp the justice of the act, in the same manner as he would delight in\na half hour extra play\nfor lessons well prepared.\nJustice should be so\nadministered, that it is\nrecognized as such by\nthe children. Then their\nsympathies are secured\non the side of right, that\nis to have the child's\ninstinct headed for the\nright and avoiding the\nwrong.\n\nPunishments in a\nschool are necessarily\nvaried, and the wise\nteacher makes it his\nor her plan, to have\nthe punishment suit the\noffense, and that it\nbe administered not\nin revenge for the wrong\nin the past, but to\nassure good results in\nthe future.\n\nPunishment inflicted\non the backward child\nis a gross injustice, and\nhis instinct rebels against\nit and rightfully so.\nAll children are not\ngifted alike and the\nterm \"backward child\"\nmay have tried his utmost\nto please, only to find his efforts regarded not at all and ending in punishment. Such an act on the part of a teacher kills in the child the desire to try again; so, his instinct reasons with him why put forth effort to end the punishment.\n\nWe all recognize the fact that those very boys and girls in our classes today will in time become the men and women of the nation; hence the growth or lack of the decay of the nation is in a measure in the hands of its teachers. This is most particularly true of Indian teachers, for as a general rule, we find manifest in Indian homes a weakening in parental control and home training. This of course has a corresponding tendency to throw extra obligations on the teacher. The chief agencies for the training of children are the home, the church,\nand the school. The closer these are associated the better will be the result for the boy or girl. The home comes first, and no matter how competent or zealous the clergyman or teacher may be, he can never supply the want of proper home training. One of the first things a teacher is wise to do is to get acquainted with the home life of the pupils\u2014 their environment, their parent, big brothers and sisters. A sympathetic acquaintance with these will help to a better knowledge of the children and will be of great value in dealing with individual peculiarities during the year. Furthermore it will prevent possible trouble in another way, for parents sometimes through the exaggerated reports of children get a distorted view of the character and personality of the teacher and this jeopardizes his or her honest efforts to be of use in the community.\n\nThe successful failure\nof the school, as an agency for the training of the pupils, lies almost entirely in the hands of the teacher. For six hours every day it is practically the home of both the teacher and the pupils, and instead of being thought of as the cold, dark, and repulsive thing that it too often is, it should be the centre of attraction, enlightenment, and progress to which both young and old look for guidance and inspiration. The school should be the centre of clean and healthful amusement and its all-round atmosphere should vibrate with steady progress along every line of enlightened human endeavor; for no investment gives a higher return than the money, time and energy spent in training boys and girls to become useful and efficient members of the community.\nSome thoughts and ideals common to the Indian child both in the Material and Spiritual life that may be of use in Early Language and Reading Lessons.\n\nThe problem of Primary Reading is one of the most complex and difficult in the whole range of school instruction. Much time has been expended to find the appropriate and natural method of teaching children to read.\n\nReading and Language should be taught, one in connection with the other.\n\nIn early years the minds of children may be enriched with ideas through stories told in the way of oral language.\n\nIndian children have many thoughts and words common to them that may be used in school in telling them stories to give a foundation of English for a mind filled with ideas is quicker to learn than a mind barren of thought. The interest aroused in the stories transfers itself to the reading lessons and gives greater spirit to the efforts at learning to read in the Primary Grade.\n\nIn placing topics before children\nit is always advisable to touch up the knowledge already possessed by them. The crudest efforts of little children must be received with kindness and encouragement. A great difficulty is to get correct English on account of home influence so it makes the work an uphill task; still with effort it can be accomplished.\n\nThe Indian child is familiar in the Material world with tent, bow and arrow, trees, canoe, birds animals and the names of children.\n\nWe can take advantage of this, tell stories concerning them in order to give the child some form of expression.\n\nAgain in the Spiritual life of the child it has thoughts and words concerning God that may be used in the telling of Bible History stories. All these increase the child's vocabulary which is so important in the training of the child to read.\n\nAfter the child has some knowledge of language and it can reproduce to some extent the story told, short sentences including its oral words may be placed on the board by the teacher. Each child reads these and is\nsoon able to point out the words. As new words are learned they may be placed among others for drill. The Indian child has a great love for his dog and he also has the thought that God loves him. If the language lesson has something about a dog, the child's interest is immediately aroused and a reading lesson can be taught at the same time.\n\nThus: \"I love my dog.\"\n\nGod loved me.\n\nI love God, etc.\n\nAfter a few lessons some simple words are taken from which to learn the sounds; the sounds are associated with the letters. These letters are met in other words and as soon as a number of sounds and letters have been learned new words can be formed by dropping a letter or adding one.\n\nThroughout Language and Reading must be combined; one as a help to the other.\n\nAfter the child has acquired some knowledge of reading he must be taught the further expression which is more easily secured if the child is interested in the lesson and this can be accomplished by proper questioning and occasional examples by the teacher.\nCorrect emphasis will naturally follow.\n\nFrom the first the child should be encouraged to articulate distinctly and not allowed to say e.g., las for last. In the case of white children they usually correct themselves later but an Indian child generally speaking continues an old habit.\n\nWe must also strive to get vitality into the voice. To aid in this have a child act out something as fishing, playing ball, etc., and then have another child tell what he did. Practice in this will give force to his utterance for children are anxious to give to others what they know and also to give it in such a way as to be understood.\n\nIn no other subject of the curriculum has the teacher so great an opportunity for producing the right impression on the mind of the child as in the early language and reading lessons presented to him. These to be effectual must deal with subjects common to his environment and by means of objects of which the child has a concrete perception he may be taught many lessons which will help him both spiritually and materially and what is more to\nthe point by these means many of the defects inherent in his race may be at least suppressed if not eradicated.\n\nThe Indian child can scarcely ever be driven as the obstinacy and stupidity of his mind would work against such methods but if persuasive methods be used the child can be led to do through kindness and trust those things which coercion would fail to secure.\n\nIn the selection of materials for reading I think there is nothing better than the Beacon Chart now in use in our schools together with the prescribed readers. The Pictorial illustrations add beauty and clearness. They deal with both the Material and Spiritual life of the child and contain many thoughts and words familiar to him.\n\nSr. Maria.\nReverend Inspector, Reverend Sisters, Fellow Teachers:\n\nIn my experience with the Indians, I have always found them very observing, and I think one of the best methods to interest them in thrift is by trying to show them by your own example, just what you want them to do. For instance take the children. Mostly, if a button was needed on their clothing the first question they would ask was \"Where will I get a button?\". I have a button box in which I keep all kinds of buttons. This is brought continually into use. At first it was kind of a novelty for them. Any button they would find would be given to me for the box. In a very short time they were saving the buttons at home. This is a very small item, but I find it is a great help in interesting them in thrift.\n\nThe same thing applies to pieces of twine and other kinds of string. When they needed a shoe lace, which was very often, they would come looking for twine. I would give them the box of twine and let them make their own shoe laces. In no time they had caught onto the idea of saving the twine at home. This also interested the parents, and almost without their noticing it, they had become accustomed to saving odds and ends around the house. We also have them save nails, pieces of wire, bolts etc., and not only the children come looking for them, but they have come several times, and when they found how convenient it was to have these things on hand, they became interested in the idea of doing it for themselves. Wrapping paper, paper bags, boxes, bottles, corks, pieces of soap and anything that turns up from day to day is saved, put in its place and is always on hand when needed.\n\nAnother thing that had to be overcome was in the line of clothing. Some of the children who were fortunate enough to\nbeing a good clean housekeeper. I also explain to them that it is much healthier to have things clean, and how much easier it is to get work done when things are neat and clean. In some cases it is almost impossible for them to keep their houses looking clean. They have so little to work with. The walls and floors are so rough and hard to scrub. Screens are unknown to them. The chimneys are pieces of stovepipe through the roof. This lets in the rain and the stoves and pipes are nearly always rusty. I think if the Government would supply whitewash for them, or do something to help them fixing the insides of their houses, there would be a great change noticed in many places.\n\nThe houses are very cold in the Winter time, and when the children sleep on the floor, which they do in most places, it is impossible to keep them from taking cold. I have been able in some cases to get the men to make little wooden couches for the children, and have had the women make straw mattresses for them. This has helped some. I always encourage them to wash their old clothing and make quilts out of them. Also to keep their clothing good from season to season. That is to put their Winter clothing away during the warm weather. Sometimes these are thrown around all Summer and when the cold weather comes they have nothing to wear. This is watched especially in the case of the children. Their caps, sweaters, stockings and mittens are darned and put away so as to be ready when needed.\n\nIn summing up, I would say, that in my opinion, if you want to interest the Indians in Thrift, try to show them by your own example just what it means. Take an interest in them and in their work. Always be ready to help them in any way you can. Keep a competition worked up among the women. Explain to them how much healthier it is for themselves and their children if things are neat and clean in and around the\nhave two coats, insisted on wearing their good coats to school. This was discouraged from the very first. Some of them had to be told several times to wear their old coats and keep their good ones for Sunday. I explained to them that I would not think of wearing my best coat every day. In a short time their old coats were patched and worn to school. Another thing I found that helped along this line was wearing rubbers on a rainy day. They soon notice these things and become interested in thrift almost without knowing that you are trying to teach them this very thing.\n\nAnother instance which proves it is easy to interest them by your own example. Last October we bought a few hens. At that time there were about twenty-four hens on the Reserve. Several times I noticed the Indians looking the hens over. They asked all kinds of questions about them. I always made it a point to be pleasant with them and answer all their questions. One day not long after we got our hens, one of the Indians came home with ten hens. A short time after this his neighbor brought home six, another fellow bought four, several bought two and some of them started in with one. They often came and asked for information regarding the care of the hens. I always helped them all I could. Several came to me this Spring for settings of eggs, and when school closed in June there were over one hundred chickens on the Reserve, whereas last year there were no more than twenty-five.\n\nI also find that a few words of encouragement once in a while help a great deal. Showing an interest in and always being ready to discuss their work with them, works wonders along this line.\n\nFrom my experience with the women, the best way to keep them interested in cleanliness and neatness is to work up a sort of competition among them. When I go into a clean house I always compliment the woman on her work, and during the course of our conversation pass a remark about Mrs. So and So.\nhouse. Instruct them in personal cleanliness, and always have a word of encouragement for them which will help you over many rough places.\nHow to Promote Higher Education among the Indians\n\n(a) By interesting the children.\n(b) By interesting the parents.\n\nWith my limited experience in dealing with the Indians, even with the children, it is not possible for me to say much that has direct bearing on the title subject.\n\nMy first suggestion in regard to the education of an Indian child is not to send it to school too young. The little mind may be easily stunted and by the time the child should really be able to grasp the allotted work it has become tired of school and looks on it as a penance or bore-dom. It will acquire a distaste or aversion for study which will increase as it advances to the higher grades; if indeed, it can be kept in school until what we might call the higher grades has been reached.\nThe free restless nature of the Indian child should not be restrained too much or too suddenly. The school room is not the natural element of these once children of the woods.\n\nA good beginning makes possible a good ending, but a poor beginning, while it may terminate well doesn't give much hope for final success. Hence, if the life in the lower grades is made interesting, the child should develop a certain attraction for school work and be desirous of continuing in a sphere where it feels that a personal interest is taken in its welfare.\n\nCleanliness and attractiveness of the school room will make life more pleasant for the children. Work should not be presented as drudgery, but should be made as interesting as the subject will allow. All work and no play does not appeal to anyone, especially to children.\nSo a little recreation occasionally, such as a story or a game, a little exercise or play will help to keep the children attached to school life.\n\nA keen but friendly rivalry should be manifested by children who are physically and mentally normal.\n\nTheir little ideas must be drawn out and encouraged. Little personal talks on what the future holds in store, as a possibility for them if they make use of present opportunities, should be some incentive to leading them to desire a more complete education which would enable them to take their places with other boys and girls in the world.*\n\nA well educated person will earn a living much easier than one whose education has been neglected.\n\n*The old boast \"I can't read or write but I always made my living\" is not unknown to the Indians.\n\nEven the little children have a tendency to think that as they are only Indians...\nthey cannot expect to do or be much. This idea should not be fostered. We must lead them to see that their becoming good men and women does not depend on their race but rather on the manner in which they prepare themselves for the great events of life, and the surest foundation for this lies in the proper education.\n\nIndian parents, are as a rule very fond of their children, but like many of our own people their affection is often misapplied in so far as they pamper the likes and dislikes of the children to the detriment of their later life.\n\nParents are much to blame for the want of interest and lack of energy in school work on the part of the children when the children should be getting their much needed rest at night, to fit them for the coming day, how many are on the roads or visiting in the neighbor's houses? Parents should be brought to realize that this is not giving their children justice.\nAnother thing the parents think nothing of keeping the children out of school one or two days each week, to wash, or take care of the baby, etc. This break in the regular work not only spoils the child's own interest but upsets the whole class.\n\nThe introduction of domestic science and manual work will make the parents realize that there is more to education than the three 'Rs'.\n\nPraising and encouraging the parents in regard to the abilities of their children will be some inducement to their keeping the children in school and encouraging them to higher studies.\n\nOf the realization of the proper kind of living could be brought to the parents' minds then there would be a start to advanced education on the part of the pupils toward better and higher life.\nDomestic Science.\n\nDomestic Science is a subject taught in most schools at the present day, and which should form a most important factor from the standpoint of the school and the home as well. This subject forms an important part of subjects taught in Indian schools. The science includes teaching of cooking, sewing and general housekeeping.\n\nThe teaching of Domestic Science for Indian children is even more necessary than in ordinary schools, since the children of Indian schools lack home training in this respect; the mothers being less competent than the ordinary housewife; thus the children are not instructed and are more or less careless in home duties.\nIn all cases, as a rule, the children make use of their school experiences in later life; so will it be with that of lessons learned in Domestic Science; they will begin to make use, as soon as they are able, of their lessons learned in School. This will affect their after life to the extent the attention has been given them in their school days.\n\nTheir home life will be much benefited by the introduction of this study in the school, not only in the saving of their food and the practice of neatness and cleanliness in their homes, but will also give a pleasing effect among themselves and their relations with others.\n\nThey will have a greater home life, and will encourage outsiders with the same spirit, thus making a better and healthier community life.\n\nThe mothers will also benefit by these lessons and example from their children,\nwhich will make both mothers and children happier in their homes, thus the daily task of household duties will be made lighter and more pleasant for both.\n\nSister M. Clare P.M.\nTobique Indian Home\nMaliseet, N.B.\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF A FIELD MATRON -- TIME AND DUTIES.\n\nIt is rather difficult to say much of interest on this subject as I have had only one year's experience in the work and besides the pioneer work on the Woodstock Reservation was done when I took up the work. However I will attempt a few words on the subject.\n\nThe instructions from the Indian Department and Reverend Father Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools, were:\n\nFirst, to come to the Reservation daily during the School term at the hour of the opening of school in the morning.\n\nTo visit the homes daily so that all on the Reservation be visited at least once during the week and of course oftener when advisable.\n\nTo send a report of the conditions found and the work done once every month to the Inspector of Schools and once every three months to the Department at Ottawa. This Report is to be under three headings:\n\nConditions in the homes;\nHygiene and Nursing;\nDomestic Science.\n\nThe Field Matron is on the Woodstock Reservation also the Domestic Science teacher and I find that in a small Reservation the two tasks can easily be handled by one person.\n\nThe work of the Field Matron must be planned by herself generally, according to existing conditions and special needs. It is chiefly that of a Social Service worker and includes a little nursing but mostly instructions to the Indian women as to the care of minor injuries such as cuts and burns, boils and abscesses; how to render first aid to the injured, etc. Then instructions to prospective mothers; how to care for themselves and what to prepare for the coming event of childbirth. Then later instructions and demonstrations on the care of the infant and proper feeding to supply the maternal deficiency which is common.\n\nDuring the regular daily inspection of the home, the chief advantage is to encourage the women to improve the sanitary conditions and to induce them when possible to greater cleanliness and order in the homes. Sometimes to reprimand when they fall back or refuse to do what is reasonably asked of them. I find, of course, that reprimanding does not effect much unless mixed with encouragement all the time.\n\nThe Field Matron has also to keep in touch with the cases requiring relief so as to prevent the ones not in want from getting same on false pretenses and informing the Indian Agent when there are cases needing help, so that these be supplied with what is necessary by the Indian Department.\n\nIn regard to infections, especially tuberculosis and venereal, there is ample work for the Field Matron to\ninstruct the people as to both prevention of infection and care of those already infected. This is rather difficult as they often cannot be made realize the danger of the infection. With the cooperation of the physician in charge and by means of sending the worst cases for treatment to Sanitariums, the spread of the diseases may at least be lessened.\n\nThe condition of the Reservation is much improved since the work of the Field Matron was begun here. The Indian Department however also has helped to bring about this improvement as a number of houses have been built and others repaired so as to enable the Indian people to have separate sleeping rooms and better homes. There still remains much to be done.\n\nSister M. Katherine\nReg. N.\nWoodstock Indian Hospital\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\n\f\nhousekeeping, thrift, sobriety, and morals. On not a few of our Reserves were found malignant diseases that called forth more than ordinary efforts and precautions to overcome. Heroic work went forth claiming one Reverend Sister in death, while gaining another. Yet others filled the vacancies and on went our work with uninterrupted progress, in spite of this tremendous sacrifice, so that now from out of almost darkened despair, there arises on the horizon of the said Reserves, a bright hope for better conditions.\n\nOn the smaller Reserves, some six in number, Domestic Science has not progressed as well as on the larger, where Field Matrons have been provided, due to the fact that after a hard day's work in school, little energy was left in the teacher to carry on field work; and since our grades must retain their proper standards, it was only natural that Domestic Science must suffer to some extent. However, since the Department of Indian Affairs has increased the salaries of such teachers, on condition that they would teach Domestic Science, it became their duty to do all in their power to carry on, to the best of their ability, or not accept this increase in salary; and when one's health and ability will not permit, then the said position must pass to another capable of bearing the burden. Thus by a continuous devoted interest and self-denial, there will surely be found, in the near future, a wonderful transformation in both the physical and moral \"BEING\" of these Indians confided to our charge.\n\nWith this end in view, I also allotted to our Field Matrons certain subjects on which they carefully prepared papers, that will be of deep interest to us all. Notes shall be carefully taken from these valuable papers which when surely and effectually imbedded in our work, will guarantee greater efficiency in the year before us.\nThe following are the subjects that were given:\n\n(1) How to Counteract any Influence that might be in the Indian Home that would mar the School Training of their Children.\n\n(2) The Organization of a Field Matron's Time and Duty.\n\n(3) Domestic Science and the Co-relation of the Child's School Activities in the Home.\n\nBest\n\n(4) The Method to Interest Indians in Thrift, and Indian Women in Cleanliness, Neatness and Home Efficiency.\n\nDISCUSSIONS:\n\n(1) Methods of Encouraging Regular Attendance at School.\n\n(2) The Necessity of Monthly Examinations.\n\n(3) Home Work for all Advanced Grades.\n\n(4) How to Cultivate a Taste for Neatness and Order in School Books, Work and Personal Appearance.\n\n(5) The Proper Adjustment of the WORD and SENTENCE METHODS in the Teaching of Reading.\n\nDEMONSTRATION LESSONS:\n\n(1) The Objective Word Method in the First Days Language Lesson.\n\n(2) The Sentence Method in the Teaching of Reading.\n\n(3) The Place of PHONICS in the Teaching of Language.\n\n(4) The Place of PHONICS in the Teaching of Reading.\n\n(5) Securing a Ready Response from Stolid Pupils in the Picture Lesson.\n\n(6) Securing Ready Response from the Stolid Pupils in the Ember Lesson.\nReverend Sisters and Dear Teachers of our New Brunswick Indian Schools:\n\nThrough the ever increasing INTEREST manifested in the Indian Schools of Our Province, by the Minister of The Interior Rt. Hon. Mr. Stewart, as well as that of his most worthy Deputy, Mr. Scott, likewise that of Mr. Perrier, Supt. of Indian education for Canada, together with Mr. Sutherland and all co-workers of the said Department of Indian education, we are again able to hold this our second convention. Our last convention, the first of its kind to be held in New Brunswick, or perhaps in Canada, took place between the 5th and 9th of September, 1927, at Woodstock, N.B., made possible there through the invitation of the then most worthy Pastor, Rev. Father Lockery, whose kindness on that occasion, as well as that of his dear people, cannot easily be forgotten. We are now in the hands, and largely at the mercy of the excellent Pastor of North Devon, Rev. Father Denchee, who, I am sure, will leave nothing undone to assist us, in every possible way, to achieve and even surpass, the scope of work so faithfully and earnestly carried out at our last convention.\n\nIt is a pleasure to note that most of the teachers who were at our last convention, are with us today, and a still greater pleasure to know and feel that, with but few exceptions, all have faithfully tried to make workable on the Reserves, the RECOMMENDATIONS passed at our last convention. It must be well understood that what is acted upon by these conventions, sanctioned and approved by the Department of Indian education at Ottawa, should become workable by all our teachers; otherwise our time would be lost and such meetings be but a huge failure. You will, therefore, provide\nyourselves with the required note books and pencils, that you might make your own notes on what this Convention may be able to impart to you. These NOTES should be retained at school, so that I may be able, from time to time, look over same on my semi-annual visits to the Reserves. I can assure you nothing can be more discouraging to me and harmful to yourselves, as teachers in our Indian schools, when on such visits I find that the very principles adopted at our Conventions, were simply ignored. We are told that success lies in seeing our little faults and in being \"BIG ENOUGH\" to admit and overcome same. I feel sure of your good will and co-operation in this matter.\n\nPROGRESS.\u2014The success of our Indian schools remained in a balance for years. It seemed as though there was an impregnable wall that challenged further advancement. After careful research into every detail, it was found that what seemed, at first, to be unity of purpose contained the wildest divergencies, which left our Indian schools, (so unlike the white schools) without proper methods of advancement. Such difficulties could only be solved and a workable base of unity of principles and methods adopted, in a free and full discussion of same by our teachers, called in convention. Therefore, it was not until after our first Convention of September 1927, that our Indian schools solidly advanced in phalanx formation, wherever the teachers faithfully adhered to the principles initiated at that Meeting. Still, as we go on, we certainly feel a deeper need for such meetings, if progress must be maintained, and rightly so; for how in conscience could the days pass without bringing such assured success in our work as to enable us to feel that we have accomplished, in good measure, the grave responsibilities entrusted to our care, in the uplifting of a belated race to the full participation in our CITIZENSHIP.\n\nWith this end in view, let us bend every energy to promote higher education, as well as a deeper, broader efficiency\nin every MORAL that must spell \"A CONTINUED PROGRESS\". Now,\nas a guarantee for such efficiency, I carefully laid before\nyou, in June last, certain subjects on which you faithfully\nprepared papers for this Convention, which will tend to en-\nlighten us and undoubtedly serve to remove many grave obstacles\nthat, heretofore, confronted us in the advancement of our work.\nIt will be our duty, therefore, during these days to listen\nwith marked attention to all papers and absorb such material\nthat, through the process of discussion, may be found essential\nfor the progress of our Indian schools.\n\nThe following papers on SCHOOL WORK are expected to be\nread at this Convention:\n\n(1) How to Promote Higher Education on Indian Reserves.\n\n(2) Some Words and Thoughts Common to the Indian Child's\nSpiritual and Material Environment, Which May be Used\nin Early Language and Reading Lessons.\n\n(3) Practical Methods to Overcome the Natural Shyness of\nIndian Children.\n\n(4) How to Quicken the Interest of the Indian Community\nin the Success of the School.\n\n(5) How the Teacher May Use the Indian Child's Love for\nDrawing to Advance School Work.\n\n(6) How the Instinct of Reverence may be Used to Promote\nClass Room Efficiency.\n\n(7) The Best Method of Instilling in the Indian Child a\nTrue Character, that is LOVE OF JUSTICE, of RIGHT and\nWRONG and the Will Power to do, or not to do, According\nto the Dictates of Right Conscience.\n\n(8) Does a Religious Atmosphere in the School Room Influence\nthe Indian Child in more Efficient Class Work. If so,\nWhat Method or Methods May be Adopted to Maintain the\nSaid Spiritual Life in the Schools.\n\n(9) The Best Method or Methods for Efficient Work and Attention\nin the School Room.\n\n(10) The Indian Child's Instinct of Justice in Right and Wrong\nPunishment.\nMINUTES OF SECOND CONVENTION.\n\nThe first meeting of the second Institute of the Indian Teachers of New Brunswick was called to order at North Deven at 2 P.M. on September 2nd, 1929, with A.L. Fraser in the chair. The minutes of the last Convention were read. On motion of Mrs. S. Keene, seconded by Miss M. Hughes, minutes are passed as read.\n\nOn roll call the following are present:\n\nRev. J.C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools.\nRev. Sister Praxides, Tobique Reserve.\nRev.

Father Ryan informs the Convention that the Misses Cahoon of Burnt Church Reserve, are unavoidably absent owing to the critical illness of their Mother.\n\nAn address of welcome is now delivered to the teachers on behalf of Rev. Father Denchce by Rev. Father Osborne.\n\nRev. Father Ryan delivers the opening address to the teachers, his paper being divided into three parts. (1) Introduction. (2) Progress. (3) Work to be Covered.\n\nRev. Father Ryan reads a paper dealing with the Domestic Science Teachers and Field Matron's work.\n\nRev. Father Ryan reads certain recommendations for school teachers and Domestic Science teachers. Each teacher to procure a copy of said recommendations, which are to be on hand at all times.\n\nSister Quentin reads a paper entitled \"How to Promote Higher Education on Indian Reserves.\" Discussion followed same.\nIt is agreed that the entry of children to school shall be left to the discretion of the teacher, but that no child be admitted under five years of age. It is agreed that when advisable that the letter should be carried on with the word and not to wait six months as mentioned on chart. Teachers are urged to give much drill in Primary work.\n\nConvention goes on record as petitioning Department of Indian Affairs to supply each Indian school with one sand table and certain bright colored toys for use in object lessons. Considerable discussion takes place on \"How to make a firmer bond between home and school.\"\n\nMeeting adjourns at 5 P.M.\n\nSecond session opened at 9 P.M., September 3rd 1929.\n\nAll teachers present at first meeting answer roll call.

Relative to this discussion it is resolved that three hours be spent each week in teaching Domestic Science, one half hour each day excepting Friday when one hour must be spent in this work. Note books to be kept by pupils to record recipes. Reports as to time spent to be noted on back of return to Inspector of Schools. The teachers are unanimously agreed, that in view of the increasing work along sewing lines, that it is very advisable that the Department supply each school with one sewing machine to take care of this work.\n\nMeeting adjourned at 12 M.\n\nThird Session opened at 2 P.M. All teachers present on roll call.\n\nRev. Sister M. Mercia gave a demonstration of teaching words from sounds and of building words through the use of sound families. Teachers are now advised by the Inspector to requisition for animal stencils which were not supplied certain schools last year. Discussion now takes place on Best Methods of Encouraging Attendance at School, it being agreed that making the work interesting and offering small prizes for attendance would help considerably in this matter.\n\nThe Meeting is now visited by Miss Moody of the Dept. Of Indian Affairs accompanied by Miss Murdoch newly appointed Visiting Nurse. Rev. Father Ryan delivers an address of welcome in which he urges all teachers to co-operate, as far as possible, with Miss Murdoch.

It is urged on all teachers present to be punctual themselves, if they would overcome tardiness in the pupils. The Convention censors long drawn explanations where short illustrations may be used, and the teachers are again advised to interest their children in lessons.\n\nCleanliness in the school rooms is now dealt with by the teachers, and it is agreed that dustpan should be supplied each school for sweeping purposes, also that two mops be supplied each school for scrubbing.\n\nPaper is now read by Miss M. Hughes entitled \"Does a Religious Atmosphere in the School Room Influence the Indian Child in More Efficient Class Work? If so What Method or Methods May be Adopted to Maintain the said Spiritual Life in the School.\" Discussion followed same.\n\nSister Clare now reads paper entitled \"Domestic Science and the Co-relation of the Child's School Activities in the Home.\" Discussion followed same.\n\nMiss B.

Further it is recommended that deficiencies of different pupils be noted in a book and kept for the teachers reference. It is recommended that moral suasion be used to produce neatness in the person of the child. It is agreed that the Convention prefers the Phonic Method as recommended in the Beacon Chart, for the teaching of reading. It is further recommended that the object method be used wherever applicable in teaching different subjects.\n\nSister Mercia is instructed to draw up a Resolution of sympathy to be signed by the teachers and forwarded to the Misses Cahoon.\n\nReverend Father Ryan is now presented with a small memento, from the teachers, on the occasion of his Silver Jubilee which he recently celebrated.\n\nOn motion of Mrs. Kehoe, seconded by Sister Praxedes, a vote of thanks is presented Reverend Father Denchoe and the people of North Devon, for their kindness to the teachers here in Convention. This is responded to by Reverend Father Osborne.\n\nThe Convention closes at 12:30 P.M.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n(1) For the better advancement of pupils in many ways, I would suggest that our teachers supervise the play grounds, and do all in their power to provide and encourage such games as would afford child, the most efficient pleasure & exercise, and during such periods of recreation to induce the Ind. child to speak the English language.\n\n(2) For your own health, as well as that of the children, may I call your attention to the grave necessity of keeping the school room scrupulously clean and well ventilated. Please make it attractive by drawings on blackboards, & flowers, &c., &c. Kindly see that all children are clean & neatly dressed, provided with handkerchiefs, and instructed how to use same, that this constant sneezing may be prevented. All sores to be promptly treated, sore eyes or any disorders requiring medical treatment, please notify the Doctor in attendance.\n\n(3) I would kindly ask all teachers of Domestic science, \u2014 and this includes all teachers in our Ind. schools, \u2014 to instruct Ind. boys as well as the girls how to sew, knit, repair, cook, and all such practical work.\n\nI am pleased to state that already a number of our Ind. boys have proved themselves most efficient in this line of work. They have knit a number of sweaters for themselves, & stockings, mittens, and have mastered the art of repairing old sweaters, stockings, mittens &c., by inserting needles in the stitches and knitting in all repair work, thus eliminating unsatisfactory accumulation of yarns in the very ready process of darnings, that rather reminds one of swollen glands or tumors.\n\n(4) Finally, \u2014 let it well be remembered that upon RELIGION, as a base, must we build the whole structure of our education system. We must educate both the SOUL, as well as the HEART of those entrusted to our care.\n\nThe Soul, that precious REPOSITORY of good created by GOD for Himself \u2014 and loaned to an earthly habitation but for a little while, brings in its combination of creation, a therefore true education must be such that will develop both \u2014 the SOUL \u2014 by caring for its full intellectual and spiritual well-being in developing its whole and full capacity, by bringing out and promoting (equally) every power and everything within it, \u2014 not stifling one to strengthen the other, &c.\n\n\u2014 (That will develop) \u2014 The Heart \u2014 the affections, the will, and all that is truly noble in the heart, for such certainly determines man's moral life! in making him good, honest, pure, obedient, just &c., &c., &c. \u2014 It is not his intellectual power and strength, \u2014 for does not our Country today possess many intellectual giants, who are everything but good CITIZENS. \u2014 Therefore, we must reach the WILL and the affections of our Ind. children \u2014 these powers must be developed, \u2014 their very souls and wills must be stamped with ONE DIVINE resemblance that has been fixed in them, thus, while we educate the heart and will on the one hand, we, at the same time, pour into their intellects every form of sound knowledge \u2014 forming both intellect and holy children.\n\nIt is self evident, therefore, that a strong religious atmosphere must pervade the schoolroom, daily strengthening within our TEACHERS deeper religious convictions well grounded upon great PURITY and SINCERITY of SOUL. Under such conditions the CHILD OF BETHLEHEM becomes the teacher, while our Ind. children daily grow in Wisdom and age, \u2014 Such an education is the sole guarantee of good and lasting citizenship to any COUNTRY.\nIndianapolis, Sept 27th\n\nReceived from Mr. Smith two dollar and twenty cents ($2.20) for two (2) new \"New\" tickets at half fare.

Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the minutes of the second convention of teachers of Indian schools in New Brunswick held at North Devon September 2nd to 4th, last, at which all teachers, with the exception of those of the Burnt Church School, were present. The various papers prepared and read by the teachers were also received. The minutes of the convention, together with your address, as well as the various papers prepared by the teachers of the schools on the different matters affecting their work, have been read with a great deal of interest. It is hoped that the convention will prove of great benefit and be productive of results both for teachers and pupils. The Department desires to thank you for the interest and trouble taken by you in making the convention a success, and also to thank the teachers for their attendance and the papers prepared and discussed by them.\n\nRelative to the recommendation of the convention that sand tables, sewing machines and dustbans be supplied each school, I have to say, with reference to the sand tables, that the teachers should requisition through their local Indian agents for this equipment. It is thought that these tables could be made locally at less expense than purchasing same through a school supply firm. When forwarding the requisition, the cost of building the table should be given. When the requisitions are received by the Department favourable consideration will be given to authorising having the tables built.\n\nRelative to the supplying of sewing machines for use in domestic science work, as you are, no doubt, aware machines were supplied to the Woodstock and Tobique Schools. It has been found that where equipment of this nature has been supplied to Indian schools elsewhere than in New Brunswick that they became easily damaged on account of being used when the teachers were not present to oversee the operation of same.\n\nThe Department will supply a reasonable quantity of dust-bans upon receipt of requisitions. In fact, one or two of the teachers have lately requisitioned for this material and the agents have been authorised to purchase same.\n\nThe account which you submitted covering the travelling expenses, etc., of the teachers and yourself was received, and cheques have been sent.\n\nThe papers read at the conference have been placed on file. I wish to make special reference to your address to the teachers and your kind reference therein to the interest manifested by the officials of this Department in the work of the schools in New Brunswick.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nRev. F. O. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, North. Co.,\nN.B.\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nI have been invited by my School Inspector the Reverend Mr. Ryan to compose a report upon how quickly the interest of the Indian community in the success of my school.\n\nFor my experience among the Indians I find that in some instances it is not always an easy matter to interest them in the work and success of their children. Nevertheless I have outlined a few suggestions and remarks that may in some instances prove effective.\n\nThe interest of the Indians may be quickened by pointing out to them how of this age of advanced education so many are making rapid strides in the acquisition of knowledge, as well as showing them why the flame of their zeal should not be allowed to flicker and soon become a bygone.\n\nTell them what educated people have done and are doing, not only among the whites, but also among the Indians of the west. Plan friendly talks with the parents of your pupils either at their homes or when any opportunity presents itself. Let them see that you are not working merely to earn a salary, but that you are deeply interested both in the spiritual and temporal welfare of their children. If their attendance at school has been very regular show that you are pleased, and hope that this may continue.\nRemark to them how well their children are progressing, due to their regular attendance.\n\nOn the other hand, the attendance has been somewhat irregular\u2014express your regret that such has been the case, and point out that even a day from school now and again retards the progress of child.\n\nLucy may be missing her catechism lesson and morning prayer because she had to wash the breakfast dishes. Barney may miss a morning session, because he was sent to the country store some little distance away. Suggest that the children arise a little earlier, that they may be punctual for lessons, and present at each session.\n\nAlthough the Indian people do not always seem deeply religious, still I think that down deep in the Indian heart there is a great love for the faith. So you may be able to appeal to them from a religious viewpoint. Tell them how much better the educated child understands his or her religion, and when assisting at Mass for instance is provided with a prayer book can follow the parts of the Holy Sacrifice as the priest continues, and as a result will doubtless assist with greater devotion; also in many cases the child will be able to explain many important things to the parents.\nwho probably were less fortunate than he in securing an education.\n\nIn the same way with the Squamish.\n\nBy understanding what the laws\n\nnameless are, they will in the major-\n\nity of cases, prepare to receive them\n\nwith better dispositions.\n\nObtain how the benefits derived by\n\nthe children are double, i.e., present\n\nand future. Among the former may be\n\nclassed this sound study of their helping\n\nas well as the attainment of a much\n\nrequired self-respect, honesty, thrift,\n\ncitizenship, and patriotism. For self-\n\nrespect is the beginning of wisdom.\n\nAs one author puts it, \"With respect on\n\nguard you look people squarely in\n\nthe eye, without wavering; such\n\nrespect active and unafraid, you go\n\nahead to move away difficulties and\n\nobstacles and pave a path for other\n\npeople to walk in from which they\n\nprofit.\" In a word education moulds\n\ntheir character, something that is\n\ngreater than talent, genius, money\n\nand friends; there is nothing to\n\ncompare with it.\n\nApart from these there is a happiness\n\npeculiar to education\u2014present\u2014the child\n\nbeing settled and satisfied with this present\n\nstate of life; for I think the average Indian\n\nparents can readily see that their chil-\n\ndren who are attending school regularly\n\nare, in the majority of cases, very contented\n\nand future, they will possess that which\neveryone else will want and giving it\nto others. For as much as one shares\nhis fruits with others, in that measure\nwill he be happy.\n\nIt may also be pointed out to them\nthat the children of today whom\nthey should centre their interest, will,\nif properly educated, be a source of\ncomfort to them in later years.\n\nThe main idea I think should be\nto gain the confidence of the\nIndian parents, showing clearly\nthat it is for their good you are\nworking.\n\nShould we enter on our duties\nwith this spirit, we may meet with\na great deal of success.\nOttawa, September 25, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the paper which you forwarded, written by Mrs. S. Kohoe, teacher of the Red Bank Indian Day School, on the subject \"How I quicken the Interest of the Indian Community in the success of my School.\" This paper of Mrs. Kohoe's has been read with interest. The suggestions made by her, as to the means of obtaining the interest of the Indian parents in the education of their children, have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. F. G. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, North, Geo.,\nN. B.\nHow the Teachers Can Cultivate the Indian Child's Love of Drawing\n\nAs a teacher of Indian children I have found that drawing is one of their most attractive subjects and the children derive much pleasure and gratification from it. Of course the little child who has not tested his powers to reproduce objects goes instinctively at his first attempt to make a pretty picture. At first he fails and this is so discouraging that he is apt to give up drawing entirely with a frown; so to get the young child interested in drawing I give him a simple object to draw, for instance a cat. I draw it on the black board keeping as closely to the ordinary appearance as possible with a few straight lines. Then even though the child goes pretty wide of the mark strangely enough he still gets something resembling a cat which pleases and encourages him so I have noticed that after drawing a few of these objects the child begins to take an interest in seeing things more clearly, to draw them better and to soon enjoy drawing more.\n\nIn its larger sense drawing means the graphic\nexpression of an idea, so when we come to a lesson in which the child lacks interest for instance a history lesson or a way if the child draws a map of the place he has seen and markers marking the features he will find it more interesting and this will always help him to remember the lesson. In geography if a child draws a map of a country he has seen a sketching and making in the rivers lakes cities, towns and imports etc., he is certainly more likely to remember them than if the map has not been drawn. Even in arithmetic in which the Indian child is so often trailing will again come in useful for example questions in the calculation the places more interesting if the figures are drawn and the pictures placed on them. In the lower grades if arithmetic is taught by means pictures on the black board it will be more easily remembered. Therefore I think that in almost any subject if drawing is introduced the child will be more willing to study.\nRed Bank, Mitchell Co. Mo.\nSept. 30th\nThe Dept. of Ind.

RYAN, on his inspection of the KEL GROUND INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, on May 19, 1933.\n\nOriginal on 55-3-6.\n\nA Convention of our teachers must be held this summer. I am calling one at Red Bank during the last week of July. All teachers may not be able to attend, as the Rev. Sisters and Miss Hughes and Miss Tremblay. However, all the rest will be present. I would like to have at least two of the Rev. Sisters but feel I could not pay their way - all other teachers will meet their own expenses, which will be nothing to speak of. They will be boarded free here and about all live near the Miramichi. If the Department could allow the Rev. Sisters $25.00 they could attend. No doubt, the 4 Rev. Sisters then could be present. Their presence would add much to the success of the Conference.\nOttawa, June 16, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIt is noted from the reports which you forwarded on your recent inspection of the Indian schools in the Province of New Brunswick that it is intended to hold a convention of teachers at Red Bank during the last week of July. The Department is pleased to approve of the holding of this convention, and I trust that the sessions will prove of much interest and value to those engaged in our work.\n\nThe Department will allow a grant not exceeding the sum of $25 towards the travelling expenses of the Reverend Sisters in attending the convention. It is noted that all other teachers will meet their own expenses. If you will require the above amount in advance, we will forward same to you upon request. If, however, the Sisters or yourself will pay the expenses, obtaining receipts in duplicate, which you should certify and forward to the Department, reimbursement will be made to the above amount.\n\nThe Department will leave the arrangements and details for the holding of this convention in your hands. I should be pleased to have a report from you after the convention is over, giving the names of the teachers who attend, the various subjects discussed and the general results achieved. I would suggest that the agenda be along similar lines to that of the convention held at North Devon in September, 1929.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. F. C.

These will be accompanied by Work Books and, in addition, a new reading chart will be available for these schools requiring same.\n\nThe Department is also supplying, this year, Arithmetic Work Books which, it is considered, will be very suitable for the lower grades.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

When the little ones begin school, the teacher should show them by her kindness and sympathy, that they can count on her as their friend. When this friendship is established, the work of the teacher is made...\nmuch easier.\n\nAs simplicity is a marked characteristic of the Indian children, the teacher should endeavor as far as possible to use this feature in presenting all subjects.\n\nFormal lessons in English Reading should not be begun with Indian speaking pupils until they have acquired a little vocabulary of English words.\n\nI take my Bible class and talk to them about their pets, show them pictures of dogs and cats and other things, teach them the names of the parts of the body\u2014hair, ears, eyes, teeth, fingers, toes, etc., also the names of the different articles of clothing such\nas dresses, buttons on dresses and pockets on dresses, shoes, stockings. The teacher points to the objects, gives their names and has them repeated by the pupils until they are quite familiar with them. The children soon become interested and this is most important. Test the children by asking them questions about what they have learned. I asked one of my little girls \"where are the buttons on your dress?\" after I had taught the names so reviewing it very carefully carefully she looked up with a little smile and said \"No Buttons\". Another was asked to show her pocket. She looked at her dress and finding none said \"No pocket\". No every Indian school is provided\nwith an altar, the children's attention should be called to it. Ask them what they see. Some will point to the crucifix, others to the statue and others again to the flowers. Tell them the names of what they see. Speak to them about God, that He is in Heaven that He loves them etc., show them how to kneel and join their hands in prayer. Now and again difficulties may arise in making the children grasp the meaning of what is being said. Some of the older pupils might be called upon to give a little explanation in the mother tongue, but I think this should be the exception and not the rule.\n\nBy the time the little ones have\nbecome acquainted with their new surroundings so they may be started on a simple reading lesson. Great care should be exercised by the teacher in bringing the children to class to see that all slovenly habits in walking and standing are avoided as these are apt to cause carelessness in reading.\n\nHere is a plan for first reading lesson. After the pupils are assembled in class they are told to close their eyes, the teacher indicating what they should do by closing her eyes. The picture of a ball is presented, and the children are told to open their eyes and tell what they see. Then one child tells that he sees a ball, and the\nof what he said is printed on the blackboard. Touch each child saying \"see.\" The children read it from the board, and the teacher shows them the same sentence on the chart and asks them to read it, placing the pointer under the sentence.\n\nNext day review the sentence that was taught the previous day and present other objects or pictures such as a picture of a kitty and a dog. When these are shown have a child tell the teacher what he sees and then use the blackboard printing \"I see a kitty\" and \"I see a dog.\" Then have a little talk with the children about their own dogs, their names etc., tell them that we are going to\ncall this dog \"Lover\" and then print \"See Lover.\" Drill the class on \"See\" which begins each sentence and show them that the endings are different. Like plants may be used for the following lessons.\n\nPhonetics which are a great aid in word getting should be introduced as soon as possible to the Indian children. The teacher's aim in the teaching of phonetics is the training of the ear and the voice before the training of the eye, and the telling of a simple story is helpful in presenting a phonograph. But as we are dealing with Indian children who are unfamiliar with the English language, it might be deemed advisable...\nto teach phonetics as well as unphonetic words as sight words for a while, probably for first and second months, according to the capability and intelligence of the class; the teacher should use her own judgment in this matter. When the lessons in phonetics are introduced they are to be given apart from the reading lessons.\n\nIndividual work is necessary.\n\nAs previously stated a story is helpful in teaching phonetics as it is intended to excite interest, and to serve as a background to aid the memory. From the sheets of flash cards cut along the dotted lines, the cards containing the nine consonants \"g,\" \"j,\" \"r,\" etc., and the one vowel \"a.\" Master the story on the reverse side of the card containing the\nsymbol \"s\" so that you can tell it well. The following story may be used to teach the sound of the letter \"s.\"\n\nOnce upon a time there was a little boy called Tom. When playing in the yard one day he felt hungry so he ran into the house for a lunch. His mother was in the house getting dinner. \"Dinner will soon be ready,\" said mother. Listen to the tea kettle. It says \"s-s-s.\" This is a picture of what the kettle said. Then teach the vowel \"a\" as in \"fan.\"\n\nThe next step is teaching the blend of the two sounds. Teaching the blend of the consonant and the following vowel is an essential feature of this method.\nThese blends, -\"ea\", \"fa\"-etc may be called helpers, since they help the pupil toward the pronunciation of words which are now to be formed. Drill the individual pupils until each child can pronounce all of them instantly.\n\nThe sound of vowel \"a\" is to be taught as \"fan\".\n\nDo not be discouraged by the apparent inability of the pupils to blend the sounds. Keep at it until each pupil can blend the two sounds of the first helper \"ea\", so they are pronounced in \"sat,\" \"sand\" and \"sad.\" Then see if the children can unite each of the helpers with the consonants sounds already taught.\nFlash cards are of great assistance in the teaching of reading. Provide the children with cards having the words they have already learned, and ask them to arrange these words in sentences.\n\nIn teaching all lessons from the chart the blackboard should be used freely. Insist upon good expression and discourage all parrot-like reading.\n\nWhen the Primer is completed the First Reader should be begun, continuing daily drill on phonetics. A few simple suggestions which apply to all reading:\n\nInsist upon clear enunciation and correct pronunciation.\n\nProper inflection and attention to all punctuation marks.\nNever allow a child to read anything he does not understand. Therefore before giving a child a lesson all unfamiliar words should be written on the blackboard and clearly explained.\n\nAll head movements are to be avoided also the use of the finger as a pointer. To handle the book properly and to stand correctly.\nReverend Fathers, Reverend Sisters, Mr. Chairman and Fellow Teachers,\n\nMy opinions have been consulted regarding the \"Teaching of Domestic Science as the help maid to the advancement of Indian Schools.\"\n\nDomestic Science is not so applicable for lower grade pupils as in the higher grades, and it cannot be carried out on a large scale because (1) The allotted time does not permit extensive work where there are a large number of pupils. (2) The usual home training does not furnish a basis on which to enlarge on this subject.\n\nOwing to the fact that the time-table allows only a few hours a week for Domestic Science very little work can be accomplished.\nhowever Domestic Science is taught under the following headings: Sewing, Knitting, Patching, Cooking, Lectures, Quilting, Making mats, and Miscellaneous Subjects.\n\nIn Sewing we teach the cutout patterns of handkerchiefs, towels, pillow cases, aprons, dresses, and shirts; the making of these articles by plain hand stitching.\n\nIn Knitting, we first teach the pupil the plain stitch used in knitting scarfs, while the pupils in the higher grades knit sweaters, stockings, mittens, and gloves. During May and June as the pupils complete their allotted work they are obliged to wash, and return their last year stockings and mittens. Then, they are shown how to knit in new knees, heels, toes or feet as the article\nrequires; in the case of mittens\nthe wrists are saved for new\nmittens.\n\nPatching is important because it\nteaches the child to be neat and\ntidy; and it makes their clothes\nwear longer. When a hole occurs\nin a pupil's dress, trousers or stock-\nings we teach them how to mend\nit immediately.\n\nIn Cooking we teach the pupils\nthe methods of preparing simple, nut-\nritious dishes, such as: The making\nof breads, biscuit, muffins, oatmeal\nporridge etc. Owing to depression the\ngovernment did not supply any\nmaterial for cooking during the past\nyear, therefore, all that could be\ndone was to give lectures on the\nsubject, and no demonstrations could\nbe given.\nLectures are given occasionally on foods, and their values, health, and miscellaneous subjects.\n\nWhen what I considered the more necessary work was finished I found that I didn't have time for the making of quilts and mats, but I intend in the near future to take up this work with my advanced pupils.\n\nMiscellaneous subjects might include any conditions that may arise, aside from the regular Domestic Science program.\n\nThe object in teaching the different branches in Domestic Science to an Indian child is to (1) Cultivate cleanliness (2) To give them a working knowledge of housekeeping, and the making and mending of their own clothing etc. (3) It also forms\na relation between the school and\nthe home. (4) The making of articles\nof clothing enables the child to\nattend school with suitable cloth-\ning.\n\nAs I have outlined my views\non this subject, I am now prepa-\nred to receive, and will appreciate\nany criticism that may arise.\n\nI thank you.\nReverend Fathers, Reverend Sisters, Fellow Teachers:\n\nThe subject of my paper is \"The Teaching of Domestic Science in my school.\"\n\nThe teaching of Domestic Science in our Indian schools has for its main object the training of the Indian children in the habit of thrift, and never in the history of our school has it been more needed than at the present time. If this habit is fostered through the school life of the children it will no doubt be practiced to a certain extent at least in the years to follow.\n\nThe hour set apart for this work is hailed with delight by my pupils. The little ones love to have a pair of bright knitting needles and a ball of colored yarn put into their hands.\n\nI start my beginners knitting with two needles. They are told they must learn the plain and rib stitches, and then they\nmay begin to knit something they can wear. Every effort is put forth to do their work well. Many mistakes are made but they are always willing to try again. Before long they are able to set up a scarf or a pair of mittens for themselves. I do not think it advisable to continue the same kind of work daily so I change from knitting to sewing every now and then. I ask the children to save their salt bags and little pieces of soft cotton materials that they may bring them to school and hem them for handkerchiefs. Pretty soon they began to bring in their salt bags, nicely washed and ironed, also little pieces of cotton which are hemmed in a short time.\n\nThe older pupils knit their own mitts, stockings and sweaters. They repair the old stockings by knitting in new knees, heels or toes as required. The wrists of mittens which are much worn are saved, and new parts are knit on.\n\nWhen the time for wearing\nthese garments is over, the children are told to have them all washed, mended and put away so that they may be ready for use when the cold weather begins again. If we have not sufficient yarn for mending all the garments, they are brought to school and mended at the beginning of the September term. When the last year's garments were not cared for in this way, the children were given to understand that they might not have the privilege of getting the yarn the following year. I had some difficulty about this at first. The pupils would say, \"My mudder washed my stockings felt no good; knees all break, no toes or heel.\" But I insisted on having the garments brought to the school. The pupils were shown how to insert the needles, and knit a new piece where it was needed. When the work was completed, some of the children would say \"Just like new.\" Of course in some instances the old part may not wear out.\nthe new but the children have learned a lesson in economy.\n\nI told the older pupils to watch their mothers sewing baskets; they might find there some pieces with which they could start quilt patching. They were delighted with this proposal, and began to bring in pieces of every shape and hue. It was surprising the patience the children exercised in putting these pieces together. I must admit the work was rather crude, but as all seemed to be doing their very best, I gave them much encouragement. The children brought flour bags; some made slips upon and waists. I have been suggesting that they dye their flour bags some pretty colors, and then they could make dresses. Remnants of dress goods were used for making tams.\n\nAnother very important part of the Domestic Science work, is the making over of old garments into new ones. This work should\nbe particularly stressed both at home and in\nthe class room. Now the question might arise,\n\"In what Indian home could material be found\nfor such work?\" We are aware that the average\nhome has little or none; but as some of our\nIndian people from time to time work in ex-\nchange for worn clothing, it might be secure\nin this way. I have in the class room two\ncoats which were made over in schools which\nare not provided with sewing machines; the\nwork may be begun at home, as many Indian\nhomes have sewing machines. The children\nmay be provided with patterns, have them\nrip up the old garments, eliminating worn-out\nparts, the new garments cut out, and basted.\n\nApart from this work, the pupils are instruct-\ned to watch the buttons on their clothing and\nwhen any are missing, to find others to take\ntheir places. When a patch is needed to bring\na piece of material as near as possible like\nthe garment and have one put on. If they\nhave new dresses, to keep them for Sunday,\nthey are not to be worn to school unless it is absolutely necessary. The same rule applies to other articles of clothing, as coats, shoes and stockings etc.\n\nFrom time to time the children are given practical hints on bread making and the preparation of simple nutritious foods. They are frequently reminded that economy should always be practised, economy in the home, economy in the school.\n\nThis is a summary of the actual work which is being carried on in my school, and it should be the earnest endeavor of every Domestic Science teacher to make this work a great success, for next to their religion, I think it will play the most important part in the lives of the children in the years to come. At times we may feel discouraged when our efforts are now crowned with the success we expected, but by our untiring\nPerseverance, always seeking the cooperation of both parents and pupils, let us go steadily on with a fixed determination to succeed. I shall be pleased to receive any suggestions from my fellow teachers along this line of work.\nNature and Health.\n\nIt would seem presumptuous for me to try to tell you how to teach Nature and Health. In this paper I shall simply try to demonstrate a few of the methods I use, after which I shall listen attentively to your criticism, which will point out, I hope, some of the weaknesses that I could not see.\n\nAny subject which we attempt to teach may be divided into three phases: motivation, development, and expression. Motivation is simply an article or story, a practical application or some other device used to arouse interest in the child. In fact, it is a concrete bridge connecting the known and the related and known. I very often use blackboard drawings, or make flash cards from pictures found in advertisements in magazines. Another very effective motivation is a practical demonstration before the class of some good health habit. The daily morning exercise of brushing the teeth is a good example. Frequently, too, I teach a bookless lesson. My motives here are...\nto get action, to teach something to do rather than the something to learn, for the sake of variety; to show by their absence how useful books are, and to develop the power of self-reliant thinking. The vital point about this particular lesson which I have taught so often is not the fact information it contains, but the actions and habits it induces the boys and girls to do and to continue to do. Knowledge about health is important but it is the health habits that count.\n\nKeeping this idea uppermost, my first step is to give the boys and girls a five minutes talk on bodily cleanliness among other points. Stress these: Many germ diseases may be carried by the hands, backs, footwear, the fur of pets, the knobs on doors, retain germs, most colds are caught by germs reaching the mouth by means of the hands.\n\nSecond step: I write on the blackboard this health pledge: Cleanliness is the first law of health. I owe it to myself, my family, my school, my country to keep my body clean, strong and healthy. Free from dirt and germs. I'll try. Then the children...\nmemorize the pledge.\n\nThird Step: Next, I teach the children some useful health habits; for instance, how to wash their hands. Few children make a good job of it. I have a pupil demonstrate the proper way before the class. About washing the hands remind the children what should be done: roll up their sleeves, rub soap on the backs of the hands also, not to wipe dirt off on the towel.\n\nFourth Step: Here enters the \"do\" part. For one month hence (not only one month I hope) the children put into practice what I have been teaching and preaching to them. For one month, they wash their hands regularly under my supervision. After that, they wash their hands regularly without supervision. Every Monday morning they bring to school a record showing the number of times, the days, dates and occasions on which they have washed their hands. Golden colored stars are awarded. At the end of the month the winner in the competition is announced and lauded. If the interest justifies it and in my case it did, we continue the contest.\nfor another month. Lewis Bros. Ltd. of Toronto, will supply any teacher with Wash-up Sacred Shields. Gold Stars Ltd. This is an example of only one lesson that has been worked out on this plan.\n\nLessons from the text on Respiration, Digestion, the circulation of the blood etc., may be outlined under different headings and taught step by step using drawings and pictures for demonstrations.\n\nHand in hand with health goes Nature, and the teacher may be called upon at any time to decide some problem that had been observed or found on the way to school perhaps. Then, very often the carefully planned lesson of the day is set aside for a future date, and immediate notice is taken of the visitor. For instance, one day a big green caterpillar was discovered making its way along the classroom floor. I defined our guest as a cabbage caterpillar and told the children how the egg had been laid by the butterfly and hatched out into their caterpillar. It had now attained its full size and was seeking some place to sleep. The children\nplaced him in a box and watched with interest during the winter months to see what was going to happen, for they understood that life history was not yet complete. Needless to tell, it was an enthusiastic class which, one extra warm day in May, observed our guest endeavoring to spread his wings. Carefully we removed him from his close quarters and placed him in the sun. Soon he spread his wings and poised for flight. Having as it were harbored him, we were loath to kill him, as perhaps we should have done to the interest of next year's cabbage crop, but the children wanted him set free, so we opened a window and out he flew. I feel certain that particular nature lesson will never be forgotten by my pupils.\n\nTopics for this study are so numerous that I can but touch on them. The autumn presents to us for study and observation, the harvesting of crops, turning and falling of leaves, the southward flight of the birds and nature's way in general of preparation for winter. Although nature is in most\ncases, dormant during the winter months, what better time is there to study our evergreen trees. Our forest and lumbering operations, too, are a never failing source of interest because they supply, no doubt, a home occupation for the fathers and elder brothers, so though Nature be sleeping, our lessons need never be dull.\n\nSpecimens one may say, may be hard to procure in winter. Not so, if cloud collections are gathered and differences in different clouds noticed and noted, again the fungus often found clinging to the furnace sticks, is a splendid specimen for an interesting lesson.\n\nThus we arrive at spring when all Nature is awake and birds animals, plants and trees vie with each other to be noticed. What boy or girl is there who doesn't delight in telling us of seeing the first robin, or so far with other birds common to our locality. What better time then to have a lesson on those birds. Again I am sure, we have each had the pleasure of receiving our first spring bouquet from the children, perhaps only a mixture of lady's slipper, but\na fountain of wealth for nature study. Thus the children themselves are supplying the subjects for their nature classes.\n\nI find that in connection with this spring work a great source of interest is the bird and wild flower studies. These are very simply made by ruling a sheet of Bristol board under the headings: Common name, Date, Family, Description, and a space for the name of the pupil who found the particular specimen. These calendars or charts can be made very attractive classroom decorations, by pasting on pictures of wild flowers and birds and hanging them on the classroom walls.\n\nAs spring advances birds and flowers give place to seeding and gardening; when again the practical work is the best way of imparting knowledge to the school child. The school garden where it can be effectively carried out, teaches the child how to prepare seed and cultivate growing crops. If school gardening cannot be carried out, encourage the child to have a home plot.\n\nArbor day is a day special\nday, when nature work may be made most interesting. The word \"work\" refers to trees; it is an old day, we plant a tree, but let us not stop at that. On Labor day, we can prepare and seed flower beds, which help to beautify our school grounds. Thus we see how the nature project works itself into our school routine and added to that, the three weekly periods allotted to it, I find my pupils have a fair knowledge of nature, and in time they will hope learn to appreciate how great nature is, and that it truly is living proof of the existence and omnipotence of the Almighty Creator who in his wisdom and kindness fashioned Mother Earth for our special use and benefit.\nDomestic Science.\n\nThis subject I think appeals strongly to the Indian children, especially to the girls and naturally so for it is generally to the housewife folk, that the making and mending of the household is configned. It is not unusual, however, for boys to be able to mend their own clothes or even to knit their own mittens socks and sweaters and while they may never be called upon to do these things for themselves afterwards it certainly can not harm them to know how, if the emergency ever should arise.\n\nIt really is not any harder to start a boys knitting or sewing class than it is to start the same class with girls. True, for a time it is more discouraging, for the boys cannot be expected to show the same enthusiasm for this work as the girls but in time the Indian boy begins to show a real interest in the work, especially if it is something he can use for\nhis own weaving apparel; a pair of mittens, a cap, sweater, or stockings, for then he begins to realize what he has done something really worth while. He is anxious to show the girls in his class that he is just as capable of looking after his own personal appearance as they are.\n\nThe girls in most cases are energetic workers along this line of study. One cannot realize how useful this period is to the Indian children until one sees the improvement it has made in their lives and homes. For a number of years, the Department of Indian Affairs has supplied material both for sewing and knitting, for the use of the school children, and practically all the clothing for both boys and girls is made from this material, the work being done either in school by the pupils or at home by their parents.\n\nThe children themselves, from the age of eleven up are able to make and keep in repair all their own clothes. This is considered no mean\naccomplishment and it certainly is a credit to any child; most so to the Indian child, who not only has the knowledge and capability of such work but also brings that knowledge to the home where it has proved its influence with the parents.\n\nFor the smaller pupils who are not old enough to make their own clothes, the garments can be cut out in school basted and sent or brought to the parents, some of whom do surprisingly neat and accurate work on the garments, many times trimming them according to their own tastes showing their originality and their pride and interest in the work. This I find is a good object for our monthly visits to the homes of the children, for while the parents usually enjoy these visits of the teacher & think they like it better when the teacher brings something for them to do for their children and on the next visit they will proudly display the work they have completed. Not only does the children profit by these hours of domestic\nwork, but the parents also show that they are taking advantage of the opportunities these lessons afford. Besides the articles of clothing made, many comfortable quilts have been made, using up all the left over scraps of material.\n\nThe children, too, take great pride in keeping their clothes, especially when they make themselves neat and tidy, and different times I have had pupils come and ask if they could mend some article of clothing before beginning the regular work they have on hand. This shows that the children are making good use of what they have been taught. The warm garments made in school act to, as a preventative from cold. Thus this work indirectly influences the other work carried on, for if the children are not warmly clad in winter, the almost sure result is sickness, and sickness means absence from school and a falling back in the classes. I might say here, too, that I find the daily use of Cod Liver Oil\nand milk which the department supplies, to have made a wonderful improvement in the health and appearances of my pupils, so that whatever ugly line look at it, the domestic work should receive the earnest and interested attention of the teacher, as it has a marked effect on the pupils, not only while they are attending school, but takes in their lives afterwards, for it is a work that can always be put to practical use.\nTeaching English Grammar and Composition to Indian Children.\n\nReverend Fathers, Reverend Sisters, Mr Chairman and Fellow Teachers,\n\nI have been asked to write a paper on Teaching English Grammar and Composition to Indian Children:\n\nOut of the twelve subjects on the curriculum for Indian schools, I find that Grammar is the most difficult subject to be taught with any success to Indian children.\n\nSince the entire study of Grammar is based on language, the teacher, therefore, has a very weak foundation to work upon, because the majority of Indian pupils know very little English and have no desire to learn it.\n\nIn the lower grades even when\nthe child enters in Grade I, the teacher should begin instructions in English language by teaching what is correct, and correcting what is wrong without teaching a system of rules, as the minds of little children are as yet too undeveloped to grasp scientific principles.\n\nAs the child passes into a higher grade, the language study is continued by degrees until the fifth grade, when the term Grammar should be introduced, and then in a very limited sense.\n\nIt is not until the sixth grade is reached that it is profitable to introduce the study of the text book. Up to this time the pupil has been taught to use certain expressions and to avoid others without always knowing exactly why, but when he comes\nto the study of the text-book the teacher explains the logical reasons for these things, and no longer must the pupil choose between right and wrong forms on the basis of memorization instead he applies his knowledge of fundamental rules.\n\nBoth language work and Grammar are closely related to Composition since the pupil must from the beginning build sentences to illustrate the principles he has been learning.\n\nThe following underlying principles are applicable to all language teaching:\n\n1. The child learns language by listening to his teachers.\n2. The child learns language from his reading book.\n3. The child learns language from by coming in contact with English-speaking persons.\n\nThe pupil must be encouraged to use the English tongue in conversation.\nto pronounce words correctly, to use correct language forms and to cooperate with the teacher in mastering the correct forms of English.\n\nI offer two suggestions which would be found helpful. The teacher must be careful to use correct language as the pupil imitates your speech as well as your actions. (2) Call attention to correct forms in such a way as not to embarrass the pupil, and do not call attention to incorrect forms for instance, when a pupil makes an error it is in conversation it is better to let him finish rather than interrupt him, as it is most difficult to encourage an Indian child to repeat.\n\nSince the phases of Grammar are not taught to pupils under Grade V, I shall outline the work to be taken up by these lower grades. Namely, Letters\u2014\nto pronounce words correctly, to use correct language forms and to cooperate with the teacher in mastering the correct forms of English.\n\nI offer two suggestions which would be found helpful. The teacher must be careful to use correct language as the pupil imitates your speech as well as your actions. (2) Call attention to correct forms in such a way as not to embarrass the pupil, and do not call attention to incorrect forms for instance, when a pupil makes an error. In conversation it is better to let him finish rather than interrupt him, as it is most difficult to encourage an Indian child to repeat.\n\nSince the phases of Grammar are not taught to pupils under Grade V, I shall outline the work to be taken up by these lower grades. Namely, \"Little...\"\nWriting (2) Story-telling (3) The writing of simple compositions. In letter-writing the pupil is taught the parts of a letter, the use of capitals, and simple punctuation.\n\nIn story-telling the story is told by the teacher and repeated by the pupil. In simple composition the teacher suggests a title and the pupil enlarges it into a composition.\n\nNow in Grade V we begin the simple phases of grammar, namely, the parts of speech and the elements of a sentence.\n\nIn Grade VI we continue and enlarge upon the work of Grade V and introduce the Classification of Sentences according to construction and use, the classical analysis and simple detailed analysis of sentences.\n\nGrade VII is a continuation\nand review of Grade VI with the classification of nouns and pronouns, and the inflections of nouns.\n\nGrade VII comprises the completion of the remaining phases of grammar which includes the inflection of pronouns, the classification and inflection of the remaining parts of speech, the parsing of each, the rules of syntax, the rules of punctuation and then the review of the complete text.\n\nIn teaching grammar the use of the text book should be practically eliminated even in the advanced grades. To obtain results each individual grammar lesson must be taught from the blackboard, and the grades must work exercises on grammar days so that the teacher may determine if they understand the work accomplished.\n\nThe great difficulty in teaching\nGrammar to Indian children is, that their knowledge of English does not enable them to enlarge on definitions, and after accomplishing a certain section they cannot connect it with the previous lesson.\n\nThe important factor in successful grammar teaching is the constant reviewing of work done in previous grades.\n\nThere are many phases of grammar teaching which the teacher should like to cover more thoroughly, but the allotted time for grammar on the time table does not permit extensive work.\n\nThis is my personal opinion in teaching this subject, but other teachers may vary in their ideas according to the ability of their pupils.\n\nNow I should be glad to receive any suggestions from your inspectors.\nand my fellow teachers and my composition is open for criticism.\n\nThank you.\nSupervision of the Play ground\nand\nGroup Games.\n\nWhen asked to write a paper for this teachers' convention, I was delighted to learn that the subject of my paper was \"Supervision of the Play ground and Group Games,\" for on the play-ground I first knew my pupils as they really are, there where we became real friends and there where I obtained knowledge regarding their real tempers, dispositions and manners which has helped me to encourage what is right and discourage what is wrong or, in other words, in the moulding of moral character. This has been one of my greatest problems and one that required and still requires a great amount of study and work to make a success of. We teachers who are familiar with the Indians know it is a very easy matter to get the Indian child to play because it is their nature to be more at home in the open and up until the time they begin school restraint is unknown to them.\n\nWe have from thirty to forty minutes per day devoted to recreation and this time should be spent in recreation by both\nboth teacher and pupils not in neglected homework, duly prepared lessons and seat work. This time although short is restful and needed to safeguard the health of the pupils.\n\nThe Indian children very seldom leave the Reserve or have opportunity of learning new games, therefore they require more teaching and supervision than the white children; for this reason it is expedient that the teacher be present in the play-ground with the pupils during recreation and that he or she takes part in the games. This also eliminates arguing, quarreling etc., which, at times, takes place on the unsupervised play-ground.\n\nThe grouping of pupils for the different games is an easy matter in a large school but a difficult one in the smaller school where the individual teacher has to select a game which will be suitable to pupils of all ages, as most games require a certain number of pupils of the same or nearly about the same age, so it becomes necessary for the teacher to comprise a number of games to suit her school. The wider knowledge the teacher has of these games and the better she adopts\nthem to the conditions which obtain,\nthe more valuable will be the effects\nof the games.\n\nOur Syllabus of Physical Training\nsuggests that when choosing a game\nthe age, ability and physique of the\nplayers should be considered. Children\nmay be divided into three age-groups,\nnamely, those from 5-7, those from 8-10\nand those of 11 years of age and upward.\nFirst we will consider out-of-door\ngames. In the first group from 5-7, the\ngames should be very simple. Easy\ngames such as running, jumping and\nchasing are advised. In the running\ngames we are familiar with, Hide and\nSeek, Fox and Geese, Fill the Gap,\nDrop the Handkerchief and Races. In\nthe chasing games we have Cat and\nMouse, Sheep, Sheep, Come Home, Chasing\nthe Squirrel, etc. The jumping games\nfor this group must be very simple\nsuch as imitating the nursery rhymes,\nfor example, the little rhyme which con-\ntains the words, \"The cow jumped over the\nmoon.\"\nMany little song games are very much appreciated. The little rhymes being learned on Friday afternoons. Included in these games are, Little Sally Walker, London Bridge is Falling Down and Huts in May.\n\nIn the second group we use games of a more advanced and difficult form than the first. Among these games we have, Hop Scotch, Tag, Dodge, Blind Mans Buff, Jack-in-the-Dark and Catch.\n\nIn the third group the games we play are Soft Ball, Football Kicking, Leap Frog, Squat, Tug-o-War, Follow My Leader, etc. The favorite game is Soft Ball and for this the Indian team on the Reserve permits us the use of their bat, ball, gloves etc. We have also a football which is used in the kicking games.\n\nThe favorite winter games are skiing and coasting and to this end we have obtained permission to use the hill adjacent to the school grounds. On these occasions the teacher is\nalways present.\n\nWhen weather conditions will not permit play on the playground, there are many games which can be played in the school-room and which the children like to play almost as well as the outdoor games. Some of these are, Guessing Games, Kite, Jacks, Hide the Butter, Marbles etc. There are also Jigsaw Letters and Maps which can be obtained by the teacher at a very slight cost and are educative as well as amusing. The ever popular cross-word puzzle, if not too difficult is enjoyed by the Indian child. This tends to widen the pupil's knowledge of the English language and promotes the use of the dictionary.\n\nIn the lower grades physical exercises must be very simple and exercise games are easily taught. This one I have found very interesting and instructive in forming correct walking and standing positions also in teaching the pupil alertness. The pupils are\nstanding in four rows. Each pupil in each row is numbered from the front back, beginning with number one to the last pupil. The rows are numbered 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th. Each pupil standing in front is given a piece of chalk. Assume that the pupils have come to the proper standing position, the teacher commands that row No. 2 lead in the walking game, followed by row No. 1, then No. 3 and lastly No. 4. When the command is given, the first child in row No. 2 comes forward to the board in proper walking position, performs the required exercise (which may be one such as the writing of a simple word) turns properly, walks back to his place, turns again so that he will be facing the front, passes his chalk backward over his right shoulder to No. 2 in his line, who repeats the exercise and so on to the end. Any pupil who does not keep his position is out of the game and takes his seat. Another exercise I like very much is \"Kelley says.\"\nOne point that should be stressed is the speaking of the English language on the playground, as the pupils tend to use their own language. Some slight punishment such as suspension from the game for a short period or silence for a few minutes will help to overcome this.\n\nI have found the educational magazines very helpful in this work, especially The Canadian Teacher, Toronto and Educational Review, Moncton. Much desired information can be obtained in the Syllabus of Physical Training which is in the hands of every teacher.\n\nFollowing along these lines and also by soliciting the opinions of teachers who have wider experience in schoolwork than myself, I have rarely had extreme difficulty in controlling my playground or in having the pupils consider play a monotony.\n\nEstelle M. O'Brien\nKingsclear Indian Day School\nKingsclear\nN.B.\nWays and Means of Obtaining the Cooperation of the Indian Parents.\n\nDomestic Science is home-made knowledge arranged or classified with reference to general truths or laws and shown to be correct by accurate observation and thinking. This kind of work to the Indians is a pleasure and really their natural kind of work.\n\nI shall briefly give some ways and means of getting the cooperation of the Indian Parents in my work.\n\n1. By making friends with the Indians. They being of a very sensitive nature are easily hurt; therefore, we must be watchful lest we do or say something which will hurt their feelings. We should never be so rushed that we have not time to speak to them when we meet them. Other than our monthly visit we should visit them frequently especially in cases of illness, death or in fact whenever requested for any reason. Treat them fairly; show no favoritism; give\npraise where praise is due; encourage every effort, however small. We must be always ready to help them showing an interest in anything they are doing. In this way we not only make friends with the Indians, but gain their goodwill, confidence, love and respect.\n\n2. Working up some competition among them. Some of the Indian parents take great pride in sending their children to school both neat and clean. Others do not. To the latter I remark that such a family of children look so neat and clean. This usually results in an improvement in the appearance of these families.\n\n3. Example. Some of the boys were fortunate enough to be able to buy white knickers for the ball team. Others were not. To one Indian woman I suggested making them from bleached flour bags. Very soon I noticed several pairs of these knickers on the Reserve.\n\n4. Through the pupils. For example\nthe Indian parent allows the child to do very much as he wishes. Therefore the child can convince the parent where it would be impossible for the outsider to do so. On the other hand the child more readily absorbs new ideas which he will carry to his parent and makes it easier for the teacher to convince in cases where it is necessary to do so as in case of inoculation.\n\nI have not meant to imply that these are the only methods by which we may gain the cooperation of the Indians but I have found these ways and means useful in obtaining the end which I strive for.\n\nEstelle M. O'Brien\nInspector Day School,\nKingsclear\nN.B.\nRev. Father, Reverend Sisters,\nMr. Chapman and fellow teachers,\n\nThe topic on which I have been asked to write is \"Domestic Science where the teacher is also Field Matron.\"\n\nThe title Domestic Science is the name given to the study of Home Economics or Home-Making.\n\nThis is the oldest and best-known profession the world has ever known.\n\nOne of the greatest resources of the teacher and Field Matron is the ability to meet all the conditions and emergencies which will confront her in the Indian home, gracefully and efficiently.\n\nThe duties of the teacher as an assistant house-maker comprise:\n\nFirst, aiding the house-wife in home economics, especially the branches of cooking and sewing;\n\nSecond, the home-life and the study of each individual pupil;\n\nThird, the developing of better habits of living; and fourth,\n\nFirst aid.\n\nHer business is to serve the Indian people safely and well.\n\nDomestic Science in the average Indian home is neglected and over-looked, and the teacher must endeavor by visiting the individual homes at least once each month.\nto carry out her miscellaneous duties, to the best of her ability.\n\nThe teacher's success depends on the circumstances and conditions of the home.\n\nThe home, the school, and the business world are important educational factors; one cannot exist without the help of the other.\n\nThe higher the standard of the home, the greater will be the efficiency of the pupils in the school.\n\nSince the home and school are so closely related, I shall outline briefly the Domestic Science Course as conducted in the school.\n\nThe period of time allotted for this course is so brief that only a limited amount of work can be accomplished.\n\nDomestic Science is not applicable to lower grade pupils and in the higher grades its application is limited because the home training of the pupils does not furnish a basis for this work.\n\nIn the school Domestic Science is conducted under the following headings, namely:\n\n1. Sewing\n2. Patching\n3. Stitching\n4. Cutting Lessons\n5. Lectures\n6. Quilting\n7. Making Mats\n8. Miscellaneous Work\nThe principal arts of the home are cooking and sewing. Sewing is connected with the furnishing of the home and the clothing of the children. Hand sewing should be taken up first, and the student should become familiar with all the stitches used in plain sewing, for basting, hemming, etc.\n\nA suggested list for the sewing course includes the making of towels, holders, aprons, underwear, pillow cases, handkerchiefs, shirts and dresses.\n\nThin materials should be used. The pupils should also be taught the use of the sewing machine, if one has been provided for the school.\n\nKnitting is also an essential factor in the course, and each pupil should be able to make stockings, mittens, scarfs and sweaters.\n\nLectures are essential from the view point of health. Cooking classes teach the child how to prepare nourishing foods, but few schools are equipped with the necessary cooking apparatus. Knitting and knitting mats are not very practical.\nFor Indian children, however,\nthis work may be carried on\non a small scale, by using\npieces of left-over material\nfrom sewing, etc.\n\nThe work which I have\nalways considered the most\nimportant in the Domestic\nScience Course is Patching;\nevery child from its earliest\nschool days should be taught\nthe value and care of their\nclothing, and how to repair\nworn-out materials properly;\nthe teacher should remember\nthat this is one of the factors\nwhich helps the child to attend\nschool regularly, by having\nnecessary clothing.\n\nThe most important points\noccupy the whole of the allotted\nperiod for Domestic Science,\nand if the teacher has a\nfew minutes at her disposal,\nat the close of the period,\nshe usually takes time for\nmiscellaneous items, which\narise from time to time.\n\nThe subject of Home\nEconomics, as taught in\nthe school to Indian pupils,\nand the duties of the\nteacher, as Chief Matron,\nare subjects which afford a\ngreat field for enlargement.\nbut would take up too much time, if gone into detail.\n\nTherefore I have touched briefly on these general points which I have experimented with and which I consider important.\n\nI shall now terminate with a little advice, which I have learned from actual experience, which is, when assuming your position as Field Master, do not criticize the existing conditions in any home; if you do a second visit will not be welcomed, or any further advice appreciated. Rather endeavor to alter habits, and make corrections by example and friendly advice; do not use harshness.\n\nI should now apprise the new points of these facts.\n\nI thank you.\n\nIrene Fitzgerald. (Teacher)\nEel Ground Indian Day School.\nI.\n\nReverend Fathers, Reverend Sisters,\nMy Chairman and Fellow Teachers,\n\nI have been requested to compose\na paper on \"Making a Workable\nTime-Table for an Indian School.\"\n\nIn the preparation of a practical\nIndian school time-table, the teacher\nshould comply with the same basic\nprinciples, which are used in making\nEnglish school time-tables, as the\ncurricula are similar.\n\nThere are four definite points to\nbe carefully considered before beginning\nthe outlining of a time-table,\nwhich are, the following: first, the\nnumber and names of the title\nsubjects to be taught; secondly, the\ndivision of these subjects according\nto the five school days; thirdly,\nthe amount of time to be allotted\nto each subject and fourthly, the\ndivision of that specified time\namong the eight grades.\n\nRegarding these points just\nmentioned, the first one, namely, the\nnumber and names of the title\nsubjects to be taught, is applicable\nto all Indian schools, while the\nsecond, third and fourth, namely,\nthe division of those subjects according\nto the five school days, the amount\nof time to be allotted to each subject,\nand the division of that specified\ntime among the eight grades, respectively,\nwill each vary according to the prevailing conditions of each particular school.\n\nI shall now enlarge on each point individually.\n\nFirst, the number and names of the title subjects to be taught; concerning the curriculum, there are twelve subjects; namely, Religion, Mathematics, Reading, Geography, Grammar, Hygiene, History, Latin, Nature Study, Writing, Drawing and Domestic Science.\n\nSecond, the division of these subjects according to the five school days either of two methods may be used in arranging this heading; for example, some teachers prefer the system of teaching daily all the subjects on the curriculum, whereas others prefer teaching a certain number of subjects on particular days and the remaining ones on alternate days.\n\nPersonally, I have experimented with both systems, and have found that it is practically impossible for one instructor to teach twelve subjects daily to eight grades; in the first place, time will not permit and in the second place, the average Indian child has not the ability to grasp such an amount of material each day.\n\nConsequently, I have used the second system of grouping the subjects,\nfor certain days, and therefore the\ntimetable time-table, which I am\npresenting to you is made according\nto my practical experience.\n\nI feel that all Indian school\nteachers must agree with me that,\nthe work outlined on a time-table,\nof twelve subjects daily, with all\nthe grammar grades, could not\npossibly be accomplished.\n\nThe only way by which this\nsystem could be worked successfully,\nwould be in a school with more\nthan one teacher, or where a single\nteacher did not have all the right tools.\nBut since I am to make a whole\ntime table for Grades I-III inclusive,\nthe latter system of combining certain\nsubjects must be used.\n\nThird, the amount of time to\nbe allotted to each subject.\nThe school day is divided into\nseven hours, from which one and\none-half hours are deducted for\nRecess periods and twenty-five\nminutes are deducted for\nnecessary exercises, aside from\nthe curriculum; thus leaving\napproximately five hours for\nthe school subjects on the curriculum.\n\nIt is not necessary that any\nsubject should have a definite\nposition on the time-table; although\neducators state \"that Mathematics\nshould be taught in the early morning session while the child's reasoning abilities are fresh.\n\nHowever, the teacher may arrange the subjects according to his judgment.\n\nThe most important point on a time table is the division of the actual teaching hours among the subjects, while the teacher desires to take up daily, so that from experience she may determine the number of minutes necessary to cover the work of a certain subject with the grades which are taking that subject.\n\nFourth, the division of the specified time among the eight grades. There can be no special time allotted to a particular grade, as the time necessary for any lesson varies each day, according to the number of pupils in the class, their ability and the nature of the lesson. The ability of these pupils compels the teacher to use the time to best advantage, and to take opportunity of any short-notice lesson in almost every period of the day; a few minutes of the allotted time must be used in assisting the pupils with their seat-work, black-board illustration, discipline, etc.\nFollowing is my outline of a workable time-table for an Indian School, Grades I-VIII, scientifically which from actual experience has proved successful.\n\n**Morning Session: 9 A.M. - 12 A.M.**\n\n| Time | Activity                          | Notes       |\n|------|----------------------------------|-------------|\n| 9-9.10 | Morning Exercises and Roll Call | Daily       |\n| 9.10-10.10 | Religious Instruction            | Daily       |\n| 10.10-10.45 | Physical Drill                  | Daily       |\n| 10.45-11   | Mathematics                      | Daily       |\n| 11-12 A.M. | Games and Ventilation            | Daily       |\n| 12-1 P.M. | Noon recess (1 hour)             |             |\n\n**Afternoon Session: 1 P.M. - 4 P.M.**\n\n| Time | Activity                          | Notes       |\n|------|----------------------------------|-------------|\n| 1-1.05 | Roll Call                        | Daily       |\n| 1.05-1.25 | Reading                          | Daily       |\n| 1.25-1.30 | Physical Drill                   | Daily       |\n| 1.30-2   | Geography                         | Mon., Tues., and Thurs. |\n| 2-2.25   | British History                   | Mon., Tues., and Thurs. |\n|         | Canadian History                  |             |\n| 2.25-2.45 | Latin                            | Mon. and Tues. |\n| 2.45-3   | Physiology                        | Tues. and Thurs. |\n|         | Water Study                       | Friday      |\n|         | Games and Ventilation             | Daily       |\n| 3-3.30   | Writing                           | Mon. and Tues. |\n|         | Drawing                           | Tues. and Thurs. |\n| 3.30-4   | Domestic Science                  | Daily, with 60 min.

School Files. (RG 10, Volume 6032, File 150-37, Part 1)\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter above quoted.\n\nI note that you say in reference to the holidays that are to be granted at Christmas time that this is a special case, and will have to be dealt with individually. I would point out that it has been the practice at the Qu'Appelle and File Hills schools in the past to let all or nearly all the children go home for ten days or two weeks at Christmas time, in addition to the summer holidays. When I read your contract I noticed that nothing was said about Christmas holidays and I drew your attention to this as it would never do to let two schools so close together have different policies with regard to Christmas holidays. The parents, especially the pagans, would send their children to the schools that gave the most holidays. Indians do dearly love to get their children out of school for a visit, and it was for this very reason that I wanted both schools to be dealt with exactly alike, and not dealt with separately after representation had been made.\n\nIf\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIf it is the intention to keep the children at the school during Xmas the parents should be advised.\n\nIt may have seemed superfluous to write specially to doctors advising them to exercise care in admitting children, in view of the fact that you have printed forms for them to fill out, but I assure you that a good deal of the work of admitting children gets to be a matter of form and a special letter would have done good.\n\nWith reference to the matter of holidays for Principals you are labouring under an entirely wrong impression if you think all Principals look to the Department as the proper source to obtain leave. You ask me to quote any cases where this is not done. I might quote you a case right at home. The Principal of the File Hills school told me that she was going away for six weeks or so as she had received her leave either from the Committee in Winnipeg or Toronto. I know for a fact that former Principals of this school have gone away for lengthy periods without consulting the Department. One of the main causes for the non-success of the Regina school, was that the last two Principals spent too much of their time away from the school and not on Indian business.\n\nI think if you wish to know other cases where Principals go away or leave without your authority, I could find them, but is this necessary?\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI would ask to be advised what the instructions of the Department are in regard to granting summer vacation to pupils attending Boarding Schools throughout the West. From time to time I receive requests for pupils to be allowed out of School for various periods throughout the year, and it seems to me that if it were established that the pupils were to receive at least one month's vacation in the summer time, there would be no excuse for letting the children off from time to time throughout the year.\n\nIn the interests of the children I would strongly urge that this recommendation be given effect and that Principals of Schools be instructed to grant the pupils this vacation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 26, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the summer vacation allowed pupils attending the boarding schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that one month (31 days) summer holidays are allowed with grant to the pupils in all residential schools. These holidays should be taken between the first day of July and the first day of October in each year, unless some other course is expressly sanctioned by the Department. During vacation the pupils may, in the discretion of the principal, be permitted to visit their homes but the Department will not pay any part of the cost of transportation, either going or returning. The grant will not be allowed for any days leave of absence in excess of 31 days, unless authority is granted for special reasons. The principals of the residential schools should be thoroughly aware of the Department's requirements regarding the granting of holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nM. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nINFORMATION OFFICE,\n402 Holden Building,\nVancouver, B.C., Feb. 23, 1953.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nASST. DEPUTY & SECRETARY,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada,\n\nSir:\n\nThis acknowledges the receipt of your letter of February the 16th in which you state that Dr. Westgate, acting General Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, requests that the holiday period for the Alert Bay Residential Schools be extended from four weeks to six weeks each year.\n\nIt will be just as well to recognize that if the request is granted in this case it will, of necessity, lead to a change of policy in this matter by the Indian Department. For I feel certain that similar requests will come from many of our Residential Schools.\n\nIt would be well, too, to remember that according to Indian Day School Regulations, the pupils of Day Schools have two months' holidays. I think that the arguments in favour of two months' holidays for our day school are equally cogent when applied to Residential Schools.\n\nThere is a tendency in educational circles to increase the holiday time. July and August are holidays in all the public schools of British Columbia. From a health point of view it is generally recognized that pupils are better out of the\nclass-room during the period of extremely hot weather.\n\nThe objective of all our schools is to develop the moral, mental, and physical powers of the child. Therefore I am prepared to sanction any change that will help the schools to attain that objective.\n\nThere is also another phase of the question. At the present time many pupils do not return promptly and the result is that the quarter ending September 30th generally shows a marked decrease in the financial results. This leads to difficulty in financing the schools.\n\nOn the whole, I am in favour of the holiday period being extended to six weeks with full grant. Practically, it takes two weeks to get the pupils back to school and organized for work. If the policy of six weeks' holidays were adopted then punctuality on the part of the pupils should be insisted upon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) R. H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nOttawa, March 3, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the holiday period at Indian residential schools. I have noted the reasons advanced by you why it might be desirable to arrange for a 6 weeks' period.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department cannot change its regulations in this connection, at the present time. Some schools in certain parts of Canada are so situated that it is impracticable to allow the children to go home in the summer time. At these schools, arrangements are made for summer camps and other outings, always under the supervision of members of the staff. Further, I am of the opinion that there will always be delinquent pupils who fail to return promptly at the expiration of a holiday period, and a lengthening of the vacation would result in a general disorganizing of institutional routine, for a period every summer of at least two months. Most of our institutions are crowded to the limit of their capacity, and no opportunity must be lost to educate and prepare for Christian citizenship the youth of the present generation.\n\nIf it is found, at any school, that the general health and stamina of the children are not what they should be, special arrangements can be made upon application to the Department for outdoor activities, as a substitution for classroom work for those weeks in the summer that are not in the vacation period. The Department believes that the children enrolled at Indian residential schools should be, for 11 months of the year, under the discipline, care and civilizing influence of the staff of workers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n402 Holden Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOf late, I have been requested from many quarters to write you as to the duration of the Summer holidays. The regulations of the Department call for a month while some Principals allow six weeks and others even two months, with the result that difficulties arise among the Indians, who, in several cases, refuse to send their children to School when the old ruling is adhered to by the latter.\n\nIn my estimation only a month's time is rather short for the Summer holidays as it practically gives no rest to the Principals or the members of the Staff. I think that if I were suggesting six weeks as a new ruling for the Summer holidays, this request would be approved by all those concerned.\n\nWould you kindly consider the reasonableness of my request and the opportunity of granting it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Eyre.\nMarch 31, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nAt different times, representations have been made to the Department that it would be advisable to increase the annual vacation at Indian residential schools to six weeks. Of late years, Mr. Inspector Cairns has urged a longer holiday and Rev. Father Guy, on behalf of R.C. principals, has made a similar request.\n\nThe reasons advanced are as follows:\n\n1. In extremely warm weather it is better for the health of the pupils if they are without classroom activity and without the restraint which is so irksome to the Indian child. (there is a general tendency to increase the duration of the summer vacation at educational institutions).\n\n2. A certain number of the staff have to be on duty at Indian residential schools at all times. If the vacation of the pupils is limited to one month, some of the officers do not receive any more than two weeks' holiday.\n\n3. One or two exceptions have been made and a holiday longer than 31 days is taken. Father Guy points out that some principals allow six weeks or more, without the permission of the Department, and have been doing it for many years.\n\nI wish to recommend an annual vacation of 45 days instead of 31 days as formerly. This will be full 6 weeks plus a Sunday at the end of the holiday. With your approval I will draft a circular letter to the Church and Department workers interested. I propose to send a copy to two or three representative principals and to Commissioner Graham and Inspector Cairns, with the request that they make suggestions. Then a circular would be directed to all principals and agents, after having been approved by yourself.\n\nRussell D. Fraser\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nTo Church Authorities, Principals and Department Representatives:\n\nThe Department has decided to allow 45-60 days' annual leave with grant for pupils at Indian residential schools. This holiday may be taken at the discretion of the principal, some time during the September quarter. Other dates may be fixed only when specifically approved by the Department. The practice of giving pupils leave from Indian residential schools at Christmas is considered unwise and in future grant will not be allowed if holidays at this season are given without permission.\n\nOrphans and children of destitute parents should not be allowed summer holidays, unless satisfactory arrangements can be made for their care when away from school. Principals should not allow annual leave to children who have had to be brought in under escort upon the expiration of summer vacations and may refuse holidays to those pupils who have truanted during the academic year. Extreme care should be exercised in the case of pupils whose homes are distant from the school. Unless special safeguards concerning their return can be taken, holidays should not be granted.\n\nWhen the September quarter return is being prepared, the dates of the annual leave should be clearly indicated and grant for the full quarter may be requested for all pupils who have been away from the school no longer than 43 days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nJupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, April 7, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has decided to allow six weeks' annual holiday with grant for pupils at Indian residential schools and it is proposed to circularize the Church and Department officials concerned.

As you will know this is a matter of very considerable importance to our Society, in connection with the maintenance of many of the schools under its control, and for this reason I shall be glad to know if any appropriation will be set apart by your Department to meet any expenses which may be incurred in this connection at the schools where the children are recruited, as at Elkhorn, not to mention others, from remote distances,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. B. R. Westgate,\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTRW/JF\nOttawa, April 24, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the proposed circular concerning holidays with grant at Indian residential schools. I have to inform you, in reply, that reference to travelling expenses of children going on holiday was omitted with intent, because of the fact that a general ruling would be impossible. Each school's case in this connection must be decided on its own merits. The appropriation for travelling costs is so limited, that extreme care must be exercised. The Indian Act gives us power to pay travelling expenses, but in no case does the Department give out authority for an indefinite period.\n\nWith particular reference to expenses at the Elkhorn School, I have to request that you will ask the Principal to make a recommendation to the Department as to what children should be allowed home for the annual leave. He should estimate the cost for each reserve group and should intimate what are the probabilities of having the parents meet the transportation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., APRIL 18TH, 1925.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, No. 150-37, informing me that the Department had decided to allow six weeks' annual leave with grant to Indian pupils in residential schools.\n\nYou have asked me to examine the draft of the proposed circular and suggest any changes that might occur to me. I may say that the circular seems quite satisfactory, but there are two suggestions I should like to make. It often happens that requests are made by Indian parents to have their children home at a time when they can be of service to them in carrying on haying or harvesting operations, and we have in the past requested the Principals not to let the children go out at the regular holiday period, but to hold them until the Agents make a recommendation as to when they should leave. If, before granting vacation to the older pupils, the Principals would communicate with the Agents at points where these children are likely to be needed for work after the end of September, their holidays could be timed accordingly.\n\nMy second suggestion is that any holidays over and above the annual leave should be given on the recommendation of the Indian Agent by this office. The need for such emergency holidays sometimes arises on account of sickness in the home, and the necessary authority could be obtained without delay by telephoning to this office.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 28, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-11B of the 18th instant, with reference to the proposed circular concerning six weeks' annual leave with grant to pupils at Indian residential schools. I am pleased to have your suggestions and will make changes in the present draft, giving local representatives authority to make decisions in special cases and emergencies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter to you of the 18th instant, on the matter of annual holidays for Indian pupils in residential schools, I may point out that I have had considerable difficulty in persuading Agents not to ask for the children to be let out of school for short periods on the slightest excuse. Sometimes an Indian woman will be sick with perhaps a headache or some other minor complaint, and the first thing she does is to go to the Agent and ask that he give a recommendation that her child be sent home, and I am sorry to say that some of our agents are prone to do this.\n\nI gave instructions to various Agents, in this district particularly, that no special leave of absence was to be granted without first taking the matter up with this office. I was then in a position to get full particulars as to why these children should leave school to go home, and in most cases, after investigation I found that it was quite unnecessary.\n\nPerhaps it would be well to embody in this Circular that you are sending out, that in the matter of special leave, the Agents should take it up with this office. That is the way the matter stands now, and I think it is in the interest of the Department and the work that it should be so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, May 4, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-11B of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the proposed circular concerning six weeks' annual leave with grant to pupils at Indian residential schools. You will understand that this circular is for schools in all parts of Canada, and, as I indicated in my letter of the 26th ultimo, there will be a general statement only concerning decisions by local representatives.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Holidays should be taken consecutively, at the discretion of the principal, during the September quarter. Other dates may be fixed only when specifically approved by the Department.

At no school should week-end holidays be granted.\n\nRequests for special or emergency leave for pupils, who are urgently needed at home, should be made to the Indian agent, who will give approval only when he considers such leave absolutely necessary and after he has the concurrence of the principal, who should understand that grant will be discontinued. Special leave in the case of any pupil should be reported to the Department by the Indian agent. If the medical officer advises that a pupil be sent home for a period because of illness, the Indian agent should be informed and the principal, when preparing the quarterly return, should not apply for grant for those days the pupil was out of school.\n\nOrphans and children of destitute parents should not be allowed summer holidays, unless satisfactory arrangements can be made for their care when away from school. Principals should not allow annual leave to children who have had to be brought in under escort upon the expiration of former vacations and may refuse holidays to those pupils who have truanted during the academic year. Extreme care should be exercised in the case of pupils whose homes are distant from the school. Unless special safeguards concerning their return can be taken, holidays should not be granted.\n\nWhen the September quarter return is being prepared, the dates of the annual leave should be clearly indicated and grant for the full quarter may be requested for all pupils who have been away from the school no longer than 43 days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have read over carefully your personal letter to Principals of school, dated 20th inst., No. 150-37, and fear it is going to cause us endless trouble if enforced to the letter.\n\nThe parents of the great majority of our pupils are very anxious to have their help at home during the greater part of July and August. Many of them really need the help. We could not get our teachers to continue after July 1st, or begin before September 1st, the regular school year. If pupils were forced to return here the middle of August the parents would believe we wanted them to work on our farm instead of theirs, and it would make a tempest.\n\nOur practice is to give some latitude covering these two months. Pupils who are needed at home are allowed the full time. Those who have no homes, or are not needed at home are paid a reasonable wage for time here. It is working splendidly, and the school about breaks even in the matter.\n\nI sincerely hope you will give us a little latitude as heretofore, and thus keep peace in the family.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, May 30, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, with reference to holidays at the Mt.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., June 1, 1925.\n\nYour File 150-37.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your circular letter of the 20th ultimo referring to holidays at residential schools, and beg to say that I am fully in accord with the instructions you have laid down, except in one case.\n\nIn the last sentence of your first paragraph you state that \"At no school should week-end holidays be granted\" and I should like to have a word from you as to just how this is to be interpreted. As you no doubt know, a number of our residential schools are in very close proximity to Indian Reserves from which a considerable number of the pupils have been admitted, and the practice in the past has generally been that pupils from such reserves are allowed to go to their homes on Friday evening and remain there until Sunday evening.\n\nWhat I should like to know from you is whether your instructions with regard to week-end holidays are to apply in such cases. Kindly let me hear from you at your earliest possible convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 8, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your 100-11B of April 27th, last, relative to official circular of the 20th ultimo concerning holidays for pupils at Indian residential schools, I note that agents in the Prairie Provinces have been requested to allow special leave of absence without first taking the matter up with your office. Do you consider it advisable for me to circularise the Indian agents in the Prairie Provinces, relative to referring special leave to your office, or will such action be unnecessary in view of earlier instructions you may have given?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, June 8, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/5201 of the first instant, with reference to the circular of the 20th ultimo relative to holidays at Indian residential schools. It is the intention that the last sentence of the first paragraph should be interpreted literally. At most schools it has been found quite inadvisable to allow pupils home for week-ends. There are occasional difficulties in the matter of the return of pupils. Far too often, pupils returning from even brief holidays bring body vermin into the institution. Further, the breaking of the routine itself often outweighs the value of the change for the pupil.\n\nIt is advisable, of course, to make exceptions in the application of any regulation laid down for many institutions of different types and in various localities. If, after you have discussed this question with any school principal and the local agent, you are satisfied that an exception should be made, your recommendation will receive much weight.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

SCOTT\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nSir,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your circular of May 20th, 1925, No. 150-37.\n\nI beg to point out that it will be difficult to follow your instructions in this Agency.\n\nThe parents of the children attending the schools under my jurisdiction are practically, without exception, uneducated, and they fail, as yet, to understand the great benefit to the children of being in school for the longest possible periods during the year. In fact, a very large percentage of them firmly believe that the children are there for the sole purpose of receiving religious instruction while being well cared for physically.\n\nThe parents have been accustomed, most of them for some years, to having their children with them, practically the whole summer, and it will require a great deal of explaining by the Principals of the schools to the children and to their parents; and by myself, to the entire Bands; why the children are to be compelled to shorten their vacations.\n\nWithout\n\nRussell T. Farrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education, Ottawa\nWithout this explanation being made it will require considerable coercion to enforce the new regulations, which will cause more or less friction.\n\nIt is impossible for me to meet the outlying Bands except at Treaty time, and for the majority this will not be until well on in the summer, or at the end of it.\n\nI would suggest that with the exception of the three Residential Schools of St. Bernard's, St. Bruno's and St. Peter's, which you know are at, or near, Grouard, that the new regulations be not enforced until the coming school year ends.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHarold Laniel\nOttawa, June 10, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to our circular of May 20th, last, regarding the length of holidays for which grant will be allowed to residential schools.\n\nAs you are aware, holidays are usually taken during the period July 1st to September 30th, and, when principals are preparing their returns for the September quarter, grant for each pupil should be requested for the number of days such pupil has been in the school during that quarter, plus 43 days holidays for which grant is allowed.\n\nI note from your letter that at some of the schools in your agency it is found necessary to allow holidays for practically the whole summer. In the case of such schools, the principals should take care when preparing their returns not to request grant for the whole period during which a pupil is absent from the school but simply for 43 days in each case. When a pupil is absent longer than 43 days, a note should appear on the return showing the dates between which such pupil was absent from the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nBupt. of Indian Education.\n\nHarold Laird, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nGrouard,\nALTA.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of Circular No.150-37 of May 20th last re absences from Boarding and Residential schools.\n\nI am pleased that a definite statement has been made, and that the school authorities have been notified. The Principal of one of our schools told me some weeks ago that he had been informed that he should be allowed the grant for pupils when absent from the school and in the hospital here. I felt sure that his information was incorrect. The extension of the vacation allowed is also an improvement.\n\nI trust that the arrangement allowed our Northern schools by Dept.

We had succeeded in persuading the Indians to do without the Easter holidays this year, and we had the promise of a meeting on two Reserves to discuss the question of Christmas holidays. But the outlook was not very hopeful, for this year at least. We were always met with the objection, which we could not answer, that other schools were giving Christmas holidays. Then the regulations arrived. I just announced at their Annual Picnic that there would be no Christmas holidays at any of the schools. We may have a little difficulty enforcing it the first year, but I have no doubt now that it can be done. One old Chief said when I told him about it, \"Is that Government? A little later, after he had discussed it with another Indian, he said, \"Is that Ottawa?\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.J.

Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 24, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Circular 150-37, dated May 20, 1925, I have to suggest that principals of Indian residential schools and Indian agents in the Prairie provinces keep in mind the desirability of having older pupils, particularly boys, take their annual leave during harvesting, fishing or trapping seasons. This will permit the pupil to be of assistance when most needed at home and will obviate the necessity of special leave, during which time grant is discontinued. Attention to this matter will be beneficial to both Indian communities and Indian residential schools.\n\nFurther, it is considered advisable that requests for special or emergency leave, mentioned in the second paragraph of the earlier circular, should be referred to the Indian Commissioner at Regina. He will give the required authority if it is considered necessary.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nWhen Rev. Father Guy visited the Department today he mentioned that during the past summer Mr. Agent Waddy discussed with him the question of changing the time of the holidays at certain of our Indian residential schools.\n\nMr. Waddy stated that owing to the conditions in the North Country, it would be preferable to allow the children home during the hunting and fishing season. If this were done the children would be able to assist their parents and receive instruction that would be valuable to them in the later years. The dates suggested as most suitable for holidays would be between March 15th and May 15th.\n\nThe schools probably affected, if the above arrangements were put into effect, would be as follows:\n\nCross Lake Residential\nMacKay #\nNorway House #\nBeauval #\nGuy #\nand probably some others.\n\nRev. Father Guy is communicating with the church authorities to ascertain their views on this matter and he will again bring the question to the Department's attention at a later date.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to request that I be supplied with a copy of Department Circular letter No.150-37, dated May 26th, under the heading \"To Church Authorities, Principals & Department Representatives.\"\n\nThe circular deals with the subject of children's holidays.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nStockholm Creek, Nov. 7th., 1923\n\nRussell L. Perrier,\nOttawa Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier:\n\nI convey to the Indians the substance of your letter re Christmas holidays. Since that time they have waited on me three times regarding the matter. On the last occasion they asked if I could not write Ottawa conveying their request for holidays.\n\nThey argued something like this, \"God gave us Christmas for a holiday and we want it for a holiday for our children. Ever since this building was put up, we have had a holiday at Christmas. It will be difficult to find children for this school if you do not allow them Christmas holidays.\"\n\nI hardly know what to do under the circumstances. I am conveying their request to you and will await your reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.J. Ross.\nOttawa, November 13, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to Christmas holidays at Indian residential schools. If you examine the Circular of May 20th, last, you will note that it reads in part as follows: \"The practice of giving pupils leave from Indian residential schools at Christmas is considered unwise and in future grant will not be allowed if holidays at this season are given without permission.\" You will note that this is not a regulation prohibiting holidays at Christmas. The Department considers leave at this season of the year should be cut to a minimum and proposes to allow no grant if holidays are taken.\n\nIf you feel it to be in the interests of the Round Lake Indian Residential School to allow certain pupils home for the Christmas season, you may do so; but it is understood that the quarterly returns will show what leave was taken and that there will be a resultant loss in per capita earnings. The Department realizes that any regulation laid down for institutions of different types and in various localities cannot be adhered to strictly. I consider Christmas holidays unwise in the great majority of cases and the best method to stop them is to cut off the grant when taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. R. J. Ross,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Indian Res. School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., Nov. 17th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to the Department's Circular Letter of the 20th of May last #150-37, addressed to Church Authorities, Principals and Department Representatives. I would inform the Department that a delegation of Indians from Crooked Lakes called on me today, asking if they could have their children out of the Round Lake School for Christmas Day and the day following.\n\nI think that their request is a most reasonable one. These people live on the reserve on which the school is situated, and to deprive them of the privilege of having their children with them on Christmas Day seems to me rather hard.\n\nI notice your Circular states that special leave can be granted. I hope you will see your way clear to authorize that children who are attending schools situated on the reserves where their parents live be granted leave of absence for Christmas Day, and also for New Year's Day, which is a big day with the Indians.\n\nI can understand the Department not wanting to allow children whose homes are at a distance from the school to travel on trains, stay on the reserve for a week or ten days and then have another train trip back to the school again, but it is an altogether different matter when the parents of the children live in close proximity to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 23, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-11 B of the 17th instant, with reference to a delegation from the Crooked Lake agency, which requested Christmas holidays for the pupils of the Round Lake Indian Residential School. You will note that circular letter of this file number of May 20th, last, reads in part as follows: \"The practice of giving pupils leave from Indian residential schools at Christmas is considered unwise and in future grant will not be allowed if holidays at this season are given without permission.\"\n\nYou will note that Christmas holidays are considered unwise, but that there is no regulation prohibiting them. Grant, however, will not be allowed if they are taken. The reason for this stipulation is the Department's wish to discourage Christmas holidays. In the first place, the season of the year is not suitable for travelling. Children have occasionally been returned to school insufficiently clad. Further, there are occasional difficulties in the matter of the return of pupils. Again, far too often pupils returning from even brief holidays bring body vermin into the institution. Lastly, the breaking of the routine itself often outweighs the value of the change for the pupil. I consider that schools on or contiguous to reserves should have a Christmas tree and concert, to which all parents and friends should be invited.\n\nThe Rev. Principal of the Round Lake Indian Residential School, on the 7th instant, wrote to the Department. I replied, in part, as follows: \"You will note that this is not a regulation prohibiting holidays at Christmas. The Department considers leave at this season of the year\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nshould be cut to a minimum and proposes to allow no grant if holidays are taken. If you feel it to be in the best interests of the Round Lake Indian Residential School to allow certain pupils home for the Christmas season, you may do so; but it is understood that the quarterly returns will show what leave was taken and that there will be a resultant loss in per capita earnings.\"\n\nThe Department realizes that any regulation laid down for institutions of different types and in various localities cannot be adhered to strictly. Christmas holidays at Indian residential schools are considered unwise in the great majority of cases and the best method to stop them is to cut off the grant when taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir:-\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant 150-37 with reference to the question of granting Christmas holidays to pupils of the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI was quite aware before I wrote you on this subject that the practice of giving holidays to children at this season of the year was not wise, but I thought this applied to children whose parents were living on reserves distant from the school, and where they would be absent at least ten days at Christmas. I consider it an altogether different matter when it comes to granting holidays to children whose homes are on the reserves where the school is situated, and it was cases of this kind that I brought to your notice, and asked that the request of the Indians be granted.\n\nI note that the Department has had some correspondence direct with the Rev. Principal of the Round Lake School with regard to this matter. I regret that the Principal did not take this matter up through the Indian Agent, so that he could take it up between the School and the Department. This is the practice that was followed years ago, and seems to me the only satisfactory way to carry on the business, especially when the Indian Agent has more dealings with the parents of the children than has the Principal. It seems to me that in the interests of discipline it would be better to follow the old system. I doubt whether the Indian Agent at Crooked Lake knows that anything has passed between the Department and the Principal regarding this matter of leave, and it does not seem the right course, for him to have to go to the Principal to find these things out, especially when he\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nhas charge of all matters pertaining to the reserves over which he has jurisdiction. If there is any difficulty in getting the children back to school, it will be the Agent who will have to be resorted to, and not the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, December 9, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-11B of the 2nd instant, with reference to granting Christmas holidays to the pupils at Indian residential schools. The correspondence which has passed between the Rev. Principal of the Round Lake Institution and the Department had reference to the general policy in this connection. If the regulations laid down in circular letter of May 20th, last, had been changed, or if any special authority had been given to the Round Lake School, the Agent would have been notified. I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Pugh, recapitulating the correspondence in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from the Indian agent referring to the Christmas holidays being denied our children attending school. We just wonder why has the Department taken such a move. We, poor Indians, think it is a crime to deprive us and our children of such joy and consolation. As we all know Christmas Day and New Year's day are above all home festivals, days of unity and charity in our Christian families. It is customary for all institutions such as Universities, Colleges, Academies and convents to grant holidays to their students at this season. Why should the Indians be denied the same privilege and happiness? Moreover, we understand that all such institutions as named above are not denied with the government grant during the Christmas holidays, why should our Residential School be deprived of the same favour?\n\nIt is not our intention to challenge the Department upon the enactment of such regulations, but we feel sorry not to be treated at par with the white people in this connection. We feel molested in our rights over our children and trust that our appeal will not go unanswered. May it please the Indian Department to adjust this matter for the good of all.\n\nSigned:\n\nChief Tom Desjardins\n\nHM Sam Atan\n\n$971.\n\nPovion on the other side.\n\nKindly reply to Head man.\n\nSam Fred Atan.\nBateel Pinace\nManitobapines\nPat moose\nGeorge Bruce\nHarvin Hongo\nWalligun\nJos.

You will please communicate with Sam Akan, to whom a reply was requested, informing him that the Department has received the petition, and explain as much of circular letter of May 20th, last, as you see fit.\n\nYou will note that this circular reads in part as follows: \u2014 \"The practice of giving pupils leave from Indian residential schools at Christmas is considered unwise; and, in future, grant will not be allowed if holidays at this season are given without permission.\" You will note that Christmas holidays are considered unwise, but there is no regulation prohibiting them. Grant, however, will not be allowed if they are taken. There is no objection to pupils going to their homes for the day if such a short visit is possible because of the nearness of their homes, but there are many reasons why a holiday of some days' duration is not advisable at the Christmas season. I consider that schools on or contiguous to Reserves should have a Christmas tree and concert, to which all parents and friends should be invited.\n\nCopies of this letter and copies of the general circular letter regarding holidays are enclosed herewith for the Rev. Principals of the Muscoseguan's and Gordon's Schools. Please see that they receive these copies immediately, and inform them that there is no regulation prohibiting Christmas holidays, but if such are taken, grant should not be requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. S. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant 150-37 with reference to granting Christmas holidays to pupils of Indian Residential Schools. I note that you have written to Mr. Indian Agent Pugh, recapitulating the correspondence that has taken place with regard to this matter.\n\nFor your information I may say that I am told by the Agent that the Chief has been to see him not less than three or four times during the past week, pressing to have the children home, and I am today in receipt of a long distance phone call from the Chief, asking what decision the department has come to with regard to the matter; I having told the delegation from Crooked Lakes when they visited me in Regina that the matter would be taken up with the Department and when I received an answer I would let them know.\n\nUp to the time of receiving your letter today the Indian Agent at Broadview knew nothing of what was transpiring between the Principal and the Department direct. I pointed out to the Department in a previous letter that this was altogether likely.\n\nMy own opinion is that these children on the reserve should be allowed to go home for the Christmas week, and that a corresponding number of days should be taken off their regular summer holidays. In that way no grant would be lost.\n\nIn speaking\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIn speaking to the Principal of the Round Lake School over the long distance telephone today he informs me that he is of the opinion that it would unsettle the Indians and cause a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst them if this request were not granted, and I am of the same opinion. I can imagine white parents living within a mile or two of a boarding school and not being granted the privilege of having their children home at Christmas time. In my opinion the cases are parallel; the Indian loves his child just as much as does the white man, and consideration should be given to him in matters of this kind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 402-11.\nAND\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nBlood Indian Agency.\n\nCardston, Alta. Sept 17th 1926\n\nSr,\n\nI beg to place before the Department, a matter pertaining to Circular No 150-37, dated May 20th 1925, which relates to Holidays at Residential Schools.\n\nA situation arises at this Agency as between the two schools in this regard. It appears that it is the practice of the St Paul's School to allow one Saturday a month to the children's parents to take the children home, and before the children came back to the St Mary's School, the Principal sent for me and placed this matter before me, and requested that I place the subject before the Department in order that whatever is the regulation, that it shall apply to each school, and that the Department be aware of the existing rule.\n\nIt would appear that the St Mary's School do not allow the Week end holiday, abiding by the Circular which was issued. The matter is presented to me in this light, that if one school is allowed to let the children out for a week end holiday, then it mitigates against recruiting for the school that does not, and friction is un-avoidable. I should be glad if the Department will advise on the point in question.\n\nIn regard to the returning of the pupils after the holidays this summer, I might add that considerable trouble is being had in getting some back. I have instructed the RCMP to notify parents, but owing to the fearful roads, slow progress is being made, but I will do all I can to get the schools back in shape, in regard to truant pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 24th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, referring to our circular of May 20th, 1925, regarding holidays at Residential Schools.\n\nThe last sentence in the first paragraph of the circular mentioned distinctly states that week-end holidays should not be granted. Please direct the attention of the Principal of the St. Paul's Residential School to the circular above mentioned. It is expected that he will carry out the instructions contained therein and by so doing the regulations of the Department will be enforced in both residential schools in the Blood Agency.\n\nI enclose two copies of our circular and you might hand one to the Principal of the St. Paul's School for his guidance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ.E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nIndian Educational Work\n\nOct. 1, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter, also enclosure dealing with the statutory holidays allowed by the Department. May I say in reply that these regulations have always been maintained. For some time past however, a slight departure has been attempted with an endeavour to follow out the policy indicated by the Department, namely to let the School stand as a mark of progressive methods both towards the pupils and parents. Situated as we are here in the midst of a thriving Indian farming population, with Indians possessing homes equal to their white brothers, we have made an effort to thrust responsibility on the responsible parents, also as a competitive system amongst the pupils, to allow the children to go home attended by their parents, on the first Saturday of each month, between the hours of nine to five o'clock in the afternoon. Such a plan has been found eminently successful, and has thus engendered confidence between School, pupil and parents.\n\nIn case of a stray absentee not returning at the allotted time, such practice was discontinued during the succeeding month.\n\nYou are fully cognizant that the majority of the parents appreciate the responsibility given and always endeavour to reciprocate by returning their children on time. Moreover, the homes are all within a radius of a few miles, and no hardship is experienced by either party.\n\nI would therefore ask for your favourable endorsement to the Department that we be allowed to continue the practice as indicated above, by allowing the pupils, who have responsible parents, to spend a few hours with their parents on the first Saturday of each month. No other concession is desired, none are asked for, but in the interests of both School and the Reserve in general, in view of the advanced stage at which most of the Bloods have arrived, would beg that this be granted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.E. Pugh, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nBlood Reserve.\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg to state that the enclosed letter is addressed to me by Canon Middleton, Principal of the St Paul's School of this Agency.\n\nI would mention it is in answer to the Departmental Circular No of May 20th 1925, relative to holidays at week ends, I am submitting this letter to the Dept for perusal, and would be glad of the Department's advice and comments.\n\nI should however like to say that if the Department do approve of allowing the St Paul's School one Saturday in the month, that the privilege should also be extended to the St Mary's School.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 15th, 1926,\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing a letter from Canon Middleton, Principal of the St. Paul's School, with reference to certain special leave allowed at that school.\n\nI note from the Principal's letter that he is allowing the children to go home on the first Saturday of each month between the hours of 9 A.M. and 5 P.M. The Department considers this quite different from a week end holiday and if the Principal considers such action is in the best interests of the school, the Department will have no objection to him continuing this practice. If you find, however, that this privilege abused, you should issue immediate orders to have it discontinued. As pointed out in my letter of the 24th ultimo, the regulations outlined in circular letter of May 20th, 1925, definitely state that week end holidays must not be allowed.\n\nYou may also inform the Principal of the Blood R.C. Residential School that he may extend the same privilege to his pupils, as is done at the St. Paul's School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ.E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. H.W. MacDonald, B.A., Barrister at Broadview, urging the claim for the granting of Christmas leave to the children at the Round Lake School, whose parents reside on the Ochappowace Reserve and I thought it well to advise you of this and to refer you to my letters of 17th November and 2nd December, 1925 and Department letter No. 150-37, dated the 23rd November, on this subject of granting Christmas leave to pupils, at least whose parents reside on the reserve on which the Residential school which they attend is situated.\n\nI am still of the opinion that such leave should be granted and that the school grant should not suffer. I am satisfied that this question will be reopened every year at this season and I think the Department's ruling might well be relaxed to meet such situations as exist on the Ochappowace Reserve, where the school is only a few feet outside its bounds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada,\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI am writing you in regard to the holidays, which permit only forty-two days to each child. There are some children who live at a distance and who cannot take holidays with their people more frequently than once in two years. In such cases would it be possible for me to so arrange that part of the holidays could be charged in one year and part in the other, the total for the two years not exceeding eighty-four days?\n\nI do not wish to work a hardship on the parents of the children. At the same time I am anxious to conform to the regulation, as interpreted by you. If this concession could be made I am sure it would be helpful to the parents.\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H. Raley, Principal\nOttawa, June 1, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Raley:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with regard to the annual holidays at Indian residential schools. I regret it would not be possible to allow leave to accumulate. If put into practice, this would lead to endless difficulty, and, while it seems a bit unfair to the school remote from its constituency, I consider it unwise to make exceptions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. G. H. Raley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetsa Institute,\nSardis, B.C.\nIndian Residential Schools,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOctober 5th, 1927.\n\nTo,\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe...Rhoda Cook, pupil #076, Alert Bay Girls' Home.\n\nSir:\n\nIn view of the fact that I am holding this pupil's place in this School open for her, and bearing in mind that we are losing grants by keeping this place vacant, might I enquire, please, as to the possibility of bringing this pupil back to school. Should the Dept. not see its way clear at this time to enforce the return of this pupil to school, I will at once, on receipt of the notification, fill the vacancy with a new pupil.\n\nI am well aware of the contentious points that this subject must bring to the fore, and realise that it is a question that cannot be settled in a minute, although I would much like to get this particular child returned to school, as I am afraid for her sake what too long a delay might do. Her sister returned from Quatsino the other day, and I am afraid her influence will be for the bad.\n\nThis whole question of raising the age limit is a very serious one, and although I do not wish to be intrusive, I would like to put forward a suggestion. There is no denying the fact that we of the Schools are apt to lose sight of the fact that the Indians themselves have rights that must be guarded. Principal among these is that of having their children for the fishing season, chiefly the boys, who, in this age of keen competition and poor seasons due to overcrowding of the waters with gear, must be invaluable to their parents in the annual harvesting of the fish. It is only just and fair that these youngsters should have the opportunity of going out and learning what the schools cannot teach them, their future living as a fisherman. Yet under Departmental regulations, we can only grant them 43 days holiday, which for years here, with the attendant loss of per capita grant, has been stretched to 50 days, owing to the impossibility of getting them back before the end of the sockeye run. Yet for the past two or three years here, over 80% of the children have been back in school right on time. This is a splendid tribute to the desire of the Indians for education, and why should that be worthy of encouragement? Let us do they take them out at 15 years of age? Because they must have the elder boys for at least two months fishing, and sooner than not have them, they take them out of school, and then the youngsters hang around and do nothing all the winter. With the girls, it is different. They are needed principally in the canneries for the sockeye run, most of the other varieties being machines canned, thereby not requiring the same large number of hands.\n\nNow is there not some way of reaching a compromise with the Indians on this matter. Could we not say that if the age limit is raised, to 17, that all boys of 14, or 15, could have two months vacation, to enable them to earn money, learn a trade, and fit themselves for an honourable life of usefulness to themselves and their people. Then, when the long winter comes, and they would otherwise become pool room habitues, they would be back in school, where education, both technical and academic, would be carrying on the work. Of course there are many questions in a matter like this, and I suppose one of the first would be that of the loss of grant. Why not put it up to the Indians themselves to pay the per capita grant for the period of extra time granted the pupil in question? One here off...\ned to pay if I would let his boy stay out for an extra month, and when I turned him down on the ground of unfairness to others, he took the boy out of school.\n\nIn summing up, it can be quite easily seen that the Indians themselves have some just and very valid reasons why they should oppose the raising of the age limit. Their story that the children come out of the school, able to read, to talk, to dress well, and in possession of many other white man's ways, but unable to fish, is pathetic, but true, as far as the boys are concerned, although I think that it is principally tribal customs relating to early marriage, etc., that create the opposition to the going back of the girls. The crying need seems to be for an extended vacation for all the elder boys, to enable them to learn their own business of life; domestic science in the schools for the girls; and advanced and intensive technical training for the boys, taking in carpentering, gas and diesel engineering, housebuilding, sanitation and drainage and other useful subjects. With these in force, I think it might be quite on the cards that the Indians themselves would welcome a raised age limit, say to the 17th year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDr. Scott:\n\nHere is a letter worthy of careful reading and consideration.\n\nP.H.T.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, October 13, 1927.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Fernie,\n\nThe report from Principal Anfield is interesting and worthy of consideration.

It appears that the boys are useful at home during the fishing season and apparently the annual holidays cannot be made to synchronise with it. In the past, this school and certain others have allowed the older boys longer holidays and, of course, they lose per capita grant, as only 45 days holiday with grant are allowed by the Department regulations. Other parents do not return their older boys at all, with the result that, after their usefulness during the salmon run is ended, they loaf all winter.\n\nI have discussed this with Dr. Scott and we believe that the teen age boy at Indian residential schools should benefit by the experiences that he can gain during the fishing season. I am writing to you to ascertain if this season is longer than 45 days. If so, then what schools would you recommend for a change in the regulations in the case of the older boys?\n\nIn the interior schools, we urge principals to give the annual vacation during the hop picking or berry picking seasons, and, while we have had a little trouble in getting pupils back on time, in the main we have been able to carry out our programme satisfactorily. If you think that there should be a change in the regulations in connection with schools where the boys are not engaged in fishing itself, you might make a recommendation in this connection, also.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B.

I have discussed these questions with the Deputy Superintendent General and I am writing to Mr. Indian Commissioner Betchburn, with a view to making a slight change in our regulations concerning the vacation. The question of the age for discharge from Indian residential schools is also being given the Department's serious consideration and it is possible that Parliament will be asked to change the Statute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Your instructions are that if the children go home for holidays at this time the Principals of the schools will lose their grant for the period they are out. I am told that last year Father Carri\u00e8re, Principal of the Cowessess School in the Crooked Lake Agency was in favour of allowing the children to go to their homes for the week, whether his grant was withheld or not and when the Indians who had children at the Round Lake School heard that the Cowessess children were going to their homes for Christmas they communicated with the Department through the local Member and the Agent was given instructions to permit the children to return to their homes for two days on account of the fact that Christmas Day came on a Saturday. The Agent states that naturally in a great number of cases the children were out for more than two days.\n\nPersonally I am not in favour of depriving the Indians of having their children home for the Christmas week.\n\nI should be glad to have your ruling on this matter by wire, as I think it is a mistake to have the Agents inform the Indians that holidays cannot be allowed and then have them go to outsiders and have this authorized over the heads of the resident Agents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.M.

F. MACKENZIE.\n\nDEP. DEPT. I.A.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo having reference to the complaint of the Principal of the Alert Bay Residential School that it is difficult to get parents to return their children to the school at the expiration of the summer vacation, which is for a period of forty-three days, due to the fact that boys are useful to their parents during the fishing season.\n\nIn reply to your request for information as to whether the fishing season is longer than forty-three days, I beg to say that it is.\n\nIn District No.1, which takes in the Fraser River and Howe Sound territory (Howe Sound is about fifteen miles North of Vancouver), the fishing season is from the 1st July to the 10th November, a period of one hundred and thirty-three days.\n\nDistrict No.2 covers the territory from the Nass River South to the North end of Vancouver Island, and in this district the fishing season begins on the 20th June and ends any time up to the end of September according to how the fall fish are running. This would be a period of approximately one hundred and ten days.\n\nDistrict No.3\u2014Vancouver Island and Mainland South to Howe Sound. The fishing season begins on the 1st June and ends generally about the first week in November which is one hundred and forty-three days. This year, however, some of the canneries are operating until the 19th of the present month.\n\nAt the Alert Bay School, the pupils are gathered from the Kwawkewlth Agency, which is in Number 3 District, and also from the Bella Coola Agency in Number 2 District. Therefore to extend the vacation to take in the fishing season in both these districts, the period would be fully one hundred and fifty days, as of course, it would be impossible to get a boy back to the school within a few days after the fishing season is closed. It would not be in the interest of our educational system that the vacation period should cover such a long period for the reason that there is a great percentage of the pupils who do return to school at the expiration of the summer vacation.\n\nThe residential\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe residential schools of British Columbia at which any of the pupils would be engaged in the fishing industry are Ahousaht, Alberni, Alert Bay, Christie, Coqualeetza, Kitimat, Kuper Island, Sechelt and also possibly the Squamish School at North Vancouver.\n\nIn British Columbia the annual vacation in the public schools begins on the 1st of July and extends to the first Tuesday in September.\n\nI do not see how it would be possible for the vacation period to fit in very well with the fishing seasons, for the simple reason that a very great bulk of the Indian fishermen only take part in the fishing season for the sock-eye salmon, which is the early run. This is followed later by various species of what are known as the fall fish and not nearly as many Indians participate in this as do in the sock-eye fishing. Those who do not stay fishing after the sock-eye run is over generally go South with their families for the hop-picking at Chilliwack and Agassiz, some going to the hop-yards in the State of Washington during the month of September and do not reach their homes until about the second week of October. Consequently as long as pupils are allowed to take part in the fishing and hop-picking business, there naturally will be some of them who do not return after the summer vacation is over.\n\nIt might be a good idea for the Department to favourably consider the matter of giving the Indian pupils a full two months' vacation in the summer time the same as the white children have and to allow the principals of these schools to determine just when the holidays should begin and end so as to get the best results by way of return of all their pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, December 21st, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nI have your 15/10345 of the 14th ultimo, concerning holidays at Indian residential schools. The Department is very glad to have this clear statement from you and I note that it will be extremely difficult to synchronise the annual vacation at our institutions with the fishing season. Your recommendation that two months' holidays be allowed is receiving consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nE. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., December 20th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nFor the last two weeks I have been besieged with Indians coming in from the reserves to see me as to whether the Department would not re-consider its ruling regarding the non-granting of Christmas holidays to their children attending the various Boarding Schools. The ruling has caused a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst the Indians and about a month before Christmas they start making appeals to have their children sent home.\n\nPersonally, I think it is perhaps unfair to a great many of our advanced Indians who are quite willing and anxious to carry out the regulations of the Department, and who have homes equally as good as some of the prosperous farmers in this country; (in fact their home conditions could not be much better), to deprive them of the privilege that the white man has, and it is hard to explain it to them. I perhaps see the discontent caused by this ruling a great deal more than do many of the Principals, because the Indians know the ruling is made by the Government and they naturally come to me. They see hundreds of children from all over the country coming home from Boarding Schools for the Christmas holidays, and they look on it as an injustice to them when their children are not given the same consideration. This certainly has the effect of making them sulky and discontented. I have always impressed upon the Indians that the Department's aim is to put them on the basis of White people as soon as it is possible to do so, and in situations of this kind it becomes rather difficult to explain to them the Department's attitude. The Indians who are right next door to the school and who are doing well in every way should not be made to suffer on account of the laxity of those at a distance who do not send their children back to school promptly and who do not keep them as cleanly as they should when they are at home.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI fully appreciate the difficulty in getting children back to school where they have to travel great distances, and in cases where the parents are indifferent, but I am now placing this matter before you more particularly on behalf of those Indians who have good homes within a reasonable distance, and who will carry out their promises to see that their children are returned to school promptly.\n\nI believe there have been twenty people come to Regina by train to speak to me about this matter, and I hope that my writing to you will not be looked upon as being too persistent, as I think it only right that you should have the whole matter laid before you, and be advised as to just what the feeling is, and the difficulties it makes in connection with recruiting, as most of this work is done by the Department's officials and not by the Principals of schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJanuary 19, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have given considerable thought to the question of Christmas holidays at Indian residential schools and to your 100-LB of the 20th ultimo. I think I should inform you that principals and others interested are, in the main, satisfied that such holidays should be discouraged.\n\nHowever, I am of the opinion that the responsibility for allowing a short vacation in the winter time should rest upon the individual principals at our institutions. They know that holidays may be given if proper safeguards are taken. Whenever a principal believes that it is in the best interests of the school to allow certain pupils to go home, he will do so, even if there is a small loss of per capita grant.\n\nIf Indian parents or others approach you in future, I think you would be well advised to refer them to the principal of the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nExtract from the Report of Dr. W.H. Turpel for\nthe month of January 1928- Norway House Agency.\n\nOriginal on file....76-123 A.\n\nEleven cases of Gonorrhoea amongst pupils of the\nIndian Residential School are reported this month.\n(Commencing January 14th) there have been no cases\nsince January 19th and those infected are segregated.\nThe boys involved are the younger boys from 10 to 16.\nThey were home on Jan.3-5 and that is the probable time\nof infection as no source could be found in the school.\nOttawa, February 6, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your B.12 of the 11th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication from the Principal of the Old Sun Indian Residential School with reference to holidays. Circular letter of May 20, 1925 - copies of which are enclosed - is the Department's general instructions in the matter. In the Prairie Provinces, principals and Indian agents should keep in mind the desirability of having older pupils, particularly the boys, take their annual leave during the harvest season. This will permit the pupil to be of assistance when most needed at home and will obviate the necessity of special leave, during which time grant is discontinued.\n\nConcerning Christmas holidays, you will note that there is no regulation prohibiting them; but the Department considers them undue and definite grant if more than one day is taken. Each request for leave should be answered by the school principal, who must take the responsibility and who should not grant holidays without the permission of the Indian agent. I am enclosing an extra copy of this letter for you to hand to Mr. Gibney.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEmcl.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCleishen, Alta.\nExtract from Report of Mr. Inspector Christianson,\nDated February 10th, 1928, on the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nThe mistake that was made, which probably brought about the colds, was that the children were allowed to go out with their parents to a feast held between Christmas and New Year's, and the weather being extremely cold, a number of the children caught colds, and naturally it soon went through the school. The Principal admitted this, but the parents are just as much to blame, as they went and got the children and everything would probably have been well if the weather had been a little milder. However, it is most regrettable that a death occurred.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M.

Fenton, Director of Indian Education.\n\nI have the honour to enquire as to the Department's intention with regard to the granting of two months vacation this school year.\n\nTime is flying along and we will soon be making arrangements about the holidays, and the start of them depends a great deal on just what the Department will do in connection with my letter of October 5th, 1927, addressed to the Secretary, and of your reply of the 17th of the same month. Should the Dept. sanction the two months vacation, our holidays would not start until July 1st or thereabouts, whilst they would commence earlier if only the 45 days were granted.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Victoria, I discussed this matter fully with your Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn, and I imagined that the consensus of his opinion was that the two months vacation would be the best way to solve the difficulty. He stated that he would be taking this matter up with you direct.\n\nWe are anxiously awaiting news regarding the possibility of raising the age limit for compulsory attendance at the schools, and whilst we are aware that the whole question is a very live issue and that whilst there are sights clearly seen, to be worried for the Indians; nevertheless it is our prayer that something may ensue, that will make things easier for us to hold the children, the girls especially, for a little longer, than is by statute now possible.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMarch 8, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT.\n\nYou will remember that the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School urged the Department to allow 2 months' annual vacation, as the older boys were useful at home during the fishing season. I believe that the 'teen age boy should benefit by the working experiences he can gain when on vacation, and, as Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn strongly recommends a 2 months' holiday for certain schools, I believe it advisable to allow it.\n\nAll told, there are 9 schools on the coast of British Columbia, that might be affected by any change in the regulation. The authorities of the Alert Bay School have written again in the matter and I wish to recommend that 2 months' holiday be allowed there. When, and if, others of these 8 schools make application for the extended period, I believe favourable consideration should be given.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, March 9, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nWith further reference to your 15/10345 of the 14th ultimo, concerning holidays at Indian residential schools, I have now to inform you that the Department will grant 2 months' holidays in the case of those schools situated on the coast. I do not believe it advisable, however, to inform the 8 schools affected that the extra holiday is now granted, as I consider the longer vacation should be taken only when the individual school, for urgent reasons, presses for such action. At the present time, the Alert Bay Indian Residential School is the only one that is being authorised to give the two months' holiday. When you believe it is timely to make the change in the case of any of the other coast schools, you might make a recommendation to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The Department has received Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn's recommendation in this connection, and it has been decided to allow you to give 2 months' holidays, commencing this year. You should clearly indicate on your quarterly return between what dates the holidays were taken.\n\nThe question of raising the age limit for compulsory attendance at residential schools is at present under consideration, but I do not anticipate any action in this connection for some months, as the Statute would have to be changed by Parliament.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T.

The bird boy, Robert, is attending the Hills School and is fourteen years of age. Vincent Bellegerde, fifteen years of age, and Leslie Pinay, fourteen years of age, are attending the Lebret School. If these requests are acceded to, we shall be swamped with applications for the return of the boys from school to assist with seeding and I am very strongly opposed to granting these requests and hope the Department will concur in refusing them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWm.

Bird, Magliore Bellegarde and Noel Pinay that their sons be allowed home from school to assist with the seeding. In reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to allow these boys special leave this year and you should so inform their fathers and the principals of the schools concerned.\n\nIf a father, because of illness, is unable to get his crop in, special leave may be granted by the Indian Agent or your office if the Principal concurs. In this event, the return should show the pupils absent from the school and, of course, grant would not be allowed for that period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

It is stated that the Indians of the entire village at Kitimat leave for the ceremonies in June and stay away at least two or three months, and that for the school children to return within the forty-three day period usually allowed for summer holidays would be very difficult.\n\nIf you consider it advisable to grant this school the same holiday period as the Alert Bay School, viz., two months, I shall be pleased if you will so inform Mr. Agent Fougner. We are informing the Agent that this matter has been referred to you for your consideration and attention.

MacKenzie.\nThe Department allows pupils at Indian residential schools annual leave with grant for any period up to 43 days. Generally, holidays should be taken consecutively, at the discretion of the principal, during the September quarter. Other dates may be fixed only when specifically approved by the Department. The practice of giving pupils leave from Indian residential schools at Christmas is considered unwise; and grant is not allowed if holidays are taken at this season. The Department wishes to discourage Christmas holidays; but there is no regulation prohibiting them. In the first place, the season of the year is not suitable for travelling. Further, there are occasional difficulties in the matter of the return of pupils. I consider that schools on, or contiguous to, reserves should have a Christmas tree or concert, to which all friends should be invited.\n\nAt no school should week-end holidays be granted. Far too often, returning pupils bring body vermin into the institution. Again, the breaking of the routine itself often outweighs the value of the change for the pupil. There is no objection to pupils going to their homes for Christmas Day or on Sunday, if such a short visit is possible, but they should be returned to the school before nightfall.\nINDIAN DEPT OTTAWA ONT\n\nPREMIER ANDERSON TELEPHONES THAT STRONG REPRESENTATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BY QUAPPELLE INDIANS TO HAVE CHILDREN HOME FOR NEW YEARS SIMILAR REQUEST RECEIVED FROM MR PERLEY M P SOME SCHOOLS ALLOWING CHILDREN HOME OTHERS NOT THIS MATTER COMES UP EVERY YEAR DEPARTMENT RULING SEEMS TO ME UNFAIR PROMISED TO TELEGRAPH YOU KINDLY WIRE TODAY\n\nW M GRAHAM.\nOTTAWA, December 30th, 1950.\n\nW.

A.S.Williams.\n\nSo far as the matter of granting leave to children at the Christmas season is concerned I am quite familiar with the Department's ruling, and every year I receive strong representations from Indians to have their children home, as they consider the ruling most unfair. When they are told that I cannot grant their request and that it rests with the Principals, they then resort to any\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\naside influence they can bring to bear on the matter.\n\nHon. Dr. Anderson received a strong letter from Louis Tawiyaka of the Sioux which he forwarded to me, as well as calling me up by telephone. I also received a letter from the Member for Qu'Appelle constituency, Mr. E.E. Ferley, in which he stated that a delegation had come to see him, so you will understand what the situation is here.\n\nI could never understand why a matter of this kind should be placed in the hands of the Principals of the schools, over the heads of the Indian Agents and the Indian Commissioner. We can have a Principal in our employ for three weeks, and he is to decide whether or not the children should go home for the Christmas holidays, and has the say over the head of the Indian Agent who may have been there for many years. It seems to me that the Department is not at all familiar with the circumstances, and why they should object to children going home a few miles to the reserve at the Christmas season is hard to understand.\n\nThis matter is bound to come up every year, and under the present system it is impossible to avoid dissatisfaction, as one Principal will grant leave of absence to the children, and another Principal six miles away will not.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, March 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 9306-06 of the 14th instant, with enclosure, concerning an extra two weeks' holiday for the pupils of the St. George's Indian Residential School. The difficulties concerning which Mr. Lett writes are common throughout Canada, and, after careful consideration, the Department has decided that 43 days' holiday with grant is all that can be allowed. There are a few exceptions, where there are seasonal occupations and where the children accompany the parents, but this does not obtain in central British Columbia. If, in any particular year, it is desired that the 6 weeks be changed, to permit of teachers attending a convention, the Department has no objection, in other words, have the annual holiday commence on July 15th.\n\nConcerning the comparison that is made with the provincial public schools, it is simple enough to explain to the parents that these are day schools and that Indian day schools take two months' holidays. Residential schools, however, are allowed but 43 days with grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nOttawa, July 25, 1951.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the care of five chicken pox cases during the summer at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. It appears from your letter that the intention was to close the school on the 15th instant and that there would be no one in the building after the 30th. On the 14th instant, the Department telegraphed direct to the Principal, as follows:\n\n\"Department considers your staff should take care chickenpox cases. Do not disperse pupils without permission medical health officer. Spread to other points might involve great expense.\"\n\nI may say that it is the usual practice, dictated by conditions, to have some members of the staff and certain pupils at the school at all times during the year. Farm, garden, live stock and buildings themselves have to be cared for, and there are always pupils at these institutions, whose homes are not at all suitable and who therefore cannot be given holidays. This year, particularly, the Department has been forced to dispense holidays generally, because funds are very limited. It is quite unsatisfactory to give holidays to those pupils who have good homes to go to and who will be promptly returned at the expiry of the vacation period - all provided that the expenses can be met by parents or school.\n\nThe usual practice at Indian residential schools is to have half the staff on duty for three weeks and the other half for the ensuing three weeks of the holiday period. I am sending an extra copy of this letter direct to Mr. Byrne.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKensora, Ont.\nBlackfoot Reservation\n\nCluny P.O. Oct 3rd/1931\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education\nOttawa.\n\nWe are writing to you about some matter regarding our children in the schools on this Reservation. It seems that each school has its own rules; we would like to have the same for the whole Reserve.\n\nAt the Old Sun School the pupils go home every Saturday afternoon.\n\nAt the Crowfoot School, the Principal does not allow any weekend holidays; he says it is against the Regulations of the Indian Department. He has shown us a letter dated May 20/1925.\n\nIf this circular is to be kept, we would like to have it for the 2 schools.\n\nNow we would like to have our children one half day every week.\n\nKindly take matter into consideration. Hoping you will give us a favourable answer.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nDuck Chief. X Head Chief\nOne Gun... X mine chief\nBen Calf Robe.\nJoe Good Eagle.\nOttawa, October 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a letter, dated the third instant and signed by Dusk Chief, One Gun and a few others, in which information concerning holidays at Indian residential schools is requested. Particular reference is made to week-end holidays. Will you please inform our correspondents that the letter has been received and explain to them the Department's wishes.\n\nThe Department believes that week-end holidays should not be granted. There is no objection to pupils going to their homes for Christmas Day, or on a Saturday, or on a Sunday, if a short visit with the parents is possible; but they should be returned to the school before nightfall on the same day. It should be clearly understood, however, that a few hours' visit with the parents is permitted by the Department, if the principal of the residential school wishes to make such arrangement. When principals are in doubt as to what they should do in the matter, they are expected to take the advice of the Indian agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGlenichen, Alta.\nBlackfoot Agency,\nGlenchen, Alberta. 13th October, 1931.\n\nThe Principal,\nCrowfoot Residential School,\nGLUNY, Alberta.\n\nDear Father Riou:\n\nIndian parents of pupils at your school ask that they be allowed to take their children out on Saturday afternoons as is allowed at Old Sun School.\n\nThe Principal at Old Sun School allows all pupils, except old girls, to go out with parents from 2 to 5 P.M. on Saturdays and I understand that this has worked out satisfactorily from all angles.\n\nIt is suggested that you might follow a like policy and I believe in doing so, the parents would be satisfied.\n\nThis, of course, has nothing to do with the regular one day holiday each month.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) G.H. Gooderham.\nG.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent.\nSir:\n\nAttention Mr Ferrier.\n\nI am glad to get your letter of the 26th answering a letter sent by the Chief and other Indians whose children attend Crowfoot School.\n\nFor your information I enclose a letter written to Father Riou at the time the Indians asked that they get their children out on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, as at Old Sun School.\n\nThe Rev. Father replied that the Indians had written to the Department; surely this was unnecessary, and clearly a lack of cooperation on the part of the Rev. Principal. I have sent him a copy of your letter and hope he will avoid further trouble in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, enclosing petition signed by fourteen members of the Poorman's Band requesting that their children be allowed home from the Nunswequar Indian Residential School for two weeks' holidays at Christmas.\n\nCircular letter of May 20, 1925, reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The practice of giving pupils leave from Indian residential schools at Christmas is considered unwise, and, in future, grant will not be allowed if holidays at this season are given without permission.\"\n\nYou will note that Christmas holidays are considered unwise, but that there is no regulation prohibiting them. Grant, however, will not be allowed if they are taken. The reason for this stipulation is the Department's wish to discourage Christmas holidays. In the first place, the season of the year is not suitable for travelling. Children have occasionally been returned to school insufficiently clad. Further, there are occasional difficulties in the matter of the return of pupils; again, far too often pupils returning from even brief holidays bring body weak into the institution. Lastly, the breaking of the routine itself outweighs the value of the change for the pupil.\n\nIt is considered that schools on or contiguous to reserves should have a Christmas tree and concert, to which all parents and friends should be invited.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nThere is no objection to pupils going to their homes for Christmas day, or on a Saturday, or on a Sunday, if a short visit with the parents is possible, but they should be returned to the school before nightfall on the same day. It should be clearly understood, however, that a few hours' visit with the parents is permitted by the Department if the principal of the residential school wishes to make such arrangement.\n\nI am of the opinion that the responsibility for allowing such leave should rest upon the principal of the Indian residential school concerned. If he is in doubt, the Indian agent should be consulted. The Department, therefore, considers that you should discuss the request which you have received with the Principal of the Muscowequan Residential School. The policy of the Department regarding holidays at Christmas has been outlined in this letter so that both you and the Principal may be fully informed regarding our wishes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nIndian Residential School Commission\nof the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nWinnipeg, Man. October 27th, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of our Elkhorn School has requested our Commission to furnish him with a definite ruling as to the length of holidays allowed for the pupils in this school. He states that the Rev. Principal Eley his predecessor gave him to understand that \"absentee from school was allowed for two months but the per capita grant allowed was for only 43 of these days.\" He had also been informed by the Principal of a United Church Indian Residential School that that school was allowed the per capita grant for the full two months.\n\nI have examined our Commission's records on this subject, and find (1) from the letter of the late Mr. Ferrier, April 7th, 1925, No.150-37, addressed to me, and from a \"circular\" sent out by him to \"Church authorities, Principals, and Department Representatives\" on May 20th, 1925, No. 150-37, that \"The Department has decided to allow pupils at Indian Residential Schools annual leave with grants for any period up to 43 days\", and (2) from Mr. Ferrier's letter of March 9th, 1926, No. 150-37, addressed to Mr. F. Earl Anfield, the Department had agreed to allow our Alert Bay School two months holiday.\n\nIf any departure from these rulings has been made by your Department, subsequent to the dates given, it will be appreciated by our Commission if you will kindly advise me of the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, October 31, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th instant, I beg to say that at a few schools on the west coast of British Columbia the Department allows, owing to special circumstances, two months' holidays with grant.\n\nAt all other Indian residential schools in Canada we allow 45 days' holidays with grant.\n\nIf any school considers it advisable to allow two months' holidays, it should be distinctly understood that grant for only 45 days' holidays should be requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n35-47 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., E.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSt. Martin's R.C. Indian Res. School,\nDesmarais, Alberta.\nDecember 29th, 1936.\n\nMr. N.P.L'Heureux, Indian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Chief Bigstone and councillor Augustin Auger called at my office lately and requested that the pupils of our School be given leave on New Year's Day; I explained to them that the Department did not allow the pupils to go out of school during the Christmas Holidays and I told them that I was guided by a letter from the Department, no. 150-37, dated at Ottawa, May 20, 1925, signed by Russell T. Ferrier, Supt. of Indian Education, which reads, in part as follows:\n\n\"The Department has decided to allow pupils at Indian residential schools annual leave with grant for any period up to 43 days. Holidays should be taken consecutively, at the discretion of the principal, during the September quarter. Other dates may be fixed only when specifically approved by the Department. The practice of giving pupils leave from Indian residential schools at Christmas is considered unwise; and, in future, grant will not be allowed if holidays at this season are given without permission. At no school should week-end holidays be granted.\"\n\nAugustin Auger could not understand the reason of my refusal, when leave is being practised at the Wabasca Church of England Indian Res. School; moreover, he also stated that week-end holidays were being granted all the year round at the Wabasca Church of England Indian Res. School.\n\nI doubt whether it be so, however, I told Augustin Auger that I had received no authorization from the Indian Agent to leave the pupils go home during the Christmas Holidays and at the week-end. I understand that Augustin Auger is going to Driftpile for freight; I would advise that, when you see Augustin, you explain to him in black and white the decision of the Department regarding granting leave to the pupils at Christmas and at week-end.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL. Buglet, O.M. D.\nPrincipal.\nDriftpile, Alberta,\nJanuary 14th, 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith the letter of Rev. L. Beuglet, Principal of the Wabasca R.C. Residential School, Wabasca, with reference to the difference in the practice of giving holidays to Indian pupils in the Wabasca C. of E. Residential School and the Wabasca R. C. Residential School, both at Wabasca.\n\nI would appreciate if you would re-state the Department's ruling for the information of the principals concerned.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN. P. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 23rd, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing letter received from the Principal of the Wabasca R. C. Residential School with reference to holidays allowed at the Wabasca C. E. Residential School. Please advise me definitely the length of holidays allowed the pupils at the Wabasca C. E. Residential School.\n\nEnclosed are several copies of circular letter of May 20th, 1925, governing the holidays to be allowed at Indian residential schools. You should forward a copy of this to the Reverend Principal of the Wabasca C. E. Residential School and also to the Principal of the Wabasca R. C. Residential School.\n\nAt your earliest convenience, you should arrange to meet both of these Principals and point out to them that the Department expects strict adherence to the instructions contained in the enclosed circular.\n\nWhere two schools of different denominations are situated in the same vicinity it is most essential that no holidays be granted at one school that are not allowed at the other.\n\nWhen you have consulted the Principals, you should report to the Department, giving full information regarding your interview with them. The Department will expect to hear from you in this regard within the next month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. P. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile,\nAlta.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT AND DIARY OF TRIP TO WABASCA,\nfrom January 29th to February 2nd, 1937.\n\nRegarding the complaint made against the C. of E.\nMission for granting week-end and Christmas holidays to some\nIndian pupils. I interviewed the Principal and found that the\nlatter did not know the regulations and did not have Circular\nNo. 150-37 of May 20, 1925. I supplied him with a copy of\nsame. The Principal said he was quite disposed to adhere\nto these regulations in future.\n\nN. P. L'Heureux.\nIndian Agent.\nFebruary 4, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRight Reverend Joe Guy and Reverend J. O. Fleurde intimated to us that they would return to Ottawa toward the end of the present week and they were hopeful that, at that time, we would be in a position to make known to them our decision in respect to a number of proposals submitted by them for our consideration. May I submit to you, for your consideration, the following proposals:\n\n1. That the present holiday period at residential schools be extended from six weeks to two months (July and August) and that this new regulation come into force at the end of the present academic year. This regulation, if adopted, will bring the holiday period at residential schools into conformity with the present regulation governing day schools and will be in conformity also, with the practice followed by provincial authorities in respect to public schools. If this regulation is adopted, it would result in certain economies to the church authorities. It should mean less expenditure in the purchase of supplies, etc.\n\n2. That we grant the sum of Five Dollars ($5.00) per pupil per annum in the case of church-owned schools, on the understanding that the church authorities would become responsible for the repair and upkeep of these institutions. This additional sum may appear small, but, in view of the substantial grants made to these schools during the last five year period, I consider it reasonable.\n\n3. That you consider the advisability of discussing with Bishop Guy the rebuilding of a wing at the Grouard School recently destroyed by fire and that this building be erected at his expense. If he is prepared to assume this obligation, the Department might agree to increase the per capita grant from $175.00 to $185.00. I note that the Church of England Schools at Wabasca and Whitefish Lake both receive $180.00 per capita and will receive $185.00 per capita if our second proposal is adopted. As a matter of fact, this would mean that all of Bishop Guy's schools and the Church of England Schools at Wabasca and Whitefish Lake will be receiving exactly the same grant, except that the Jeannard School, which now receives a grant of $175.00, would, under the\n\n- new proposal\nnew proposal receive $150.00. The advisability of increasing this school, also, to $155.00 is worthy of consideration.\n\n4. That you consider, also, a grant of $155.00 with an enrollment of 100 pupils in the case of the new school to be erected by the Church of England at Moose Fort. You will notice that here, too, my recommendation is exactly the same as in the case of the other schools now under discussion. It is my opinion, however, that the erection of a residential school at Moose Fort should enable us to escape from the necessity of maintaining two day schools in that district. I have in mind the day school at Moose Fort and the day school at Rupert's House. In addition to this, we should have a definite understanding with Canon Gould that the cost of equipment, desks, blackboards, etc., should not exceed a certain sum. It is my opinion that the sum of $1,500 should be sufficient for this purpose.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nTo Church Authorities, Principals and Department Representatives:\n\nThe Department has decided to allow pupils at Indian residential schools annual leave with grant for any period up to two (2) months. These holidays should be taken during the months of July and August. Other dates for the annual leave may be fixed only when specifically approved by the Department.\n\nThis extended holiday should obviate the necessity of granting week-end holidays or holidays at Christmastime, for which no authorization can be given.\n\nOrphans and children of destitute parents should not be allowed summer holidays unless arrangements can be made for their care when away from the school. This provision has special application to girls from twelve to sixteen years of age. Extreme care should be exercised in the case of pupils whose homes are distant from the school. Unless special safeguards concerning their return can be taken, holidays should not be granted.\n\nRequests for special or emergency leave for pupils who are urgently needed at home should be made to the Indian Agent, who will give approval only when he considers such leave absolutely necessary and after he has the concurrence of the Principal, who should understand that grant will be discontinued during such absence of a pupil. All such cases of special leave should immediately be reported to the Department by the Indian Agent.\n\nIf the medical officer advises that a pupil be sent home for a period because of illness, the Indian Agent should be informed and the Principal, when preparing the quarterly return, should not apply for grant for those days the pupil was not in residence. Definite information regarding all such pupils should be supplied on the quarterly return.\n\nWhen the September quarter return is being prepared, the dates of the annual leave should be clearly indicated and grant for the full quarter may be requested for all pupils who have been away from the school not longer than sixty-two (62) days.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. A. Hone,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nTo Inspectors of Indian Agencies\nand Indian Agents:\n\nEnclosed, for your information, is a copy of circular letter of the 30th instant, with reference to the Department's decision to allow two months' holiday leave with grant at Indian residential schools. A copy of this circular is being forwarded to each Principal of a residential school, as well as to officials of the various Churches associated with us in Indian work.\n\nOn every possible occasion, you should impress on the Indians the importance of having their children returned to the residential schools promptly upon the expiry of the holiday period. As we are now allowing two months' holidays each summer, it is felt that those Indian parents whose children are attending Indian residential schools should show sufficient interest in the welfare of their children to arrange to have them returned to the school they are attending on the date set by the Principal of that school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Previous to the present year, pupils at Indian residential schools were only allowed forty-three (43) days' holidays. Commencing this year, it has been decided to allow such pupils two months' holidays. Principals of residential schools arrange the dates between which the holidays are taken. No grant is allowed to each pupil.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nM. Winger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your 402-4C of the 13th instant, with reference to the petition recently forwarded by the Blood Indians.\n\nIn deciding to allow two months' holidays at Indian residential schools, the Department desired to bring the holiday period at this class of schools in conformity with Indian day schools and with the general procedure adopted in the case of White schools.\n\nFor many reasons that will, no doubt, suggest themselves to you, the Department has always felt that it was undesirable to allow holiday leave at Christmastime and short term leave during other periods of the year. For this reason, paragraph 2 was inserted in circular letter of March 30th, 1937. For your information, I may add that the various Church officials were consulted previous to the issuance of the circular letter just mentioned and they expressed their concurrence.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that it has been the practice for many years to allow certain holidays at both the residential schools on the Blood Reserve and the Department does not wish to make any change in this regard, provided the Inspector of Indian Agencies, yourself, the Principals of the schools and the parents feel that it is advisable to continue this practice. Please discuss this matter further and make a definite recommendation regarding what holidays over and above the two months annual leave you consider should be allowed the pupils at the two schools on the Blood Reserve. In making such a recommendation, you should state distinctly the duration of these special holidays in order that all parties concerned may have a definite understanding regarding them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. H. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nR. A. Heay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCalgary, July 20th, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. John E. Pugh, Indian Agent at the Blood Agency, has forwarded me a copy of his No. 402-4C dated the 13th instant, re petition forwarded by the members of the Blood Band to the Department, re circular letter No. 150-37 dated March 30th last, which refers to school holidays.\n\nWhen on the reserve on the 21st ultimo, Chief Owns-Many-Horses mentioned the matter to me. He claimed the new regulations were very drastic, insomuch as there would be no monthly or Christmas holidays in future. I asked him what his objections were, and what he wished, pointing out that the children would be given two months holidays each summer. His reply was, \"Ten months is a very long time without having our children in our homes, after being accustomed to having them home each month. Would the Department allow them a week at Christmas and month-end holidays for the months of March, April and May?\" I informed him I could not change the Department's regulations, and that I understood the new ones had been made because, in several cases pupils who were allowed to go home Friday evenings and should return to the school on Sunday, did not return until Monday or Tuesday. This upset the class-room work and other regulations in the schools, as well as the pupils themselves. I also informed him that the Blood Reserve was the only one I knew of where monthly leave of absence had been granted. He then informed me that a petition was being circulated for signing, which would be forwarded to the Department. I have not seen this petition.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nIn conversation with the Principals of St. Paul's and St. Mary's Schools, they stated that they would carry out the Department's instructions. When told of Chief Owns-Many-Horses' request, they did not appear to have any objections to the Christmas holidays. However, I gathered from their conversation that they would not make the suggestion: If it was made by the Indians and the Department granted same, well and good.\n\nIn my opinion, these Indians -- a number of whom have impressed me as being haughty and exacting -- have no reason for complaint. They are allowed to visit their children at the schools and are informed when they are sick, and on Sundays they have the privilege of being with them for several hours.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nKAMLOOPS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nKamloops, B.C., Sept. 8, 1937.\n\nMr. W.J. Ferguson,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ferguson:\n\nSome time ago we received a circular from the Department No. 150-37, dated March 30th, 1937, and addressed to Church Authorities, Principals and Department Representatives, signed by Mr. R.A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare and Training. In this circular it is stated that grant for the full quarter may be requested for all pupils who have been away from the school not longer than sixty two days (62A).\n\nI would be grateful to you if you would find out from the Department if the sixty-two day holiday grant is not to be requested for those children who for no reason whatsoever fail to return for the 1st of September. If this is so, I think it is too bad that the school should be penalised with regard to those children who give us most trouble and for whom extra expense is often contracted in the making of extra trips in an endeavour to have them return on time and this especially as the school has no authority to enforce the truancy act. I understand that a grant of no more than sixty two days may be expected when children are out of school for more than that number of days but I feel that the sixty-two day grant should be allowed.\n\nThanking you for any information you may be able to obtain in regard to this matter, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd) Thos. M. Kennedy, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nKamloops, B.C., September 11th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter received from the Principal of Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nI would be much obliged if the information requested by the Rev. Principal, could be supplied me as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, September 18, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing copy of a communication received from the Principal of the Kamloops Residential School, with reference to the holiday leave.\n\nBefore increasing the holiday leave from 45 days to 62 days, the proposal was discussed with all church officials, and they expressed the opinion that, if the holiday leave was extended to 62 days, there would be considerably less difficulty in having the pupils returned on time. They also promised that all church officials and school principals would cooperate with the Department in having pupils returned promptly upon the expiry of their leave.\n\nIn the case of each pupil who was in the Kamloops School on June 30th - the probable date of closing for summer holidays - and who was allowed home on holidays, the Principal may request grant at the end of September for the actual number of days such pupil was in residence during the September quarter, plus the holiday leave. For instance, for a pupil allowed out on holidays on July first and who returned on September fifth, grant may be requested for the full quarter, or 62 days. If a pupil did not return to the school until September 15th, grant should only be requested for 78 days (62 days holidays plus 16 days for the period September 16th to September 30th). For a pupil allowed out on holidays on July first and who does not return to the school by September 30th, grant should only be requested for 62 days.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. J.

Recently, Fr. Chatelain received a circular letter\nfrom your Department announcing that there would be no\nChristmas holiday hereafter and that the summer holiday\nwould be extended. Although Fr. Chatelain caused this\ninformation to be made known to the parents of the child-\nren, number of them nevertheless sent their children back\nat the time that the fall term heretofore opened. He was\nobliged to send them home and some of the disaffected\nparents started a rumour about that the circular letter\nfrom your Department was not genuine. Then when school\nopened they made a complaint\u2014to the Indian agent, I\nbelieve, that the school was infected with typhoid and that\nthe food was not good. As a result, I understand that\nthe Indian Agent had the Medical Officer, Dr. Craig of Broadview\nmake an investigation\u2014-at least, if that is not so, Dr.\nCraig after making an investigation delivered a report to the\nAgent. I am enclosing a copy of this report from which you\nwill note that the charges were entirely unfounded, and\nwere obviously propounded through dissatisfaction because\nof your Department's decision in regard to changing the\nschool holiday.\n\nFr. Chatelain fears that unless the Department\ntakes a firm stand in the matter that there is going to be\nmore trouble when December comes as the parents will be\nwanting to take out the children. It would appear that,\nin order to avoid such a situation arising, you ought now\nto give very definite instructions to your agent to take\nadequate steps in the matter. I should be obliged, therefore,\nif you would, at once, write Fr. Chatelain assuring him\nthat this will be done, and at the same time send me a copy\nof your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) D.A.

In view of the recent ruling by the Department, concerning this question, I have given a negative reply in each case.\n\nThe requests however, are so persistent that I am constrained to write, asking if you will kindly recommend to the Department, that a few days holiday be granted during the Christmas season.\n\nBoth parents and students would appreciate such a favour, and I am sure, if the privilege was granted, the students would return on any date mutually agreed upon.\n\nPersonally, I consider it would be beneficial to the students; the parents; and the School. I therefore take pleasure in recommending the same, and earnestly solicit your appreciated endorsement to the request.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSHM/M\nPrincipal.\nSt. Mary's School, Cardston, December 1, 1937\n\nR.A.

For the children, it would be an occasion to enjoy home life and an incentive to attend more willingly to their class work; for the parents, on the other hand, this would serve as a soothing for all ill-feeling, felt and often expressed to us since monthly holidays were suppressed.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDEPT.

Hoey\nSup. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAccording to your circular 150-37 March 30th, 1937 the Department has decided to allow pupils of Indian Residential Schools annual holidays during the months of July and August. \"Other dates for the annual leave may be fixed only when specifically approved by the Department\".\n\nTherefore I kindly ask you to change the dates, instead of leaving in July, to leave on the 15th of June and to come back on the 15th of August, for the following reasons:\n\nThe Indians leave their summer resort for their trapping ground in the middle of August. Therefore it makes it awkward for the parents to send their children only at the end of August, and the Principal to fetch children.\n\nFurthermore the Indians receiving their Treaty money in the early part of the summer and fish being plenty can easily feed their children which is not the case in August.\n\nThese are the main reasons for this change in holidays and I hope this will meet with your approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 27, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Beauval Indian Residential School in which he states that the most suitable dates to take the summer holidays at the Beauval School are around June 15 to August 15.\n\nYou may inform the Principal, Reverend F. X. Gagnon, O.M.I., that the Department approves the annual holidays in the Beauval School being taken between the dates mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSt. Mary's R.R. School,\nCardston, November 28th, 1936.\n\nMr. John Hugh, Agent,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nBy reference to your letter dated November 16th, 1936 concerning Christmas holidays to be given without grant as was done in December 1937, as I have already verbally told you, that I am absolutely opposed to a move of this kind.\n\nYou are no doubt aware, no one can escape the fact, that the floods have been pressing, exacting, demanding holidays for the Christmas season... This is quite natural and should be rather easy for every-one concerned to understand.\n\nAt the same time we must not forget that it is impossible to close the school completely, dismiss staff & teachers and stop the daily expense involved in the running of the school. Moreover some thirty children will remain in the school necessitating therefore that the staff remain at work. Only a few meals will therefore be saved. For this reason I must remain emphatically opposed to the suggestion that holidays be given without grant. If the tendency is to cut... cut... cut... reduce the grants, I do not see how the Department can expect me to develop manual training for both boys and girls on a reduced grant. We are making sacrifices for this end and I do not see why the work should not be encouraged by the Department by giving us the advantage of the very few dollars which may be gained by the meals not served at the school on those days.\nI repeat the statement already made that I am not opposed to a holiday of two or three days at the most; I nevertheless am positively opposed to the granting of a holiday on the basis of a reduced grant and I anticipate real harm being done to the schools if the Department turns around and announces that no holiday will be given because the principals cannot afford to keep the school going without the sustained regular grant. Having consulted the Rev. Canon Middleton on this subject I am satisfied that he is of the same opinion on this matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev. P.A. Charron, principal.\nSt. Paul's Residential School\nRev. Canon S. H. Middleton, B. Sc.\nPrincipal\nBlood Reserve - Cardston, Alberta\n\nNovember 19th, 38.\n\nJohn E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter wherein the suggestion is made that a holiday (without grant) be recommended during the Christmas season. My reaction to the suggestion is definitely negative. The sooner the question of holidays is settled on a mutually accepted and satisfactory basis, the better it will be for all concerned.\n\nYou know, I know, that the Indian parents have a strong and parental desire to have their children home for a few days during the Christmas festivities. Such a feeling is quite natural and to be highly commended.\n\nUnder the domestic administration of the Agency you are also cognizant of the fact, that whereas some of the students will remain in school while a certain number will go home during that period. I know that you are further convinced that all will return in time for the New Years Celebrations.\n\nWhile 'st I heartily and sympathetically agree to a few days holiday being granted during the Christmas season, yet academically, ecclesiastically, officially and personally, I most emphatically disagree to giving a holiday under such conditions, minus payment of the official and authorised Grant. Obviously, provision has already been made and anticipated, for the continued residence of the students during the period of say, two, three, or four days, as the case may be. Yet it is impossible and unadvisable to discharge the members of the School Staff and close the School for that period, owing to the fact that many of the students would still be in residence and the School routine must continue to function in the normal and accepted manner. The aggregate expenditure would therefore be lessened by the cost of only a few meals not partaken by the absentees, while the income intimated by the suggestion made, would reduce the official Grant and Revenue by several hundred dollars.\nAs such a high state of efficiency is and rightly demanded by the Department, the proficiency cannot be maintained by the curtailment of the anticipated per capita Grant.\n\nIn view of the local and domestic principles involved, I am sending a copy of this letter to the Reverend Principal of the St. Mary's Roman School, with the hope that we may mutually and respectfully ask for the sustained and regular payment of the Grant, while at the same time acquiescing to the wishes of the parents and allow the brief holiday as requested.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nBlood Indian Agency\nNOV 21 1938\nCARSTON, ALTA.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., November 28th, 1938.\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to submit herewith correspondence received from the Principals of the Blood R.C. and St. Paul's Anglican Schools, Blood Indian Reserve.\n\nIn this connection may I state that a representative number of the Indians Council, at a meeting in the Agency office on November 17th, requested that a holiday be granted to their children from both schools at the Christmas season.\n\nThe Indians were informed that it was a matter of special request to the Department, as was the case last year, and in view of the fact that grant was deducted for the holiday in 1937, both Principals were written, to acquaint them of the Indian application and request for a holiday.\n\nIt will be noted that the Principals' opinions are the same on the subject, and I may say that the opinions of both the Principals and myself is that consideration might be given to a Christmas holiday, as we feel that generally the Indians have not been too restive over the restriction made, whereby the once a month weekend holiday was curtailed.\n\nAs Agent for this Reserve, I feel that it would be to mutual advantage to grant a holiday of five days duration, from the 26th to the 31st of December.\n\nThe subject was referred to Mr. Inspector C.P. Schmidt on his recent visit to this Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs, Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nCalgary, December 9th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nOn my return to this office today from a visit to Lesser Slave Lake Agency, I found a letter from Agent J. E. Pugh, addressed to the Secretary, attached to which are letters addressed to him by the Rev. Canon S. Middleton and Rev. P. A. Charbon, Principals of St. Paul's and St. Mary's Indian Residential Schools, which are self-explanatory.\n\nWhen at the Blood Agency on the 18th ultimo, Head-Chief, Shot on Both Sides and Minor Chiefs, Own Different Horses and John Cotton, made the request to Agent Pugh and myself that the pupils of the two residential schools on the reserve be allowed to return to their homes on the reserve for Christmas vacations: I informed them that authority would have to be obtained from the Department, as was done last year. I then asked Agent Pugh to write both Principals, informing them of the request, and mentioning that it would likely affect the per capita grant. The following day, Agent Pugh and I visited both schools, when I mentioned the matter to the Principals, who, while agreeing that the Indians' request was a natural one, emphatically expressed themselves as opposed to a reduction of the per capita grant, for the period of the holidays. I then asked them to reply, in writing, to Mr. Pugh's letter, which they had received that day.\n\nLast year, the month-end holidays, which had been customary for years past, were discontinued: This aroused the Indians somewhat. However, our point was won, and the Band pacified by allowing them Christmas holidays. This year no mention has been made regarding the month-end holidays. What effect the refusing of Christmas holidays will have upon the Indian parents, and whether it will cause dissatisfaction and desertion amongst the pupils, I cannot say.\n\nBoth Principals agree that the pecuniary saving made to the schools during the absence of the pupils who go home at Christmas, is negligible, and does not begin to offset the amount deducted from the per capita grant.\n\nI note in his letter No. 150-37 of December 18th, 1937, second paragraph, the Superintendent of Welfare and Training states:\n\n\"...under present regulations, no grant can be allowed for the period pupils are absent for Christmas holidays.\"\n\nIn view of this, and the Principals' objections to losing part of the grant, it seems to me that the proper thing for the Department to do is to refuse the Indians' request for holidays, and thereby relieve the Principals of the unpleasant task of doing so.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nWe must expect a repetition of this request next year. Therefore, the Department's decision this year will create a precedent on this reserve, which will be observed by Indians of other reserves.\n\nI beg to ask for an early reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa,\nDecember 16, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant enclosing correspondence with regard to allowing holidays at Christmas time to the pupils of the Blood and St. Paul's Indian Residential Schools.\n\nFor your information I enclose another copy of the regulations governing the granting of holidays at Indian Residential Schools. For reasons that will readily suggest themselves to you the Department has always taken the position that the allowing of holidays during the winter season is neither in the best interests of the pupils themselves nor conducive to the progress of the Residential School.\n\nWe would have no objection to the children going home for Christmas Day provided they would return to the school for night time. As a matter of fact it would be preferable for the schools to arrange some special celebration on either Christmas Day or the day after and have the parents come to the school and spend the day with their children.\n\nHowever, if you still feel that the holiday leave at Christmas requested by the parents of pupils attending the Blood and St. Paul's schools should be allowed you may govern yourself by the contents of official letter of December 18, 1937, a copy of which is enclosed. As you know the regulations governing holidays at Indian Residential School provide that grant cannot be allowed when pupils are absent except for the period mentioned in the regulations. Consequently if the pupils of the two schools mentioned\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nabove are allowed home on holidays this year the Department will have no alternative than to withhold payment of the grant for the period they are absent. You should, therefore, advise me definitely what action is taken at the Blood and St. Paul's schools during the coming Christmas holidays.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., December 24th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Christmas Holidays.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 402-11B, of the 21st instant, with enclosed copy of letter from the Department re the above.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that both the Principals of the two schools in this Agency were in my office this morning, and after a long discussion over the contents of the Department's letter, they decided to dismiss the schools for twenty-four hours, December 26th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

For reasons that will readily suggest themselves to you the Department has always taken the position that the allowing of holidays during the winter season is neither in the best interests of the pupils themselves nor conducive to the progress of the residential schools.

McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nOttawa,\nJune 10, 1943.\n\nTo: The Inspector, Indian Agents and Principals of Indian Residential Schools in the Province of Alberta.\n\nI desire to direct your attention to the fact that provincial regulations regarding additional or extended summer holidays do not apply to Indian children attending Indian residential schools in Alberta, or to the Indian children attending the Sarcee Indian Day School.\n\nThe regulations outlined in Departmental circular No. 1862 of March 30, 1943, also circular letters Nos. 502-643 and 502-645, should be adhered to strictly.\n\nIndian Agents should visit each residential school under their supervision twice during the months of September, October and November. I suggest the first and third Mondays of each of these months. While at the residential school the Indian Agent should prepare a list of all pupils who have not returned to school upon the expiry of their leave. Following this visit the Indian Agent will be expected to make every effort to have the delinquent pupils returned to the residential school concerned at the earliest possible date. It is unnecessary for me to point out the importance of having pupils return promptly at the start of the new academic year.\n\nIn issuing the above instructions to Indian Agents, it is not our idea that the Principals of residential schools should be relieved of all responsibility. In the case of pupils who do not return on the expiry of the summer holiday period, the Rev.

I am especially pleased to note the help that you are now giving us for the return of delinquent pupils. If the principal is left to himself in this matter he can do nothing. But with the help of the Agent I am sure that things will be much better.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nRev. P.A.

It should also be discussed with the Indian parents on every occasion possible, so that there will be no misunderstanding.\n\nBe the list of children, which you are instructed to prepare on each of your two visits to the schools during the months of September, October and November: You will please see that a copy of same is posted in the Indians' waiting room in your office, and copies sent to the Farming Instructors, Issuers or Overseers, and missionaries on the reserve(s).

Pugh, Esq., Indian Agent, Saddle Lake, Alta.\n\nRe quotations of letters between your office and the Edmonton Residential School, regarding holidays, which subject you mention on your report on Blue Quills Residential School for the month of July, 1943, which was received here this day:\n\nI beg to enquire whether you have received my Circular Letter No. 93 dated June 18th, last; acknowledgment of receipt of same has not been made to date by your office.\n\nC. Pant, Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nCOPY: for your information, please.\n\nAlso attached is copy of my Circular Letter No. 93 referred to above. The first paragraph of Departmental Circular No. 150-37 dated June 11, 1943, deals with holidays. Of course it is understood that Indian Agent Pugh does not visit the Edmonton School, which is located near the city of Edmonton.\n\nCopy of Agent Pugh's letter of July 31st, re fire escapes at Blue Quills School, which subject is also mentioned on his report on this School for the month of July, was forwarded to the Department on the 4th, instant.\n\nC. Pant, Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, December 5, 1944.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, requesting that the children attending the Birtle Residential School be allowed to go to their homes for the holiday period between Christmas and New Year's Day.\n\nThe Department has always taken the position that the allowing of holidays during the winter is neither in the best interests of the pupils themselves nor conducive to the progress of residential schools. Pupils residing close to the school might be allowed home for Christmas Day only, provided they will return to the school the same evening. As a matter of fact, we have always encouraged residential schools to arrange some special celebration, whether on Christmas Day or one of the days in Christmas week, and have the parents come to the school and spend the day with their children.\n\nIn view of our policy, which has been in effect for several years, the Department cannot see its way clear to allow the pupils from the Birtle School the privilege that you request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nActing Director.\n\nW. C. Richardson, Esq., LL.B.,\nBarrister,\nElphinstone, Man.\nSt. Paul's Residential School\nRev. Archdeacon S. H. Middleton, B.D., B.A.\nPrincipal\nCardston, Alberta\n\nJuly 13th., 1945\n\nMr. John E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to yours of the 12th. inst.,\nand our conversation on the matter of Inspector Evanson's report.\n\nI discussed this question with the Inspector during his visit, and pointed out the conditions which have gradually arisen both on and off the Reserve, especially with so many of the parents working at distant points.\n\nDuring the past year several students were brought to School, but the parents would not sign the official Application Form, maintaining thereby that so long as students were not officially admitted, they claimed the privilege of taking their children home whenever they desired.\n\nHad I refused to accept these children under the conditions mentioned, it is quite probable that they would have been taken to the Roman School. Such a pernicious habit has been growing for several years past. Moreover, during the monthly weekend holiday\u2014there is no weekly holiday\u2014parents working off the Reserve, forty-fifty sixty and seventy miles distant, have not been punctual in returning the Juniors. It has been the constant duty of a staff member to drive many hundreds of miles to \"round up\" the delinquents, causing thereby much annoyance and extra labour.\nIf the monthly holiday is still to be an accepted factor of School life, then I would suggest that a Truant Officer be appointed to remedy the situation.\n\nThis matter has become somewhat aggravated during the War years, as so many of the Indians have not been residing on the Reserve.\n\nCould the matter be discussed before the Council, and thus place the responsibility on the Leaders?\n\nWill gladly offer any assistance and co-operation which may help to produce a more regular and unified attendance of the Kindergarten and Junior Classes.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSHM/FMH\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of letter #103-1-6 of the 19th June last relative to Inspector Evenson's report on the two Schools of this Agency, namely the Blood R.C. and St. Paul's Anglican Residential Schools.\n\nOn receipt of the Department's letter, I wrote both Principals quoting the excerpt as given by Inspector Evenson, and I attach herewith, a letter received from the Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican School in reply, and the Rev. Father Charron advises that he is writing, but to-date this Office has not received a reply, and it is possible that this may have been sent direct to the Department.\n\nBoth Principals advise me that they discussed the matter with Inspector Evenson, asking that their comment be embodied in his report, and this apparently has been carried out.\n\nIn the opinion of the writer, it would appear that Truancy is the only answer, brought about through varying causes, which are undoubtedly affected through non-return at the end of Summer Holidays, monthly week-end Holidays, and Xmas Holidays. All of the latter have been the subject of correspondence over a period of years, and it is found that such are being given.\n\nThe matter of the return of the Pupils to Schools at the close of the Summer Holidays has been a problem, and prior to the outbreak of War, Section 10 of the Indian Act was applied quite often, notices being served by R.C.M. Police Officers, who were oftentimes conveyed in Agency vehicles for this purpose, but during the War I am given to understand that this has largely devolved largely upon the School authorities, who have spent a lot of time and gasoline in covering the country endeavouring to obtain the children's return to School, and this has been aggravated by the Indian parents who were working out off the Reserve for high wages and in widely separated areas, and a long way removed from the Schools.\n\nIt was noted that last Fall, the above was the general atmosphere, and it was also found that Holidays were a regular monthly affair, and that Xmas Holidays were included.\n\nIn perusal of the Files I find that Agents and Principals were requested not to lean on the R.C.M. Police for the return of Pupils due to War emergencies, but I did interview the local Detachment in this respect, and request that the matter be placed before the Officer Commanding, R.C.M. Police, LETHERIDGE, which I reported to the Department under cover our 402-11 CE-1 of October 23rd, 1944.\n\nAt that time I adopted the procedure of making up the Truancy Notices and the Schools delivering same. This method met with the indifference of the parents concerned, no prosecutions were made.\n\nIn reviewing the problem with a view to finding a solution, the writer is of the opinion, that the Agent is in the main the one who is held responsible, if a child is either not returned from Summer Holidays or other Holidays, I am therefore (over).................\nof the opinion that, (to eradicate the criticisms offered by the Principals', which apparently was done in this connection), the Principals of both Schools should be notified that no Holidays, either monthly or other Holidays, will be allowed, and it is further suggested that this be in the form of a letter from the Branch, which could be posted on the School \"NOTICE\" boards, and also at the Agency, this is requested inasmuch as there is a tendency on the part of the Indians to presume that the matter of Holidays is a local affair.\n\nIt is anticipated that the Indians will protest strongly any action to curtail Holidays, and a review of correspondence entered into from this Agency prior to the War will support this prediction.\n\nI do not concur in the suggestion of the Principal of St. Paul's School, that the matter be discussed before the Council, I however do concur in the appointment of a Truant Officer, or that the services of the R.C.M. Police be used in the matter of Truancy, and the facilities of the Schools could be used to transport R.C.M. Police Officers to serve Truancy Notices when required, but when a prosecution is to be made, it is thought that this should be carried out by the R.C.M. Police acting as Truant Officer. Should this latter method be approved, may we ask if a supply of \"Notice to Parents, Guardian or other Person by Truant Officer\" be sent forward prior to the opening of the Schools.\n\nIt is intended that a check-up of the School Rolls be made on the 4th September, and a report made to the Department for two purposes, that of attendance at Schools, and to the Family Allowance Directorate at EDMONTON.\n\nMay we be advised of any suggestion in this matter.\n\nJ.

PUGH, INDIAN AGENT.\n\n141-AM 5TH\nOttawa, September 6, 1945.\n\nMr. J. B. Pugh, Indian Agent,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo, with reference to the Blood and St. Paul's Residential Schools, regarding truancy and absences at both of these schools during the past academic year.\n\nI am also in receipt of your telegram of the 6th instant, reporting the small enrolment at both schools for the academic year 1945-46. Both of these communications refer to the same subject and consequently are being answered in one letter.\n\nAs you will remember, we have had correspondence for many years regarding the practice followed at the two schools in question, where holidays have been allowed at week-ends and on other occasions, contrary to departmental instructions and the general practice at other residential schools throughout the Dominion.\n\nIn order that the matter may again be placed before the Principals, I am forwarding two extra copies of this letter, one of which should be handed to each Principal. In connection with this letter I wish to direct attention to the contents of circular letter of June 11, 1945, and of March 30, 1937.\n\nThe Department feels that holidays on week-ends and other special occasions should be discontinued immediately, and if the Principals persist in ignoring our instructions in this regard, they should be informed...\nthat a note should be made on the quarterly return of every day any pupil is absent and grant will not be allowed. While it may place additional work on your office, I feel certain that you will co-operate with us in this regard, by checking the returns before forwarding them to us, in order to make certain that the Principals have not asked grant for pupils who have been allowed out on unauthorized holiday leave.\n\nThe payment of family allowances may enter into the matter this year, and it should be kept in mind that Family Allowance officials are satisfied to have Section 10 of the Indian Act apply instead of Section 29 of their Regulations. This being the case, children of 6 years of age, and who have not yet reached 7, may be granted family allowance. Children of 7 years of age and over are obliged to attend school, and if parents are holding at home children who are of school age according to Section 10 of the Indian Act, it is your duty as Indian Agent to immediately notify the Regional Director of Family Allowances of the names of such children, and the family allowance payments for them will be discontinued.\n\nIf the condition mentioned in your telegram of the 4th instant shows no sign of improvement, you may take the necessary action, under Section 10 of the Indian Act (subsections 3, 4, 5 and 6). In the latter subsection you will notice that every member of the R.C.M.P. is considered a truant officer. Under separate cover you are being forwarded a supply of the notice that is required to be given to parent, guardian or other person by the truant officer.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCROWSTON, Alberta,\n12th September, 1945.\n\nOfficer Commanding,\nRe C.

Police except in rare and exceptional cases, and therefore explanation is desired as to what action the schools have taken regarding absent children, and in this connection I may say that both schools and the Agency have kept the subject matter before the Indians, and both principals have done considerable driving and bringing in of children, but other than the use of moral persuasion, there is no authoritative action they can take, hence our request.\n\nThe matter was referred to our Branch at Ottawa, before any action was taken, and I quote herewith an excerpt from their letter:\n\n\"...if the conditions mentioned in your telegram of the 4th inst. shows no sign of improvement, you may take the necessary action under Section 10 of the Indian Act (Sub Sections 5, 6 & 6).

Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter #150-37 of September 7th last with reference to the School attendance at the respective Anglican and Roman Catholic Schools of this Agency.\n\nIn reply, it is advised that acting upon the instructions or suggestions made in the above referenced file #150-37, necessary Truancy Notices were drawn up and the N.C.O. I/c of the CADSTON Detachment, was requested to serve such Notices. The Officer Commanding, R.C.M.Police Sub Division at LETHBRIDGE was also written, copy of such request is enclosed.\n\nNo reply has been received from the Officer Commanding at LETHBRIDGE but the N.C.O.I/c CADSTON Detachment has been asked by his Officer Commanding \"\u2014 what steps the Schools have taken to obtain the attendance of children not attending\", and was requested to interview the Indian Agent.\n\nIt was gathered from the conversation with the N.C.O.I/c CADSTON Detachment, that Circular Letter #15-1 dated June 21st, 1942, was considered still in effect, and that only in cases of emergency, were the services of the R.C.M.Police to be utilized, and in view of this it is presumed that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police will have to be definitely instructed by our Department, that the problem of procuring attendances at our Schools is an emergent matter, and without some vested authority in the serving of Truancy Notices it is very doubtful if the situation will improve.\n\nAttendance at the Blood R.C. School at this date is 139 Pupils in School and 19 Pupils absent, at the St. Paul's Anglican 80 children are in School and 50 Pupils absent.\n\nIt would appear therefore that some drastic action should be taken, and the writer is convinced that the serving of Truancy Notices by the R.C.M.Police is the only authoritative solution, and request is therefore made that the R.C.M.Police be asked to carry out the provisions of Section 10 (Sub Sections 2, 4, 5 &6) of the Indian Act. I have to-day written the Officer Commanding the R.C.M.Police Sub-Division at LETHBRIDGE in the matter, copy of letter being attached.\n\nBoth Schools have been checked weekly, and have been re-checked to-day and the above figures are as at to-day's attendance.\n\nIn regard to the matter of Family Allowances, we are informing them (and attaching a List of all Children over the full age of 7 years) that these should be struck off, except for certified Ill Health or other legitimate causes.\n\nJ.

I would appreciate having your comments.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to your letters of August 17 and September 25 and my letter of September 6.\n\nWhen replying, you should return the enclosed correspondence.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, File No. 150-37, with reference to the granting of monthly holidays to the pupils of the St Paul's Anglican and Blood Residential School of this agency, and enclosing a Petition from the Blood Indians.\n\nIn reply thereto, I wish to state that this matter has had considerable attention from time to time, and the writer is of the opinion that the granting of a holiday at the end of each month to the pupils of both schools, would it is thought create a better feeling towards our educational system on this Agency.\n\nIf such is granted there are certain rules that should be laid down as hard and fast regulations, these suggest should be as follows:\n\nThat such holiday be granted at the end of each month, falling on the last Sunday.\nThat such holiday be from 10 AM on the Saturday Morning, and under no circumstances, should pupils be allowed out on the Friday evening.\nThat all pupils should be returned to the respective schools on Sunday evening at 4 PM.\nThat in the event of parents not returning their children at the stated time, the following month's holiday should be curtailed.\nThat on the opening of Schools in September, any child or children not reporting back to school on the given opening date, should not be granted the privilege of monthly holidays prior to the Xmas term.\n\nThe Principals have not been consulted prior to writing this letter, as their thoughts are known on the subject, and subject to the rules outlined above I do not think that they would object to the granting of the monthly holiday.\n\nIt is understood that the habit of many of the parents not bringing their children back promptly after a holiday, does disrupt their management.\n\nI note that Mr. Allan suggests 9 PM for return, this is considered late for the school management, entailing the settling down of the pupils just prior to bedtime.\n\nIt is also suggested that at Xmas the holiday be from Saturday the 22nd until Wednesday the 26th at 4 PM, with no further holiday until the last Sunday of January.\n\nIt is felt that if the foregoing rules were put into effect by the respective schools, and all breaches of discipline in respect to the holiday treated as suggested, the cooperation of the Indians would be readily given.\n\nThe petition and Mr. Allan's note are herewith returned.\n\nRespectfully submitted and recommended.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nMiss Harwood's copy.\n\nThe letter was handed to me in the presence of Capt. Selkirk who was aware of the contents of same. The signatures are not visible so I saw none of them sign particularly the last ones among whom are the Chief of the Band. I discussed it briefly with Mayor. Individual reasons were given in support of Act rule - i.e., lack of facilities of the children to return to school or business. Changed but the Indians could not see as soon as\nFriday was another day of children's classes. Always have back, if at all, up to noon or Monday and similar events.\n\nIf would appear like that of the children from Nelson homes - and there are many - were released. I am Saturday a returned. I am Sunday, for two of a weekend, for every friend. Because it might be a compromise arrangement worth considering.\n\nMaybe 9 am to 9 pm.\n\nHad no opportunity of debating with whole extended.

We ask that this rule be used against them and an exception be made for those that abide by the rules.\n\nOur children are taken away from us at the age of seven and do not leave school till sixteen (16) years of age. This is the time child needs a mother's care. In a boarding school they are taught to do things in a routine way therefore they have no idea of home life and they lose the respect for the parents, past experience has proven this.\n\nWe ask that we have them home once a month and on all holidays to which a Canadian child is entitled. In this way we hope to do our duty by our children as mothers and fathers, and further more we are human beings and would like justice done to us like any other free people. An Indian is a more attached parent than a white parent. We go through thick and thin even under the poor circumstances in which we are living.\n\nWe ask again that a rule be made to permit that those who do not keep the school rules be punished and that the others have an exception to this rule.\n\nCardston, Alberta, October 22, 1945.\n\nMrs. Jamie Davis\nMrs. Percy Wrighton\nAlice Smallface\nHarry Bade, alias, Biddle\nBernard E.

As pointed out in previous communications, the Principals of the two schools in your Agency have not adhered to the instructions.\n\nIn addition to your request for Christmas Holidays at the Residential Schools in your Agency, we have received similar requests from two other Agencies. As a result, the Director and myself considered the matter sufficiently important to arrange for an interview with the Minister. As you will readily see, the matter of allowing holidays as suggested is not as simple as it sometimes appears. A great many factors have to be considered and what is done in one Agency or for one Residential School would have to apply to all the schools.\n\nAfter giving the matter careful thought, it was considered undesirable to make any change this year in the policy that has been followed for many years.\n\nNo doubt you have noticed in the papers that it is the intention to arrange for a review of Indian administration in Canada this year. At that time the question regarding holidays for pupils attending Residential Schools will be reviewed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nMay 13, 1946\n\nMr. R.A.

Devine, Blood Reserve, Cardston, Alberta, the material part of which reads as follows:\n\n\"May you allow me, on behalf of my people and fellowmen of this Indian Reserve, to lay before you the following complaint we have towards the Indian Department at Ottawa.\n\n\"Sir, Our children's monthly holidays.\n\"It is well known by compilation all children of school age are attending two residential or boarding schools here on this Blood Indian Reserve.\n\"Therefore they are forced away from their homes at the very tender age of seven years when they can scarcely attend to themselves properly, and are kept there until they are sixteen years old when they are discharged.\n\"In former years these children spent every week-end at their homes with their parents. Then the Indian Department stopped these week-end holidays and changed them into monthly holidays; leaving school every first Friday afternoon of the month and returning the following Sunday. But now the Department has entirely put a stop to these holidays.\n\"Last Christmas they only allowed them four days at home, but this last Easter they were completely denied any holidays at home, though all the white children of this Province of Alberta attending schools were allowed ten days at their homes. Therefore we feel this is a grievous injustice.\"\n\"The Department's sole reason for acting so unreasonably is that last Fall some few children were not back on time for school, hence the three hundred and some odd number of children attending these schools are punished innocently for this crime, if it can be called such.\"\n\nAny information you could let me have in connection with this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nM.

Devine, of the Blood Reserve.\n\nAs you are probably aware, it has been our practice to allow two months' holidays each summer to those Indian children enrolled at residential schools whose parents are living and are willing to have them at home for the months of July and August.\n\nThe question of allowing holidays at other periods of the year has been considered on several occasions in the past, but the matter is not as simple as your correspondent appears to indicate.\n\nIn view of the recent appointment of a Parliamentary Committee to review Indian Affairs in Canada, I feel that it is undesirable to make any change until the Committee reviews the whole situation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J. Goldwell, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI have received a request from the Cowessess Indians, through their Councillor Norbert Sparvier, for Christmas leave for their children attending Residential Schools, from December 24th to January 6th, inclusive. They write as follows:\n\n\"We request that you contact the Indian Department at Ottawa for permission to grant leave from school for the Christmas Holidays, to all Cowessess children wherever they may be, namely, Cowessess Residential School, Round Lake, Brandon, Lestock and elsewhere. We suggest that, with the clear understanding that all children must go back to School at the appointed time. The Christmas leave to start from December 24th 1946 to January 6th 1947, both dates inclusive.

Also there is sometimes drinking at Christmas.\n\nFr. de Salle of St. Mary's (Missionary) feels that they are entitled to have their children and it may be a way of helping to teach parents some improvements in way of living etc.\n\nI agree with the arguments of all three. We should like to see the children go home, but there will be many difficulties. There will be just as much hardship for the children to go home as for the parents to come in. (They are not able to get lodging, however, in town at Christmas.)\n\nHoping that we may have a reply on this matter soon, so that we may have time to write all the parents,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMr. W.J.D.

Hoey,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI received your letter regarding Christmas Holidays for Residential Schools. I understand the Minister's attitude in referring this question to the Joint Committee. However, I feel justified in asking authorization to send home, for Christmas Holidays, the children whose parents are willing to take home, for the following reasons:\n\n1... We have in our district, a group of Indians who are influenced by some politicians and who are trying to find all kinds of grievances against the present Indian Administration and our system of education.\n\nIt is a general feeling among our good Indians that the granting of Christmas Holidays would appease many bad feelings towards the School and would bring more sympathy towards the Indian Affairs Branch. (Can we really blame the parents to want their children home, at least a few times during the year. Is this not a natural desire?).\n\n2... The Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School used to grant Christmas Holidays some twenty years ago. It became a financial problem. Many children did not return promptly and others came back suffering from some sickness etc.\n\nIt is evident that the conditions of the Indians in our district have changed. I am confident that nowadays the Christmas Holidays would have many advantages.\n\n3... When the Joint Committee will consider this matter, how will it be able to determine that the time has come or not for the Indian children in Residential Schools, to be allowed with success, Christmas Holidays, if there is no experiment made? Since we have here, children coming from twelve different reserves, would not our School be an ideal one to make the experiment? I would be glad to send you an extensive report of the success or lack of success obtained; the reactions of the parents, the feelings of the children etc.\nIndian Residential School\n\nLebret, Saskatchewan\n\n4... It would be understood that the parents would take the responsibility of the transportation of their children. They would come for them or have them sent on the train at their own expenses. The highest fare (return ticket) to be paid would be $1.60 for children over 12 and $0.90 for those under 12.\n\n5... There would be a great disappointment among the majority of our Indians if the children are not going home this year for Christmas Holidays, because for the last three years especially, the parents have been pressing us strongly with their demand to have their children home at Christmas. These demands have always been deferred until the following year.\n\n6... We would be in a better position this year, to exact from the parents, good care of their children and a prompt return. Thus, a precedent would be created which would be a guide in our future policy.\n\n7... If holidays are not granted to our children this year, knowing the present spirit of the parents, I am afraid that we would have to face many difficulties coming from the ill-feelings of both parents and children.\n\nI hope that you will give my request your consideration. I would greatly appreciate an answer at your earliest convenience.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nP.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRE CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEARS HOLIDAYS.\n\nThe Indians have been informed that the authorities at Ottawa are not in favor and oppose the granting of school holidays to Indian children during the yuletide season.\n\nNo one knows the real reason why the Indian Department at Ottawa takes that attitude towards the granting of those holidays.\n\nThe churches and their missionaries who have custody of the Indian children have repeatedly told the Indians that they are in favor of giving the holidays to the children, as one missionary put it, \"in the spirit of peace on earth and goodwill towards all men.\"\n\nIn the past, some schools have granted the holidays to the pupils of their schools, and as far as we can ascertain, no ill effects on the children was noticed as a result of the holidays.\n\nAs far as we can ascertain, the authorities at Ottawa oppose the granting of those holidays because of sickness and epidemics.\n\nWe quite agree that if epidemics are in progress, isolation is the best means of preventing the disease from spreading.\n\nBut to believe and be of the opinion that the holidays in themselves are the cause of epidemics is something hard to understand.\n\nWe must remember, on some reserves the standard of living is remarkably high.\n\nAnother possible reason why the Indian Officials at Ottawa oppose the holidays may be, because in some districts a school may not be on an Indian Reserve. Some Indian schools serve several reserves, those reserves may be widely separated and many miles apart.\n\nThe school in these cases is located at as near a central point as is possible.\n\nIn those cases there may be some virtue in keeping the children at school because of transportation difficulties.\n\nIn Alberta nearly all schools are located on an Indian reserve; hence, there is practically no transportation problems.\n\nThere are no real difficulties in getting the children back to school.\n\nWhen the school is located on an Indian reserve there is no reason why the children should not be granted the school holidays.\n\nThe point we wish to raise is this, why make a regulation general in its effect when that regulation is necessary only because it serves the purpose in one or two cases, or why break the legs of all the Indians because one or two Indians broke their legs.\n\nWhen making regulations one must never forget the possible effects which a regulation may have on the Indians in general.\n\nThe Indians have been led to believe that the Christmas holidays are a great cause for happiness and rejoicing, an event to look forward to for family reunions in a spirit of thankfulness that God has been kind and has preserved our health and our lives for the occasion.\n\n(Cont next page.)\nThe Indian has been told, on Christmas Day a Savior was born as a manifestation of the tolerance and goodness of God.\n\nA large number of the Indians actually believe that the Indian department at Ottawa oppose the granting of Christmas holidays because, originally, the holidays were a white man's affair and that the Indian children do not deserve the holidays merely because they are Indians.\n\nAll white children in the neighborhood of this reserve will be at home, away from the formalities and restricting of school life.\n\nThe poor Indian child, because of an inhumane regulation will be kept behind high walls and closed doors as it were.\n\nWhen those men who are in favor of and support such a regulation sit down at their Christmas table with their own children will they think of the misery they have caused others.\n\nHISERY\n\nTEDDY YELLOWFLY.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Dec. 10, 1946.\n\nMINUTES OF BLACKFOOT COUNCIL MEETING\n\nThe minutes of Blackfoot Council Meeting held in the office of the Indian Agent, Monday, December 9, 1946.\n\nChristmas holidays\n\nYellowfly addressed the Council and stated that he had been informed that Ottawa was not allowing Christmas holidays for Indian school children this year. He read a prepared brief to the Council (copy attached) which was loudly applauded. Most Councillors spoke on this issue - all with strenuous objections. The Council then wished to go on record as being unanimous in asking the Department to reconsider this rule, and they ask that Christmas holidays be given the Blackfoot Indian Children at the discretion of the Principals of Schools in conference with the Acting Agent. It was also the Council's wish that the Acting Agent report this wish to the Department, by letter, at once. This the Chairman promised to do.\n\n(Signed) R.D.

Glen, M.P.,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nI have been consulted by an Indian delegation from Qu'Appelle, that has made the request that the children at the Indian residence school at Lebret be granted Christmas holidays this year. I am advised that the teaching staff enjoys Christmas leave between December 20th and January 3rd. During this period the children will therefore not receive any instruction, and their parents are extremely anxious that they spend the Christmas vacation at home.\n\nI am advised that Chief John Stevenson communicated with Mr. Hoey of your Department regarding this matter, and that leave was refused. So far as I know, there exists no compelling reason why these children should not enjoy their vacation in their own homes.\n\nI wonder if you would, therefore, look into this matter as soon as possible in order that consideration may be given to granting this request before the 20th of this month.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention to this matter,\n\nI remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) T.C. Douglas.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDecember 16th, 1946.\n\nTo the - Acting Deputy Minister\n\nAttention Director of Indian Affairs\n\nPlease find attached letter to the Minister, dated Dec. 10, 1946, from the Hon. T. C. Douglas, Premier of Saskatchewan, Regina, Sask., concerning the request of an Indian delegation from Qu'Appelle that the children at the Indian residence school at Lebret be granted Christmas holidays this year, as the teaching staff has Christmas leave between Dec. 20th and Jan. 3rd, and the children receive no instructions during this period.\n\nPlease have a letter prepared for the Minister's signature to the Hon. Mr. Douglas.\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nMr. Hoey:\nFor draft reply as requested.\nHonourable T.C. Douglas,\nPremier of Saskatchewan,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Douglas:\n\nI have received your letter of December 10th with reference to allowing holidays at Christmas time to the Indian children attending the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you probably are aware, it has been our practice to allow two months' holidays each summer to those Indian children enrolled at a residential school whose parents are living and who are willing to have them at home for the months of July and August.\n\nFor physical and other reasons, we have always felt that it was in the best interests of the children to remain in the residential schools during the Christmas holiday period and from reports received, I believe that all our schools provided special food and entertainment for the children at this period of the year.\n\nHowever, in recent years, we have received requests from a few Principals of Indian residential schools and from some Indian parents to allow Christmas holidays.\nHonourable T.C. Douglas - 2,\n18 December 1946.\n\nRecently the matter was carefully reviewed with Departmental of Indians and it was decided to make an experiment this year with certain of our residential schools. As a consequence, Principals of the u'Appelle, Tile Hills and Gordon's Indian Residential schools were advised in a letter dated December 12th, that Christmas holidays would be allowed this year to the pupils attending these schools. Each of the three Principals is making a special report on the reaction of all persons concerned.\n\nIt is our intention to review the results in order to decide if this privilege should be continued in future and extended to other Indian residential schools throughout the Dominion.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nRE CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S HOLIDAYS.\n\nThe Indians have been informed that the authorities at Ottawa are not in favor and oppose the granting of school holidays to Indian children during the yuletide season.\n\nOne does know the real reason why the Indian department at Ottawa takes that attitude towards the granting of those holidays. The churches and their missionaries who have custody of the Indian children have repeatedly told the Indian that they are in favor of giving the holidays to the children, as one missionary put it, \"in the spirit of peace on earth and goodwill towards all men\".\n\nIn the past, some schools have granted holidays to the pupils of their schools, and as far as we can ascertain, no ill effects on the children was noticed as a result of the holidays. As far as we can ascertain, the authorities at Ottawa oppose the granting of those holidays because of sickness and epidemics. We quite agree, that if epidemics are in progress, isolation is the best means of preventing the disease from spreading. But to believe and be of the opinion that the holidays in themselves are the cause of epidemics is something hard to understand. We must remember, on some reserves the standard of living is remarkably high.\n\nAnother possible reason why the Indian officials at Ottawa oppose the holidays may be, because in some districts a school may not be on an Indian Reserve, some Indian schools serve several reserves, those reserves may be widely separated and many miles apart. The school in these cases is located at as near a central point as possible. In those cases there may be some virtue in keeping the children at school because of transportation difficulties. In Alberta nearly all schools are located on an Indian reserve, hence, there is practically no transportation problems. There are no real difficulties in getting the children back to school when the school is located on an Indian reserve there is no reason why the children should not be granted the school holidays.\n\nThe point we wish to raise is this, why make a regulation general in its effect when that regulation is necessary only because it serves the purpose in one or two cases. Or why break the legs of all the Indians because one or two Indians broke their legs? When making regulations one must never forget the possible effects which a regulation may have on the Indians in general.\n\nThe Indians have been led to believe that the Christmas holidays are a great cause for happiness and rejoicing, an event to look forward to for family reunions in a spirit of thankfulness that God has been kind and has preserved our health and or liver for the occasion. The Indian has been told, on Christmas day a Saviour was born as a manifestation of the tolerance and goodness of God.\n\nA large number of the Indians actually believe that the Indian department at Ottawa opposes the granting of Christmas holidays because, originally, the holidays were a white man's affair and that the Indian children do not deserve the holidays, merely because they are Indians. All white children in the neighborhood of this reserve will be at home, away from the formalities and restricting of school life. The poor Indian child, because of an humane regulation, will be kept behind high walls and closed doors as it were. When those men who are in favor of or support such a regulation sit down at their Christmas table with their own children will they think of the misery they have caused others.\n\nSigned Teddy Yellowfly\nChristmas Holidays\nBlackfoot Reserve.\n\nBy Blackfoot Indian Council Meeting of Dec. 9th, we were requested to write the Department re the wish of the Blackfoot Band, through their Council, that school children should have Christmas holidays this season.\n\nThe meeting minute, pertaining to this reads as follows:\n\n\"Christmas Holidays\nYellowfly addressed the Council and stated that he had been informed that Ottawa was not allowing Christmas holidays for Indian school children this year. He read a prepared brief to the Council (copy attached) which was loudly applauded. Most Councillors spoke on this issue - all with strenuous objections. The Council then wished to go on record as being unanimous in asking the Department to reconsider this issue and they ask that Christmas holidays be given the Blackfoot Indian children at the discretion of the Principals of Schools in conference with the Acting Agent. It was also the Council's wish that the Acting Agent report this wish to the Department, by letter, at once. This the Chairman promised to do.\" The brief referred to is attached hereto for your information.\n\nThe writer strongly recommends that these holidays be allowed. On this Reserve the homes of children are all near the school and with the transportation available no difficulty is anticipated in getting them either to or from these homes.\n\nR.D.

Hoey,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe: Home leave for Pupils during Term.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI am taking the liberty of addressing you personally on a matter important to the conduct of this school, that is, the granting of leave to local children to visit their homes once or twice a week during the school term, and at Christmas and Easter.\n\nPerhaps you may be aware that, at the time of my appointment here, there were two major problems..... apart from finance. They were, first, discipline and conduct within the school, and secondly, the relationship between the school and the local Indians.\n\nThe two problems, I decided, had some bearing on each other. The local pupils were allowed to go home at times during the week and the parents were permitted to take them out of school to make purchases for them in the Town. Many complaints had been received about pupil conduct outside of the school, and, naturally, any and all misdemeanours occurring on the reserves or in the neighbourhood were blamed on the school pupils.\n\nAnother circumstance that had an acute bearing on school discipline was the fact that the local Indian people had, when this school catered mainly to the local Agency, looked upon the school as pertaining to them particularly. On the enlargement of the school ressentiment arose and strong hostility was met by the \"non-Indians\" pupils from distant Agencies, who had been transferred here from the old Coqualeetza school. Local parents insulated this resentment in their children attending the school. Further, because of this condition, local parents were constant in their demand for special privileges for their children.\n\nMr. Scott, my predecessor, has told me that he also recognised the leave for local children as being subversive of order and discipline and tried to institute a prohibitory rule, but was unsuccessful against the demands of the local parents. As a new Principal, I instituted the rule and have adhered to it rigidly. The reasons for it, as noted here, and also in regard to possibly the more important matter of general school health, has been fully explained to the local Indian parents, both individually and collectively. Some six months after I took over the school, on the first visit of Major MacKay, the local parents met with him here and made a request for the discarding of the \"no home leave\" regulation. At that meeting the whole matter was gone into, emphasizing the matter of Health, the local Indians having explained to them fully the very excellent system of detecting and eliminating T.B. among the pupils by X-ray and Tuberculin Test Clinics which is conducted at the school, among all pupils, as soon after the summer vacation as possible, during which summer vacation the disease could be and all too frequently is contracted by pupils by contagion at the Canneries. It was explained that two or three such Clinics are conducted at the school after the summer vacation, and that, after three months of such test and detection, it is safe to assume that the exonerated pupils are free from contraction of the disease during the rest of the term........ so long as they do not have further opportunities from outside. Frequent leave, such as was demanded by the parents, during the term, would provide such means of contagion, and would neutralise the usefulness of the Clinics. There are a number of active T.B. cases on the local reserves.\nFurther, on my first visit to parents, on distant reserves, during my first summer here, complaints were received that pupils had returned home in June with scabies and headlice, where they had been sent to school clean the previous September. I investigated, and in one house on the local reserve I found severe cases of scabies and impetigo among the pre-school age children and, in this house also, an advanced case of T.B., in a boy nine years old, since dead. This was a home that some of the school children visited when permitted leave. Headlice was even more prevalent on the reserves. Many of the Indian homes were very clean and well cared for, but there are the exceptions that provide the infection.\n\nAfter prohibiting home leave, I instructed my staff that head-lice, scabies and impetigo, which are fairly prevalent when the pupils return to school in September, must be eliminated by intensive treatment within one month after the pupils return. This, I may say, is entirely possible when the pupils have been removed from outside contagion, and it has been done. However great an effort is made in the school to control these conditions, however, we occasionally get infection of this nature from children coming with their parents to visit pupils in the school, visiting which is permitted on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday Afternoons each week. As must be obvious the regular and the great majority of visitors are from the local reserves.\n\nAll this, as I say, was explained to the local Indian people, and they readily admitted the facts and that conditions had much improved since the \"no leave\" rule had been instituted. But, with the notorious insistence of the Indian on the preservation of his rights (or what, in this instance, had been permitted as a privilege) and finally considered by them as a \"right\" they still insisted that they wanted their children home. The relationship of the school with the Indian people has been quite harmonious, with the exception of this matter of home leave, and even this has been dormant until just before last Christmas.\n\nI am enclosing a letter just published in the local paper, signed by one George Clute, who is an intelligent man, at least up to the point where logic and reason meets up with racial stubbornness in the protection of so-called \"rights.\" He is possibly the most vociferous in the present demand. I may say that George has two small children in the school, placed here since the rule in question went into effect. This rule was specifically agreed to by him as a condition of his placing his children in the school.\n\nA few of the local parents work in the lumber mills here and are members of the I.W.A. Union. This Union, whose reputation, I am sure, is nation wide, is rather notorious for taking up any matter that might embarrass the Government or Government institutions. Just before last Christmas, the officials of this Union petitioned the City Councils of Port Alberni and of Alberni, the Provincial Member of Parliament, appealing for their intervention in the matter of home leave for the local Indian pupils. The Mayors of the two towns and the local Member immediately phoned me acquainting me with the complaint, and saying that there should have been obvious to the Union officials even after discounting their irrationality of thought and procedure wherever they think they can stir up trouble) that the matter was no business of theirs. I phoned the Secretary of the Union and explained the situation to him again. I invited him to come and look over the school so that he could become acquainted with the situation they were interested in. He promised to come the following day, but has not been here yet. In spite of the information and invitation I had given him, he still later appeared before the Councils and as a result the matter was aired in the local newspapers, with some totally erroneous statements such as that the parents were only allowed to visit one hour a week. To correct Public Opinion I wrote to the Councils explaining the reason for the leave prohibition. I particularly asked for no newspaper controversy, but the Councils thought that the public should be informed and the rebuttal was published in the papers and the matter dropped.\nMr. Hoey, (3)\n\nI may say also that, while this controversy was in progress, I received your circular letter on this very matter, in reference to the experiment being made on three Reserves in Saskatchewan, and stating that the result of this experiment would govern Department policy regarding inter-term pupil leave in the future. Also, the circular stated that leave permitted last Christmas only applied to the three schools in question. Other schools would continue with the long-established policy of the Department in extending no leave.\n\nAs the case for the establishment of the \"no leave\" rule had been placed directly on myself (the thing the Indian people cannot understand is that other schools, including the Islamic residential school at Kakawis, permit frequent home leave for their pupils... I must confess I cannot understand this situation either) I mentioned to the Councils, and this subsequently appeared in the newspaper, that the prohibition was a Department ruling.\n\nOne would have thought that here the matter could have been entirely dropped, but recently Clutecl was invited to speak at an A.O.T.S. Club meeting in the United Church. He voluntarily took Indians \"wrong\" as his subject and read the enclosed letter at the meeting. Dr. Dorsey was expected on a visit the following week and it was decided to place the matter before him. (I was not present at the A.O.T.S. meeting) Dr. Dorsey was here last week and an Indian delegation of three met him and the letter written by Clutecl was read again. I was present and went over the argument again (a procedure which I knew from experience would be futile) and clinched the matter with reference to the recent epidemic of a rather bad type of measles, and also mumps, on the local reserves. We did not have a single case in the school, but could not possibly have avoided it had the children been granted the leave the parents are asking for.... as, of course, the contagious period of measles is before the parents, and especially Indian parents, could have detected symptoms of the disease. As expected, however, no argument could convince the Indian delegates that their rights were not being infringed, hence Dr. Dorsey can wholly in accord with the present rules put it to him that I had a choice of two evils... keep to the rule and incur the continued ill-feeling (on this point alone) of the local Indians, or abandon the rule and run the risk of infection among the 230 pupils in residence. One cannot question as to which choice is the wise one.\n\nI am writing this, not because of any wish for Department assistance in the local situation, but in regard to the effect of possible future Department policy on the situation at this school. In view of the announcement of future policy as mentioned in your circular letter previously referred to, I told the delegation that I would conform to the Department policy regarding home leave as soon as such policy was announced. Referring to the practice at other residential schools, specifically the Kakawis School, the delegation still insisted that the matter of home leave rested with me as the Principal. May I, therefore, outline future possible policy as it might apply to conditions at this school.\n\n1st. The Saskatchewan schools at which the Christmas experiment was conducted, cater, I believe, to mainly local pupils. All, or practically all, would conveniently go home on occasional weekly leave, or at Christmas and Easter. The Alberni school draws a large proportion of its pupilage from distant Agencies, Alert Bay, Queen Charlottes, Naam-Skema (Prince Rupert), Behime (Hastleton) Bella Coola, etc., as well as from the West Coast Agency. It would be obviously impossible for home leave to be taken advantage of by any but a small percentage of the pupils.\nLocal pupils at this school number approximately 30 out of a total pupilage of 230. About 70 pupils (exclusive of the local Alberni pupils) are from the West Coast Agency, and could conceivably be permitted leave within the periods of the Christmas and Easter holidays. However, it would appear that the parents of many of these West Coast Agency pupils do not desire such leave. The Alberni people, in order to press and gain their demand for home leave, have, on a number of occasions, sought to enlist the support of other native Bands along the Alberni Canal. These bands have consistently refused to ask for a change in the present rules. Many have expressed their approval of the present system verbally, and I have voluntary letters on file from them. One of these dated Nov. 5th 1948, from Fort Albion (Ucluelet). I will quote from\u2014\n\n\"Dear Mr. Caldwell, I'm sure glad that you are keeping up with rules in the school. I sure would be disappointed if you had the kids running around free. Keep it up, Mr. Caldwell. Your doing splendid work. All the people from here that has children there are all satisfied with the kids for being kept in the school grounds, otherwise, had they been free, anything happens in the reserve the school boys would get the blame. Remember, Mr. Caldwell, good word is good against one whole Indian Reserve........... We have a few Alberni Indian women here at this cannery that told us about the school, but remember, we are not against you at all. Keep up the good work all Ucluelets are quite satisfied with your good work at that school.\"\n\nSigned. (Philip Mack.)\n\nI quote this to indicate that the demand for leave is purely a local one and is not only not supported, but is actually opposed by other Bands within the same Agency.\n\nPermitting the 30 local children to frequent their own, and other's homes on the local reserves, coming in contact with, not only \"outside,\" but \"contagious\" cases of T.B., would neutralize the whole excellent T.B. control programme (as outlined herein), now in practice, and would endanger the whole 230 pupils in the school. This would also apply to epidemics of measles, mumps, etc., and to conditions of impetigo, scabies and headlice which are common in some of the less progressive homes on the reserves. In other words, it would scarcely be possible for the Principal to accept responsibility for health conditions in the school, emanating from sources over which he has no control.\n\nPermitting the 30 local pupils \"home leave\" has been, and would again be, upsetting to the 200 children who could not visit their homes because of the distance involved, and this condition would have a detrimental effect on school discipline.\n\nThe circular letter above referred to in connection with the experiment conducted last Christmas in the three Saskatchewan residential schools, indicated that from the result of this experiment a Department policy would be formed. It is fairly obvious such policy would apply to all Indian residential schools as the impracticability of granting special privileges to individual Indian cases is well known. It should be obvious also, however, that a policy applicable to a school catering mainly to local pupils might not apply to conditions as a school such as this, where the pupils come from widely distant homes. It might be possible, without too greatly disturbing the whole residential school system, for such a policy of \"home leave\" to be applied regionally, leaving the schools of British Columbia, for instance, where, in nearly all cases, the pupils are gathered from distant Agencies, out of the \"home leave\" regulation, if such should be found to be feasible as a result of the Saskatchewan experiment.\nIn conclusion, may I suggest a solution to the condition here at Alberni, one that would do away with all friction between the residential school and the local Indian people, and would meet with the approval of these people.\n\nThe approximately 30 pupils from local homes attending this school could all be accommodated in a day-school situated centrally on the Sheshatshai Reserve, on the River Road, adjacent to the town of Alberni. There is a site for a school, with space for playgrounds. This school could also accommodate some ten children, in addition to the 30 already in this school, for whom accommodation is not at present available in this school. I believe an appropriation has already been requested for such a school, by the United Church, and more recently by the West Coast Indian Agency. It might be suggested that these local pupils could attend the Public Schools in the Alberni Valley, and there would, I think, be no objection to this by the Public school authorities, but the fact is that the school population of the Alberni Valley has increased enormously during the past two years and there is no prospect of accommodation for elementary Indian pupils for some time to come. May I therefore request that the matter of the providing of the day-school be given immediate consideration.\n\nI would not have the Department think that there is too much confinement of pupils in this school. My policy has been to provide as much opportunity of the Indian pupils mixing with the \"whites\" as possible. To that end, football, baseball and boxing is encouraged with the \"whites\" in competition. Our pupils visit the sports grounds of the two Cities and teams from the Cities come to the school. This experiment, carried out during the past two years, has been essentially successful, both in establishing normal companionship between the Indian and \"white\" pupils, and in engendering an affection of the Indian pupils among white residents generally. Our football team is so well known that usually, when a British freighter is loading at Port Alberni, the Sailor's Institute arranges a game between the crew and our senior boys.\n\nFurther, we have four pupils attending grade 10 in the Public High School, where they are greatly appreciated, are themselves very happy, and are doing well in their studies.\n\nThe local Indian parents, I may say, are given every opportunity of visiting the school, even beyond the hours and days specified as for visiting. Parents wishing to make purchases in Town for their children are always permitted to do so in company with their children, except that, in order not to break the rule established, and to make sure that the children are not taken to the homes, the pupils are taken to town by school car or truck, left with the parents for the required period and then conveyed back to school again.\n\nI trust that you will pardon the length of this explanation. My desire is to acquaint you with the conditions at this school applicable to the matter of \"home leave,\" now under your consideration. I am sure that Dr. Dorey will substantiate the information I have given you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nPerhaps I should add, as throwing some light on the present relationship between the school and the local Indians, that George Clutesi, the writer of the attached letter, who has quite some reputation, rather more than Province-wide, as a Native Artist, voluntarily comes to the school once or twice a week to give lessons in art to the pupils.\nThe Safety Valve\n\nOpinions expressed in letters to the Editor are not necessarily those of the newspaper.\n\n(Regarding recently a talk given by George Clutesi to a meeting of the A.O.S.S., Mr. Clutesi gave a brief account. Due to the brevity of the report, Mrs. Clutesi felt that her views had not been thoroughly outlined. Since the matter is important to many Indians, Mr. Clutesi has condensed his talk and submitted it to the Safety Valve. Following is his letter.)\n\nMr. Chairman, Gentlemen:\n\nIt is with sincere gratitude that I stand before you to submit our account concerning our children's holidays, especially Christmas and Easter holidays, to you.\n\nWe, the parents of the two local bands, namely the Ojibway and Ojibwa bands do hereby respectfully request that our children be permitted to go home on Saturdays during the Christmas and Easter. Children need not stay overnight.\n\nWe will further declare that contrary to past allegations, implications, or judgments, we are quite capable of responsibly guarding the general welfare of our own child while in our custody for the weekend.\n\nWe believe and declare that it is not to the best advantage of a small child to be completely separated from the surroundings of its immediate home life and are not asking too much. Won't you advise us? Won't you assist us in this fight for our loved ones?\n\nI thank you.\n\nG. C.

CALDWELL\n\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIn reading over the attached letter I am impressed with the fact that such a letter would have a tremendous sympathetic influence on an uninformed public. I fancy much of the trouble caused the Department in Indian affairs comes through the channels of a romantically inclined, but factually ignorant public.\n\nI have been exclusively in Indian work, of practically all phases, for over twenty years, and the fact that I am still in the work is evidence that I am not unsympathetically disposed towards Indians and their problems and conditions. The attached letter would indicate a deep emotional sensitivity as an Indian trait. I am afraid that my experience has yet to find such in the Indian race. There is emotional sensitivity; it is true, but it is essentially superficial.\n\nThe writer of the letter has become \"inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity\"..... and that is a decided Indian trait. His overwhelming desire for contact with his children is not particularly apparent in that he does not take very regular advantage of the opportunity afforded him to visit them in the school.\n\nTo one who understands Indian nature the letter provides a typical example of Indian psychology. I would say, advisedly, that the Indian, generally, is as yet incapable of any depth of sensibility, and this applies to domestic affection. Undoubtedly, they are not yet far enough removed from savage custom and tradition. In many cases still, and among the more advanced communities, the wife is a chattel and marriages are arranged without the consent of the two contractants. Indian girls, mainly through the teaching of the schools, are just emerging from the condition where they accept such \"arranged\" marriages docilely, and are looking for something more in a husband than just a good \"provider\".\n\nI do not say that they have no form of affection for their children. The affection they display is something of the nature of the affection of a child for her doll. This applies only while the children are quite young.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, April 11, 1947.\n\nHome Leave for Pupils during Term.\n\nDear Mr. Caldwell:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 21. During the last few days Colonel Henry, our Superintendent of Welfare and Training, has also had an opportunity of discussing, with the reverend Dr. Dorey, the problems which you raise in your letter.\n\nIt has been decided to place this whole question of home leave for pupils at residential schools before the sub-committee on Education of the Joint Parliamentary Committee into the Indian Act. It would be appreciated if we could have your permission to place before the committee your letter and the attached newspaper article.\n\nIn closing may I say that I realize only too well the difficult situation in which you are placed and your sincerity in presenting these facts to us.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\n\nA.

CALDWELL\n\n150-37 (W.T.)\n\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nApril 20th 1947.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe: Home Leave for Pupils during Term.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI have your letter of April 11th in reply to my letter of March 21st, regarding the matter of home leave. I have no objection whatever to you placing the correspondence before the Joint Parliamentary Committee. The matter referred to is only a local one, but the situation must be duplicated in other instances, and it is an indication of the many complexities of Indian Administration.\n\nI have had Mr. Davis, the School Inspector, here recently on his first visit and we discussed the matter of school leaves and the effect of the present conditions on the local Indian people. I agree with him that the better solution would be to arrange for the local Indian pupils to attend the Public School in Alberni. A school bus service would make such attendance very convenient. This bus service is now in operation for the public school pupils, including the High School pupils attending from this school. However, Mr. Davis felt that, due to the lack of accommodation at the Public Schools, with no prospect of improvement for some years, the only present solution would be the establishment of a day school on the Reserve. No doubt he will be reporting on this matter.\n\nIn an effort to cope with the dissatisfaction which arises out of the present situation, I requested the Supervisor of the Alberni District Schools to take up the matter of the entry of Indian children in the public schools with the School Board. This he did at a meeting last Monday and he reports back to me that, while the Board would have no objection to Indian pupils attending the Public Schools, there is no prospect of accommodation being available for them for a long time. The situation in the local Public Schools is perhaps unique. This is a fast growing community. A year ago the local High School accommodated 120 pupils. There are now 600 pupils and the High School is being accommodated in temporary buildings of an Army Camp. The elementary school population is now 2800; with crowded accommodation. Further, on the present population alone, it is estimated that the pupilage of both the High and the Elementary Schools will double in the next six years.\nI give the foregoing information to indicate that the Public Schools cannot very well be considered as a solution to our local educational problem.\n\nI am enclosing a cutting from the local paper of this week, making mention of a resolution passed by the Native Brotherhood at their Convention at Nanaimo recently. It is worthy of note that this resolution was presented by the representative from the Alberni Reserve. I do not suppose there was any presentation made of reasons for the weekly leave restrictions. It is likely the Rev. Peter Kelly will be a Brotherhood delegate to the Joint Committee. It might be productive of good if this whole matter of inter-term leave, with all the facts pro and con to hand, were discussed with him.\n\nI scarcely think it is fair to expect responsibility on the part of a Principal for school health should this home leave be allowed. The visiting of relatives, and especially pre-school-age children (which is permitted here on three afternoons each week) provides in itself a considerable health risk. Our experience this year goes far to prove this. During the winter there was a severe epidemic of measles outside the school and on the reserves. I quarantined the visitors during the epidemic and we did not have one case in the school. Just now there is an epidemic of \"flu\" in the district. This got into the school last Sunday and we have had over seventy cases during the week. With such a non-registered nurse in charge, this is a period of strain that could have been avoided if we did not have the local public situation. I certainly would not suggest any such drastic step as to prohibit visiting at the school, but, in our case, our main corridors are full of parents and children during the whole afternoons of Sunday, Wednesday and Saturday, and, if there is any cause of infection, the opportunity thus afforded is ample.\n\nIn view of the condition at the Public Schools in this district, I would be glad if the Department would give serious consideration to the prospect of giving the local Indians a day school on the Reserve.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nCorrection Made\n\nIn the article last week's issue covering the B.C. Band's annual meeting held at Masset recently, one of the resolutions passed at the meeting was stated as follows:\n\n\"That no longer will children whose parents reside on a reserve be taken out of school one half day per week.\"\n\nThe statement was incorrect, but was stated mistakenly through misinterpretation of a briefly written report submitted to the paper.\n\nOn the advice of T. Shewish, Alberni district representative at the meeting, the corrected resolution is as follows:\n\n\"That children may be allowed half a day each Saturday to visit their parents on the reserve.\"\n\n[Signature]\n\nWest Coast Advocate\n\nAlberni\n\nApril 27, 1947\nOttawa, May 7th, 1947.\n\nMr. James Coleman, Inspector of Agencies,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter recently received from Mr. Caldwell, Principal of the Alberni Residential School.\n\nThe Department would appreciate it if you would have Inspector Davey discuss the whole matter with Mr. Caldwell on the occasion of Mr. Davey's next visit to Alberni.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nTO PRINCIPALS OF INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS.\n\nThis letter will deal with two main points in the administration of Indian Residential Schools.\n\n(a) Christmas Holidays\n(b) Qualifications of Teachers.\n\n(a) Christmas Holidays:\n\nAs you are aware, it has not been the practice of the Department to allow holidays at Christmas. For physical and other reasons, we have always felt that it was in the best interests of the children to remain in the residential schools during the Christmas holiday period and from reports received, we were under the impression that all our schools provided special food and entertainment for the children at this period of the year.\n\nHowever, in recent years we have had increased requests from some Principals and from some Indian parents to allow Christmas holidays and due to changing conditions we decided last year to conduct an experiment with certain of our residential schools.\n\nIt was decided to allow Christmas holidays to pupils attending the Qu'Appelle, the File Hills and the Gordon's Residential Schools. A survey form was completed by each principal after the holidays. Of 447 pupils granted leave, 430 (96%) returned on the proper date. The number of returnees would have been higher but for a severe storm (-40 degrees below zero) at the time. The reaction of the principals was varied -- with two being decidedly in favour of the plan and one opposed. In all instances the physical condition of the children on their return was good. The reaction of the parents and children was decidedly favourable.\n\nTherefore, the Department has decided on the following policy with regard to Christmas Holidays for Residential Schools:\n\n(a) Due to the widely varying conditions existing in our residential schools, the decision as to the permitting of children to return to their homes at Christmas will be left in the hands of the principal of the school. In some schools it is a relatively easy matter to send the children home, in others it is very difficult. Taking this factor and others into account, it is felt that the principal of the school concerned is the one who should make this decision. It is suggested that before making his decision known, each principal should consult his local Indian Agent and also the principals of other residential schools in the area (if any).\n\n(b) Those children whose home conditions are suitable may be allowed to go home on December 20 on the distinct understanding that they will return to the school by January 4, 1948.\n\n(c) It must be clearly understood by all concerned that the transportation of the children both ways will be paid by the parents. Neither the Department nor the school management is expected to incur this expenditure.\n(d) No claim can be made for Family Allowances for the 14 days the children are at home.\n\n(e) Each child should take home his progress record card for signature by his parents or guardians.\n\n(f) The Department will make a full per capita grant for the children who are on Christmas holidays.\n\nIt is suggested that a mimeographed letter be sent to the parents of these children outlining the above facts which immediately concern them. In certain instances, principals may wish to point out to parents the fact that future Christmas holidays for their children depend on their compliance with the above regulations.\n\n(b) Qualifications of Teachers:\n\nIn order to present an accurate picture of the qualifications of our teachers to the parliamentary committee we wish to have the attached forms completed by each classroom teacher. Would all principals please have their teachers complete these forms and have them forwarded to the Department within five days after the arrival of this letter.\n\nDirector.\nTo: PRINCIPALS OF INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS, and\nINDIAN AFFAIRS FIELD OFFICIALS:\n\nRe: Christmas Holidays for Children Attending Residential Schools.\n\nAs you are aware, it has not been the practice of the Department to allow holidays at Christmas.

After discussion and expressions of views it was moved by Chief Shot on Both Sides, and seconded by Joe Bullshield that the A/Agent communicate with the Department requesting school holidays for pupils of Blood residential Schools for the Christmas season of 1947. Carried unanimously.\n\nCopied:\nCS\n\nNOV 19 1947\nR.D. Regan,\nA/Indian Agent.\nIndian Residential School\nLebret, Saskatchewan\n\nNovember 12th 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your circular letter No. 24 to Principals of Indian Residential Schools Re: Christmas Holidays for children attending Residential Schools.\n\nI sincerely appreciate the Department's decision with regard to these holidays. Paragraph (b) states that children may be allowed to go home on December 20 on the distinct understanding that they will return to the school by January 6, 1948. May we be permitted here to send the pupils home on December 22 and have them returned on January 6, 1948. The reason for this demand is that the children are leaving and coming back on the train and the train on Saturdays passes late at night whereas it passes in the forenoon on Mondays. We feel that it would be more convenient for the parents to meet their children at the station during daytime. The same applies for the return.\n\nKnowing your interest in Indian Schools' activities, I take pleasure in enclosing an article published in the \"Cadet Bulletin\" Sept. 1947- Sask. Area. The success of our Hugonard Cadet Corps brought great honor to our boys.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nP. Piche O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R.A.

SEPTEMBER 1st, 1920\n\nThe Red Cross as a Peace-time Organization\n\n\"The members of the League agree to encourage and promote the establishment and co-operation of duly authorized, voluntary, National Red Cross organizations, having as purposes the improvement of health, the prevention of disease, and the mitigation of suffering throughout the world.\"\n\n(Covenant of the League of Nations, Article 25.)\nThe Red Cross as a Peace-Time Organization\n\nThis issue of THE BULLETIN is devoted entirely to a brief sketch of the relations between the various elements in the Red Cross Peace-Time Organization.\u2014League of Red Cross Societies,\u2014Canadian Red Cross Society,\u2014Ontario Division and Local Branches.\n\nIn War Time\n\nFormerly a War Organization\n\nPrior to May 5th, 1919, the Red Cross was in constitution and purpose a War-time organization. Its function was to act as a voluntary auxiliary to the Army Medical Service in time of war. Such an auxiliary organization is necessary in order that the Medical Service may quickly mobilize in sufficient strength those voluntary forces which are needed to enable it to meet the necessities of the sick and wounded in time of war. This statement is borne out by the fact that ever since the League has given its permission to its National Red Cross Societies as the official channel for voluntary medical aid to the sick and wounded soldiers in time of war.\n\nThe Transition to Peace Time Work\n\nWork for War Prisoners and Refugees\n\nBut during the Great War, the Red Cross Societies of Allied and neutral countries found it impossible to limit their work of mercy to the armies. Our soldiers who were held as prisoners of war in enemy countries had to be cared for. They were inhumanely treated, in violation of international usage, and deprived even of necessaries of life, and it became imperative to send to them regular supplies of food and clothing. The Red Cross, as the internationally recognized means of communication with prisoners of war, became an official channel through which supplies were sent. While this meant to our unfortunate men languishing in prison camps, will never be fully realized, except by the men themselves.\n\nRefugees from the invaded and devastated regions of France, Flanders, Italy and Serbia, and broken and diseased civilians repatriated through neutral countries constituted a problem in health, sanitation and relief which the Red Cross could not ignore.\n\nRelief Work After the Armistice\n\nAfter the Armistice, as the demands of the armies rapidly diminished, the demands for civilian relief as rapidly increased. This was due to the freeing of invaded areas, the repatriation and demobilization of enlisted men, the disorganization of civil life due to the War, under-feeding of civilian population and the terrible aftermath of disease and poverty which always follows war. The Red Cross Societies did not slow responding to these needs. As their supplies and organization were released from the demands of the armies, their energies were directed towards providing civilian relief in Belgium, France, Italy, Serbia, Roumania, Siberia and Czecho-Slovakia.\n\nThese features of Red Cross activity,\u2014the aid to war prisoners, the aid to refugees from devastated districts, and the post-Armistice relief work in war-stricken countries\u2014represent three stages in the transition of the Red Cross from a war-time to a peace-time organization.\n\nThe League of Red Cross Societies: How it was Formed\n\nCommittee of Red Cross Societies to Discuss Peace Work\n\nThe organization of the League of Red Cross Societies came about in the following way.\u2014In December, 1918, one month after the Armistice, with the approval and indorsement of the Governments of the five great powers, Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan and the United States, a Committee of their Red Cross Societies was convened \"to formulate and propose to the Red Cross Societies of the world an extended programme of Red Cross activities in the interest of humanity.\"\n\nConference of Medical Experts to Suggest Plans\n\nThis Committee called a Conference of the leading medical experts of the world which was held at Cannes in the early part of April, 1919. The Conference outlined a programme of Peace-time work of the Red Cross Societies of the world. To carry out this programme the League of Red Cross Societies was formed at Paris on May 5th, 1919, with headquarters at Geneva.\n\nThe League Formed, Paris May 5th, 1919\n\nThe League was formed in Paris on May 5th, 1919, with the approval of the five great powers. It is mentioned in Article 25 of the Covenant of the League of Nations which reads: \"Members of the League agree to encourage and promote the establishment and co-operation of duly-authorized, voluntary, national Red Cross organizations, having as purposes the improvement of health, the prevention of disease and the mitigation of suffering throughout the world.\"\n\nMembership of League\n\nThe National Red Cross Societies of the five great powers,\u2014Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan and the United States, became founder members of the\nThe Work of the League\n\nThe League is purely voluntary organization. It is non-political, non-governmental and non-sectarian and therefore has no statutory connections with the League of Nations or any government. The objects of the League are:\n\n1. To encourage and promote in every country of the world the establishment and development of duly-authorized, voluntary, national Red Cross organizations, having as purposes the improvement of health, the prevention of disease, and the mitigation of suffering throughout the world, and to secure the co-operation of such organizations for these purposes.\n\n2. To promote the welfare of mankind by furnishing a medium for bringing within the reach of all peoples the benefits to be derived from present known facts and new contributions to science and medical knowledge, and their application.\n\n3. To furnish a medium for coordinating relief work in case of great national or international calamities.\n\nThe Canadian Red Cross Society\n\nThe Canadian Red Cross Society has become a member of the League, and is planning to carry out its objects by a programme of Peace Work organized Nationally, Provincially and Locally.\n\nAt a Conference held in Winnipeg, September 9th and 10th, 1919, the Charter of the Canadian Society was altered to include Article 25 of the League of Nations' Covenant, as above quoted.\n\nThe functions of the Canadian Society will be\u2014\n\n1. To continue to act as a voluntary auxiliary to the Militia Department.\n\n2. To act as a voluntary auxiliary to the Federal Department of Health;\n\n3.

Its purpose is to show briefly the kind of relations which should exist between the various factions of the Red Cross organizations, from the Local Branch to the League of Red Cross Societies, and to show every member of the Red Cross how his or her effort is vitally related to a great world-wide movement of neighborliness, humanity and mercy. Each individual member should feel that he or she is a vital part of this movement and see clearly that the power of this good and merciful work depends ultimately upon the devotion and service of the individual.\n\nChart Showing Relations of Red Cross\nLocal, Provincial, National and International\n\nLeague of Red Cross Societies\n\nCanadian Red Cross Society\n\nProvincial Divisions, Canadian Red Cross Society\n\nPrince Edward Island New Brunswick Nova Scotia Quebec Ontario Manitoba Saskatchewan Alberta British Columbia\n\nLocal Branches\n\nThe Red Cross, a union of those who serve for the sake of those who suffer.\nThe Junior Red Cross\n\nMEMORY GEM\n\nRejoice, whatever anguish rend your heart,\nThat God has given to you the priceless dower\nTo live in these great times, and bear your part\nIn Freedom's crowning hour.\n\nThat ye may tell others who see the light\nHis gifts the heavens\u2014their heritage to take\u2014\n\"I saw the powers of darkness put to flight;\nI saw the morning break.\"\nThe Canadian Red Cross Society\n\nOFFICERS and COMMITTEE\n\nPresident\nHER EXCELLENCY THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE\n\nSASKATCHEWAN DIVISION\n\nJunior Red Cross Committee\n\nJUNIOR RED CROSS WORK IN SASKATCHEWAN\n\nFILE HILLS INDIAN JUNIOR RED CROSS\n\nFOR THE RELIEF OF CRIPPLED CHILDREN\n\nTHE PRINCE OF WALES\n\n\"THE LADY WITH THE LAMP\"\n\nSASKATCHEWAN JUNIORS AT WORK\n\nA LETTER FROM PREMIER MARTIN\n\nHINTS ON ORGANIZATION\n\nJUNIOR RED CROSS STATISTICS AND SLOGAN\n\nOUR GUARANTEE\n\nEvery dollar sent in to the Junior Red Cross Committee by a Junior Red Cross Society, whether in the form of membership fees or special contributions, shall be expended for relief work among the children of Saskatchewan, and not one cent shall be diverted for organisation or office expenses.\n\n\u2014The Junior Red Cross Committee.\n\nTHE JUNIOR RED CROSS\n\nNo. 1 REGINA SASKATCHEWAN April, 1920\n\nJunior Red Cross Work in Saskatchewan\n\nEarly in the year 1918, when after nearly four years of struggle with a powerful enemy it was realised that the most extreme efforts must be made to cope with the critical situations that had developed, the Red Cross Society turned to organise more actively the assistance that could be given by the children. In Saskatchewan, on account of the organisation of the schools earlier in the war for other patriotic purposes, the request for the formation of Junior Red Cross Societies readily met with response. In 1915, an appeal had been made to the children on behalf of the Canadian Patriotic Fund, and a large sum of money which was contributed to the Schools Patriotic Fund and turned over by the Department of Education to the Canadian Patriotic Fund. In 1916 upwards of $67,000 was collected by the children of the province for the relief of Belgian children. This fund also was organised by the department through the schools.\n\nThe campaign for Junior Red Cross Societies began in April, 1918, when Sir Richard Lake, President of the Saskatchewan Branch, sent through the teachers a letter to the school children urging the need for funds and material for the Red Cross, and requesting that the assistance that could be given be sent through their respective Red Cross Societies.\n\nIn May, this appeal was followed by Mr. Martin Frances, and Minister of Education, by a letter to teachers, trustees and pupils, recalling the good work that had already been done, and requesting assistance by way of funds for the Red Cross. In turn a letter to teachers and trustees from the Department was sent, establishing the Schools Red Cross Fund and recommended the formation of a Junior Red Cross Society in every school district. Efforts were also made to interest the Inspectors of Schools in the scheme, and many of them, besides holding meetings, made personal appeals by means of circular letters to the teachers and trustees in their jurisdictions. A diploma was presented to each school in whose jurisdiction that raised the largest amount for the Schools Red Cross Fund by December 31\u2014and 40 of these diplomas have been presented at public meetings. At that date there had been subscribed a total of $15,195. Undoubtedly many times this sum would have been collected, but the epidemic of influenza prevented most of the schools just at the time the preparations were being made for the campaign to collect funds. When the fund was closed on September 30, 1919, the total amount turned in to the Red Cross Society by the school children, through the Schools Red Cross Fund, was $19,203.47. The signing of the Armistice, of course, caused most of such efforts to cease altogether.\nThe Junior Red Cross\n\nUnder all the circumstances this result testifies to the splendid assistance our school children, when effectively organised, can give to patriotic and humanitarian schemes. But this is not the whole story. There were organised in 1917 by the senior branches in the province 127 junior branches\u2014in 1918, 285 were formed a total of\u2014412. The amount raised by these and sent direct to Red Cross Headquarters, was at September 30, 1918, $1,600, and from October 1st to September 30th, 1919, $7,500, a total of $9,100. Not to weary you with figures, let it be added that the grand total raised for the Red Cross by the children was $38,700, and besides this they made innumerable articles for the comfort of our soldiers. These figures are eloquent. They speak of all the big and little sacrifices made and gifts given by teachers all over the province. They tell of splendid impulse actualising in good deeds, realised as for noble ends. Only those who love children may measure the deep and wide human interest implied in such results.\n\nWhen subsequent to the Armistice, consideration was being given to the nature of Red Cross work in peace times, the Executive Committee at its meeting discussed the share that should be taken by the Junior Red Cross Societies. A committee of two was appointed, and the following report when presented to the full meeting of the Executive was unanimously adopted:\n\n(1) That the Junior Red Cross Societies already organised be encouraged fully to resume their activities.\n\n(2) That the organisation of Junior Red Cross Societies in connection with schools or other institutions throughout the province be encouraged.\n\n(3) That Junior Red Cross Societies be recommended to hold regular meetings at least monthly, study among other things, certain details of domestic hygiene and public hygiene as related to municipal and rural conditions.\n\n(4) That the Junior Red Cross Societies be encouraged to make contributions to a fund known as the Junior Red Cross Fund instituted for the care of crippled children.\n\n(5) That the amount now at the credit of the Schools Red Cross Fund approximating $1,660 be used as a foundation of such fund.\n\n(6) That a leaflet to be the organ of the Saskatchewan Junior Red Cross Society be issued monthly, the editorial and managing committee to be appointed by the Executive Committee, and that this leaflet be sent to every society, its contents to form the nucleus of study at the regular meetings.\n\nIn furtherance of the scheme outlined the president nominated a committee consisting of a doctor, the editor of one of the Regina dailies, the Director of School Hygiene for the province and the two members of the original committee. This committee has already investigated several cases reported to require orthopedic treatment, and is setting in motion schemes for discovering necessitous cases of the kind throughout the province.\n\nThe appeal of the crippled children of the province, we believe, will readily awaken the sympathies of children who are sound and well. The studies in personal, domestic and public hygiene will awaken an interest (Continued on page 14)\n\nFile Hills Indian Junior Red Cross\n\nThe boarding school on the File Hills Indian Reserve contains about seventy-five Indian children. When the Junior Red Cross was organised in 1916 every pupil became an enthusiastic member. Some already had money to pay the membership fee; the others immediately set to work and got it. There were many other children on the reserve, little tots not old enough to go to school or earn money to pay their membership fee by working on farms or elsewhere made them members. It came about that the Junior Red Cross at File Hills had the youngest member in the world\u2014the baby Kowayaytin aged only seven weeks. The oldest member of the Red Cross Society also lived on the File Hills reserve, the aged and venerable Chiposotatum who had reached the advanced age of 109.\n\nThe Red Cross was not a new thing to the Indian children as they had done much to help the senior members from the beginning of the war, but they went to work with more energy when they had their own society. They volunteered to spend two evenings a week for the Red Cross making bead chains, torn gauze, magazine covers and knitting and crocheting many useful articles. One little Indian girl made a good deal of money for the Red Cross by knitting mittens for the hills. They sold at ten cents a pair.\n\nDuring the harvest of 1918 the boys and girls raised money by stoking sheaves. All the older ones who were able to lift a sheaf went out into the harvest fields while the younger ones worked extra hard at the housework and chores. By this splendid co-operation they together helped to make money for the Red Cross. They received a certain amount for their work and gave it all. So the Junior Red Cross at File Hills has earned about three hundred dollars for the good work and now that they know the service the Junior Red Cross is giving to crippled children they are going to work with renewed energy and plan to make their society one of the best in the province.\nSaskatchewan Division Canadian Red Cross Society\n\nPresident: Sir Richard S.

Such unfortunate cases are not uncommon and are more frequent than generally known. They evoke our deepest sympathy and will doubtless inspire us all to assist in providing the medical and surgical attention required, and in supplying hospitals with the necessary apparatus and other items.\n\nA crippled child is naturally the object of much sympathy and kindly feeling in other children and it is a phase of education with definite value to the training of children for good citizenship. It is a natural sentiment demanding for its proper expression. What could be more fitting than that the children who have been blessed with sound, healthy limbs should be called upon to assist a plan which aims at as sound and healthy as possible those who are crippled? The committee feel convinced that the idea will appeal to children all over the province.\n\nWe urge that the Junior Red Cross be organised. If there is a Junior Red Cross Society in your neighbourhood see that the pupils of your school join it and work for it. If there is no such organisation, make an effort to establish one in connection with your school. The committee will be glad to receive any funds for the purpose indicated above either by small regular contributions or by means of a special contribution provided by public entertainments or similar methods. You will be kept informed from time to time of any dispositions made for the collection of contributions. Every dollar raised shall be expended for relief work among the children of the province and not one cent for organisation or expenses.\n\nThe committee trust that every teacher will take a lively interest in the scheme. It will take time and energy to organise your school or class efficiently and keep up interest but what a noble cause!\n\nThe committee urges you to deal with the matter immediately in your district. You will be glad to know that the Junior Red Cross Club already amounts to several thousand members throughout the province by the end of last year. The relief of crippled children has begun. Teachers are asked to report to the Secretary of the Committee, Mr. W. F. Kerr, 217 Macdonald Street. Report any cases in their locality requiring treatment. Investigations will be made by the committee and assistance given where needed.\n\nThe scheme has the fullest approval of His Honour Sir Richard Lake and the Honourable W. M. Maclean, Premier and Minister of Education.\n\nAll contributions should be sent to Saskatchewan Headquarters, Canadian Red Cross Society, Regina, and marked \"Junior Red Cross Fund for Crippled Children.\"\n\nAugustus H. Ball,\n\nChairman Junior Red Cross Committee.\n\nTHE PRINCE OF WALES\n\n\"The Friend of the Children of the Empire\"\nThe Lady With The Lamp\n\nOn England's annals through the long\nHer name is written in the song,\nThat light its rays shall cast\nFrom portals of the past.\n\n\"A lady with a lamp shall stand\nIn the dark hours of the land,\nA noble type of good\nHeroic womanhood.\"\n\nWhen thinking of the origin of the Red Cross one naturally recalls Florence Nightingale. She was the first to do for the soldier what the Red Cross has done for him in the Great War. Setting the example herself she organised in 1854 a band of thirty-eight nurses to bring comfort and health to sick and wounded soldiers in the Crimea.\n\nShe saw that good wholesome food was essential for them and started proper kitchens in the hospitals. She had medical stores sent from England and bought with all speed to the seat of war. She wrote to friends in England to send out books and papers so that the patients in hospitals might have something to read. She had recreation huts built where the convalescent could write letters, play games or have entertainments. She provided paper and stamps for their letters. She persuaded as many as possible to send money to their families and even organised a Money Order Office to make this as easy as possible. She looked after the health and comfort of any of the families who had come out with the army and even arranged for invalids to be sent back to England. She did more than her share of the nursing of those who particularly needed her care.\n\nWith a mind of exceptional ability to originate plans and reform abuses she combined a heart so tender and a love for others so great that we have almost forgotten all the wonderful work of organising which she did and remember her only as \"The Lady with the Lamp\" walking down the cold dark corridors of the hospital at Scutari after all others were in bed. But to me it seemed that all was not well as far as the poor soldiers were concerned. The incident mentioned of the soldier turning \"to kiss her shadow as she passed\" was really true of at least one man. He was a Highlander whose arm had been so badly wounded that the doctors said it would have to be taken off, but Florence Nightingale begged to be allowed to see the patient and worked hard to see if special care could not save it. She was allowed to do this and worked so hard she well that it healed and the soldier naturally was most grateful. He always liked to lie awake at night to see her pass by and kiss the shadow of the woman who had done so much for him. In fact all the soldiers loved dearly this noble loving young lady who had given up all the comfort of a home in England to come out to the Crimea to make things more comfortable for the wounded of our army.\n\nAnd it was a far different thing to do this in 1854 than it was in 1914. In 1854 there were no women nurses in the army. No women nurses had ever been with our armies so it was a hard task to find women who knew something of the care of the sick and at the same time had a ability to meet and overcome all the difficulties that would be sure to arise in such new work. Some idea of what they had to do may be imagined when we read that when they arrived at Scutari there were in the hospital no vessels for carrying water, no towels of any kind, no soap, towels no clothes. No washing was done so there was no clean linen. There were no bandages or hospital supplies. No hospital clothes had been provided for the men who were lying mostly on the floors, their uniforms stiff with blood and their bodies covered with the vermin that infested\n\nFLORENCE NIGHTINGALE\n\nthe dreadful den of dirt and pestilence and death to which they were consigned.\n\nThere was no proper cooking apparatus and what food could be got was cold and unappetising, for it had to be carried long distances to many of the patients as they lay in the open air on the hospital grounds of a mile long. Before Florence Nightingale arrived the cooking for the sick was done in large kettles into which the meat and potatoes were thrown together and the resulting greasy soup was all the poor invalids\nhad. But a few days after her arrival chicken broth, beef tea and jellies made their appearance to tempt the appetite and cheer the spirits of the poor suffering men. The swiftness with which she was able to create order and comfort in this terrible place might well be called one of the wonders of the age.\n\nThe secret of her ability to do all this lay largely in the fact that all her life had been an offering and a preparation. Her work in the Crimea was not the outcome of a mere generous impulse. It was the fruit of years of steady preparation. The war gave her an opportunity of which others, less wisely desiring to volunteer, could not take advantage. She had always liked to help others, particularly the sick, and to do that well she soon found out that she must learn all she could on the subject of nursing. So she visited hospitals in England and Scotland and learned whatever she could of their management and care of the sick\u2014and this was considered by many a most unlikely thing for a woman to do. Then she went abroad to study. On her return to England she was placed in charge of a hospital for sick governesses which had just been opened in London. This gave her a training in the management of an institution as well as training in nursing.\n\nSo, having armed herself by hard work and hard study she was ready when the call came to do a great and wonderful work. Not only by doing so much for the poor unfortunate soldier, but also because of her fine character and training she was able to lift a despised occupation into being one of the most noblest and dignified\u2014into a woman's engagement.\n\nOn her return from the Crimea she was presented with a gift of $250,000 to which people of all classes and in all parts of the Empire had contributed and this sum she gave to establish and maintain an institution for the training of nurses and hospital attendance and for some years she presided over this institution.\n\nWhen in 1860 her health gave way and she became a bedridden invalid for the rest of her long life she still worked hard at her life work of ameliorating human suffering. She still kept in touch with all movements of social and hygienic reform and indeed was able by her writings to organise and direct the welfare of boys in Great Britain and India. So to the end of her long life she worked from morning to night and sometimes from night to morning as well at her Master's work\u2014caring for others with no thought of reward or rest for herself.\n\n\"At Chelsea under the lime trees' stir\nI read the news to a pensioner.\nThey say the enemy's army were dead,\nThey were younger men than me,\" he said.\n\"I read again of another death.\nThe old man sighed and then caught his breath\u2014\n'She's dead!' he said. 'She too!' In camp\nWe called her 'The Lady with the Lamp.'\"\n\nHe would not listen to what I read\nBut said, \"It's nothing\u2014she's only a dead\"\nI showed him it to remove his doubt\nAnd added unthinking, \"The lamp's gone out.\"\n\nHe rose\u2014and I had to help him stand\nThere, as he sat with trembling hand.\n\"I'm going to see the doctor now.\"\n\"The Lamp she lit is slight today.\"\n\nSaskatchewan Juniors at Work\n\nSince the organization of the Saskatchewan Junior Red Cross Committee a few months ago, and the approval by the Provincial Red Cross Executive of its plan of work, the main feature of which is to encourage the formation of Junior Red Cross Societies throughout the Province and thereby enlist the sympathising and active assistance of the boys and girls of Saskatchewan in providing medical and surgical attention for crippled children whose parents are too poor to obtain proper relief for them\u2014the committee has had no less than eleven cases reported to it, all of which have been investigated and definite action taken to relieve the sufferings of these little patients.\n\nThe following brief outline of these cases will serve to indicate the nature of the work the Junior Red Cross is undertaking in Saskatchewan and in support of which the boys and girls in the schools of the province are urged to organise their own Junior Red Cross Societies and contribute towards the relief of their suffering brothers and sisters in less fortunate positions in life.\n\nREPORT OF CASES\n\nCase of Eye Trouble.\n\nCase No. 1. E. M. Cadillac\u2014in August last the secretary of Bedford S.D., No. 3195, forwarded to the Department of Education a letter received by him from Miss Morton, who stated she was unable to attend school on account of eye trouble. The secretary of the school district wrote back saying that there was no case deserving one but that the father, owing to successive total crop failures for the last three years, was unable to send the boy treated. Upon the organisation of the Junior Red Cross committee this case was referred to it. Through the director of school hygiene, Miss Morton was sent to Broadview and examined this boy and advised that he was a suspect of trachoma and should be immediately seen by the local board of health and to the provincial bureau of public health. So far as the Junior Red Cross committee is concerned it was thus relieved of responsibility.\n\nTubercular Spine.\n\nCase No. 2.\u2014(A. F. Broadview) This is the case of a deformed girl, a humpback, aged 10 years, daughter of a man of foreign birth, and was reported by her school teacher. She was last seen by the director of school hygiene. The resident doctor examined the case and reported the deformity as due to a tubercular condition of the spine. He took the child to a specialist in Winnipeg with the understanding that she be left there until such time as treatment had been completed. The child's parents were informed that with proper treatment there is hope for the child's cure. After the organisation of the Junior Red Cross committee this case was entrusted to it. Unfortunately, during the interval of time which elapsed, the family moved from Broadview and only recently a report was received that the child and parents were living near Colonay. An effort is now being made through the school inspector of that inspectional to locate this girl.\n\nA Case that is Hopeless.\n\nCase No. 3.\u2014(E. L. North Regina) Through the cooperation of the Regina Branch of the Red Cross Society this case of a little girl of 7 years was brought to the attention of the Junior Red Cross committee. The child has never walked, cannot speak, and has to be spoonfed, cannot eat solid food. The parents and other facts relating to this girl and her case were reported by Miss Morton, school nurse, and recently a visit was made at the request of the Junior Red Cross committee. Miss Morton stated that\nThe Junior Red Cross\n\nthe mother was anxious to have the child examined by a physician, but could not afford to do so. The Junior Red Cross arranged with the mother to take her daughter to a local physician and have her examined at Junior Red Cross expense. This was done. The physician reported that the case was hopeless, that there was lack of brain development, as well as physical deformities, and that a massage might serve to straighten her limbs somewhat, nothing really effective in the case. It was decided that the mother of the child has written the Junior Red Cross expressing appreciation of the help she had found in their belief. The physician declined to accept any fee for a Red Cross case.\n\nTo Have Adenoids Removed.\n\nCase No. 7\u2014A. M., Cadillac\u2014This is the case of a boy of 12 years who had spinal meningitis when he was six years old. He is one of a family of nine children, whose father earns $20 per week. Miss Cooper of the Junior Red Cross has been working on the case. The most urgent need was for braces properly adjusted by an orthopedist. The boy was placed in a wheelchair, as the surgeon so advised. The Junior Red Cross has had this little girl attending school, and she is now able to walk with the aid of a cane.\n\nHelping a Widow's Child.\n\nCase No. 5\u2014A. C., Rosanville\u2014Reported to the Red Cross by Mrs. Deacon, widow of a soldier. The boy lives on a farm 18 miles from Cadillac and is suffering from advanced operation, but the parents, being in very poor circumstances, could not afford it. The Junior Red Cross has arranged with Dr. Porter to undertake the treatment of this boy at Junior Red Cross expense.\n\nFast Required Treatment.\n\nCase No. 8\u2014K. B., Weyburn\u2014This boy of 7 years of age, the son of a woman of several children, has been under the control of the Provincial Superintendent of Neglected and Dependent Children. His mother is unable to control him. He has been working on farms, but is in such poor health that he cannot possibly go about doing work. The boy has a deformed foot. The Superintendent of Neglected and Dependent Children has asked Junior Red Cross to make arrangements for surgical treatment for this boy by Dr. Gallaway, Winnipeg, and to pay his hospital bill. He asked that the Red Cross undertake to pay his fare to Winnipeg and return. This the Junior Red Cross did.\n\nThe Junior Red Cross Committee wants to see a Junior Red Cross Society organized in connection with every school in Saskatchewan in order to give all boys and girls with sound and healthy bodies an opportunity to contribute their share, however small, towards \"The Junior Red Cross Fund for Crippled Children,\" and thus enable the committee to give prompt and necessary attention to all further cases of crippled children in our own province who require assistance.\n\nIs there a Junior Red Cross Society in your school? If not, will you not interest yourself in the formation of one without loss of time and thus have your school take a part in this noble work?\n\nDeformed and Crippled.\n\nCase No. 10\u2014A. A., Pennant\u2014This is the case of a boy 13 years of age, who was brought to Regina by Miss Simpson of the school hygiene staff. When quite a small child he had infantile paralysis, which caused him to be crippled. Six years ago the municipality sent him to Rochester where he had a certain number of bones given an iron splint to wear, which he has outgrown. The mother had a larger one made for him, but it was not at all satisfactory. The mother is a woman with a family of four children, who could not find anyone able to give the boy fitted with a proper splint. The Junior Red Cross has arranged with Dr. Gallaway on March 23 and he is now being fitted with proper braces at Junior Red Cross expense.\n\nSuccessful Operation Performed.\n\nCase No. 11\u2014M.T., Francis\u2014This young girl, years of age, is a sister of E. T. Case No. 6, and operated for removal of tonsils and adenoids was required. In company with her sister she was brought to Regina on May 2. She was operated for by the Junior Red Cross for her admittance to the Alexander Clark Hospital, Regina General Hospital. She was successfully operated on the following day, and two days later was able to return to her home.\nA Letter from Our Premier\n\nTo the Teachers of Saskatchewan:\n\nRegina, March 31, 1920.\n\nThe covenant of the League of Nations has placed before us all of its significance and duty of emphasis on a new foundation the noble work of the Red Cross. Hitherto active only in time of war it is now to continue its work in time of peace and in the words of the covenant \"to encourage and promote the establishment and co-operation of the authorities and voluntary Red Cross Societies throughout the world pursuing the improvement of health, the prevention of disease and the mitigation of suffering throughout the world.\"\n\nIt is therefore evident that the Junior Red Cross of Saskatchewan has set before itself very definite objects\u2014chiefly the study and practice of hygiene and the relief of crippled children. I realise that these aims will tend gradually toward humanitarian phases of education and that the former will benefit the hundreds of many children now apparently doomed to lives of suffering. In the study of health, in the practice of healthy habits, in the assistance given to crippled children, and good citizenship will be daily inculcated and our citizenship thereby strengthened towards good ends.\n\nThe Junior Red Cross therefore has my most approving sympathy and I trust that while schools are in operation, in order to assist the realisation of these objects, a portion of every Friday afternoon be given to the study of those humanitarian phases of education and citizenship for which the Junior Red Cross stands.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Martin,\nMinister of Education.\n\nJUNIOR RED CROSS WORK IN SASKATCHEWAN\n\n(Continued from page 4)\n\nin healthful home and public conditions and supplement the efforts of our Health Departments and school nursing systems.\n\nNaturally, Red Cross workers will realise that though the primary object of Junior Red Cross Societies in Saskatchewan has been set down as the creation and fund for the relief of crippled children, the secondary object, namely the training of the altruistic instincts of the children is possibly the most important from the long distance view of training for citizenship. The view held by Sir Arthur Currie was voiced by him in all his public addresses, that the offices of the splendid service of the late noble man can only be made effective in the life of this Dominion by a similar spirit of service and sacrifice on the part of all its citizens, will find vital expression in the lives of our children in the many little sacrifices for the Junior Red Cross and the great service for crippled children. What an appeal the Red Cross will ultimately become second only in its influence to the appeal of the White Cross the symbol of our religious goodness!\n\nEverywhere one hears the call to service\u2014service not of ourselves, but of our fellow citizens, the larger service of the community in which we live, and the splendid service for our country and our race. Children think in simple terms. They tend to act upon their impulses in immediate action. The Red Cross supplies another category of good impulses. Children are impatient of principles and precepts, finding the application of daily moral problems to such principles difficult, but they appreciate facts, the facts of suffering and the Red Cross provides the opportunity for training in what may be termed concrete goodness.\n\nHints on Organization of Junior Red Cross Societies\n\nThe Junior Red Cross Committee wants to see a Junior Red Cross Society formed in connection with every school in Saskatchewan. That is the committee's objective for 1920. You can help in this connection in once more putting Saskatchewan 'over the top.'\n\nThe organisation of a Junior Red Cross Society is very simple. All boys and girls under eighteen years of age are eligible for membership. The annual membership fee is small\u2014only twenty-five cents. A membership button will be supplied to each member by the Junior Red Cross Committee.\n\nA member should be enrolled on payment of the membership fee and the taking of some simple pledge like the following:\n\n\"I promise to serve the King and the flag of my country, the symbol of liberty and justice, and to work for the Red Cross, the emblem of humanity and service throughout the world.\"\n\nThe simple organization of a Junior Red Cross Society may be covered by the following:\n\n1. Name\u2014This Society shall be known as the Junior Red Cross Society of ______.\n\n2. Objects\u2014The objects of the Society shall be to acquaint its members with the aims and objects of the Red Cross, to enlist the sympathies and services of the members in behalf of suffering childhood and the needs of those children less fortunate situated, to instil into themselves to give instruction in hygiene and encourage healthful habits among its members, and generally to inculcate and develop kindly thought and sympathetic action by personal effort and sacrifice in behalf of others, thus providing intelligent training in good citizenship.\n\n3. Membership and Fees\u2014All young people under 18 years of age shall be eligible for membership. The membership fee shall be twenty-five cents per annum.\n\n4. Meetings\u2014Meetings of the Society shall be held at least once a month.\n\n5. Officers\u2014The officers shall consist of a Director (who should be the teacher in charge of the school), a President, and a Secretary Treasurer, to be chosen from among the members.\n\n6.

WRIGHT\n\nSeptember 20th, 1920.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nSupt. of Schools,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nIn our plans for organizing the Junior Red Cross work in the schools of Ontario we are venturing to hope that we may be permitted to have the work carried on also in your Indian Schools.\n\nI enclose a copy of a circular issued by the Saskatchewan Junior Red Cross in which you will find a fine statement of the good work done by the File Hills Indian School in that Province. Something similar might be hoped for in many other schools where enterprising teachers hold sway.\n\nCan you let me have a list of all the Indian schools (including the Church Schools) in Ontario? Whether they are joined up or not with our work, I am sure the teachers would appreciate our literature. I know Mr. Abraham of your Department quite well, and through him occasionally hear of the work being promoted along agricultural lines. The Red Cross work can be made part of this kind of service if it should meet with the approval of your Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOrganizer, Junior Red Cross.\nOttawa, September 29, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant with reference to organizing the Junior Red Cross work in the Indian schools in the Province of Ontario.\n\nIn reply I beg to enclose herewith a list containing the names of the day schools and the address of each, also a list of the residential schools, giving the name of the school, the name of the principal and the address. In case of the day schools it will be sufficient in mailing your circulars or literature, to address them to \"The Principal\", followed by the name of the school and the post office. This list contains the names of all the schools in operation in Ontario under the control of the Department and also under the auspices of the various\n\nIf the teachers will undertake the organization of their schools the Department will have no objection. I am of opinion, however, that it is only in the residential schools or in those day schools in the older districts of the province that success may be expected.\n\nI may add that the circulars enclosed by you have been received and the Department is pleased to note your interest in the File Hills Indian Boarding School of Saskatchewan.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nfor Assistant Deputy Minister\n\nJ. E. Scott,\nRed Cross,\nHerbouin St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOctober 1st, 1920.\n\nMr. McKenzie Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. McKenzie -\n\nWe are in receipt of yours of September 29th (545722) and thank you for your interest and kindness in furnishing a list of the Indian Schools in Ontario. Even if the teachers do not organize a formal Red Cross Auxiliary I am sure they will benefit from the receipt of our literature. This will help to work down some of their isolation. Our plans are not fully formed yet, but when they are we shall not overlook the needs of the Indian children; indeed it has been proposed already that one of the fields of service that school-children in well-to-do districts might undertake would be that of furnishing needed supplies of clothing and comforts to their less fortunate fellow-citizens in outlying and backwood districts. I believe many of the Indian Missions receive boxes of such supplies through Church groups. If this is not overdone, through the Junior Red Cross we might be able to collect and transmit similar articles where they are most needed - particularly in nature of comforts for the sick in hospitals.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nOrganizer, Junior Red Cross.\nDr. Scott,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Interior,\nParliament Buildings, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nSome years ago you may remember we co-operated with you in regard to the improvement of the teaching of Agriculture in your Indian Schools. In recent years my work has changed into the promotion of better health teaching in the schools under what is called, the Junior Red Cross. We are beginning to get some real substantial results I think in this connection and I should like to extend an offer to the teachers in your Indian Schools in Ontario, to help them with the part of their work should they be interested. Whether or not they formally organize their children into Head, Heart, Hand and Health Clubs we can offer them real help with posters and other printed matter - all free for the asking.\n\nIf you will give me a list of the Indian Schools in Ontario, I shall be glad to send them a letter or perhaps you would prefer to send the letter yourself. Miss Mary Moffitt of Cape Croker Reserve and Miss Mary Black, Gibson Reserve, Sahanatien have so far been the only two teachers of your teaching staff to become interested. Am sending you copies of the health posters that are available. You will note that the practice of health is described as a \"game\".\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOrganizer, Junior Red Cross.\nOttawa, Sept. 15, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. McCready:\n\nI wish to acknowledge and thank you for the kind offer of your letter of the 10th instant. I am sure that many of our teachers in Ontario Indian schools will be glad to utilize the \"health games\" which are promoted by your Society. I am enclosing a list of the Indian schools in Ontario, the address and name of the teacher in each case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nS. B. McCready, Esq., B.A.,\nCanadian Red Cross Society,\n610 Sherbourne St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, November 21, 1924.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to placing the \"Red Cross Junior\" in Indian schools in Canada. I am preparing a list of residential and day schools, to which it is advisable to send the publication. You will be further advised.\n\nI should be grateful if you, in the meantime, would consider offering this Department a club rate. Our business would be very easily handled, considering that there would be but one letter covering the addresses, one letter relative to renewals per annum and one cheque in payment per annum.\n\nMy suggestion is that Indian schools generally each receive a copy of \"Red Cross Junior.\" You could send a list of the schools in each province to your provincial organisers. I shall send a circular letter to principals and teachers, explaining about the magazine and informing them that the Department would be glad to learn that they have enrolled with the provincial organisation. I shall also instruct our schools to requisition to the Department if additional copies of the magazine can be used to advantage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Make it clear that in putting their names down for enrollment in the membership of the Canadian Red Cross, they are committing to work for its ideals. Younger children may print their names, but the teacher should see that each child does his best which means writing out correctly; the Secretary or Teacher should check the spelling and writing to make it clear. Names of pupils who are absent may be put down for them.\nOctober 6th, 1924\n\nTo the Teachers of Ontario Indian Schools,\n\nIt gives me much pleasure to offer you the services of Junior Red Cross for the encouragement of the development of good health habits amongst your pupils. There is no charge for these services. They are offered free to the schools by the Red Cross as part of its peace-time service to make Canada healthier and happier.\n\nAs the enclosed leaflet explains, Junior Red Cross is an \"activity\" plan of teaching. The pupils enroll as junior members of the Red Cross (free) and agree as a group to \"play the health game\". There are pretty membership buttons, attractive merit badges, colored posters, a charter, etc. Each month the class gets our magazine (free) with interesting pictures, reading matter, etc.\n\nIf the members of the class are old enough and clever enough, they may hold occasional meetings as a Head, Heart, Hand and Health Club, but this is not essential. The important thing is that they should \"play the game\" daily, keep themselves clean, keep their school sanitary, etc - and so grow up healthy and strong.\n\nI enclose an Application Form for the enrollment of your class. Upon receipt of it we will send you a full set of supplies. Dr. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of the Department of Indian Affairs in accepting our proposal and sending us a list of Indian Schools says, \"I am sure that many of our teachers in Ontario Indian Schools will be glad to utilize the \"health games\" which are promoted by your society\". Miss Moffit's class at Cape Croker is enrolled.\n\nDuring the past three years the work has grown steadily in favour in our schools. It is past the experimental stage. It is now being encouraged in the Normal Schools. You can have it for a three cent stamp!\n\nYours for Good Health and Good Citizenship,\n\nProf. J. A. Dale,\nChairman, J.R.C. Committee,\nOrganizer, Ontario J.R.C.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing sample copies of \"The Red Cross Junior\" for December, 1923 and Oct., 1924, and would recommend that the Department subscribe for this little magazine for the various schools in the West. For the large schools it would be well to have three or four copies but one would be sufficient for most of them. The cost would be very small as each subscription is only 50\u00a2 and I am sure it would be of great benefit to the schools. The Inspectors frequently remark on the lack of interesting reading matter to be found in our Indian Schools, and anything we can do to remedy that state of affairs would be a good move.\n\nI trust the Department will favorably consider this recommendation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 4, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 100-7bReq. of the 11th ultimo, with reference to supplying the Junior Red Cross Magazine to the Indian schools in the Prairie Provinces. Some months ago I cooperated with the Ontario Division of this Society and I am pleased that you have drawn the Department's attention to the advisability of extending this work to the Prairies. I believe I will include British Columbia as well. I will write to the organizer of the Dominion Junior Red Cross and see if the Department can get a special rate for all our work and one account per year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.
