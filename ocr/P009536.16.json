Sifton, Esq., M.L.A.,\nCommissioner of Public Works.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Department of Public Works for the year 1902.\n\nThe increase and extension in the work of all branches of the Department referred to in the last annual report will be found, from the detailed information given in these pages with reference to the work of the Department during the past year, to have again practically doubled over the work of the preceding year.\n\nThis marked increase was to have been expected from the rapid increase of settlement and the extension of the areas within which the Department has been called upon to perform public works during the past season.\n\nThe details and information contained in this report with reference to the general question of public works, and more particularly regarding the matter of bridge construction, the survey of roads, drainage and local improvement districts are of themselves a marked indication of the rapid strides which have been made during the past year towards the settlement and opening up of areas which were practically uninhabited before the beginning of the year.\n\nIn the early part of the year an excessive rainfall was experienced throughout practically the whole Territories and in the western portion floods were experienced which in severity have not been exceeded since the opening up of the country. As a natural consequence much damage was caused to existing means of communication and a very considerable number of the larger bridges were washed out, and one or two of the larger structures seriously damaged.\n\nThe possibility of repairing the structures injured by these floods and improving the roads was materially aided by the long spell of dry weather which was experienced after midsummer, and owing to that fact we were able to close the year with practically all main lines of communication open and the larger number of the important bridges in a fit state for travel.\n\nThe bearing which the rapid opening up of new settlements throughout the west has had upon the work of the Department in the effort to provide means of communication has been referred to in previous reports, but it seems necessary to again emphasise the fact that so long as the present conditions continue, under which new settlements with their central villages are almost a matter of weekly growth, it will be a serious question how the natural means of communication between these villages and the principal market centres can be opened up with anything like the degree of rapidity which the incoming settler seems to expect from the Territorial Government.\n\nThe requests made for the completion of public works during the past year have again exceeded at least three-fold the amount of work which it was possible to do with the means available, and the result of\nthis falling behind, during the past year and two preceding years, in the effort to keep pace with demands, has now accumulated a mass of work which it is quite evident will seriously tax the resources of the Department to meet in the near future.\n\nIt is, of course, only reasonable to expect that immigrants who have decided to make their home in the Territories, owing to information supplied to them through reliable sources as to climatic and soil conditions, must look to some central authority, either government or municipal, when they have located on their claims, for the completion of such works as are absolutely necessary to give them access to market centres. But it may not be out of place here to again direct attention to the fact that, owing to existing conditions, the only authority which such settlers can look to for the relief of their needs is the Territorial Government, and that to provide for what can be justly classed as fair requests must of necessity, owing to the rapid development now taking place in the Territories, involve the expenditure of a large sum of money annually.\n\nThe very bountiful crop with which the country was blessed this year has had a marked effect in directing the attention of emigrants both from the United States and Great Britain to the capabilities of the west, and is sure to be followed by a larger influx of desirable settlers than we have had in the past, with consequent enlarged responsibilities, as far as the Department is concerned, in the effort to provide these settlers with what they need to enable them to become successful and contented citizens.\n\nThe total amount expended during the past year for public works was $298,238.00, or about $61,664.00 more than was expended during the preceding year. For the purpose of reference a schedule is again appended showing in a graphic form the expenditure by the Department since 1898.\n\n| Year | Expenditure |\n|------|-------------|\n| 1898 | $129,046    |\n| 1899 | $146,403    |\n| 1900 | $175,960    |\n| 1901 | $236,574    |\n| 1902 | $298,238    |\n\nIt will be noted from the foregoing that since the organisation of the Department in 1898 a marked effort has been made by the Government to keep pace with the development of the country, in so far as expenditures on public works are concerned, but it is quite evident, as already mentioned, that if any effort is to be made in the near future to catch up with the arrears of work which have resulted from the inability to provide for what was recognised as actually necessary during preceding years, the expenditure for the coming year must show a much more marked increase than that noted above as the proportionate increase between the expenditures of 1900 and 1901. The details of the expenditures under the different headings comparing the totals above mentioned are given in the section of the report dealing with the Accountant's Branch. The general matter of expenditure is referred to here owing to the fact that, while that expenditure comprises a very large proportion of the amount voted to meet the needs of our \"growing time,\" it is quite clear, from information now on record in the Department, that to keep pace with that \"growing time\" large additional expenditures, as already mentioned, should, if possible, be provided for in the near future.\n\nThe system adopted in previous reports with reference to the subdivision of the subject matter of this report has again been followed for convenience of reference, and leads first to the work of the\nCorrespondence Branch, which is really the pulse of the work undertaken by the Department.\n\n**CORRESPONDENCE BRANCH.**\n\n- Staff:\n  - 1 chief clerk.\n  - 3 clerks.\n  - 6 stenographers and typewriters.\n  - 1 messenger.\n\nIt will be noted from the following statement that a very marked extension has again to be reported in the volume of correspondence dealt with by the Department during the past year, and for the purpose of graphic presentation the totals of the past and preceding years are shown in schedule form as follows:\n\n| Year | Communications received |\n|------|------------------------|\n| 1901 | 29,098                 |\n| 1902 | 42,251                 |\n\n| Year | Sent |\n|------|------|\n| 1901 | 58,005 |\n| 1902 | 86,730 |\n\n| Year | Irrigation Branch |\n|------|------------------|\n| 1901 | 3,392            |\n| 1902 | 3,350            |\n\n| Year | Total |\n|------|-------|\n| 1901 | 90,495 |\n| 1902 | 132,331 |\n\nAverage of communications dealt with daily, 1901... 294\n\" \" \" \" \" \" 1902... 431\n\nEntries of cash received, 1901... 4,053\n\" \" \" \" \" \" 1902... 9,651\n\nThe volume of correspondence dealt with during the past year as noted above shows an increase over the preceding year of 41,836 communications and the daily average of 431 letters will of itself indicate the mass of work handled by the Department, and serve to illustrate the fact already mentioned that a very large percentage of the resident population of the Territories finds it necessary from time to time to communicate with the Department relative to their needs.\n\nI have again to point out that the volume of correspondence has proved a serious tax upon the staff, and that only by persistent hard work was it possible to deal in anything like a prompt manner with this great mass of work.\n\nIn dealing with the public there is nothing that sooner arouses hostile criticism than delays in answering letters, and while it is admitted that many people run to unnecessary letter writing, it will be realised that, in a country of such vast proportions as the Territories, and with our centralised form of government, a very large percentage of the business of the Department must necessarily be done by correspondence. To prevent unnecessary delays and endeavour to deal promptly, as far as possible, with all communications received has been the aim of the staff during the past year, and the fact that the mass of correspondence, as stated above, was handled with the staff mentioned is, I think, worthy of record.\n\nThe Coal Mines Regulations Ordinance and The Steam Boilers Ordinance which, during the past year, as in preceding years, have been administered from the Correspondence Branch are for convenience of reference dealt with under separate headings.\nOutside staff ........................................... 1 inspector.\n\nA marked increase will be noted in the number of mines operated in the Territories during the past year, which for convenience are scheduled as follows:\n\n**SCHEDULE of Coal Mines Operated in the Territories in 1902**\n\n| NAME               | LOCATION            | OPERATED BY                          | CHARACTER OF COAL |\n|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Anthracite         | Anthracite, Alta.    | H.

Smith                             |                  |\nThe output of the above mines during the year as shown by the returns filed under the provisions of the Ordinance is as follows:\n\nBituminous and lignite coal.................. 494,087 tons.\nAnthracite coal............................... 16,587 \" \n\nTotal........................................... 510,674 tons.\n\nThe figures given in the report for 1901 were:\n\nBituminous and lignite coal.................. 331,907 tons.\nAnthracite coal............................... 14,742 \"\n\nTotal........................................... 346,649 tons.\n\nIt will be noted that the total output for the past year exceeds that of 1901 by 164,025 tons, an increase of over 47 per cent.\n\nThe important bearing which the extensive coal areas of the Territories must have upon the future development of the country is now beginning to be realised and it seems quite certain that in the immediate future this industry must of necessity show marked extension in the line of the mining of coal for domestic purposes. Doubtless the great strike in the Pennsylvania coal fields of the United States during the year, and the resulting scarcity of fuel, has done much to direct attention to the inexhaustible coal supplies which we have near at hand, and the fact that the time has now practically arrived when the West can become entirely independent of the East for their fuel supply must have a marked bearing upon the rapid settlement and development of the Territories. It is true that as yet the anthracite coal fields have not been sufficiently developed to justify the hope that fuel of that class can be provided to meet all needs, but as far as the cheaper fuels of the lignite and bituminous coal classes are concerned it is now quite evident that we have an inexhaustible supply of both fuels of this kind.\n\nSouris District.\n\nThe area of lignite coal in the south-eastern portion of Assiniboia is now known to be practically inexhaustible and the use of that coal, owing to the improved methods of consumption in stoves, is very rapidly extending, and its use for the generation of steam has also shown a marked extension during the past year owing to the scarcity of other fuels and to the fact that experience has proved that, with proper grates and careful firing, very satisfactory results can be obtained from its use. In this connection it may be noted that a number of the larger steam grist mills in southern Manitoba, and one of the largest mills in Winnipeg, now use Souris coal altogether for the generation of steam. The Souris Coal Company, who now operate the mines previously worked by independent companies at Roche Percee and Coalfields, have extended their works so as to enable them to mine a much larger quantity of coal. The situation of their present works, however, on the banks of the Souris river is such that considerable difficulty is experienced in handling their coal, and a long up-grade haul is necessary before the coal reaches the prairie level for distribution east and west. It is probable that the\ncompany referred to will, in the near future, find it expedient to abandon their present system of mining and adopt the system of reaching the coal by shafts sunk from the prairie level, with decreased cost of handling and material reduction in the mileage haul from the mines to the distributing centre at Estevan.\n\nCrow's Nest Pass District.\n\nIn the Crow's Nest Pass coal fields, in the Territories, the operations of the Canadian-American Coal & Coke Co. at Frank show a marked development during the past year. That company is now putting out a large quantity of coal daily and the colliery promises to become an important one in the near future. Several other mines have been opened up in the district, but none of them have yet got beyond the development stages. Sufficient has, however, been done to clearly prove that the coal areas are of wide extent and of good quality, and there is every indication that in the near future this coal field will be one of the most extensive in the west. None of the coal so far mined has proved of first-class quality for coking, but the indications are that coal which will make good coke will be located and that the manufacture of coke will be undertaken before long.\n\nLethbridge.\n\nAt the Lethbridge colliery the company are still extending their operations and the demand for this coal for domestic purposes is rapidly increasing.\n\nCanmore.\n\nAt Canmore the indications are that the development work done by the company during the past season has now put the colliery on a more satisfactory basis and a large quantity of coal has been mined in that field during the past year, all of which, however, has been utilised for railway operation.\n\nAnthracite.\n\nThe Anthracite mine shows an increase in output over the preceding year, but the deposit on the property owned by the company would seem, from the Inspector's report, to have nearly reached the limit of output and, pending negotiations between the company and the owners of the adjoining property on which the anthracite deposits are situated, it seems probable that this mine will not show a marked increase of output in the near future.\n\nEdmonton District.\n\nIn the Edmonton country a marked extension is noted in the opening up of small mines, but I have again to direct attention to the fact that in view of the rapid extension of settlement in the Edmonton district and through the Saskatchewan valley to the east, it seems desirable that the coal mining industry should be taken in hand by a strong financial company and developed upon more permanent and extensive lines than those followed by the small companies, who operate on hand-to-mouth basis and simply to meet local demands without any reference to the future extension of their workings.\nSCHEDULE of Accidents in Coal Mines for 1902.\n\n| NAME OF MINE     | RESULTING IN DEATH | SERIOUS INJURY | SLIGHT INJURY | TOTAL OF ACCIDENTS |\n|------------------|--------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Canmore          | 4                  | 1              | 2             | 7                  |\n| Lethbridge       |                    |                |               | 4                  |\n| Frank            | 4                  | 1              | 1             | 6                  |\n| The Territories  |                    |                |               | 17                 |\n\nThe number of fatal accidents in connection with coal mining operations during the past year as given by the above schedule shows an increase of five over the preceding year, and the total number of accidents of all kinds an increase of six. Considering the large additional quantity of coal mined during the year, and the additional number of men employed, the showing is not too bad. It is, of course, regretted that fatal accidents have to be reported, but unfortunately the experience of coal mining indicates that we must expect a certain proportion of fatalities each year and can only expect, by careful inspection of mines, to see that provision is made for the greatest degree of safety possible in their operation.\n\nExaminations, under the provisions of the Ordinance, for mine managers, pit bosses and fire bosses were held during the year and certificates issued as noted hereunder to the gentlemen who successfully passed such examinations.\n\nCyrus Morris ............

Smith, B.Sc., Inspector of Coal Mines, is appended.\n\nCALGARY, 31st December, 1902.\n\nTo the Deputy Commissioner,\nPublic Works Department,\nRegina, Assa.\n\nSIR,\u2014In compliance with your instructions I have the honour, as Inspector of Coal Mines, to submit to you the following report on the coal mines of the North-West Territories for the year ending the 31st December, 1902.\n\nThe mines on the list as being in operation, or having been in operation, within the past few years now number seventy-one (71) and no doubt this does not include them all, as in outlying districts there are small mines being worked, supplying the local demand, of which there is no record. The enormous area of the three districts Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Alberta, which comprise the North-West Territories,\nmakes it a difficult matter to locate every small mine being opened for the benefit of the settler, but if those operating such would notify the Department it would greatly simplify matters. The largest coal producers of the 71 mines in operation are:\n\nThe Alberta Railway & Coal Co., Lethbridge, Alta., No. 3 shaft.\nThe H. W. McNeill Co., Ltd., Canmore, Alta., No. 3 incline slope.\nThe H. W. McNeill Co., Anthracite, Alta., No. 1 incline slope.\nSouris Coal Mining Co., Ltd., Coalfields, Assa., No. 1 and 2 adit levels and No. 1 Roche Percee mine.\n\nThe Canadian-American Coal and Coke Co., Ltd., Frank, Alta., No. 1 adit level.\n\nThe system of mining at Lethbridge is still continued as in the detailed report of 1901, and the ventilation, although forced through the workings for many miles, is sufficiently adequate for the number of men, boys and horses employed. The workings are now being pushed forward to No. 4 shaft which was sunk some years ago ahead of development. When connection is made with this shaft a large portion of the return airway will be cut off giving increased ventilation for the same power used and affording also another entrance and exit from the extreme outer workings. This mine had been for more than twelve months previous to August, 1902, free from any inflammable gas, but about that time, in one of the leading places, gas was discovered, and immediately after finding the gas the management again placed extra fire bosses on the night shift to guard against any probable accident, although the quantity discovered was very small and at the present date has again entirely disappeared. The small quantity of gas usually encountered in this mine is due to slight faulting and does not seemingly come from the vein being worked but from a stratum above and only lasts for a short period until the advanced workings are clear of the faulting.\n\nThe mine has been working steadily for the greater part of the year and during the last three months it has been impossible to procure the requisite number of freight cars to supply the orders on hand.\n\nThe Canmore mine, operated by the H. W. McNeill Co., still keeps up a steady output of about 400 tons per day mine run, the whole product being used by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The workings in this mine have been extended within the past year into Nos. 2 and 5 seams which were practically abandoned for some time, and seams 1, 3 and 4 have all been tapped at a lower level by an underground slope extending about 1,500 feet on the half pitch of the seam. During the year considerable anxiety was caused the management by gas outbursts due to the proximity of a fault on the line of the slope; also on account of the increase in cover and closer proximity to the mountains. This difficulty was successfully overcome by keeping bore levels straight ahead and on the flanks of the working places. Still, with these precautions a fatal accident occurred, the men being too slow to take the warning given by the cracking of the coal. Bore holes ahead and the widening of the rooms is the most approved method of preventing accidents from sudden outbursts of gas, as the increased width gives more scope for the compressed pocket of gas to act on, giving warning sooner, and the bore holes ahead and on the flanks will be very liable to tap any gas pocket, releasing the pressure gradually. Precautions were also taken in this district of the mine by not only having the safety lamps locked but also sealed by a lead seal so that the miners could not in any way\ntamper with the light. A periodical search of the miners is also made at this mine for any matches, pipes or tobacco, and if anything of that nature is found on any person, he is immediately discharged. It might be well that when any prohibited article is found on a miner the inspector should be notified and a prosecution take place, which would have a salutary effect on others. In the general instructions No.9, special rules adopted at this mine and approved by the Commissioner, it is expressly stated that \"No person shall have in his possession when in or about the mine any matches or smoking material of any description.\"\n\nNo.1 Anthracite mine, operated by the same company, has been partly under a cloud for the past year and, owing to negotiations between the operating company and the owners of the adjoining property not having been completed to the satisfaction of both parties, the output of this mine has been largely curtailed. Development work has not been extensive and the smaller seams have been abandoned altogether for the present. Work has been carried on mainly by drawing alternate pillars so as not in any way to injure the mine permanently, but with the idea of being able to extract all the pillars within the next year or so provided that no settlement can be arranged for working the coal lands adjoining.\n\nThere are about thirty men working in this mine all told, and the daily output is about 80 tons.\n\nThe Souris Coal Mining Company, Ltd., Coalfields, Assa., are still continuing the work in No.1 and 2 adit levels and also at the mine at Roche Percee. In the beginning of the year this company had rather a serious drawback by the outbreak of smallpox in the camp. At that season of the year it was disastrous to their yearly returns as the winter months form their busiest time and, instead of having an output of 600 tons per day, their average was for a considerable period 50 per cent less. The development work has been rapidly pushed in No.2 mine, another coal punching machine having been placed at work and the entries now in advance with rooms started off them capable of producing at least 400 tons per day from this mine alone. The development work at No.1 and Roche Percee mine has not increased to the same extent, but within the last few months of the year they have been kept going to their full capacity.\n\nThe strike in the anthracite region of Pennsylvania has been in a sense a blessing to our coal industry in the North-West, as the consumer now understands he has an article at his own door which, if not equal in quality, is certainly an excellent heat producer and, with a little more attention, can give the same effect as Pennsylvania anthracite and at a less cost. The prospects, therefore, for these mines are now brighter than ever they were and a steady output assured for the operator and miner.\n\nThe Frank mine operated by the Canadian-American Coal and Coke Co., Frank, Alta., is one of the most recently developed mines and at the present date has a daily average output of 700 tons. The pitch of the seam is a most abnormal condition for this part of the country, being vertical. For this reason it is an experiment to most miners and mining men of the country. To the peculiar condition of the seam may also be assigned several of the accidents to the miners, very few of them having ever worked under the same circumstances in their mining experience. The main tunnel has now been driven over one mile in length and a parallel or monkey gangway, 40 feet above, the same distance, with upraises in between to carry the ventilation. From this upper gangway\nthe treasts or long wall system is opened out and only the surplus coal removed by chutes. The rooms are worked to the outcrop and the coal lying in them is then withdrawn. The present large output is due to the energy of the company and the ready market for steam coal in the country. Shortly this company will be able to supply double the quantity of the present production on account of the outer rooms being worked to the surface and the coal lying in the rooms can be withdrawn, the output practically only being curtailed by the number of cars that can be handled in the mine and at the tipple.\n\nAccidents.\n\nIt is unfortunate in the past year that we have to record so many fatal accidents and a number of miners slightly injured in the pursuance of their calling. It would probably be to the advantage of the employer and employee if the inspector was informed by wire, directly an accident takes place, whether fatal or injury only, so that we could co-operate with the company to try and remedy the cause if such exists. The fatal accidents of which I know number seven (7) and I visited the collieries immediately after six of them. The first one to be recorded was at the Frank mine, but at the time I was not notified of the accident and consequently did not visit the mine for some time after. The next accident was at Cannmore mine on the 29th of March when Nando Pinanonti lost his life by a fall of rock in No. 3 seam. The treast was started in troubled ground and he was mining the coal under a bad rock which he had propped up, but loosening the coal at the back end of it the rock surged over on him, death being instantaneous.\n\nAgain a fatal accident had to be recorded in the Canmore mine, in which two brothers, John and Jacob Kovezynski, lost their lives by an outburst of gas in the new underground slope No. 3 mine. From the position in which the men were found it could be surmised that, after the coal gave warning, they lingered too long to get their dinner buckets, picks, etc., and were overcome by the great outburst of gas before reaching the gangway.\n\nAt Frank mine on the 28th September a regrettable accident happened by which two men, D. Haines and W. Clarke, lost their lives and a third, D. Davies, so overcome that it was several weeks before he was again able to work. This mine had been practically free from gas since the commencement of opening until August, when gas was discovered in one of the upraises. After that all men working in the upraises where gas was suspected were supplied with a safety lamp. In this case a safety lamp was used but naked lights were also carried on their heads, and the gas being found to a greater extent than expected, an explosion took place from the ignition of the gas by the naked light. In consequence two of the men present succumbed, the third man only being revived after hard work by medical aid. The last fatal accident to be recorded occurred at Frank mine on the 2nd of December when an experienced miner, Robert Belshaw, lost his life by a fall of rock and coal from the hanging wall. He had charge of the treast in which he was working, and in the act of taking down some coal a large fall came from the hanging wall and smothered him before he could be recovered.\n\nIn pursuance of this question fatal and non-fatal I have several times spoken to the management of different collieries with regard to\nhaving their medical practitioner start ambulances for first aid to the injured. I am fully convinced that probably two lives at least of the fatal accidents recorded last year might have been saved had some one of the officials or miners close at hand been fully competent to render first aid. It is impossible to overestimate the value of first aid, and this matter, if recommended by the Government and taken up by the management of the several collieries, might prevent many hours of suffering and probably the loss of a limb or even a life by skilful handling immediately an accident happens and before medical aid could arrive at the scene. The hearty co-operation of the employer with the employed in first instruction aid would earn many blessings from those who in their daily occupation are liable to all classes of accidents.\n\nFurther with regard to this subject, I have many times in the course of my inspection in the mines spoken to the men with regard to rule 31, section 39, which provides for the inspection of the mine by a committee of two practical working miners appointed for the purpose by persons employed in the mine. The men at present do not avail themselves to any considerable extent under the provisions of this rule and I regard this as a grave error on their part, as if it was carried out it would tend to keep everything as near right as possible and often prevent the carelessness and negligence especially of the minor officials. This negligence is often whispered among the workmen but never any direct complaint being made. A book is kept at all collieries for the purpose of this committee recording any complaints, and if the matter is not attended to serious consequences would affect the management when not complied with. If this examination was carried out regularly by the miners it would give the employers a sense of security in the mine and management at a very small cost. These men might also be appointed, when notice has been given the management, to visit immediately the scene of any accident and also record a report of the same in the book kept at the mine for their use.\n\nWhen any fatal accident occurs it would be well if the inspector was notified by wire at the same time as the coroner, and he could immediately visit the colliery and be present at the coroner's inquest to look after the interests of all parties concerned.\n\nWork of Inspection.\n\nThe work of inspection was carried on regularly throughout the year. The number of mines on the list (71) is an extensive undertaking to inspect over such a large area as the North-West Territories, but fortunately the greater portion of them are small and lie in groups, so that two or three may be visited in one day. Within the past two years there has been a marked improvement in the working of these smaller mines. The owners or lessees now begin to see the advantage of adhering to the sections in the Ordinance relating specially to the safety of their men, and keeping plans of their workings, enhancing the value of their property, where before no records were kept. The larger mines at Coalfields, Assa., Lethbridge, Frank, Cannmore and Anthracite naturally have been visited much oftener than the smaller mines, each of them being inspected at least four times in the year, and whenever any accident or complaint of any kind, anonymous or otherwise, was made an investigation followed, resulting eventually to the benefit of the operator and\nthe employed. Regularly there have been recommendations made by the Inspector through the Department to the colliery operators for improvements in their system of working and ventilation. These I must add have been faithfully carried out, especially at the Frank mine where such large operations were in the experimental stage.\n\nExaminations.\n\nSeveral examinations were held throughout the year for certificates as mine manager, pit boss and fire boss. The first of these was held at Frank in February, when one candidate presented himself for mine manager's certificate, and he having satisfied the board of examiners a certificate was granted.\n\nAnother examination was held at Coalfields, Assa., at which one candidate presented himself for pit boss certificate, but the candidate failed to satisfy the board as to his ability to hold such certificate.\n\nAn examination was held at Canmore, one candidate presenting himself for fire boss certificate but was unsuccessful.\n\nIn December an examination was held at Frank, Alta., at which two candidates presented themselves for pit boss certificates, and satisfied the board of their qualifications; accordingly certificates were granted them. Two others presented themselves for fire boss certificates, one being successful and the other failing to satisfy the board of examiners.\n\nOne pit boss certificate was issued to Mr. Cory Wetherby, of Fernie, he having given proof that he had passed a duly authorised board of examiners in British Columbia, granting such certificates.\n\nCoal Mining Prospects.\n\nThe enormous influx of settlers into the Territories for the past year is certainly directing capital towards our inexhaustible coal fields. The consumption of coal by the settlers alone is a comparatively small item, but the settlement of a country means increased traffic, increase of industries in all localities and an increased output of coal to supply the demand. Along the line of Crow's Nest Railway, or particularly in the Blairmore district, the extension of coal mining has been phenomenal. One mine alone, with a shipping capacity of barely 50 tons per day at the beginning of the year, increased its production until it nearly reached four figures at the end of 1902. Another branch railway has been built to the south of the Crow's Nest line tapping a new colliery which is also a steady producer, with a plant proposed that will equal any colliery in the country. To the north of the railway also a wagon road has been built and a company formed to open up a colliery in the spring, with exceedingly good prospects. Some work has been done on the other properties in the district but whether there will be room for the outfit of all at present depends on the other industries established in the country. At Lethbridge a new outlet has been made to the United States by the standardising of the Canada and Great Falls Railway, which a reduction in the cost of hauling coal into the States and therefore more able to compete in their market.\n\nThe coal at Medicine Hat has been worked but little in the past year, on account of the introduction of natural gas into the town for domestic use. This has been very successfully carried out, although I\nconsider that there is always room for coal where heat and steam are required.\n\nThe mines at Estevan and Coalfields have been kept busy for the latter part of the year, not on account of the increased settlement alone, but that the coal is now recognised as a fuel that will compete successfully with most other fuels in the market where economy is considered. The largest operators there are now looking forward to the increase the coal mining machinery for a production of at least 1,200 tons per day to fill the demands of the next season.\n\nThe mine at Canmore has regained a new lease of life by opening up to the west of No. 3 slope sinking to a greater depth on the main seam and cross-cutting the other veins at this lower level. The prospects lying to the east of the present mine are very hopeful, a tunnel being driven for a few hundred feet on one vein, showing an area of coal that will last for many years.\n\nIn the Edmonton district the stir in railway circles has given an impetus to the coal prospects that seemed distant a year ago. The number of mines working in a small radius would seem to be beyond the demands of the local trade, but it is not so. It would be much better, however, if these small interests were all consolidated and a company organised to work the coal fields in a more systematic manner and preserve the valuable surface from being damaged for agricultural purposes.\n\nThe prospects of opening up the coal near the foothills on the Red Deer river, where there is a fair quality of anthracite, is considered very good as capital has now been invested in the matter. It is also probable that the fine domestic coal of the Knee Hills may be opened up in the near future, as application is being made this year for a renewal of the railway charter for the line from Calgary.\n\nIn conclusion it is pleasing to note the activity in all quarters of the Territories and it is assured that our coal industry will be one of the largest revenues on which the Territories can depend in the future.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nFrank B. Smith, B.Sc.,\nInspector of Coal Mines.\n\nTHE STEAM BOILERS ORDINANCE.\n\nOwing to the marked increase in the number of steam boilers operated during the year it was found necessary to appoint an additional inspector and Mr. William Mayhew, of Broadview, was engaged to fill the position. The names and addresses of the inspectors now employed in connection with the inspection of steam boilers throughout the Territories are as follows:\n\nMr. W. M. Carment ........................................ Yorkton.\nMr. Wm. Waller ........................................... Whitewood.\nMr. Jos. Buxton ........................................... Calgary.\nMr. Wm. Mayhew .......................................... Broadview.\n\nThe usual schedule showing in a graphic form the work performed on steam boiler inspection the past year is appended;\nNumber of steam boilers inspected......................... 803\nNumber of examinations of engineers held.............. 114\nNumber of first class engineer's certificates issued..... 1\nNumber of second class engineer's certificates issued.... 22\nNumber of third class engineer's certificates issued..... 116\nNumber of provisional engineer's certificates issued... 332\nNumber of permits for operation of boilers issued...... 31\n\nFees collected:\nFor inspection of boilers....................... $3,890 00\nFor examination of engineers and final certificates issued in lieu of certificates held.......................... 432 00\nFor provisional certificates..................... 993 00\nFor permits for operation of boilers............. 93 00\n\n$5,408 00\n\nThe foregoing schedule shows an increase in the number of boilers inspected over the preceding year of 232, and there is also a marked increase in the number of third class engineer's certificates and provisional engineer's certificates issued.\n\nThe revenue collected in connection with administration of this Ordinance also shows a marked increase over that of the preceding year. The large increase in the number of boilers inspected and the work performed generally by the inspectors was due to the very bountiful harvest of the past season, and it now seems quite certain that this branch of departmental work will show an annual increase for many years, and that before long the staff of inspectors will have to be largely augmented to enable them to keep up with the work.\n\nIt is gratifying to know that although such a large number of steam threshing outfits were employed during the season no serious accidents occurred, and it is quite evident that the work of inspection done by our inspectors is having a marked effect from the standpoint of the operation of steam threshing outfits.\n\nThe administration of The Steam Boilers Ordinance during the year has indicated that at the next session of the Legislative Assembly it is desirable that some minor amendments should be provided to clear up one or two doubtful points and to make the Ordinance more clearly understood by the public as well as our inspectors. One point which should be dealt with by amendment of the existing law is the matter of the date to be endorsed upon certificates of inspection. The custom has been in the past that when an inspector inspects a boiler for the first time he issues a certificate of that date good for one year. It is, of course, impossible for our inspectors to reach every boiler for subsequent inspection upon exactly the same date as the inspection of the previous year, and if his visit is made at a time considerably prior to the date on the certificate, owners have objected to paying the fee on the ground that the existing certificate had not expired. It would be well in amending the Ordinance that provision should be made to enable the inspectors to complete their inspections at any time during the year, on the understanding that the certificate issued would be given a date which would not cause any overlapping in the expiry of a full year between the dates on which certificates lapse. In amending the Ordinance it will also be necessary to clear up a doubt which now exists as to the issue of a second\nprovisional certificate. The intention, no doubt, in the original Ordinance was to provide that not more than one provisional certificate should be issued to any one man, but as the language of the existing law is not very precise on this point, and in view of the large number of applications received for second provisional certificates, it is desirable that the doubt should be cleared up.\n\nThe usual reports from the inspectors of steam boilers, and the schedule of those holding certificates of competency under the Ordinance, are appended hereto.\n\nYORKTON, December 31st, 1902.\n\nJ. S. DENNIS, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit my annual report as Inspector of Steam Boilers for the year 1902.\n\nThe number of boilers inspected by me during the past season is 209. Of this number 36 came into the district this year. The number inspected would have been considerably greater had I not met with an accident which laid me up for several weeks during the busiest part of the year.\n\nThe boilers inspected were of the following classes: Stationary boilers 32, portable boilers 102, traction 75. They consisted of the following types: Locomotive firebox 103, return tubular 101, and upright 5. A large majority of the new boilers are of the locomotive type which are made to stand a higher pressure than the return tubular type, and are more compact and not so heavy.\n\nThe condition of the boilers was as follows: Good or fairly good, 156; fair or very fair, 48; poor, 5.\n\nRepairs were ordered in 121 cases, many of which were of trifling matters. Of the boilers in poor condition one was condemned, and in the other cases extensive repairs were ordered. A few of the older boilers inspected last season have been put permanently out of use by the owners without compulsion. This is as it should be.\n\nThe boilers inspected this season were used for the following purposes: Operating grain elevators 16, flour mills 6, sash and door factories 3, creameries 4, shingle mill 1, foundry 1, mineral water factory 1, for agricultural purposes 177.\n\nThe following new industries run by steam power have come into operation in my district since last season: 1 flour mill, 1 sash and door factory, 1 shingle mill, 1 creamery, and 1 elevator.\n\nA large number of grain elevators have been built, but most of these obtain power from gasoline engines.\n\nOwing to a large number of new boilers coming into the district, Mr. Wm. Mayhew, of Broadview, was appointed to assist me and started work about the end of August. Since that date 109 boilers have been inspected by him, of which number 61 came into the district this season. This makes a total of 318 boilers inspected in the eastern district, of which number 97 came in this season.\n\nThe opposition to inspection heretofore experienced by me in some quarters has now largely died out, or at least exists only in a passive\nform. There is a great deal of carelessness shown as regards filling the boiler with water and making preparations for inspection. In very many cases no preparation is made until after the arrival of the inspector, which causes a great loss of time.\n\nI have examined 49 candidates for engineer's final certificates, all of whom succeeded in passing. Of this number 6 were foreigners who were unable to write English and they were examined orally and their answers to the questions taken down by me in accordance with the regulations passed for the examination of foreigners.\n\nThere has been the usual scarcity of qualified engineers during the past season, and a number of applications were made to me for permits of which, however, I only granted 5. The present system of granting provisional certificates, while no doubt it has served a useful purpose in the past, is not altogether satisfactory lending itself too easily to the perpetration of fraud and the obtaining of certificates by men who are not qualified to take charge of an engine and boiler. I would therefore recommend that provisional certificates be done away with altogether and that a new class of certificates be issued to be known as \"Limited or Temporary\" certificates, and that these certificates be good for three months and limit the holder to the charge of a certain specified boiler and engine, and that these certificates be granted by the Inspector, or on his recommendation after proof by the applicant of one year's practical experience and an oral examination sufficient to satisfy the Inspector that the applicant is qualified to have charge of the boiler and engine specified. I would also recommend that in the examinations for final engineer's certificates the number of written questions be largely reduced, and the candidate be taken before a boiler and engine and be required to demonstrate his knowledge of the names and use of the different parts and fittings, showing how he would handle the same, and how act in emergencies. This would do away with all ground for complaint from employers and others that men have passed their examination and obtained certificates who, when it came to the practical work of handling an engine, were found to be inefficient.\n\nThere have been no casualties reported to me during the past year, but it is quite probable there may have been some minor accidents which have not been reported, probably through ignorance that section 22 of The Steam Boilers Ordinance requires that the nearest inspector be at once notified of any accident or casualty and that the owner neglecting to do so is liable to a penalty.\n\nThe following is a tabular statement of the season's work:\n\nTotal number of boilers inspected by me in 1902... 209\n\nTypes.\n\nReturn tabular............................................. 101\nLocomotive firebox................................. 103\nUpright sectional................................. 3\nUpright tubular................................. 2\n\nClasses.\n\nStationary boilers................................. 32\nPortable boilers................................. 102\nTraction boilers................................. 75\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 209\nCondition.\n\nGood, or fairly good...........................................156\nFair, or very fair..............................................48\nPoor.................................................................5\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014209\n\nNumber of boilers condemned.................................1\nNumber requiring repair.....................................121\nNumber of engineers examined...............................49\nNumber of permits issued....................................5\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Carment,\nInspector.\n\nWhitewood, Assa., December 31st, 1903.\n\nJ. S. Dennis, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit my annual report as Inspector of Steam Boilers for 1902, as provided for by section 19 of The Steam Boilers Ordinance of the North-West Territories.\n\nOn March 5th I received instructions from the Department to proceed to Battleford and from there to Onion Lake. On my return I received instructions from the Deputy Commissioner to superintend some alterations on the Battleford steam ferry and to do the necessary repairs and fit her for the season's work. This was done, and I operated her to see that everything was working right.\n\nThe ferry station at this point, owing to the movable sand bars, makes it difficult to navigate and also to land the people without damage to the boat. It will be necessary to replace stern post and rudder posts before the boat can be put on her station in 1903, as I could not get sufficient timber of the right kind to finish them with at the time. It is only common spruce that is in at present.\n\nHaving completed the ferry and inspected the boilers in the Battleford district, I left on May 2nd for the Prince Albert branch to inspect the stationary boilers in that district, after which I returned to Regina.\n\nThe travelling this season was very trying owing to the bad condition of the roads in many districts. It was almost impossible to travel in the month of June. These drawbacks, together with the unusually wet weather, put my work back fully a month this season.\n\nI have inspected 228 boilers this year, the following being the different classes and types:\n\n| Condition | Good | Fair |\n|-----------|------|------|\n| Stationary tubular | 27   | 8    |\n| \" upright | 2    |      |\n| \" return tubular | 1    |      |\n| \" locomotive firebox | 1    |      |\n| Locomotive fire box traction | 86   |      |\n| \" portable | 24   | 5    |\n| \" \" with return tubes, portable | 1    |      |\n| \" \" traction | 9    |      |\nCondition good. Fair.\nReturn tubular traction .................. 35 11\n\" \" portable ......................... 6 6\nTown fire engine, portable .............. 1\nUpright portable ....................... 2 2\nTotal ................................... 228\n\nI have examined 29 engineers for their final certificates. The following is the result:\u2014First class, failed 3; second class; third class, 28.\n\nPermits issued\u20141.\n\nI beg to offer a suggestion with regard to examination. Our present system of advertising as to when and where an examination is to be held is rather inadequate. Putting a notice in the post office, not one out of 20 engineers ever sees it. I would suggest that the Department print a notice paper and send one to every holder of a provisional certificate, and also put a small advertisement in the local paper, so that those who have a second or third would have an opportunity of writing for a higher grade.\n\nJudging from the number of provisional certificates issued this year in my district there will be many to write for their final certificates next year.\n\nIt is gratifying to report very little friction, together with no serious accidents in my district.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nWM. WALLER,\nInspector of Steam Boilers.\n\nBROADVIEW, ASSA., December 31st, 1902.\n\nJ. S. DENNIS, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina.\n\nSIR,\u2014I beg to submit a report of the steam boilers inspected by me since my appointment in July, 1902, at which time I was engaged to assist W. M. Carment in the eastern division of Assiniboia. Some delay was caused at first, waiting for the necessary tools to work with.\n\nThe number of boilers inspected is 109, which may be classed as follows:\n\nReturn tube portable .................... 16\nReturn tube traction ..................... 13\nLocomotive portable ..................... 27\nLocomotive traction ..................... 42\nStationary tubular ...................... 9\nStationary locomotive ................... 1\nVertical traction ......................... 1\n\nNinety-four of these boilers were in good condition and 14 were only fair, that is, they were damaged either by wear or improperly cared for. One was a new boiler with only two hand holes, and they were both in the water head, which was not enough to allow the boiler to be cleaned out\nproperly. I found two boilers carrying more steam than is allowed by the Ordinance, section 24.\n\nI have also to report that I inspected 61 boilers that had not been inspected before, which means an increase to the district. This number was made up of 49 new boilers and 12 that had been in use before they came to the Territories. In 67 cases I ordered the owners to have their safety valves made so they could be sealed according to the Ordinance, section 21.\n\nNumber of candidates examined for third class engineer's certificates, two.\n\nI have no accidents to report in connection with the operation of steam boilers in this district.\n\nI am pleased to say that the owners of steam boilers are beginning to appreciate the advantage it is to them to have their boilers inspected, because they can work them with more confidence and less anxiety, especially after they have been used a few years. Some, of course, cannot see the good of it, but I find the more knowledge the owner has of his boiler the more he is satisfied with the step the Department has taken. I have been told by many of the farmers that having the boilers inspected and qualified engineers to operate them was one of the best things that could have been done for the general public.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Mayhew,\nAsst. Inspector.\n\nCalgary, Alta., December 31st, 1902.\n\nJ. S. Dennis, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit my annual report for the year 1902, as Inspector of Steam Boilers, in accordance with the provisions of The Steam Boilers Ordinance, 1901.\n\nDuring the past year I have inspected in all 257 boilers. Of this number ten came into the district this fall and were immediately operated. There are several other new boilers being put into position to be operated within a short time.\n\nDescription of Boilers Inspected.\n\n| Description                  | Number |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| Locomotive firebox           | 79     |\n| Returned firebox             | 10     |\n| Horizontal tubular           | 63     |\n| Returned tubular             | 10     |\n| Returned flue                | 7      |\n| Upright tubular              | 30     |\n| Upright sectional            | 8      |\n| Lancashire                   | 1      |\n| **Total**                    | **257**|\n\nCondition of Boilers Inspected.\n\n| Condition       | Number |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Good            | 218    |\n| Very fair       | 29     |\n| Fair            | 10     |\nThe inspection of ten boilers not in use was postponed.\n\nDuring the past year I have examined 30 holders of provisional certificates, and have issued final certificates as follows:\u2014First class, 0; second class, 7; third class, 23.\n\nThe following shows the number of boilers inspected during 1901 and 1902:\n\n1901 .................................................. 135\n1902 .................................................. 257\n\nThe number of boilers in my district is rapidly increasing, and the figures for 1903 will, in all probability, show an increase of nearly 100 per cent.\n\nThere have been no casualties or accidents with steam boilers in my district as far as I can ascertain after careful inquiry.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJos.

has already been referred to, is clearly indicated in the following details with reference to the work of the Accountant's Branch during the year:\n\n- Total amount voted for public works: $260,000 00\n- Total amount expended: $298,238 59\n- Number of accounts examined, certified and passed to Treasury Department for payment: 3,533\n- Amount collected as Departmental revenue and paid to credit of general revenue: $18,419 51\n- Amount of taxes received for account of Large Local Improvement Districts and deposited to districts trusts accounts: $90,605 02\n- Number of accounts for work in Large Local Improvement Districts examined and passed for payment: 1,521\n- Number of cheques issued in payment of accounts in Large Local Improvement Districts: 3,813\nAmount received in payment of overdue taxes in Small Local Improvement Districts and paid through trust account to proper districts (No. of cheques issued 1,146) .................. $19,923 41\n\nTotal amount dealt with through books of Department during year ......................... $427,186 53\n\nThe amount expended during the year from Territorial revenue on public works shows an increase over the preceding year of $61,664 which is practically the same increase as was shown in last year's report over the expenditure of the preceding year.\n\nThe total expenditure by the Department during the year, which includes the payment for work done from Large Local Improvement District funds, it will be noted shows an increase of $101,928.00. The amount collected as Departmental revenue shows an increase of some $10,000.00.\n\nIt will be noted that the amount collected for taxes in Large Local Improvement Districts shows a large increase over 1901, and special attention is directed to the amount of $19,923.41 collected in payment of overdue taxes in Small Local Improvement Districts, as compared with the collection of $5,961.02 in the previous year. The carrying out of collection of overdue taxes in Small Local Improvement Districts has been a successful operation, but this will be more fully dealt with under the heading of Local Improvement Branch. Attention is directed here to the large increase owing to the fact that this sum has brought in a large number of small accounts which add very materially to the work of the Accountant's Branch.\n\nAdministration and Supervision.\n\nIn previous reports of the Department information under this heading has been given with the object of intimating that the administrative cost of the Department has been kept down to a very low figure. The figure this year shows a slight increase over that of the preceding year, but the percentage of cost of administration is still much below the limit recognised as a fair percentage charge for this class of work.\n\nThe figures as to the total amount expended, and cost of Departmental staff, with the percentage cost of administration are as follows:\n\nTotal amount dealt with by the Department during year, as shown by foregoing statement ....... $427,186 53\nTotal expenditure for Departmental staff ........ 18,842 82\nPercentage of cost of administration and supervision ........................................ 4 32\n\nSuperintendence and Inspection.\n\nAmount expended on bridges, roads, dams, ferries, repairs and reconstruction and other public works requiring superintendence and inspection ........................................ $182,975 17\nAmount expended for superintendence and inspection ........................................ 5,168 86\nPercentage of cost for superintendence and inspection ........................................ 2 82\nA slight increase will be noted in the percentage of cost of superintendence and inspection of public works for the year. The figures for 1901 were 2.16 per cent. as against 2.82 per cent. for 1902. However, it will have to be admitted that the showing of the past year is a good one, and that the cost of this service has been kept well within the limits recognised by the best authorities as a fair charge for superintendence and inspection of public works requiring technical skill and training in their design and superintendence.\n\nSurveys Branch.\n\nAssistant chief surveyor.\nStaff inside.............1 clerk and typewriter.\n1 stenographer and typewriter.\nStaff outside...........Seven district surveyors and engineers.\n\nThe work of the Surveys Branch during the season has again reached large limits, and in the matter of surveys completed is practically the same as in the preceding year. In the detailed work of the branch, however, in connection with the preparation of transfers of right of way, record of plans and settlement of compensation for right of way, the work shows a very marked increase. It was found necessary in the early part of the season to provide for an additional district surveyor and engineer in the Calgary district, and Alberta was again subdivided to provide for four instead of three districts, Mr. A. C. Talbot being appointed as District Surveyor and Engineer in the new district with headquarters at Calgary. It was also thought wise to subdivide Assiniboia so as to provide for a central district with headquarters at Regina. A district surveyor was not, however, appointed, the work for this season outside the office having been performed by the Assistant Chief Surveyor who made short trips from Regina in connection with needed surveys. The districts and gentlemen filling the positions of district surveyors and engineers are as follows:\n\nNorth Alberta District...........A. Driscoll, D.L.S. and C.E.\nCentre Alberta District.........R. C. Laurie, D.L.S. and C.E.\nCalgary District................A. C. Talbot, D.L.S. and C.E.\nSouth Alberta District.........F. J. Robinson, D.L.S. and C.E.\nWest Assiniboia District......A. J. Brabazon, D.L.S. and C.E.\nCentre Assiniboia District....Administered from headquarters.\nEast Assiniboia District......W. T. Thompson, D.L.S. and C.E.\nSaskatchewan District..........Cyrus Carroll, D.L.S. and C.E.\n\nMr. F. J. Robinson, District Surveyor and Engineer for South Alberta, was unfortunately taken seriously ill in the early part of the year, and was confined to the hospital during the greater part of the year. The pressing work in his district was performed temporarily by Mr. C. H. Ellacott, D.L.S.\n\nThe reports of the several district surveyors and engineers, together with the usual schedule of surveys completed, are appended.\nJ. S. Dennis, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit herewith my annual report of the work performed by this office during the year 1902.\n\nI took the field early in March for the purpose then of making an examination survey of some largely flooded areas which were still frozen, but from which the snow had gone, permitting an easy examination to be made of the flooded and benefited areas adjacent to the Rat creek drainage scheme.\n\nThis work was followed by the usual routine of the summer's work, such as: (1) Locating drains for the benefit of road allowances; (2) surveying old and new roads and road diversions; (3) examination of old bridges for repairs or renewal, and taking cross-sections of sites for proposed new bridges.\n\nThe work of the office included the supervising of two steam ditchers and a road grader, also constant advising with two fully equipped bridge gangs, and the usual amount of information furnished to road overseers and others.\n\nTaking these subjects in the order above mentioned the following list shows their location.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

S. Dennis, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to make the following report in connection with the district surveyor's office for Lacombe Public Works District.\n\nThe principal work during the past season was surveying diversions around sloughs and other soft places that have formed on the road allowances during the late series of wet years. In many of these places the travelled road originally followed the road allowances but the water collected to such an extent that it frequently reaches to the top of the fences. In several cases where the sloughs could be easily and cheaply\ndrained and the road allowances improved I have reported the matter before surveying diversions, but in others it was cheaper to buy a road around than to either drain or grade across the sloughs although travel will return to the straight road again as soon as it dries.\n\nThe surveys completed number 84, comprising new roads, road allowance diversions and parts of old trails. The principal old trails surveyed include parts of Hobbema to Buffalo lake trail, Edmonton to Battle lake trail, and Battle river to Beaver lake. For the second of these trails I was able to substitute road allowances nearly all the way. Amongst the most important new roads are to Tindalstall creamery; east from Blackfalds six miles, around south end of Gull lake; to connect the Calgary and Edmonton surveyed road south of the Battle river near Ponoka and five miles of the road from Wetaskiwin to Pigeon lake.\n\nThere were no drains constructed by the Department in this district but considerable traversing and levelling has been done in connection with ascertaining the feasibility of draining the tract of country extending from Innisfail to Red Deer and the diversion of Waskasoo creek. I also received instructions later in the season for a number of smaller drainage schemes but was unable to make any of the necessary surveys.\n\nIn addition to road surveys I made four surveys and cross sections for small bridges,\u2014over the Medicine river west of Red Deer; over Spotted creek at Lamerton; over the Waskasoo creek at the south-east corner of the Town of Red Deer, and across Jamieson's coulee east of Red Deer. I also examined the Red Deer river from a point about twelve miles east of Red Deer to the south of Tail creek, locating all suitable points for the establishment of a ferry, reporting the apparent advantages and disadvantages of each one.\n\nThe past winter was quite mild permitting me to commence field work in the latter part of February. The spring and early part of the summer were very wet and rainy making the roads almost impassable. This delayed the work very much as the sloughs and creeks were already full from the excessive rain of the year previous. Having received instructions for the season's work I arranged a scheme of travel so as to have the least lost time, and adhered to it throughout the summer. Commencing south of Red Deer and Medicine river districts, thence I worked northward through the Blackfalds, Lacombe and Ponoka districts. I then proceeded to the vicinity of Red Deer lake and completed all surveys except one road about sixty miles long to Willow creek, which I omitted with your permission, thereby being enabled to reach the Wetaskiwin district which it would not otherwise have been possible for me to do. About the middle of October I closed up my work in the north and returned to Red Deer to take up some further surveys for which I had received later instructions, and to clear up the surveys in the vicinity of Innisfail and Bowden. Beginning at Red Deer I worked south to Bowden when I received your instructions to return to Wetaskiwin. I immediately did so and continued in the field until the end of November, when I returned to headquarters and disbanded the party. Winter having set in about the first of November I could not complete the digging of the pits, there being about one hundred sets to be dug in the spring.\n\nI note that the overseers have been doing much better work this year and are paying more attention to draining. There are still places in the vicinity of Wetaskiwin where the plan of filling in sloughs with\nstraw and manure without any earth is adhered to. This does no good, works up into a filthy batter and is very disagreeable to drive through.\n\nI notice in the large local improvement districts where there is no resident overseer that there are many places where the expenditure of a dollar or two would fix a bad spot. As the money is spent in bulk the road foreman usually attends to the large jobs and the little are left alone. I would suggest that where the district engineer sees any small repair to a bridge approach or a small drain required, he be granted authority to direct it to be done at once.\n\nDuring the past year there were 268 letters and telegrams received at this office and 311 were sent out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. C. Laurie,\nDistrict Surveyor and Engineer.\n\nCALGARY, December 31st, 1902.\n\nJ. S. Dennis, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina.\n\nSir,\u2014I beg to submit the following report on the surveys performed by me during the past season in the district of Calgary.\n\nMy appointment as District Surveyor and Engineer for Calgary was made in the latter part of the month of June. As at the time I had not yet completed the returns of my last surveys for the Department of the Interior, it was the 6th of July only that I was able to leave Ottawa. On my way from Ottawa to Calgary I stopped at Regina to receive my instructions and take detailed informations about the work allotted to me for the season. I arrived at Calgary on the 13th of July.\n\nThe following days I was busy buying my transport outfit, supplies, and hiring labourers to help me on the survey. This was soon completed but I was afterward delayed waiting for my camp equipage, which had to come by rail from Prince Albert. Owing to the bad condition of the railway at the time, freight delivery was very slow at Calgary; though I telegraphed twice I could not get any information about my camp equipage which was on the road at the time, and was uncertain as to the date of its arrival here. Seeing that the season was already far advanced I decided to buy a complete new camp equipage and left for my work on the 30th July. At the date I left Calgary I had instructions for (36) thirty-six different surveys of new roads and road diversions and I received instructions for (15) fifteen more during the season; of these (37) thirty-seven have been surveyed, (7) seven have been abandoned or reported on for further instructions and (5) five are left over for next season's work. According to instructions received in July I made an examination of the damage done by water to the boulevard on the north bank of the Bow river in Section 17 Township 24-1-5, and reported on it. Later on I made a survey of the place and prepared plans showing proposed protection work to prevent further damage, together with estimate cost of the same.\n\nMuch time was taken travelling from one survey to the other through the district, as the roads have been in very bad condition for the whole season. Considerable time was also lost in some instances\nhunting ranchers and settlers to get information about the roads to be surveyed and locating the boundaries of sections in which said roads had to be surveyed.\n\nI remained at work in the field until the 4th of November, when, after a few days of cold weather, the ground was frozen hard and I was compelled to quit work for the season. I was near Didsbury at the time. I drove back to Calgary in a snow storm and discharged my party on the 6th. Since then I have been working in the office preparing plans and field notes of the surveys made during the season.\n\n**Schedule of surveys performed during the season 1902.**\n\nRoad in Sections 16 and 21 Township 25-1-5, to new bridge site across Beddington creek.\n\nRoad in Section 26 Township 30-1-5, to bridge over Rosebud river.\n\nRoad in Sections 16, 17 and 18 Township 31-1-5, to bridge over Rosebud creek (Surveys 58-02 and 231-02).\n\nRoad diversion in Sections 4 and 5 Township 24-1-5, to avoid cut banks and deep coulee.\n\nChange of location of road in Sections 11 and 14 Township 22-1-5, across Pine creek.\n\nRoad diversion in Section 15 Township 22-1-5, to avoid deep sloughs.\n\nRoad diversion in Section 27 Township 20-29-4, to obtain grade to hill.\n\nRoad diversion in Sections 22 and 29 Township 20-29-4, to obtain grade up hill.\n\nRoad in Sections 16, 15, 21 and 29 Township 20-29-4 (Nos. 103-02 207-02), to bridge over Sheep creek at Okotoks.\n\nRoad diversion in Section 33 Township 19-28-4, to avoid deep slough.\n\nRoad across Section 29 and road diversion NE corner of Section 29 Township 18-28-4, to avoid muskegs and obtain grade down hill.\n\nRoad across Sections 19, 20 and 21 Township 18-29-4, to obtain grade across Squaw coulee.\n\nRoad across Section 5 Township 19-28-4, to avoid slough and connect with street in town.\n\nRoad Diversion in Section 9 Township 21-1-5, to avoid steep hill.\n\nRoad diversion in Sections 32 and 33 Township 20-1-5, to avoid steep hill.\n\nRoad across Sections 5 and 8 Township 1-2-5, to Sheep creek near Millarville.\n\nChange of location of surveyed trail in Sections 10, 15 and 22 Township 25-2-5, to avoid bad slough and coulee.\n\nRoad in Sections 23 and 24 Township 24-1-5, to new bridge on Nose creek.\n\nRoad diversion in Section 11 Township 24-2-5, to obtain grade down steep hill.\n\nChange of location of surveyed trail in Sections 7 and 8 Township 24-2-5, to obtain grade down steep hill.\n\nRoad diversions in Section 2 Township 23-29-4, and Section 35 Township 22-29-4, to avoid deep sloughs.\n\nChange of location of surveyed trail in Sections 4 and 5 Township 22-29-4, being part of South Blackfoot trail.\nRoad diversion in Section 7 Township 21-28-4, to avoid deep slough.\nRoad diversion in Section 2 Township 22-1-5, around a hill.\nRoad diversion in Section 17 Township 22-1-5, to obtain grade up Jamieson hill.\nRoad diversion in Section 19 Township 22-1-5, to avoid slough.\nRoad diversion in Section 29 Township 22-1-5, to avoid sloughs.\nChange of location of surveyed trail in Sarcee Indian Reserve, Township 23-3-5.\nRoad across Sections 33 and 34 Township 25-4-5, and Section 4 Township 26-4-5, from Jumping Pond creek bridge to steel bridge at Cochrane.\nRoad across Sections 5 and 8 Township 27-4-5.

TALBOT,\nDistrict Surveyor and Engineer.\n\nMEDICINE HAT, ASSA., December 31st, 1902.\n\nJ. S. DENNIS, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina.\n\nSIR,\u2014I beg to submit herewith the following report on my operations in the field during the past season.\n\nIn consequence of your letter of the 30th of April stating that a petition had been received requesting the construction of a bridge over Plume creek, in Township 11 Range 5 west of the 4th, on the Medicine Hat and Eagle Bute trail, and directing me to make a cross section of the creek for the purpose of enabling the Department to order the necessary material for the bridge, I decided to attend to this matter before any other, and therefore on the 5th of May repaired to Plume creek for that purpose, but on my arrival there I found the trail at a point a short distance south of the creek to diverge into two branches both of which cross the creek about a mile apart, and was at a loss to know at which one the cross section should be taken. I drove to different ranches in search of information on this point, but could learn nothing definite until the next afternoon, when I met Mr. Burton, one of the chief movers in getting up the petition, who told me that a bridge anywhere between the two crossings would accommodate all concerned. I therefore selected the road allowance between Sections 28 and 29 as the most advantageous location, took a cross section of the creek, and on the 7th proceeded to Dunnmore where I carefully examined the valley of Bullshead creek, as well as the country from the north boundary of Section 20-12-5-4 to the north boundary of Section 19-11-4-4, between the portions of the Medicine Hat and Josephburg road surveyed respectively by R. J. Jephson and R. C. Laurie for the purpose of establishing by the most expedient route, corresponding with the best bridge site on the creek, the unsurveyed portion of the said road between the above mentioned boundaries, and having satisfied myself in this connection I took a cross section of the creek, made the survey, and on the 22nd left for Josephburg, inspecting on my way the road surveyed by Mr. Laurie across Section 4 Tp. 11-4-4.\n\nAt Josephburg, where I arrived on the 23rd, I established the Josephburg and Elkwater lake road, from the north boundary of Section 22-9-3-4 to the south boundary of Section 36-8-2-4, between the portions of the same road surveyed by R. C. Laurie and R. J. Jephson respectively, and returned to Medicine Hat arriving on the 6th of June, and crossed\nto the north side of the Saskatchewan the same day, where I surveyed a road from the east boundary of Section 6-13-5-4 through Sections 31 and 36, and 35-12-5 and 6 to the east boundary of Section 3-13-6-4, which I finished on the 20th, recrossed the river and moved to Crockford Bros' coal mine in Section 5-13-6-4. Examined the road thereto and sent a report in on its condition containing an estimate of the probable cost of repairing the damage done it by the flood in the Saskatchewan a short time previously. I afterwards surveyed a road from the mine to the east boundary of Section 33-12-6-4, and on the 25th, the day following the completion of this survey, I set out for Maple Creek in which district my time was occupied for the balance of the season.\n\nHad I been at liberty to make the foregoing surveys in the most advantageous order from Medicine Hat, I could have gone to Maple Creek on the completion of the Josephburg and Elkwater lake road survey, via Graburn, and, by doing the work required on the Maple Creek-Graburn trail on my way, would have reached Maple Creek with a saving of at least a hundred miles of travel.\n\nOn the 30th June I commenced the survey of the old Fort Walsh trail from the north boundary of Section 36 Township 10-27-3, via Four Mile coulee to the east boundary of Section 4 Township 6-29-3 in Ten Mile coulee, where I closed on the 20th of August. I took cross sections of four creeks on this trail, and, owing to the conflicting and indefinite views of the ranchers with regard to its location, I was obliged to resurvey about fifteen miles of it. Some of the ranchers could not see any necessity for the survey, one going so far as to say he was thinking of filling the pits, and asking me what he would be allowed for doing so. I told him he would likely be allowed the option between six months and $50.00 for every four he filled. In consequence of my survey not closing at Ten Mile coulee I went over about six miles of my work looking for the error, but not finding it I concluded it was in the subdivision of the township, and commenced the survey of the section lines through the coulee in which the bush is very thick and through which no lines appeared to have been opened in the subdivision survey. Here I found the error after a considerable loss of time, and on the 21st moved to Township 10-29-3, where I examined the road allowances from the east boundary of Section 5 Township 10-28-3, the western extremity of the portion of the Maple Creek-Graburn trail surveyed by R. C. Laurie to the north boundary of Section 33-9-29-3, the eastern extremity of the portion of the same trail surveyed by R. J. Jephson, with a view of connecting by a new road the said extremities of the surveyed portions of the above trail, in the event of the route via the road allowances being found impassable. I have already informed you that a new road at this place would not be any improvement on the road allowances without extending it beyond the western extremity of the Laurie survey in an easterly direction and beyond the eastern extremity of the Jephson survey in a westerly direction. I, however, surveyed three diversions from the road allowance between Townships 9 and 10 Ranges 28 and 29-3, the first in Section 3-10-29, the second in Section 1-10-29, the third in Section 5-10-28. Before completing the surveys of these diversions, however, I received your letter of the 21st of August directing me, at the earliest possible date, to change my survey of the old Fort Walsh trail, to follow the trail via Six Mile coulee from Section 14-9-27-3 to Ten Mile coulee. I therefore returned to Section 14, after finishing the\nsurveys of the above diversions, where I arrived on the 27th, but had only proceeded with the survey as far as the north boundary of Township 6 Range 29, when I received your letter of the 6th September directing me at once to locate the east boundary of Section 30 Township 11-26-3 to enable Mr. Hammond to build a bridge over Fish creek on the road allowance between Sections 29 and 30, the site selected by Mr. Ellacott, D.L.S., for the bridge, but who failed to leave any marks to indicate the location. The day following the receipt of your letter I set out for the above township where I established the east boundary of Section 30 without the least difficulty, the section and quarter-section corner mounds being very easily found. I was surprised to learn at Maple Creek that the engineer who had been in the Maple Creek district for the purpose, I understand, of selecting and approving selected bridge sites, looked for the one in question but failed to find it, through which failure I was obliged to leave my work and make this long journey for a matter of only trifling importance as the construction of this bridge was not to be commenced till some time in January. Following the location of the east boundary of Section 30, I returned to Township 6 and resumed work on the old Fort Walsh trail, and, on its completion I changed the numbers of the posts of the previously surveyed trail via Four Mile coulee, from Section 14-9-27-3 to the east boundary of Section 3-7-29-3, making of it a new road by which the ranchers of Battle creek and Four Mile coulee will have access to Maple Creek, and in consequence of this trail via Six Mile coulee, rendering the remaining portion of this one of no public use, I obliterated all the survey marks along it from the last mentioned boundary to Ten Mile coulee, and returned to Maple Creek, arriving there on the 26th, where I surveyed a road diversion from the north-east corner of Section 10-11-26-3 to the south boundary of Section 6-11-25-3, and on its completion I proceeded to Township 14-26-3, in which I surveyed a road diversion from the east boundary of Section 22 through Sections 23 and 14 to the east boundary of Section 10, returning to Maple Creek on the 6th, and, working eastward therefrom, surveyed a diversion in Section 9-11-25-3, which I finished on the 8th, and the same day commenced the survey of another from the north boundary of Section 32 to the north boundary of Section 23-10-25-3, completing it on the 14th. Following the survey of this diversion I examined the road allowance from the quarter section corner on the north boundary of Section 23-10-25-3 to the north-east corner of Section 22-10-22-3 and found it necessary to establish eight road diversions therefrom, owing to the broken nature of the ground it crosses, in order to afford a good road between the above corners. The first of the diversions is in Sections 23 and 24-10-25, second in Sections 28 and 29-10-24, the third in Section 23-10-24, the fourth in Section 25-10-24, the fifth extends from the north boundary of Section 19 through Sections 30, 29, 28, 27 and 26, to the north boundary of Section 23-10-23, the sixth in Sections 23 and 26-10-3, the seventh in Sections 25 and 30-10-23 and 22, and the eighth is in Section 28-10-22. I completed the survey of the last of the above diversions on the 5th of November, having also taken a cross section of Skull creek, and, the weather being cold and the snow about eight inches deep, I decided to return to winter quarters and the following day I set out for Medicine Hat. On my return journey I surveyed a diversion in Sections 17 and 18-10-24-3, and lost a day searching for the obstacle necessitating a diversion between Sections 14\nand 15-10-25-3, which I failed to find, as none exists. The requisition for this diversion I afterwards learned was made by mistake. I arrived at Medicine Hat on the 14th and on the 15th I examined and found by measurement that the change in that part of the Medicine Hat-Dunmore road, crossing the north-east quarter of Section 29-12-5-4, asked for by Mr. Jenkins, could not be effected without encroaching on the C.P.R. right of way. On the 17th I crossed to the north side of the Saskatchewan at the request of the Rev. Mr. Nicholls, and made a change in the survey of that part of the Stair-Medicine Hat road crossing the property of the church. The change in this survey completed my field work for the season.\n\nWith regard to future surveys I can only say that work in this line is accumulating rapidly, but I do not know of any particular survey that should be attended to before another; every survey applied for should, in the opinion of the applicant, be made first, which is impossible, and therefore the simplest way of dealing with the matter would be to make the surveys in the most advantageous order.\n\nWhile I was working in the neighbourhood of Maple Creek the Board of Trade of that town at one of its meetings discussed the opening up of a sufficient number of new roads in the Maple Creek district alone to keep a surveyor constantly employed. I was told, for years.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that it is almost impossible to get labouring men in Western Assiniboia. I was without a cook for over a month, and during part of that time had only two men, and for over two months had only two men and a cook, and as a survey cannot be carried on with any degree of satisfaction without a full party it will be seen that my operations were greatly retarded for want of a sufficient number of men.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. Brabazon,\nDistrict Surveyor and Engineer.\n\nOffice of the District Surveyor and Engineer,\nSouth Qu'Appelle, Assa., December 31st, 1902.\n\nJ. S. Dennis, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina.\n\nSir,\u2014I beg to submit the following report on the work performed by me as District Surveyor and Engineer for East Assiniboia during the past year.\n\nFrom the beginning of the year to June 10th I was occupied in completing plans of road and other surveys made by me under your instructions in the previous year and on the date mentioned my survey party, having been organised, left Qu'Appelle for the season's field work. In consequence of the unusual rainfall the roads were in a very bad condition and our progress was considerably retarded.\n\nOwing to the large amount of work to be attended to in the central part of my district I found it impossible to visit Saltcoats and Yorkton districts, and several surveys in other districts had also to be deferred, but all of these will be completed as soon as possible after the spring opens.\n\nOn November 6th work was discontinued in the field and I returned to Qu'Appelle on the 11th, since which date I have been occupied\npreparing returns of surveys and have also made two small surveys, viz., a road diversion near Estevan and Sunbeam reservoir near Indian Head.\n\nDetailed reports relating to the different items of work performed having already been forwarded to you, I append hereto a schedule of these surveys and for fuller particulars the reports mentioned may be referred to.\n\n### Road Allowance Diversions\n\n| LOCATION | OBJECT OF SURVEY |\n|----------|------------------|\n| Sec.

T. Thompson,\nDistrict Surveyor and Engineer.\n\nOffice of the District Engineer,\nPrince Albert, December 31st, 1902.\n\nJ. S. Dennis, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina.\n\nSir,\u2014Of the thirty surveys authorised for the past year I have been able to undertake twenty-two, leaving eight to be done next year.\n\nI think I can perform two or three of these eight during the next month.\n\nThe last and by far the largest of my surveys was the portion of the Battleford and Onion Lake trail, from Frenchman's Butte to Onion Lake, a distance of about twenty-five miles, and having tie lines of about five miles more. Nearly all of my other surveys were short road diversions to avoid sloughs. In many cases there was a track already made and used. Such tracks did not facilitate in any way the making of the surveys, but showed that the work was needed. The Fire Ordinance has been productive of much good to the country, but in making these surveys I found my work vastly increased by the trees, brush and scrub that have taken the place of the former open prairie.\n\nThe old stake marks and pits are yearly becoming more difficult to find, but must be hunted up for the purposes of the surveys.\n\nOf the first mentioned twenty-two surveys I have transcribed the field notes, made plans in duplicate, and reported on fourteen, leaving eight for which I am now transcribing the field notes and making duplicate plans.\nOwing to the sudden breaking up of the ice in the rivers last spring and the unprecedentedly high water, my presence was required at and near my headquarters longer than usual, but I got out on surveys as soon as I could safely do so and continued almost without intermission till the last days of October, when the first snows came and the season closed.\n\nIn the early summer there was much rain; later there were continuous high winds; the whole season was unusually cold, but not unfavourable for work. In so large a district there is necessarily much travelling, and with the camp equipage and outfit no great speed can be made. Everything necessary for the work must be carried along. To minimise the time and the mileage of travel I have generally so arranged as to go continuously ahead.\n\nI have found that men and team for transport cannot always be got at a day's notice, nor for short and intermittent terms of work.\n\nIn certain cases, notably in that of the land of the Hudson's Bay Company at Prince Albert, and that of the lands of the Indian School at Battleford, there is a state of things that would seem to call for legislation. In both these cases there are alleged town plots, of intricate and fancifully small lots on streets and in blocks that never had, and it is safe to say never will have, an existence. The plans thereof are registered, but I think it can be conclusively proved that in those parts where road diversions are now made no stakes were ever planted. At present certain salient points can only, after much labour, be ascertained. From the skeleton thus created the surveyor must to the best of his ability calculate and lay down the portion of each lot taken and the portions not taken, entailing an enormous amount of work, much chance of error, and great expense in the papers and the registrations that have to follow in completing the expropriation.\n\nRoads.\n\nThe repairs to the embankment at the steel bridge over Shell river on the Prince Albert and Shellbrook road made in 1901 stood well, though the water for some weeks was higher than ever known before, reaching into the steel superstructure. But by keeping a man on the bridge to pass the floating logs it was saved.\n\nThe Dominion Government grant of $5,000.00 greatly improved this road and made much needed repairs in many places. The late Mr. McNabb, who was in charge of the Dominion Government work, I am glad to say consulted with me as to some of the repairs, especially to the embankment at the bridge and the raising of the bridge. On my return from surveys I found he had only raised the bridge two feet instead of four feet as I had intended, also that the bridge (a small one in the embankment) had not been made as large as I had specified. But I think there will be no danger from high water next spring. I will put a man on the bridge for a few days, if necessary, when the ice goes out.\n\nTwo small contracts of last year let but not finished, were completed this year, viz., Government Drain No. 23 on section 20-47-27 west of the second meridian, and Gray's bridge, section 18-47-26 west of the second meridian.\n\nThe surveys are enumerated in appendices 1, 2 and 3.\nDrainage.\n\nThe benefits of drainage are getting to be better understood. It is noticed that farmers are beginning to drain their lands; the road overseers are making more offtake ditches than formerly.\n\nI note a case where a road overseer was surprised and delighted with the result of a small drain along the side of the road. This led to enquiries as to other possibilities of drainage in the vicinity.\n\nBut it must be remembered that people rise up at once in opposition if a drain brings water on their lands, whether that direction is the line of natural flow of the water or not. Claiming damages in anticipation\u2014where damage may not ensue.\n\nInvestigations, Levels and Reports.\n\nThere were fifteen cases where levels were taken for drainage and for road construction. In many of these cases the reports went into details; specifications were made so that the work, if authorised, could be done under a foreman.\n\nIn the matter of lowering the waters of Duck lake I have tried to find a feasible outlet, but so far I have not succeeded. The lake appears to be constantly rising and flooding the adjacent roads and lands. I hope to get at these levels again this winter. This case and others will be found more in detail in schedule 4.\n\nInvestigations and reports have been made as to the chances of making certain roads\u2014on the regular road allowances\u2014such roads not only required for convenience, but in some cases being absolutely necessary\u2014as the old travelled trails are being fenced up and incorporated into farms. These are all in the schedule to which I beg to refer for more particulars.\n\nI may remark that road overseers are averse to making any repairs to bridges or approaches if such were built by the Government. The same may be said as to culverts. Thus a small dangerous break is often allowed to remain for a considerable time practically closing the road for a long distance.\n\nAt the Eagle hill on the Saskatoon and Battleford trail I made a survey to change a portion of the road where the hills as at the present time are far too steep for travel. I was successful in greatly reducing the grades, making most of them fairly easy. The maximum grade is 1 in 11. This is of considerable length, but I managed to secure level rests at convenient intervals.\n\nI cross sectioned and set stakes marked with cut and fill, as I understood from the late Mr. Sinclair, M.L.A., that there was an appropriation for this work.\n\nFerries.\n\nThe ferries were in danger more than once from the exceedingly high water. Warnings by telegraph and by messengers prevented much loss.\n\nIt is in order here to remark that ferrymen prefer a low cable because it is more easy of access, to make attachments and to oil the pulleys. Hence it has come about that they sometimes lower the\nsupports. The folly of such an action is very plainly to be seen when the last five feet of a rise in the water takes the cable with it.\n\nGenerally it may be stated that they only look after the cable and its surroundings when in use. Therefore, when a sudden flood occurs they are afraid of applying the full strain on the cable to raise it out of danger, as the deadman might break or the capstan give out in the trial.\n\nNor do they sufficiently regard the convenience of the public in getting on and off the scow. It is not unusual to see teams scramble, jump and bump on the scow as best they can, with the apron a foot above the level from which the wagon must rise. Very seldom indeed is any proper landing placed for the scow to abut against and its apron overlap. Making all due allowance for the difficulties arising from the frequent risings and fallings of the water, it is submitted that ferrymen should not be indifferent to such conditions. Movable platforms adjusted as required would greatly aid in the matter of landing; even a few round poles\u2014easily got\u2014would often be of much use.\n\nAt Carlton there is a sand bank taking up about two-thirds of the river bed. The sand is very soft. There is one spot where it is quicksand, with water oozing up through it and quaking like a bog. This is very dangerous. A team, if stuck in it, would, I think, never get out. The banks at the water's edge are far too steep, being washed under.\n\nPossibly a small steam dredge might be advisable to clear a channel through the sandbank.\n\nRecommendations for Next Year.\n\nMy time has been so taken up with surveys that I am not in a position to say much as to special cases needing attention. Many such there are, I am sure, that I cannot just now point out.\n\nThere is a bridge on the Prince Albert and Carleton trail that is sadly in need of repairs. It is the bridge over McFarlane's creek, and as nearly as I could ascertain on section 36-46-1 west of the third meridian. The timbers are mostly good but the centre bent is undermined and sunk about four feet, making the crossing difficult and dangerous.\n\nA small bridge is required over a stream near the railway on the east side of section 25-44-2 west of the third meridian. The cost would be about $150.00.\n\nThere is much need for the road allowance to be opened from Mr. Acorn's place, west side of section 6-47-26 west of the second meridian north to the Lily Plains road so as to be passable for travel. Mr. Acorn is about closing an old track through his fields. There is need of opening out the road allowances, section 22-47-27 west of the second meridian.\n\nIn the matter of lowering the waters of McFarlane's creek I would say that this will be a matter of a very considerable expense, as there are many miles of it to attend to and a small steam dredge would have to be used. But I have no hesitation in saying that the benefits of such lowering of the water of the creek, in facilitating the drainage of roads along its course, would justify the undertaking of that work early next season.\n\nThe drainage of the roads not only makes it possible to properly and permanently improve them, but it is also an incidental benefit to adjacent lands.\nRoad Overseers.\n\nI would recommend that road overseers be instructed to make immediate repairs in cases of small breaks in the roads, as culverts, washouts, mudholes, approaches to bridges.\n\nAll of which is most respectfully submitted.\n\nCyrus Carroll,\nDistrict Surveyor and Engineer.\n\nSchedule 1.\u2014Surveys ordered, performed, reported.

There has been a large demand for this map owing to the fact that it is up-to-date in so far as the surveys of the Territories are concerned, and it has proved of great value in connection with the general movement of people to the west now taking place.\nENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nAssistant chief engineer,\n1 draughtsman,\n1 outside clerk of works.\n\nThe work of the Engineering Branch will be found to show the same marked increase as in other branches of the Department during the past year. In fact, as this is the branch of the Department in which the larger bulk of the work properly coming within the term \"Public works\" is undertaken, it is to be expected that the work of the branch will for several years show an increase each year if an effort is to be made to keep up with the requirements.\n\nThe detailed office work of the branch during the year was as follows:\n\nNumber of plans prepared, indexed and recorded ...........207\nNumber of contracts prepared and recorded ..................129\nNumber of bills of quantities for material prepared .........350\n\nThe figures, it will be noted, show a large increase over those of last year and indicate that the office work of this branch has been of the same pressing nature as in the other branches of the service.\n\nOwing to the damage caused by floods in the west and the large amount of bridge work which it was necessary to undertake in connection therewith, it was found desirable to keep the Assistant Chief Engineer in the west during the whole season, and his headquarters were therefore established at Calgary, as the most central point from which to direct the work of reconstruction or repair of old bridges and the construction of new bridges provided for.\n\nMAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF BUILDINGS.\n\nThe crowded condition of all of the departmental buildings must again be referred to, and, unless some decision is arrived at in the near future as to permanent quarters for the Government departments, it is quite evident that serious inconvenience in carrying on the departmental work will result from the overcrowded condition of practically all of the offices.\n\nIt is also necessary again to refer to the fact that the want of vault accommodation is a serious question in practically all of the departments where valuable records are liable to destruction by fire; and this is particularly true of the Department of Public Works, where the present vault accommodation is totally insufficient for the needs of the Department, and records with reference to surveys, local improvement assessments and water rights for irrigation are liable at any time to be wiped out of existence by fire, and their loss would necessitate the expenditure of a very large sum of money in any attempt to duplicate them.\n\nMinor repairs were undertaken in all the departmental buildings, and in the LeJeune block, which we occupy under lease for the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education, a new heating apparatus was provided.\nOwing to the increased representation, granted by the bill passed at the last session of the Legislative Assembly, it became necessary to provide increased accommodation in the Legislative chamber. This was accomplished by extending the chamber to the south, so as to provide additional seating room on the floor of the House and also space for the public and press. As it now stands, the chamber provides somewhat better accommodation than it did, but at best it is only a makeshift and far from being in keeping with the work of the Legislative Assembly.\n\nThe work of improving the grounds surrounding the Government buildings was continued during the year, and a qualified gardener employed, and the work done has added much to the appearance of the grounds. In connection with this work it was found desirable to provide a small greenhouse for use in preparing plants for the garden in the early part of the year.\n\nThe lease under which quarters are provided for the Normal School in one of the Public School buildings in the town expired in September, but under arrangements with the School Board it has been renewed for another year. I have again to point out that the necessity for considering the matter of the erection of a Normal School building is deserving of attention in view of the large rent which is being paid and the cramped and crowded quarters provided under the existing lease.\n\n---\n\nREPAIRS TO PUBLIC WORKS.\n\nThe season of 1902 will certainly be a memorable one in so far as the damage to public works from excessive floods is concerned. In the western portion of the Territories these floods reached an unprecedented height, and while it is not an unusual feature to have high water in the spring, we not only had a flood at that time, but later on in the summer we had a second flood, which reached a much higher level than the one of the earlier season. A vast amount of damage was caused by these freshets, and bridges belonging to this Department, the C.P.R. and to the Dominion Government were destroyed, and at one or two points serious damage and financial loss was caused to municipalities and individuals by the destruction of buildings and other property. At Cardston a very considerable portion of the town was undermined and a large number of buildings entirely washed away, while others were undermined and seriously damaged. In the city of Calgary the excessive floods on the Bow river caused great damage. In the village of Pincher Creek damage was caused both to the village property and to the buildings of private individuals, and at numerous places the excessively high water proved a menace both to public life and property.\n\nAll things considered the Department is to be congratulated on the small number of large and important bridges which were damaged or lost. In the south the old steel bridge over the St. Mary river at Cardston was entirely destroyed, the destruction of this bridge being largely due to the fact that houses from the village of Cardston situated above the bridge on the east were carried against the structure and created a dam which necessarily destroyed the bridge. South of Macleod the bridge over the Waterton (Kootenai) river at Stand Off escaped the first flood but was destroyed by the second flood owing to the large\namount of drift which was carried down by the stream and lodged against the structure. In the Pincher Creek district the steel bridge which crosses the South Fork river, formerly called south fork of Old Man river, was damaged, the end of one span being dropped into the stream. In the Sheep river district the bridge crossing that stream at Okotoks was damaged, one span being washed out. In the Calgary district damage was caused to the steel bridge over the Elbow river at the Weasel head crossing and the Bow marsh bridge over the Bow river at Calgary. In these cases, in common with many others, the existing structures were not washed out, but large portions of the banks were carried away, necessitating the erection of additional spans. All over the country small bridges were washed out and in the majority of instances, where these structures were old, were entirely destroyed.\n\nThe work of attempting to replace the larger of the more important bridges to meet the requirements of public travel necessarily formed a serious undertaking, owing to the shortness of the season and the great difficulty experienced in obtaining material. It will be noted, from the schedule given later on, that an exceptionally large amount of work was completed. The possibility of doing this work was entirely the outcome of the present system of erecting new and repairing old bridges by qualified bridge gangs under competent foremen, instead of attempting to do the work by contract.\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF BRIDGES.\n\nThe usual schedule of bridges constructed, reconstructed, or repaired during the season, is given hereunder.\n\nTwo hundred and eighty bridges were dealt with during the season as compared with 113 dealt with during the year of 1901. The expenditure in connection with the construction, reconstruction and repair of bridges during the season amounted to $146,633.11, and this amount shows an increase over the expenditure of the preceding year of $44,253.97. The marked increase of 167 bridges constructed, reconstructed or repaired over the preceding year is worthy of note and will indicate that every effort was made by the Department to deal vigorously with this important section of the season\u2019s operations.\n\nSCHEDULE of Bridges constructed, rebuilt and repaired, 1902.\n\nAntler creek, south (S. 2-3-32w1) ....

Both of these bridges were large structures which cost large sums of money when erected and their loss caused serious inconvenience to the public. The matter of their reconstruction has been under consideration for some time and, under authority of an Order of the Governor General in Council, the question of replacing the destroyed structures by permanent steel bridges on concrete foundations has now been delegated to the Territorial Department of Public Works.\n\nAmong the bridges included in the foregoing schedule the following are worthy of special mention:\nBridge over the Red Deer river at Tindastoll.\n\nThis bridge which was mentioned in last year's report was completed early in 1902 and opened for traffic before the ice went out of the stream. The new bridge, as well as the bridge over the Red Deer river at the town of Red Deer, withstood the unusual floods of last season without damage.\n\nBridge over High river at Alley's ford, section 17 township 20 range 28 west of the fourth meridian.\n\nMention was made of this bridge in Departmental report of 1901. Steel superstructure was erected early in 1902 and the bridge was opened for traffic when the ice broke up. The structure withstood the freshets of 1902 without damage.\n\nBridge over Sheep river at Okotoks.\n\nThis bridge was seriously damaged by floods in June, the approaches and part of the pile trestle between spans being carried away. Repairs were made, but the more serious freshet which occurred later in the season again washed out the approaches and one of the spans of the bridge was carried down stream about half a mile. Later in the season this span was replaced, the whole structure being raised about one foot and the approaches rebuilt, leaving the bridge in much better condition than it had been for several years. While the site is not a desirable one, owing to the fact that about one-half of the channel is usually blocked with saw logs, when as a matter of fact the whole section of the stream should be open to pass the water. Under normal flood conditions several years' service can be taken out of the old structure, but floods such as those experienced last season will be likely to result in further trouble at this point.\n\nBridge over Willow creek, at the crossing of the Calgary-Macleod trail.\n\nAt this point the creek partly changed its course, leaving the bridge by some three or four hundred feet, and the features of the old crossing were thereby so changed that it was not considered advisable to reconstruct the bridge at that point. It was, therefore, moved some half mile farther up stream, an 80 foot truss being taken from the old crossing and another of the same length provided, with a 120 foot pile approach, thus providing a first class crossing at a safe height above high water and at a point where further damage from floods is not likely to occur.\n\nBridge over Willow creek on Claresholm-Lyndon trail.\n\nThe construction of this bridge, which consists of one 125 foot steel truss with 60 foot pile approaches, was undertaken after the July floods. Work was completed before the end of the season and a safe and reliable crossing provided at a point where very serious inconvenience has always in the past been experienced during periods of high water.\nBridge over Bow river at Canmore.\n\nIt was decided to reconstruct this bridge because the old structure was so decayed and unsafe that it seemed clear that it could not possibly stand another season's high water. The work was commenced early in 1902, but owing to our inability to procure the necessary timber in time to complete the work before the period of high water, some inconvenience was occasioned by the freshets of June and July, which washed out the old structure before the new was completed. The new bridge, which consists of two 112 foot Howe truss spans on substantial pile and crib piers, with a 24 foot approach at each end, was completed immediately after high water. The north bank above the bridge site was badly washed away during high water, but will be protected by sheet piling and dykes, which we are putting in this winter.\n\nBridge over south fork of Old Man river, north of Pincher Creek.\n\nThis bridge consisted of two 102 foot pin connected steel trusses. The east shore pier and the centre pier were washed out and collapsed during the period of high water in June, the east truss being let down into the stream and so twisted that it was necessary to replace the four end posts. It was decided to put in a new substructure immediately below the old crossing and add another span to the bridge, one 114 foot pin connected truss being obtained for the purpose. This new span, together with the two old ones, was erected on a new substructure of our standard design, with a 60 foot pile trestle approach at each end, and at a safe height above high water mark to prevent the possibility of further damage by floods.\n\nBridge over Waterton (Kootenai) river near Stund Off.\n\nThe superstructures of this bridge which supported two 120 foot pin connected trusses were washed out and collapsed letting the south span into the river. After the June flood an effort was made to raise and secure the trusses, but the last rush of water in August swept everything away, there being nothing left to indicate that there had ever been a bridge at that point. One of the steel spans was rolled three miles downstream. Two spans were recovered and out of the parts, when straightened, we were able to build one span. Two additional steel spans were then provided, increasing the length of the steel superstructure by 102 feet. Substantial pile and crib piers were put in with 100 feet of pile trestle on the flat at the south end of the bridge, and the trusses raised well above high water mark.\n\nBridge over Fish creek at crossing of the Calgary-Macleod trail.\n\nThe damage sustained by this bridge during the freshets in June were repaired in a temporary manner, but the structure was partly carried away by floods later in the season, it being here demonstrated, as in the case of several other bridges on western streams, that nothing but a truss span, or spans, of sufficient length to permit the passing of drift wood without obstruction could be of lasting service. An 80 foot steel truss was, therefore, placed over the main channel with one 24 foot span pile and timber approach at the south end, and three at north end of 80 foot span, the latter being placed on substantial pile and timber piers.\nBridge over Jumping Pound creek at Butler's crossing, section 4 township 26 range 4 west of the fifth meridian.\n\nA 100 foot Howe truss with 20 foot span timber approach at each end was erected at this point to provide a crossing to enable settlers on the north to reach Cochrane, their market town. The structure was completed about midsummer and has been in service ever since.\n\nBridge over Jumping Pound creek at Stuart's crossing, township 24 range 4 west of the fifth meridian.\n\nThe old structure at this point, which was partly washed away by the freshets early in the season, is being raised and made more substantial by the addition of a 60 foot timber truss at the east end.\n\nBridges on the Qu'Appelle river.\n\nFive 80 foot steel trusses were erected on the Qu'Appelle river during the past season at the following points: One at Warren's crossing, one at Hyde's crossing, one on the main trail from Loon creek to Balgonie, one at Osler's crossing and one at Lumsden.\n\nThese bridges are all on main roads leading to market points, and enable large settlements living north of the river to cross at the points mentioned at any time during the year.\n\nCONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF ROADS.\n\nThe unusually wet condition of the early months of the summer rendered it almost impossible to do anything in the way of road improvement, and about midsummer, when the conditions in this respect were somewhat improved, the unusual demand for labour and horses to aid in saving the bountiful crop made it almost impossible to take advantage of the dry season to complete work which it had been impossible to undertake in the earlier part of the year.\n\nThe sum of $32,534.91 was expended in connection with road improvements during the season, but the work done was of necessity of a somewhat makeshift and patchy character and consisted largely in an effort to fill up holes or provide means to get around sloughs and low places which had been rendered impassable in the earlier part of the year.\n\nRoad making is probably the most difficult problem with which the Department has to deal. The general conditions relative to this subject have been referred to at length in previous reports and very little can be added to the information therein contained. However, each year makes it more apparent that the efforts of the Department should be centralised in attempting to provide main roads only, and it is again suggested that if it is possible to lay down on the map of each district the main roads required in connection with the development of such district, some effort might be made to put such main highways in fairly good condition. The ever changing conditions resulting from the opening up of new settlements and the extension of railway lines seem to put the possibility of defining main highways out of reach for the present;\nbut it is certain that a continuation of the present methods in attempting to improve roads without having a definite scheme to work to, must result in poor returns for the expenditure devoted to this class of work.\n\nDuring the year a new edition of the Manual of Instructions for the guidance of Overseers of Local Improvement Districts and foremen employed in making road improvements was issued, and in revising this manual an effort was made to so extend the instructions as to improve the system previously followed in dealing with this class of work. It must again, however, be pointed out that the time has come when it would be well for the Department to consider the question of employing an instructor with reference to road work who would visit the different localities and, by graphic method, endeavour to improve the knowledge of our overseers and foremen with regard to the matter of road making.\n\nDRAINAGE.\n\nThe unusual rainfall of the year has directed the attention of the Department to the necessity for drainage in districts where this matter had not been considered of importance, and the Department is now face to face with the necessity of dealing with the subject of drainage in portions of the Territories which previously were considered as deficient in necessary rainfall.\n\nApplications for the construction of drainage ditches have been filed from all parts of the Territories, and it seems quite evident that in the near future a very considerable sum of money must be expended on this important work. The difficulty of dealing with the subject on a fair basis was specially referred to in last year's report, and it is clear that, before extensive drainage work can be undertaken, additional legislation relative to this matter must be enacted.\n\nIn many districts land owners have signified their willingness to join with the Government in constructing necessary drainage ditches, but under the existing law it is of course impossible to provide any means of assessment by which all property benefited can be made to bear its fair share of the actual expenditure.\n\nThe steam ditching machine referred to in last year's report was put to work early in the season in Northern Alberta, east of Fort Saskatchewan, and did very satisfactory work. Later in the season a second machine was ordered and put to work, just before it froze up, on a large ditch required in the Edmonton district. Orders were also given for three additional machines of this kind which it is proposed to operate in North-East Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Central Alberta. With these machines it is thought that the larger and more important ditches can be undertaken during the coming year and completed within reasonable limits of cost. The ditches, however, which it is proposed to construct with these machines will drain large areas of private property, and it is only fair that owners of such property should bear a fair proportion of the cost of the work.\n\nThe question of drainage is, of course, closely allied with the matter of road improvement, because in areas where drainage is needed it is not possible to construct roads until the surface water is run off. The Government are therefore particularly interested in the matter from that\nstandpoint, and, as it is possible to state with a fair degree of accuracy the areas of roads which will be drained by a ditch in any district, it is thought that legal machinery can be provided under which the proportion of cost between the Department and the owners of adjacent lands which will be benefited can be clearly defined, and the matter of the assessment and collection of the proportion of cost based upon such benefit clearly determined.\n\nThe usual schedule of ditches and drains applied for is appended.\n\n**Schedule of Ditches and Drains for which Applications have been made for 1902.**\n\nS. 55/56-20w4 .................

The excessive floods experienced on practically all streams upon which ferries are operated caused serious inconvenience in their operation, and loss of plant in many cases. Owing to the loss of the Dominion Government bridges across the Old Man river at Macleod and over the Belly river at Lethbridge, it was found necessary to install temporary ferries to provide for the public needs during the period of high water. The operation of these ferries was discontinued as soon as it was possible to ford the streams and the necessity for them will, of course, cease after the reconstruction of the bridges referred to.\nFIREGUARDS.\n\nIt is gratifying to be able to report that the western portion of the Territories practically escaped any serious fires during the year. In Western Assiniboia one or two extensive fires took place, the most serious of which came into the Territories across the international boundary and burnt over a large area of country, causing serious inconvenience to the ranchers.\n\nIn the early part of the year a contract was entered into with the C.P.R. Co., under which the Department undertook to construct a proper fireguard along such portions of the company's main line and branches in the Territories, as was thought necessary. Under that contract we completed 1,751 miles of fireguard. This guard consisted of 16 furrows, ploughed to a depth of at least 4 inches and situated 300 feet from the track. Under the contract the company were required to burn out the grass between the track and this guard before the season for fires had arrived, and, although that part of the contract was not very thoroughly carried out, the fact that no serious fires were started by sparks from locomotives is evidence that the system proposed by the Department, and carried out under this contract, will have a marked effect in reducing the list of fires started by railway locomotives. In addition to the fireguards provided along the railway line the Department completed 898 miles of guard, a large proportion of which is situated in Western Assiniboia and Southern Alberta. The appended schedule will show the location and mileage of the guards completed.\n\nFIREGUARD Contracts, 1902.\n\nCanadian Pacific Railway, Main Line.\n\n| Location                                      | Miles |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Calgary to Gleichen                           | 117.50|\n| Gleichen to Cluny                            | 18.25 |\n| Cluny to Bowell (incomplete)                 | 28.75 |\n| Bowell \u2014 west                                | 13    |\n| Bowell to Medicine Hat                       | 30    |\n| Dunmore to Irvine (to be ploughed in spring) |       |\n| Irvine to Cummings                           | 34    |\n| Cummings to Forres                           | 12    |\n| Forres to Kincolth                           | 20    |\n| Maple Creek to Cayley                        | 21    |\n| From S. 6-12-29w3 to mileboard 937, two miles east of Gull Lake | 22.625|\n| Swift Current to Moose Jaw                   | 24    |\n| Moose Jaw to Pasqua                          | 12.80 |\n| Pasqua to west boundary of T. 18-16w2        | 105   |\n| West boundary of T. 18-16w2 to west boundary of T. 18-13w2 | 36    |\n| West boundary of T. 18-11w2 to Wolseley      | 20.50 |\n| Wolseley, three miles east                   | 6     |\n| Three miles east of Wolseley to Summerberry  | 10    |\n| Summerberry to Oakshela                      | 31.50 |\n| Oakshela to Broadview                        | 18    |\n\nCalgary & Edmonton Railway Line.\n\n| Location                                      | Miles |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| West Macleod to Leavings                      | 22.50 |\n| Leavings to Claresholm                        | 20    |\n| Claresholm to Cayley (incomplete)            | 66    |\n| Cayley to High River                          | 18    |\n| High River to Calgary                         | 8     |\n| Through section 17 and part of S. 7-20-29w4  | 3.33  |\n| Calgary Junction to Beddington                | 10    |\n| Beddington to Airdrie                         | 20    |\n| Crossfield, south                             | 4     |\n| Crossfield to Carstairs                       | 22.50 |\n| Carstairs to mileboard 42                     | 5     |\n| Mileboard 42 to mileboard 45                  | 6     |\n| Didsbury, north                               | 4,468 |\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS\n\nFIREGUARD Contracts, 1902.\u2014Continued.\n\nCrow's Nest Pass Railway Line.\n\nDunmore to Seven Persons ........................................... 32 miles\nSeven Persons to Burdette ........................................... 60 do\nBurdette to Grass Lake ............................................. 16 do\nGrassy Lake to Lethbridge (incomplete) .......................... 104 do\nLethbridge to Slide Out ............................................ 42.50 do\nBelly River to Pearce ............................................... 4.50 do\nPearce to Macleod Station (Haneyville) ......................... 15.50 do\nMacleod Station (Haneyville) to Brockett ....................... 38.75 do\nBrockett to Pincher Creek .......................................... 18 do\nThrough sections 12, 13 & 14 T. 7-1w5 ............................ 6 do\nCowley to Burmis (to be done in the spring).\n\nSoo Line.\n\nPasqua to Drinkwater .................................................. 23 miles\nDrinkwater to Milestone .............................................. 64.50 do\nMilestone to Estevan .................................................. 101.43 do\n\nQu'Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway Line.\n\nSection 4-32-4w3 to S. 36-35-4w3 .................................. 40 miles\n\nAlberta Railway & Coal Company's Line.\n\nLethbridge to international boundary .............................. 126.25 miles\n\nSt. Mary's River Railway Line.\n\nSpring Coulee to Pot Hole ............................................ 24.75 miles\nPot Hole to Stirling (incomplete) .................................. 24 do\n\nWORK done on Fireguards in 1902.\n\nRush Lake guard (reploughed) ...................................... 18 miles.\nFrom Calgary and Edmonton Railway line west on north boundary of T. 26-1w5 (reploughed) ................. 7.50 do\nFrom C.P.

The large influx of settlers into districts known to be seriously deficient in water supply must, in the near future, largely increase the demands for this class of work. The work undertaken during the past year is set forth in the report of Mr. William Duff, superintendent of well boring.\nJ. S. Dennis, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina.\n\nSir,\u2014I beg to submit my report with reference to well boring operations conducted during the year ending December 31st, 1902.\n\nEight well boring machines were in operation for part of the season, consisting of six Austin machines, which bore to a depth of 300 feet with five inch casing, and two Ohio Jetting machines with two one-half inch casing, distributed at the following points throughout the Territories:\n\nNo. 1, Austin machine, in Souris district.\nNo. 2, Buck Lake and Grand Coulee districts.\nNo. 3, Maryfield and Cannington Manor districts.\nNo. 4, Wolseley district.\nNo. 5, Pasqua and Rouleau districts\nNo. 6, Saskatoon Local Improvement district.\nNo. 7, Ohio, Maple Creek, Pense, Oxbow district.\nNo. 8, Ohio, Lethbridge Local Improvement district.\n\nThe following is a list of work done by each of these machines:\n\nNo. 1 machine started work in the village of Carievale, S. 31-2-31w1, and bored to a depth of 251 feet and got a good supply of water, also a supply of gas. This well ran over at about 4 feet above the surface through a 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch pipe. S. 6/35-2/3-33w1, Glen Ewen (no water), sunk to a depth of 275 feet and 175 feet of 5 inch casing. Village of Alameda, S. 1-4-3w2, 240 feet 5 inch casing, 150 feet water.\n\nNo. 2 Austin machine in charge of Mr. Thos. Spence, was operated in the Buck Lake district under special instructions as to work to be done and payment of same. Messrs. Boyle and Tucker were to provide teams and help, and move machine, also board Mr. Spence while at work. After operating the machine for some time Mr. Spence transferred the machine to Mr. Tucker to operate. The following work was done: S. 33/34-15-19w2, Buck Lake, 300 feet deep, no water, 227 feet 5 inch casing. S. 15/16-17-21w2, Coulee Station, 128 feet, 108 feet 5 inch casing, 45 feet water. S. 14/15-19w2, Buck Lake, 250 feet, no water. The same material was reached in this well as the previous one in the same district.\n\nNo. 3 Austin machine in charge of Mr. William H. Ward, was operated in the Maryfield district on S. 32/4, 10/11-30w1, to the depth of 305 feet with 290 feet 5 inch casing and obtained no water. The next operation was on S. 12/13-9-1w2, near Cannington Manor, to a depth of 325 feet with 300 feet of 5 inch casing and obtained 250 feet of water.\n\nNo. 4 machine, in charge of Mr. Fred Doman, was operated in the Wolseley district on S. 11/12-17-10w2, town of Wolseley. S. 35/36-17-9w2, Rose Lane school; also at Poplar Grove schoolhouse, S. 11/12-19-9w2, Rosewood schoolhouse.\n\nNo. 5 Austin machine was sent out in charge of Mr. Edward Brooks to Pasqua district. After working a few days he sent in his resignation and I was instructed to make arrangements to have the machine shipped back to the warehouse at Regina. On October 14th this machine was taken to Rouleau, to put down public wells in that town, in charge of Messrs. A. W. Dalgleish and G. Ball, these parties undertaking to have the machine and all its parts transported to Rouleau to operate on one of the public streets of that town and return the machine in good order and repair to Regina at the completion of this work.\nNo. 6 Austin machine, sent out in charge of Mr. Henry Martensen, in the Saskatchewan Local Improvement District, to commence operations at Henley, S. 1-31-4w3, then on S.-19/24-30-4-5w3, then in the village of Dundurn. After operating the machine for some time and having the misfortune to lose two of his horses, he sent in his resignation and the machine was then given in charge of Mr. A. L. Warner to operate.\n\nNo. 7 Ohio machine was sent out to Maple Creek in charge of Mr. John Reynolds to deepen the well in that village. After the completion of the work there it was next operated in Pense village to a depth of 450 feet. The next place it was operated was in the village of Oxbow, and after completing work in that district the machine was shipped to Moose Jaw for further instructions. It was then decided to discontinue the use of these machines, the hole put down with it having proved too small to be serviceable.\n\nNo. 8 Ohio machine, in charge of Mr. David Duff, was operated in the Lethbridge Local Improvement District, in the village of Sterling, the village of Raymond and on S. 25/26-8-21w4. It was also decided to discontinue the use of this machine and have it shipped to Regina.\n\nThere was on hand in stock in the warehouse at the beginning of the season, after machines had received their first supply: 238 feet of 5 inch heavy casing; and we received from Mackenzie & Milne Company during the season\u20144,831 feet 4 inches of five inch casing, 3,007 feet of two and a half inch casing galvanised, 4,056 feet of one and a quarter inch galvanised iron pipe, 2,140 lbs. of seven-sixteenths galvanised iron rods, 150 lbs. of seven-sixteenths galvanised couplings.\n\nThe machines were all supplied with a pumping attachment to test the supply of water in each well before leaving same in order to determine the quantity and quality of water obtained in each case. They were all put in thorough good working order during the winter so that there would be no delay during the season.\n\nI would suggest that something should be done in regard to districts taking charge of and keeping in repair pumps, pumphouses and wells after they have been put down and tested as to the quantity of water. There are a great many wells throughout the country which from time to time are reported out of order, and, when a man is sent out to see what is wrong he finds a handle is broken, bolts taken out, base of pump broken and such like, and one man could not begin to keep them all in order. These things do not break of themselves and it causes a lot of trouble and also needless expense, largely due to wilfulness or carelessness of the parties who should be most interested in keeping the pumps in order.\n\nAmong the wells sunk to a depth of 300 feet, and which should be deepened, are the following:\n\n3 wells in the Moose Jaw District;\n1 well in Pense village;\n1 well south of Pense, S. 7/13-16-21/22w2.\n2 wells north of Grenfell;\n1 well at Kenlis;\n1 well at Maryfield;\n1 well at Glen Ewen;\n1 well at Stirling;\n4 wells in the Lethbridge Local Improvement District;\n2 wells in the Buck Lake district.\nPumps have been put in all wells where a supply of water has been obtained, and pumphouses erected over same to protect them for the winter.\n\nThere was not as much work done this year as I would have liked partly owing to wet weather in the early part of the season, which made it very difficult to have the machines moved from place to place, and partly owing to the inexperienced workmen operating the machines. There are now in several districts throughout the Territories a number of wells put down and cased with 5 inch and 6 inch casing to a depth of 300 feet, and for the purpose of deepening these wells, and to carry on this work to a finish so that water can be obtained, it would be well to consider the advisability of heavy well machinery to accomplish this important work.\n\nThere are also several wells in the Territories where there is a good supply of water, but, owing to the depth, settlers are unable to use them for want of a power pump. Some among them that are badly needed are:\n\n- No. 56, Moose Jaw district, S. 16/17-18-25w2;\n- No. 87, Moose Jaw district, S. 9/16-18-26w2;\n- No. 54, Wolseley district, S. 10/11-19-10w2;\n- No. 112, Souris district, S. 34-2-34w1;\n- No. 114, Souris district, village of Alameda;\n- No. 115, Cannington district, Cannington Manor.\n\nAt these points I recommend that a windmill pumping plant be provided.\n\nI was unable to make as full an inspection of the wells in the several districts as should have been done, owing to other urgent work on hand, but will do so at as early a date as possible.\n\nOwing to the way in which the country around Moose Jaw, Pasqua, Belle Plain, Pense, Regina, Rouleau, Milestone and Yellowgrass is settling up, and the scarcity of water in these places for new settlers, I would recommend to you the advisability of purchasing at least two revolving process machines, with attachments to work pole tools in the event of encountering boulders in the progress of the work, capable of working to a depth of from 1,500 to 2,000 feet, with a 40 foot derrick for same. There are a good many of the tools used on a rig of this kind in stock in the warehouse that could be utilised for this work.\n\nI would further recommend, in the event of the purchase of one or more of these machines, that gasoline, instead of steam power, be used for this work, as it would do away with the services of a qualified engineer, and it would leave the water used for steam purposes to be applied on the operation of well sinking; and further that the engine be bought in Canada, thereby effecting a saving of duty and freight on same. I would also recommend that these machines, if got, be operated continually, that is, night and day to the completion of the well, and that two competent foremen be secured in time to operate each machine, together with the necessary help.\n\nThe six Austin machines should be operated in the districts suitable to their capacity, with a competent driller as foreman on each machine.\n\nAt a test made on No. 4 machine by Mr. Fred Doman at Rosewood schoolhouse, with a five horse power gasoline engine, supplied by The McLachlan Gasoline Engine Co., 201 Queen St., Toronto, he found that he could get from 3 inch to 4 inch longer stroke and steadier than what he could with 4 horses on the power.\nI further made a test with same machine at Kenlis to determine the amount of gasoline consumed in ten hours steady work, and found that a fraction over two gallons per day was the amount used. The engine is now in the warehouse, and I would also recommend the purchase, for each machine sent out, of an engine of the make above described, as it is the simplest machine I have ever seen on the market and the easiest to operate.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nWILLIAM DUFF,\nSuperintendent of Well Boring.\n\nIt is apparent that the Department must now consider the steps which it is necessary to take to obtain water in the districts where we have failed to develop a supply with our present well boring plant. That deep well boring (that is \"deep\" in the sense that drilling will have to be carried to depths beyond 400 feet) is an expensive undertaking is well known. However, in the districts where the use of our Austin machines or the Ohio Jetting machine have failed to develop a supply, it is quite apparent that only by the use of machines which will bore to great depths can we hope to be able to provide what is absolutely necessary to enable the settlers in these districts to obtain the water supply which they must have to enable them to continue their farming operations.\n\nSCHEDULE of Public Wells.\n\nMaple Creek, S. 15-11-26w3...........

The perusal of the report, and consideration of the work done will, I think, make it at once apparent that had it not been the aim of the members of the staff by persistent effort to keep up with the mass of work it would have been impossible to have dealt with the volume of correspondence and other work, which I think can be pointed to as a record for a department with the staff roll of the Territorial Department of Public Works.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.
