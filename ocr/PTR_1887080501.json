Canon Pickett.\n\nTHIRD PAPER MAY BE FOUND AT:\nChurches, Post Office, Drug Stores, Hardware, &c., &c., &c.\nThis Paper is Supplemented by the following:\nNEW YORK.\n\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 5, 1887.\n\n\"GIVE me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely, all matters of concern to the public; to read books where I please, to speak my sentiments in public, and to choose my own teachers, and not the teachers of the State.\"\n\nIn his day there was indeed little real freedom of any kind, and the liberty which he then held dear was but an aspiration, to all appearances of the most remote attainment. It has been reserved for our day and for our generation to obtain an amount of liberty of mind and action, notably in this respect, to which our own ancestors were strangers and which even the present generation in most foreign countries has never to this day enjoyed. We can easily imagine what intelligent foreigners, European continentalists for instance, must think when they become first acquainted with the perfect freedom and independence of thought and action which our newspapers discuss so merrily and vital questions, cut and slash public measures and scarcely prominent men without mercy.\n\nOur Dominion press also takes full advantage of the peculiar liberty it enjoys. Loyalists may do so and may such liberty never degenerate into license. We must say, however, we like not the airy carelessness with which some of our contemporaries indulge in comparisons on the comparative merits of the British connection and we are greatly mistaken if the thoughtful reading public enjoy the numberless declamations of dreary outrage which a portion of the Canadian press continues pouring over the land on the unalloyed benefits of commercial union and those journals on the enlightened evils of centralisation, the dark ill-success of the Confederation and the sins and shortcomings of our rulers in gross and in detail, in which poor pessimists virtually tell us our country is going to the dogs.\n\nTwo or three times it might have been supposed from reading the same newspapers that all possible and impossible grievances whatever were located in the North-West Territories, that we were exposed to hardships and moreover that though we wanted everything we could do nothing for ourselves, that we were, generally speaking, a poor ungrateful set. But patience, as the proverb says, is the longest of the noble heritage nor the distinguishing feature of the North-West. We seem to be now tolerably happy and contented in our position and prospects. It appears that many of the older provinces feel themselves down trodden and ill-used and misgoverned. Is it they whom blind guides and interested men have led astray? Or is it hard to be happy by first showing them their misery and their folly. But they will survive the process and see through it all in time.\n\nWe observe there is an Inter-Provincial Congress in course of organization. It will probably act as a safety valve to blow off pent-up and superfluous energy and we may hope it will discover a perfect panacea for all ills. Possibly croakers may however be told beforehand that there is no patriotism in belittling their country\u2014that many sound judges of the same country are convinced on quite identical terms that considering the bad times prevailing all over the world, Canada has had good reason to congratulate itself on her prosperity. But who wants now is some thing alone. We may do worse than possess our souls in patience for a time and re-pose some confidence in the rulers who have so recently replaced ours.\n\nThe population of the North-West Territories bids fair to become by and by as considerable in its character as the United States.\n\nNot to speak of the English and French speaking Canadians, who may almost be reckoned indigenous, we are constantly receiving recruits from the old countries to make up the United Kingdom as well as most of the other European nationalities. The Scandinavian element is becoming fully represented as well by natives born Studies, Norwegians, Danes, Swedes, Finns, etc., who relatives the Icelanders. The latter in particular have been arriving in large numbers and the cry is still that they come. It appears that the Icelandic exodus were about to take place from their interesting but barren island. It is reported that late the population of Iceland has been suffering severely from bad harvests and that many of the more westerly would gladly leave for the Canadian North West were means to enable them to do so forthcoming, which will eventually be provided.\n\nAfter these volcanic rocks and in homely soil such communities must seem an earthly paradise, and there is room and to spare for them all, if they choose to come. These Icelanders will without doubt make excellent settlers. They travelled in the island representing the people as industrious, peaceful and religious. Considering their isolation and by no means affluent circumstances, they are also comparatively well educated and having been nurtured to hardships from birth they will be able to make light of such little asperities as all must at first expect who embrace the healthful and invigorating life of Canadian pioneers.\n\nQU'APPELLE\n\nFrom the Progress, July 21.\n\nThe Progress presents from upas a new addition to Qu'Appelle street.
