There is a sawmill at Bad Throat, where all the rough lumber can be secured. These facts should be noted in connection with the proposed new combined school and teacher's residence at Hollowater River.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 515-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nMay 20, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI am pleased to inform you that the Department has made arrangements with His Lordship the Bishop of Keewatin for qualified teaching services at the Hollow Water River Indian Day School. This activity is quite regular and the school is well attended. The Department wishes to arrange for the erection of a combined classroom and teacher's residence. I understand that there is a sawmill at Bad Throat, where the rough lumber can be secured, and good building sand may be obtained at Big Island. There is an appropriation of $3,500 for this building and I should be grateful if you would proceed without delay with its erection. Please be guided by general instructions in Dr. Scott's 1-1-5 of the 6th instant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant 125-5-5 with reference to the building of a proposed new combination school and teacher's residence at the Hollow Water Indian Reserve, and reply to say that if the Bishop expects to have a building of frame, with lath and plaster erected it will be pretty close figuring to do it within the amount of $3500.00. However, this matter will be looked into and the work started.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask for an accountable advance cheque of $1000.00 to be used for labour in connection with the new school and teacher's residence to be built on Hollow Water Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report in connection with schools that on my recent trip to Manitoba I made arrangements for the building of the Hollow Water School with Mr. A. G. Monkman of Selkirk. He is supplying all material, labour, etc., for the sum of $2500.00. This is $1000.00 below the amount estimated and I consider it a very low price, and as he was the lowest tenderer and bears a good reputation as a builder, there was no reason that I could see why he should not get the work.\n\nThe size of the building is 34 x 40 with two rooms at one end for the teacher's living quarters. This is along the lines requested by His Lordship, the Bishop of Keewatin.\n\nM. Christianson\nSelkirk, Man., 19th September, 1927\n\nSir:\n\nWhen at Hollow Water River and Bloodvein Reserves in last summer the school teachers reported that some of the biscuits had been damaged in transit by water. I instructed them to open all the boxes and let me know exactly the amount spoiled and I would ask the Department to replace them. I have received the following information:\n\nAt Hollow Water out of 16 boxes shipped, 13 were spoiled and unfit for feed. At Bloodvein, out of 24 boxes, 15 were damaged. This will mean a shortage of 31 boxes or 775 lbs. to be replaced.\n\nI should state that the damage was done between Necla and Hollow Water, and Matheson Island and Bloodvein, where the transportation has to be made in small boats.\n\nWillingly let me have your decision regarding this at an early date and oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, September 22nd., 1927.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 19th instant, I beg to state that 775 lbs. biscuits have been ordered from The Canada Biscuit Company, of Winnipeg, for the Hollow Water River and Bloodvein Day Schools. These biscuits will be shipped to your address at Selkirk.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent.\n\nC.A. Stevenson Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n| ARTICLES | A.

Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from His Lordship the Bishop of Kewatin in which he states that Rev. E. W. Gardner, teacher of the Hollow Water River Indian Day School, is giving up duties, and nominates Mr. Cathcart, who holds an Ontario Second Class Certificate, for the position to succeed Mr. Gardner. The Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Cathcart, with salary at the rate of $75 per teaching month. If he dispenses medicines, he will receive an annual grant of $50 for this service. It is presumed that Mr. Cathcart will begin his duties as teacher at the beginning of the next school year, or about September 4th, next. We are informing Mr. Agent Stevenson of the appointment of Mr. Cathcart.\n\nHis Lordship requests that, owing to there being insufficient accommodation in the teacher's residence in connection with the new school building for Mr. Cathcart and his family, the Church authorities be allowed the use of the old school building, which they propose to fit up at the expense of the Church. He states that by using the two rooms of the school residence, with cellar and the three rooms, into which it is proposed to divide the old building, ample accommodation will be provided. The Department has no objection to the Church authorities fitting up and using the old school building for the purpose mentioned.\n\nHis Lordship requested that owing to his absence we inform you of the above matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

A. Stevenson\n\nIndian Supt. or Agent.\n\nA separate form to be used for each school.\n\nForm No. 99\nSelkirk, Man. 25th September, 1928\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose requisition for school material received from Mr. E.W. Cathcart, the new teacher at Hollow Water Indian Reserve.\n\nThere is one sheet marked \"Special Requisition\" which includes today's request for visitors' chair and number of desks. In his letter he states that there is at present seating accommodation for 13 pupils, and as there are 25 pupils attending, there will not be sufficient seats. I beg to inform you that there are 25 children on the school register, but the average attendance for the last term is 11.75. These figures are taken from the quarterly returns ending Dec. 15th and March 15th, 1928.\n\nWhen this school was built in 1927, the toilets were omitted and these are urgently needed.\n\nHe also suggests building a fence round the school so as to keep cattle and horses from the building. This I consider necessary but can be delayed until next spring as it is getting too late to do this work now.\n\nI enclose Mr. Cathcart's letter which kindly return for this office files.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nThe Department is not prepared to supply the extinguishers, sanitary drinking cups and holders.\n\nWe are sending a 6' flag to the teacher.\n\nRelative to the fencing, this will have to stand over until next spring. You should, at that time, again draw the attention of the Department to the matter, giving full particulars as to the amount of fencing required, the type and cost of same.\n\nRelative to the toilets, I shall be pleased if you will furnish an estimate of the cost of the erection of separate toilets - one for the boys and one for the girls. They should be of an inexpensive type. When we have this information, consideration will then be given to authorizing the erection of same.\n\nIt is considered that, with the number of desks which you are authorized to purchase, there should be sufficient seating accommodation for the number of children who will attend, and we are, therefore, not prepared at the present time to supply the number of single desks which the teacher requested.\n\nI am returning herewith the communication which you received from the teacher relative to his requisitions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It seems to me that this should be more and more emphasized in order to bring about fuller development of all their powers, and especially of our young people and children. It is wonderfully cheering to the teacher to note the increasing pleasure of these juveniles as they find themselves advancing in this knowledge, and rising to a higher standard of living.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy the work and regret much that owing to weakness of sight I felt compelled to resign. The constant teaching together with church duties, dispensing of medicines and visiting proved too much strain on my eyes.

Mr. Cathcart reports that the Indians have supplied and delivered the posts on the ground and will also drive them and build the fence free.

This fence is badly needed as the school is built on an open point, which is the pasture for all the horses and cattle on the reserve.\n\nThe following would be the approximate cost for material required.\n\n| Item                        | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Cost |\n|-----------------------------|----------|------------|------------|\n| Paint for toilets           | 1 gal    | pearl grey | 4.10       |\n| Inside school               | 1 gal    | pearl grey | 4.10       |\n|                             | \u00bd gal    | cream      | 2.15       |\n|                             | \u00bd gal    | white      | 8.80       |\n| Brush                       | 1        | \u00bd\"         | 1.75       |\n| Brush                       | 1        | 5'         | 2.75       |\n| Linseed oil                 | \u00bd gal    |            | 80         |\n| Fence for school grounds    | 2 spools |            | 8.50       |\n| 4 point barbed wire         |          |            | 4.25       |\n| Staples                     |          |            | $33.25     |\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nC A Stevenson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 18, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing a requisition from the teacher of the Hollow Water River Indian Day School for material for renovating and repainting the school building and toilets.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the quantities of paint, brushes and linseed oil mentioned in your letter.

It is noted that the teacher requests that 25 pounds of bacon be supplied. The Department does not usually furnish bacon for the pupils' midday lunch. Last year 20 pounds of cocoa was asked for in place of bacon, and the Department considers that it would be advisable to supply this quantity of cocoa instead of the bacon, unless you have the bacon on hand from the contract supplies sent you for the use of your Agency. You should give the matter of the purchase of the above supplies your early attention, and arrange to have them forwarded before navigation closes.

Lofthouse, D.D., Bishop\n\nBISHOPSTOWE,\nKENORA, ONT.\nJune 21st, 1945.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Teacher for Hole River,\nour letter of 14th inst.\n\nThank you for your letter of the 19th inst. with reference to Mr. Emil Plancknert.\n\nI am sorry your Department is not able to approve his appointment as permit teacher at Hole River. Since the end of September last we have endeavored by all possible means to secure a certified teacher for the school. With the great shortage of teachers, and with many teaching on permit in Manitoba, there is little hope of our securing a certified teacher. The people are most anxious to have a missionary-teacher, and I had hoped that with his wide experience Mr. Plancknert would be acceptable to the Department. He is well educated and speaks four European languages and has had some experience in Manitoba. He was formerly a monk in the Roman Catholic Church in Belgium, and by conviction he left that Church and was later connected with our Church in Ireland.\n\nIf it is possible to give further consideration to our recommendation in view of the extreme difficulty of securing a teacher for the school at Hole River, I should be much obliged, for I am of the opinion that the above-named would do good work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 515-5, part 2)\nIndians Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources,\n\nPlease find attached, requisition for School Supplies, for Hollow Water Reserve Day School. As you will note, there is a new school teacher just appointed, Mr. E. Planckaert. There has been no school teacher at this reserve since Mr. Marsh died a year ago.\n\nThere are 47 pupils at this school, with desk accommodation for 32. The remainder must either sit on the floor or boxes. This situation makes it extremely difficult for the young children to carry on with their lessons and studies.\n\nThe weather indicates an early freeze up, so may this matter be taken care of immediately.\n\nE. McPherson, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, October 2, 1945.\n\nAIRMAIL\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nI enclose a requisition which has just been received from Indian Agent McPherson. He states in his letter that the weather indicates an early freeze-up; consequently, the supplies are required immediately. You may make local purchase in Winnipeg and arrange early shipment.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, 7th November, 1945.\n\nMr. E.

This is very necessary, since lighting and heating is very unsatisfactory. The window area is 26 sq. ft.

Our missionary Mr. Cunningham opened his home and worked in his children keeping them well during their stay. He has been doing this for six months and his daughter Annie, a holder of a 2nd class teacher's certificate, has attended. Good work was done. I think a grant ought to be made by the Department for this work. If a grant of $25.00 is made to the teacher by the Department for teaching the Church will do something for the missionary.

The Rev Mr Cunningham's daughter conducted a School with the assistance of her father during the most of last winter. She however left Island Lake in the early summer and so far as I know is not now available. She was not there at Treaty time in August and there was no word of an expected return.\n\nMr Cunningham however told me that he intended to take up and carry on School work as soon as the building which he was erecting should be completed. It would serve the double purpose of a Church and a School.\n\nHe further stated that taking children practically meant to him feeding and clothing them because the parents were so poor. I admire his enthusiasm and would like to see him supplied with books etc and give him the salary usually given by the Department to cover rent and the feeding of the children.\n\nAs to the number of children resident in the vicinity I am quite sure there will not be many resident in the immediate vicinity. His plan of taking them in, housing and feeding them, will however enable him to get as many as he can support or has room for.\n\nIt will be seen by my copy of the Estimates sent some time since that I made provision for the support of a teacher as well as for a new School House for my judgment was that this should not be delayed.

Her father who is missionary among the Island Lake people opened his home and they took in 14 children first and did something toward clothing them. Miss Cunningham taught them up to date neither she nor her father has received anything for this service. The children made rapid advancement under her tuition so I have been informed.\nOttawa, November 2nd, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th of September, last, and in reply to that portion in which you ask for the erection of a day school building I beg to say that this matter is now receiving the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, in reference to the grant to Miss Annie Cunningham, who taught school at Island Lake from January to July 1st of this year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter was first brought to the notice of the Department in August, last, and upon inquiry it was satisfied that the work being performed by Miss Cunningham merited recognition and on October 5th it agreed to allow a salary of $300.00 per annum, to take effect from July 1st, last, for this school. The Department regrets that Miss Cunningham has not been fit to continue the work at Island Lake, but you will see that the action taken was prompt in so far as the Department was concerned.\n\nWith reference to payment for the six months from January to June the Department will, upon receipt of a return from Miss Cunningham showing the enrollment and attendance during the period mentioned, pay her at the rate of $300.00 per annum.

As soon as the Reserve is located the School should without doubt be erected.

This would be fair to everybody.\n\nI have every confidence in the Rev Mr Cunningham the preacher in charge. He is a practical man and is of all others in that locality the proper person to take charge of a grant for the erection of the building. I think the size of the proposed School should be large say 30 x 25 so as to admit of four rows of seats facing the teachers desk. It should be built of logs dovetailed at the corners. All lumber will of necessity be made on the ground by whip-saw. Mica roofing will again be necessary for the freight from Norway House to this point is $11.00 per cwt. Doors can be made of tongued and grooved lumber. Windows must be shipped with the roofing and nails from here. This reduces the freight bill to a minimum.\n\nThe cost of building will be about as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Cutting and hauling logs | $100.00 |\n| Sawing lumber         | 100.00 |\n| Erecting building     | 200.00 |\n| Roofing and windows   | 30.00  |\n| Freight and nails     | 50.00  |\n| Incidental            | 20.00  |\n| **Total**             | **500.00** |\n\nI cannot say that the people themselves are clamorous for a school but that arises from the fact that they have not yet wakened from the stupor of a dark past. However it is a necessity in my judgment and we are by Treaty bound to instruct and elevate them.\n\nAs to whether the Department ought to build the School this year or the year following I can only say that the convenience of the Department must be consid-\nSir,\n\nThe Methodist work at Island Lake has been carried on with vigor for the last four years but the greatest progress has been made in the three years last past. A Parsonage was commenced and completed in 1908. A Church has been built this year and is approaching completion. A school was organized by the Rev Mr Cunningham and was taught by his daughter in 1908 and this year is being taught by himself and his wife. This School was recognized by the Department under the number quoted above, dated October 8th 09, and the grant dates by that authority from July 1st of the current year. It is practically a boarding school as the clergyman has found that to get anything regular in attendance he has had to get the children to stay with him. This as was explained in a former letter of mine arises from the fact that the Parents being all hunters are scattered over a large area making it impossible for children to reach the School. The lake is stormy and the way is long.\n\nSchool has been kept in the Ministers house but is to be moved to the Church building as soon as it is ready.\n\nThe population of Island Lake is shown by the Treaty given last summer to have been 580. The juvenile element was made up of 176 boys and 154 girls. All these are of the most illiterate type, the most uncivilized people I have yet met. The need of Schooling is therefore quite apparent. A school building is quite necessary.\n\nAs to the location of the new School.

Sir,\n\nIn reference to the request made by you for the erection of a school building at Island Lake I beg to say that from information lately received the Department considers that this application might be deferred, as there is a convenient building available at present for school purposes. It will, however, assume the payment of a salary for a teacher there at the rate of $300.00 per annum, and the Rev.

As I have never visited Island Lake personally I do not know the exact conditions, but have understood from Mr. Ferrier and others who have been there that a school building is an urgent necessity. Doubtless, however, the Department has reliable information from its own agents.\n\nRespecting the intimation that a grant of $300 (Three Hundred Dollars) will be made by the Department for the salary of a teacher at Island Lake, I beg to point out that this is much below the amount granted at other points much more favorably situated. Considering the remote and isolated position of Island Lake, and the cost of getting in supplies, a grant of $500 would not be more than the equivalent of $400 (Four Hundred Dollars) at many other points. It should be considered, also, that at so isolated a place as Island Lake a married Teacher should be sent, and such an one, if properly qualified, cannot be obtained for less than $700 (Seven Hundred Dollars) per\nOttawa, December 1st, 1909.\n\nRev.

Dr. Sutherland, stated that a salary of $500.00 per annum would be paid at Island Lake if the Church could get a properly qualified married man to take charge of the school at that point.

Would the Department sanction her appointment at a salary of five or six hundred dollars?

As this school is under the auspices of the Methodist Church it is presumed that she was sent to that point by you.\n\nAccording to the schedule of salaries agreed upon, the salary provided for this school is $800 per annum plus bonus provided by law, which, for the current fiscal year is being allowed at the rate of $15.00 per month for the ten teaching months. As we are now preparing our bonus pay list for the current quarter, I shall be pleased if you will state the date on which Miss Sturdy began duties, and also particulars regarding her qualifications and experience.\n\nI will be pleased to have the information asked for at your early convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, June 14, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has not yet received the March quarter return from the Island Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIf this school was open during that quarter you should request the teacher to prepare and forward her return at once.\n\nIt is noted that the December quarter return was received at the Department within a month of the end of the quarter and apparently there is no reason why the March quarter return should not have been forwarded as promptly.\n\nI would request you to point out to the teacher that her delay in forwarding her return causes considerable inconvenience to the Department and it is hoped that returns from this school will be forwarded promptly at the close of each quarter in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWilliam Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMAN.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the Returns of Island Lake Day School for the Quarters ended March 31st and June 30th.\n\nIt will be observed that Miss Sturdy closed her school after having taught only 168 days of the year. This she did with my permission, and as there was no mail service I had not the opportunity to refer the matter to the Department. Miss Sturdy has had a hard time at Island Lake. She opened School at the Mission first, but after a few weeks the people living there all left for their winter trap lines, and she then moved to the Chief's location where she was the only white person and about 10 miles from the mission. Here she had a small house and the people put in a partition, made some benches, and she used one room as a school room, and the other as a living room. Miss Sturdy would have completed the year, but the Missionary and his wife were coming out to attend Conference, and had she not come with them, she would have had to make the trip, a dance trip of about five days, with only the company of the Indians.\n\nThe situation at Island Lake from a School standpoint is a difficult one, since the Indians are divided into three companies on three locations, and are accustomed to take their whole families when they go fishing and hunting.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 21, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing returns of the Island Lake Indian Day School for the March and June quarters. It is noted that Miss Sturdy, the teacher, taught only 168 days during the year, that she has given up duties and returned to her home.\n\nWe understand the difficulty of the situation at Island Lake, but are taking up with the authorities of the Methodist Church - under whose auspices the school is conducted - the question of continuing the school work at this point. The Church authorities are being informed that, if they decide to send in a teacher for the next school year, they may do so, but that the salary at the rate of $600 per annum will only be paid on the actual number of days the school is in operation, as shown by the returns. As soon as we hear from the Church authorities regarding their decision as to whether they will obtain a teacher for next year, or not, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nOttawa, June 21, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Gordon, Norway House, informs the Department that Miss Sturdy, Teacher of the Island Lake Indian Day School, has given up her duties. The missionary and his wife were coming out and she decided to come along. It would have been necessary for her to make the trip, taking about 5 days, in company with the Indians only. Miss Sturdy taught only 168 days during the past year.\n\nAs you are aware, the situation at Island Lake, from a school standpoint, is a difficult one, because the Indians are divided on three different locations and are accustomed to taking their whole families when they go fishing and hunting. If you decide that it would be in the interests of the work to send in a teacher for the next school year, beginning on or about September first, next, the Department would continue the grant at the rate of $500 per annum for salary, but the same could only be paid on the actual number of days the school is in operation.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you as to whether it is intended to obtain the services of a teacher for the next school year, or not. If so, the name and qualifications of the teacher secured should be forwarded for the information of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAset. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of June 14th last, re the non receipt of the Returns for the March Quarter from Island Lake Day School, I would point out that while it is possible that the December Quarter Return arrived in Ottawa in January it is barely possible to have the March Quarter Returns in the hands of the Department much before the middle of June.\n\nWe have no regular mail service to Island Lake, are dependent on the courtesy of trappers, and must be ruled by their convenience. The last mail from Norway House to Winnipeg over the ice left Norway House April 10th, and was too much delayed to have reached our March 31st. arrival from Island Lake for transmission by special messenger, which would be costly. The next mail from Norway House for Winnipeg left this point May 1st.\n\nThe Returns from Island Lake were received by me by the first canoes from Island Lake early in June, and were promptly forwarded, and should have been in the hands of the Department shortly after your letter was written.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

I discussed this matter with Mr. Gordon who is at Norway House and he was of the opinion that this was about all we could expect in the way of school attendance from the people for the present. I have not yet had a reply from Mr. Chapin.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTF/GD\nOttawa, August 29, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, in which you advise the Department that you have arranged with Mr. Chapin to teach the children when there is a sufficient number of them near the mission at Island Lake to warrant opening the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this plan is approved. As you were informed in our letter of June 21st, the Department will continue the grant of $800.00 per annum for salary, but the same will only be paid for the actual number of days the school is in operation. As we consider there are 200 teaching days in the school year, Mr. Chapin would be allowed payment at the rate of $4.00 a day for each day on which the school was conducted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I thought this wise, owing to the fact that a large number of the Indians were camped in the vicinity, and the attendance would be large, and a number more might become interested sufficiently to make arrangements for the attendance of the children during the winter. At any rate, a larger number are brought in touch with the school, even if only for a short time.\n\nThe illness of the teacher just at the time was regrettable, but I have the assurance of the Missionary that he was very ill. He is, apparently, strong and healthy normally, is young and vigorous, and may have been working too hard, as he was, besides teaching, working to fit up a disused house for the schoolroom for the winter, and cutting out roadways which had overgrown with underbrush. I would recommend payment for the full 40 days.\n\nWe have found it necessary to secure the use of an old house, and some repairs were necessary. There may be a little expenditure in connection with this, but only a little, and I trust the Department will meet this. Such expenditure would be for some material for floor and seats.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Act.

AGENT GORDON, NORWAY HOUSE AGENCY.\n\n---\n\nIsland Lake United Church School will have an excellent teacher this year who will D.V. teach full year - and with the new school building, this school should make a better showing.\nDecember 27th,\n1930.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI am enclosing camera pictures of the new school and mission house at Island Lake. The school is completely finished and I am sure that you will agree with me in seeing it as a very creditable-looking building. The mission house is not quite complete yet, as it lacks the roof on the kitchen and still requires some finishing on the interior upstairs.\n\nWhile I am discussing Island Lake, may I say that at a recent meeting of our Sub-Executive I was asked to correspond with you about the possibility of the Department bearing part or all of the travelling expenses of the teacher to and from Norway House. For example, Miss Patterson's expenses going in last fall amounted to $266.80. If she should remain there for two or three years, that probably would not seem like an excessive amount, although, as you will readily recognize, it is very expensive travelling; but if she decides at the end of one year of service that she does not wish to continue there, this expense will be repeated next year, which would mean that our Board is paying in travelling expenses an amount equivalent annually to at least one-third of the salary which is paid by the Department. After having visited that place last July, I am of the opinion that it will be quite difficult to keep teachers there for any length of time, and that we shall probably be up against these bills for travelling expenses almost annually.\n\nI am not sure whether the Department has any policy in regard to this matter, or whether they would be willing to make a special case of two or three of these isolated Indian Missions where it is so difficult to secure the right type of teacher.\n\nThanking you for an early reply to this request,\n\nI am Yours very sincerely,\n\nKJB.MLT\n\nEncs.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 5, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, and I wish to thank you for the pictures of the new school and mission house at Island Lake, Man. The school is certainly a credit to your Society and to the Department.\n\nWith reference to travelling expenses for those teachers whose schools are remote from lines of communication, I may say that there is a regulation prohibiting government departments from paying travelling expenses of employees, except when they are transferred by their department from one post to another. Even in such a case, the authority of His Excellency in Council is required. The Department has to ask the various missionary societies and orders who are interested in distant schools to consider the travelling expenses as part of their missionary enterprise. This is the rule, and I regret that nothing can be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Kenneth J.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nIn the rather extended and very beneficial conversation which I had with you during my recent visit to Ottawa, there is one matter at least about which I forgot to speak.\n\nYou may remember that in the fall I mentioned to you my desire to conduct summer schools for the children at Gods' Lake and at Island Lake. At that time, if I remember correctly, you stated that you would be willing to try out the experiment and that there would be a per capita grant for each actual teaching day.\n\nI have been in communication with Miss Frances Patterson, who is at Island Lake, and she has expressed her willingness to stay there during the summer and take her vacation in the early fall. Her suggestion is, however, that she should dismiss the twenty pupils who are now on her roll and take in an entirely new class for the summer from among the group of children who have been off in the woods with their parents all this winter.\n\nAs you are aware, there has been no teacher at Gods' Lake for about three years, and I found a group of about thirty children there last summer who were not receiving any teaching whatever. Will you please let me know what the per capita grant for such teaching would be? I am taking it for granted that it will be quite all right to go ahead with the appointment of a summer teacher for Gods' Lake, and I should like to get your reaction to Miss Patterson's proposition in regard to Island Lake.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-1, part 1)\nOttawa, March 14th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the Island Lake Indian Day School, the authorities of the United Church of Canada have directed the Department's attention to the fact that a number of the children who should attend this school are absent in the woods during the winter with their parents and, as a result, obtain little or no education.\n\nTo remedy this condition, it has been suggested that a summer school be conducted during the months of July and August for these children. The Department is approving of this arrangement and is advising the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada that salary at the rate of $100 a month for the months of July and August, 1931, will be allowed Miss Patterson, who will conduct the school.

L. Patterson will continue. She has been carrying on summer school with very great success, so many students registering that she has had to have them come in different groups, morning and afternoon. She plans to take her vacation in October and November. If the Department desires the school kept open during those months, Mrs. H. L.

His wife holds a second-class New Brunswick permanent certificate and has had three years' successful teaching experience. Her references are very good indeed. If at any time it is impossible through illness, or for any other cause, for her to keep open the school, her husband holds a first-class Saskatchewan teacher's licence and will be glad to substitute for her. We are extremely fortunate to secure a teacher of Mrs. Bacon's type for that isolated school.\n\nNelson House: Mr. David W. Hanna.\u2014Mr. Hanna is the son of a China Inland missionary and received his education up to Oxford matriculation at their school in Chefoo, China. He has been five years at home in Canada and graduated this spring from the Toronto Bible College. He will be a missionary-teacher\u2014just as Mr. Nelson Gaudin has been for the last two years.\n\nIn conclusion, I may say I have done a lot of hard work in securing recruits for this Northern work during the last year, and feel very gratified indeed at the results.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nMissionaries Going to Northern Manitoba\n\nThe Rev. H. L. Chappell and his bride have been appointed to mission work among the Cree Indians in Northern Manitoba. The career of Mr. Chappell includes the full course in arts and divinity at Saint John's College, Halifax; his education being placed this year along with Mr. Biecn and others at the Maritime Conference of The United Church. Mrs. Chappell was formerly Miss Mary Mosher, of Sussex, N.B., and holds the first-class certificate of the province of New Brunswick. Mr. Chappell is a native of Westmount North in Cape Breton county. He first served the Home Mission Board on the Red Bank, and in Miramichi Presbytery in 1927. The next year he was at Salton, in St. John Presbytery, and was invited to return there for 1929. In 1930 he received commendation for services rendered at Bevitt, in Moose Jaw Presbytery. He studied homiletics in Greek at Mount Allison University, and in New Testament at Pine Hill Divinity Hall on graduation this year.\n\nThe Chappells will spend their first year of married life on the Island Lake field. The mission house is nine days' overland from Norway House, or nine \"sleeps\" as the Indians call the shorter distance while canoeing and portaging between camps. In the winter they will take three hundred mile trips by dog train to the five main camps to which the Indian trappers and their families scatter for the fur season. The Indians come back to the permanent camps only in the spring and summer: at Wasagamaw, Marle Portage and Island Lake, and at that time the best opportunity for pastoral and school work presents itself. For the school, Miss Frances MacKenzie, late of Calgary, and formerly associated with Dr. Grenfell's work in Labrador, remains at Island Lake with the Chappells to conduct the school. When she goes they will be in full charge of the mission.\nI think these are the outstanding facts, and now I leave it to you to judge, whether or not the experiment has been a success, and is worth doing every summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd., Frances L.

I hardly feel able to judge as to its success etc., so I will state the facts as nearly as possible, and leave the decision to someone else.\n\nA large registration was obtained, quite early in the session, being sixty-seven in all. The regularity of attendance, and interest in general, was fairly good until Treaty time. Treaty being paid at Maria Portage, on the other reserve this year, took the entire population away from here for about eight days. For a week or ten days after the Treaty celebrations were over, the attendance and interest lagged very perceptibly, things were just reviving, when berry picking season commenced. The result was that the entire month of August has been very much broken in to, the attendance varying from ten to fifty.\n\nI feel that the month of July was very worthwhile, but whether or not August justifies the teacher's salary, another year I cannot say.\n\nThose pupils who attended with a fair amount of regularity have progressed to the stage, where, if they were to attend from now on they would advance steadily, that is they are emerging from the initiation period.\n\nI noticed a marked difference between the girls and the boys.

I am sending this on to you, because I am not sure that you will have received a copy.\n\nAs to arriving at a decision concerning next summer, I am presuming that that can wait until I am in Ottawa early in November and we can discuss it together.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MLT\n\nEnc.\nNorway House, Man.,\nSeptember 24, 1931.\n\n81-16A.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nSir;\n\nReferring to your letter No. 123-4-1 of August 24th with reference to the Island Lake United Church Day School I would suggest that if Miss Patterson desires to take the full two months of October and November for vacation that the school might be closed during those months. For at least a part of these two months many of the Indians are fishing and take their whole families with them to the fishing grounds. Should Miss Patterson wish to take only a part of these two months for her vacation I would recommend that she be permitted to take just so long as she desires and have the school open for the balance of the term and that she be paid at the same rate as for the other months on the basis of the days taught. Trusting that the Department will agree to this suggestion and as it would be too late for word to be returned to Island Lake unless by radio message from CKY, Winnipeg - the reception of which message would be uncertain - I have taken the liberty of advising Miss Patterson that this may be done in this way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the holiday period at the Island Lake United Church Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to official letter of the 24th ultimo, in which you were informed that Miss F. L. Patterson would continue as teacher, conducting the school during the months of July, August and September, and that the holiday period would be taken during October and November. Should Miss Patterson wish to take only part of the two months' holidays, this will be satisfactory. In preparing her return, she should state definitely thereon the dates between which the school was closed.\n\nIt is noted that you have informed Miss Patterson that she can arrange the holiday period as stated in your letter, and your action in this matter is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nMiss Patterson writes from Island Lake to say that if we desire her to remain and to conduct a summer session again this year, she is perfectly willing to do so. She also intimates that she is not certain about next fall and winter, but thinks that she will probably find it necessary to find a location somewhere near home (Calgary). In the event of her desiring to leave at the close of the summer session, say, the middle of September, we shall find it necessary to secure another teacher. Mrs. Chappell, who is the wife of our missionary there, holds a first-class teacher's certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan and has had several years' experience. I feel quite certain that she could carry on the school work very creditably. In fact, she is much superior in every way to any teacher that we have ever had there before Miss Patterson.\n\nI shall delay answering Miss Patterson's letter until I hear from you as to your intentions concerning another summer session at Island Lake.\nOttawa, March 5, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter of the 3rd instant, I beg to say that the Department approves of the same arrangement as last year in connection with the Island Lake School, viz., that Miss Patterson conducts a summer session.\n\nAs the return for the quarter ended December 31, 1931, has not yet reached the Department, I am not yet certain if Miss Patterson took holidays during October and November, last.\n\nIf Miss Patterson desires to leave Island Lake at the close of the summer session, the Department will favourably consider the appointment of Mrs. Chappell as teacher. It might be advisable to permit this school to remain closed during the months of October and November, as Mr. Agent Gordon advised the Department in a letter dated September 14th, last, that for, at least, a part of these two months many of the Indians go fishing and take their whole families with them to the fishing grounds. You might let me know when you have definite word regarding Miss Patterson's intentions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Kenneth J.

The Department is approving of this arrangement.\n\nI understand it is possible that Miss Patterson will give up duties at Island Lake about the middle of September. If it is necessary to keep the school open after that date, I am informed that the services of Mrs. Chappell, the missionary's wife, could be secured. I note from your letter of September 14th, last, that you do not consider it necessary to have this school open during the months of October and November.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Chappell as teacher of the school at Island Lake from the 1st September, when Miss Patterson terminates the summer school.\n\nIn a previous communication I have intimated that Mrs. Chappell holds a first-class certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan and has the very highest references from two inspectors under whom she has taught. Our Superintendent of Indian Missions, Mr. Barner, has discussed this matter with Mr. Gordon, the Agent at Norway House, and with the Inspector of Schools for that part of Manitoba, and both are quite happy over this nomination.\n\nWill you please send Mrs. Chappell official notice of her appointment and let us know what her salary will be.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, July 12, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, nominating the services of Mrs. H. L. Chappell as teacher of the Island Lake United Church Indian Day School from the 1st of September, next, when Miss F. L. Patterson terminates her duties as teacher.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the qualifications which Mrs. Chappell possesses have been noted and are satisfactory. The Department will approve of her appointment, with salary at the same rate as allowed Miss Patterson, viz., $100 per teaching month, less $60 for the recessed fiscal year. The Department understands that this school will be conducted during the months of July, August and September, and that the holiday period will be taken during October and November. In the event of the holidays being taken during the months mentioned, the school would not reopen until December 1st, next, when it is presumed Mrs. Chappell would begin duties.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Gordon of the approval granted for the appointment of Mrs. Chappell. You have not stated Mrs. Chappell's address, and I would, therefore, request that you notify her of her appointment and the salary allowed, also the date when she is to begin teaching duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Chappell as teacher of the Island Lake United Church Indian Day School to succeed Miss Patterson, who is terminating her services at the end of the present summer term. The Department is approving of the appointment of Mrs. Chappell, with salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year.\n\nIt is understood that this school will be conducted until the end of September, next, and that the annual holiday period will be taken during the months of October and November. If this arrangement is carried out, Mrs. Chappell will begin duties on December 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nRe Mrs. Chappell's Appointment to Island Lake.\n\nI have not yet written to Mrs. Chappell because I am not entirely satisfied that the months of October and November are the best months for holidays at Island Lake from the standpoint of the Indian.\n\nLetters to and from Island Lake are necessarily very slow, but I take the liberty of quoting a paragraph from the latest letter received from the present teacher, Miss Frances Patterson, in response to an enquiry made by me on March 8th. She expects that the summer session will end this year - as it did last year - at the end of August.\n\n\"Re the question of closing the school for the months of October and November. I have discussed the problem with the Chappells from every angle, and we have come to the conclusion that the months of April and May would be the best in which to close the school. It is quite true that the people take their families away during fishing season in October and November, but they also do this during the muskrat season in April and May. From the teacher's standpoint we decided in favor of the spring months, because dog team travelling in the latter part of March or the beginning of April would be more agreeable than in November or December. Also, April and May are pleasanter months in which to take a holiday. Again, the teacher who came in, in May, fresh from a holiday would be in trim for the heaviest portion of the teaching year, - the summer session.\"\n\nI should be glad to know what your reaction to Miss Patterson's suggestion is, that the holiday months should be April and May rather than October and November. Of course, I can see a disadvantage from the standpoint of the Department during their present fiscal year in following her suggestion, as it would mean twelve months' teaching this year at Island Lake, as it did a year ago. It will be rather difficult, however, if Miss Patterson leaves the end of August and the school is open only one month and then closed for October and November. I think there is probably still time to communicate with Mr. Gordon at Norway House and get his opinion on the matter before Mrs. Chappell begins her work.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKJB.MT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-1, part 1)\nOttawa, July 21, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the holiday months for the Island Lake Indian Day School. I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Gordon for his recommendation in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, July 21, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe United Church authorities have asked the Department to decide concerning the holidays for the Island Lake Indian Day School. I am informed that the Indians take their families away during the fishing season in October and November and for the muskrat season in April and May. Lately, the holidays have been taken during October and November, but it has been suggested that it would be better, from the teacher's standpoint, if April and May were allowed. Please let me have your recommendation in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Island Lake Indian Day School.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of July 21st concerning the holiday months for the Island Lake Indian Day School, I now have a communication from Mrs. H. L. Chappell, the teacher who has been appointed to succeed Miss Patterson. Mrs. Chappell says that her understanding of the situation was that the summer school which Miss Patterson has been conducting for the last two years was an extra and by way of an experiment. She would not have applied for the school nor consented to take it if she had known that October and November were to be the holiday months. This was my understanding of the situation, also, a year ago.\n\nMrs. Chappell, as you know, is the wife of our missionary at Island Lake and is a very highly qualified teacher. The experience of the last year at Oxford House, where Mrs. Chappell taught in addition to her school and where the regular attendance has increased so largely, shows the wisdom of having teachers of this calibre stationed in the North country. Until Miss Patterson went to Island Lake we have never had a teacher there with Mrs. Chappell's qualifications and experience. She has to take holidays, of course, when her husband has his, - usually in June or July. I hope, therefore, that the Department will see its way clear to authorize that Mrs. Chappell's appointment date from September 1st, when Miss Patterson leaves. Personally, I cannot see that any other course is possible this year.\n\nIf Mr. Agent Gordon's report is favorable to the granting of holidays at Island Lake during October and November and the carrying on of teaching during July and August, we would be very glad to discuss this at the end of the next academic year, when the question of Mrs. Chappell's reappointment or the sending in of a new teacher will naturally arise.\n\nI trust that this matter will have immediate attention. Mail service to Island Lake is exceedingly slow and we have little enough time now.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 19, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, regarding the holiday period at the Island Lake United Church Indian Day School, also the date from which the services of Mrs. H. L. Chappell, who was recently appointed as teacher, will commence.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that payment of teachers' salaries is based on ten teaching months in the year. During the fiscal year 1931-32, payment was made to Miss Patterson for eleven months - the school being conducted continuously throughout the year, with the exception of the month of October, 1931. The Auditor General may take exception to one month's payment over the salary provided. We understand that the Indians take their families away during the fishing season - October and November - and also for the muskrat season in April and May. The Department recently requested the local Indian Agent at Norway House to forward a recommendation regarding the holiday period. If this school takes holidays in April and May, 1933, the Department would have no objection to Mrs. Chappell beginning duties on September 1st, next, and would allow her salary from that date. It would be impossible, however, to pay more than ten months' salary during the year. When we have a report from the local Indian Agent as to the period he recommends the annual holidays be taken, Mrs. Chappell will be advised.\n\nWe understand that Miss Patterson taught this school during the present summer holiday months - July and August. If Mrs. Chappell understands that payment can only be made for a total of ten teaching months in the school year, there would be no objection to her appointment, with salary to date from the 1st ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

The children are not all absent during October and November.\n\nFrom the standpoint of the teacher, however, I doubt if this arrangement would be satisfactory. The teacher could not easily have a vacation away from Island Lake during April and May. It might be possible to get out by airplane under the conditions as existing this year. In ordinary seasons it would be possible to come out by dog-team and reach Wabowden before the trails become impassable and return by the first boat to reach Island Lake about June 10th. This would scarcely be satisfactory to the present teacher, Mrs. Chappell, who is the wife of the missionary and who would naturally desire to take her vacation at the same time as her husband. It might be possible for the Missionary to take his vacation from April 1st and end up with the Manitoba Conference before returning to Island Lake.\n\nI have not had an opportunity to confer with Mr. and Mrs. Chappell on this matter but under present conditions throughout the country I have no doubt that a qualified teacher could easily be secured who would\nOttawa, September 12, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to official letter of the 19th ultimo, regarding the holiday period at the Island Lake United Church Indian Day School, I have to say that Mr. Agent Gordon states the best time for vacation would be during the months of April and May. The Department therefore considers that the school should be closed during these two months, and the Indian Agent is being instructed to so advise Mrs. H. L. Chappell.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The Department is advising the Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions. You should inform Mrs. Chappell.\n\nWhen you are forwarding the return for the June quarter, 1933, you should make a special note on it that the school was not in operation during the months of April and May.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

(RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-1, part 1)\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Island Lake Indian Day School.\n\nWith further reference to the appointment of Mrs. H. L. Chappell as teacher at the Indian Day School, Island Lake, Manitoba, may I say that so far as I know the contention in your letter of August 19th is based on a misapprehension of the whole situation.\n\nThe decision to establish a summer school at Island Lake was arrived at following a conference which I had with Mr. Russell Nervier after I had personally spent ten days on the ground in 1930. The keeping of the school open during July and August was in the nature of an experiment and was to be covered by a special grant of $200.00 for two successive summers. The pupils were to be children not enrolled in the regular day school during the ordinary academic year. It was felt that both at Gods' Lake and at Island Lake the experience of a summer school should be tried out for two years in order to determine whether or not it was possible in this way to make a real contribution to the life of these bush Indians. We have therefore from the beginning never considered that the keeping of the school open during July and August had any reference to the normal number of teaching months or teaching days for which the Department assumes responsibility for an Indian day school. The $200.00 for 1931 and 1932 was regarded as being in the nature of a grant. Whether this grant should be continued for 1933 or not is a matter on which for the present I have no very settled convictions. I have not yet received a copy of Miss Patterson's report for this summer, and I am also waiting to hear from Mr. Indian Agent Gordon as to his opinion of the whole matter after his recent visit to Island Lake for the payment of Treaty.\n\nI cannot agree to the interpretation in your letter of August 19th, that it is impossible for Mrs. Chappell to begin teaching the regular day school on the 1st September because there has been a special grant for carrying on a summer school during July and August and the auditors may object.\n\nI trust that this explanation may be satisfactory to you and that Miss Patterson's special cheque for her work during July and August, 1932, may come forward in due course as in the case of the grant for 1931.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MT\n\nIndian Affairs.

He holds a certificate from the Brandon Normal School and has excellent recommendations from the Principal. He was interviewed by Dr. J. A. Doyle of the Residential School at Brandon, who reported favorably. We checked up on his character references and found them very satisfactory.\n\nI have to apologize for the fact that we had to send Mr. Northcott in to Island Lake on three or four days' notice. When Mr. and Mrs. Chappell came out for their vacation it was expected that she would return to teach the school during June, after which they would move to Norway House. When on their way back to Winnipeg from the Maritimes, it was discovered that Mrs. Chappell had something the matter with her ear and the specialist strongly advised against her going in where there was no doctor. We had only four days in which to find a teacher and send him in with Mr. Chappell, and I felt that it was more important that the school should have a satisfactory supply than that we should live up to all the technicalities of the law.\n\nReports from our Superintendent in Winnipeg and others who met Mr. Northcott during the few hours he was there on his way to Island Lake are very favorable. He and Mr. Chappell went in from Norway House by plane, which today is considerably cheaper than the former method of travel by canoe. I trust that the Department will overlook this hasty appointment and confirm Mr. Northcott in his position.

Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am due to leave this morning by plane to assume teaching duties at the United Church Day School at Selkirk Lake. I would like to have the same arrangement as last year and have my salary cheque forwarded direct to the Royal Bank, Carlton & Portage Branch in Winnipeg.\n\nAs arranged I took the two month holiday in April and May and find the arrangement very satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-1, part 1)\nNorway House, Mani:\n16th January 1936.\n\nRef: 40-B\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that last summer at treaty time, both Father Maclean of the Roman Catholic Mission and Mr. Gavin H. Grieve of the United Church Mission on the Island Lake Reserve, spoke about what they regarded as the necessity of establishing another Indian Day School on that reserve, to accommodate approximately 30 Indian children, at Wasagamach, which is from seven to 12 miles from any school on the reserve, and consequently are getting nothing in the way of education. The matter was just talked about, without any definite action being taken.\n\nI have, since that time, received requests from both the R.C. Mission, and the United Church Mission, to take the matter up with the Department, with a view to having this school established. Father Maclean of the R.C. Mission enclosed with his letter a petition (in the Cree syllabics), signed by the Chief and Councillors of the Island Lake Band, requesting that the Department would establish this school. Mr. Gavin H. Grieve, the United Church Missionary, advises me that the parents of the children in question have assured him that they will co-operate with that church to the best of their ability, and that they urge our building school if one is established. Mr. Grieve also states that the United Church erected a building at Wasagamach last year, which would be very suitable for a day school.\n\nHow many of the thirty children, or their parents, are affiliated with each church, I do not know, but it is evident that both missionaries are concerned about the same thirty children. If a school were opened under the auspices of either church, the children affiliated with the other, would doubtless not attend. Would an un-denominational school, operated solely by the Department, answer the problem? The school, if established, would have to be a summer school, carrying only during the months of June, July, and August. Apart from an un-denominational school, the only alternatives would be to open two schools, one under the auspices of each church, or no school at all.\n\nI should be glad if you would advise me what the Department considers might be done in this matter, if anything.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lagomoye,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nOttawa, January 24, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, relative to the request of the church authorities - Roman Catholic and United Church - for the establishment of a school on the Island Lake reserve, for the Indian children at Wasagamach, as they reside at too great a distance from the schools at present in operation on the reserve.\n\nThe Department has no funds from which to cover the cost of fitting up classrooms or to pay the salary of a teacher. No provision has been made in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year for a school at the point mentioned above. It is noted that there are approximately 30 Indian children of school age. The Department could not consider the establishment of a school for each of the religious denominations interested. It is regretted that it will be impossible to make any provision for the education of the Indian children at Wasagamach, Island Lake Reserve, for some considerable time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

They cannot earn a living on the reserve in the winter time.\n\nThe Island Lake Indians are very primitive; far more so than the Indians outside on the prairies; and they seldom come in contact with white people, apart from the traders. Scholastic education is of far less importance to them than it is to the prairie Indian, and I am of the opinion that if these Indians receive sufficient schooling to enable them to speak fairly good English, and write fairly decently; and figure and know the value of money, they do not really require much else. Moreover; if the children are kept on the reserve by their parents during the winter months, instead of being taken out to the prairies to be set at trap, they are not going to be able to earn a living for themselves when they grow up past school age, and that is a matter of the utmost importance. Hunting, trapping, and fishing are the sole means of livelihood for these Indians, and the parents are the children's only teachers so far as these occupations are concerned.\n\nFrankly speaking; rather than try to increase the school attendance during the winter months, I would favour making both these schools 'seasonal' schools, and operate them for the four months from June to September inclusive only, leaving them closed for the balance of the year. The average attendance at these schools during the six months period September to March does not seem to justify the paying of two teachers $90.00 a month each for that period, and to increase the attendance would mean that a greater number of families would have to remain on the reserve during the winter instead of getting out to the prairies to earn their living, and that is not desirable, as the inevitable result would be that they would become dependent upon the Department instead of themselves for their living.\n\nThese two schools are now having their annual vacation; during the two months April and May; and I should be pleased to have your opinion on the foregoing.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No; 123-4-l of the 6th instant, having reference to the low average attendance during the December and March quarters, at the Island Lake United Church Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that I am unable to state the reason for the attendance becoming so low during these two quarters, from personal inspections of the school. This reserve, (as well as God's Lake and Oxford House), is never visited except at treaty time, owing to its isolation, distance, and travel difficulties and cost of getting there from Norway House. At treaty time of course the schools are not in session, and they are consequently never inspected.\n\nHowever, from reports that have come to me at various times, and from various sources, during the time I have been Agent here, it appears that the Indians who live near the neighbourhood of the United Church School, are practically all away from the reserve to their winter trapping camps about the 15th September, where they stay all winter, returning to the reserve about the following June. When they leave, they take their wives and children with them of course, and in consequence, the school attendance suffers. In the case of those Indians who live in proximity to the R.C.Mission, it is very adverse and is a very large measure. Far too many of them prefer to stay around the reserve, instead of getting away to the bush to hunt and trap as they should do, and earn their living. Several families do go of course, but the greater number stay and their children are available for school attendance, consequently the average attendance at the R.C.School does not fall so low as at the U.C.School during the winter months.\n\nIf I may be permitted to enlarge somewhat, I might also say that though the school attendance at the R.C.School, during these months is better than at the U.C.School, the very conditions that make it so, are undesirable as far as the education, proper health and general welfare of the Indians. Those Indians who spend the winter at their trapping and hunting camps in the bush, are infinitely better off in every way, than\n\nR.A.Hoey Esq;\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

On July 22nd Mr. Match wrote Dr. Cormie to say that Mr. Grafton had arrived at Island Lake and that he, himself, was moving on to Pekangecum. Dr. Cormie's understanding is that both appointments are effective August 1st, and apparently the men concerned have acted on the same understanding.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBGG\nBJ\nSept. 9, 1937\n\nMr. R. A. Hooey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hooey,\n\nSome time ago you will remember, Mr. Bernard Grafton was appointed as teacher at Island Lake. The question now arises about his transportation from Norway House to Island Lake. In a communication which has reached this office, it is stated that some time ago Mr. Grafton was a teacher at Black River, I presume under your Department, and that at that time his expenses from Norway House to Black River were paid. If that is the case, would it not be reasonable to expect his expenses from Norway House to Island Lake to be paid? We have of course no record of his appointment at Black River, as that is under your Department, but it would seem to me that if it is the policy of the Department to pay the travelling expenses of a teacher whom they appoint, they might do the same with other teachers whom they appoint on the nomination of the Church. After all, all that we do is try to help you to get good teachers, and you pay the same salary whether they are nominated by the Church or whether you have the difficulty of getting them. I should be glad to know what you think of this.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD/EB\nOttawa, September 10, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant and to state, by way of comment, that no provision has been made in the Estimates of this year for the payment of transportation costs of Indian day school teachers.\n\nThe officials here inform me that no provision has ever been made for costs of this kind at any time in the history of the Department. There is nothing on file here to indicate that the Department paid Mr. Grafton's expenses from Norway House to Black River.\n\nI may state, however, if the Indian Agent or any other employee of the Government is making a trip, by boat or by car, it has been the practice to assist the teacher in moving from one school to another.\n\nI regret, therefore, in view of present regulations, that it will not be possible to pay Mr. Grafton's moving expenses to Island Lake.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Please let me know as soon as possible if this is the case. You should also let me know the exact date on which he resumes duties. If he resumes duties on the first of June, no cheque will be issued to him at the end of that month, as he has already been paid for April, during which month he was not supposed to have taught the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nP.

R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Bldg.,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI just received a letter from a young constituent of mine, Ben Grafton, with regard to the new proposed Day School at Island Lake. He states that what is required is a residential school. There are 280 children of school age, most of them who are in the bush for part of the year and he says that the only way to give them an education would be to keep them in residence at the mission.\n\nI do not know the position but I assume that all these matters have been duly considered but perhaps you will let me know just what is being done and if there is any merit in the suggestion made by Mr. Grafton, you will, of course, consider it.\n\nKind regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames Allison Glen, M.P.\n\nJAG/CI\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-1, part 2)\nOttawa, May 9, 1939.\n\nRe - Island Lake Indian School\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th instant, in which you intimate that in a letter received from Mr. Ben. Grafton the suggestion is made that a residential school should be established at Island Lake, Manitoba.\n\nThere is at this date an Indian day school in operation at Island Lake, with Mr. Grafton in charge as teacher. In addition to this, provision is made in the estimates of this year for the erection of an additional room to the school already established or for the construction of a new school. However, I have experienced the utmost difficulty in securing from Mr. Grafton the information that must be supplied to the Surveys and Engineering Branch before construction of the school can be undertaken. Mr. Grafton, influenced perhaps by the local missionary, Mr. Grieve, appears reluctant to supply us with the necessary information.\n\nIf you have the time at your disposal, I wish you would drop in at my office and look over the file. I have already intimated to Dr. Dorey, of the United Church, that unless Mr. Grafton, an employee of the Department, is prepared to forward this information, we will be compelled to ask for his resignation at the end of the present school year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Allison Glen, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOf course this was not the case. Mr. Grafton and myself are only interested in trying to get adequate schools for our people. I have had an architect draw plans for the set up which we think would be a great advance over the present residential type of school. And it will be necessary for any type of residence to be provided for the Island Lake children if they are to get a school for more than a few weeks each year. The people have one way to make a living and that is off the country and have to go far afield in the winter to the trapping grounds so the children cannot attend any school except for a very few. Our present day school is all that is necessary if only day schools are contemplated as summer schools are not worth bothering with.\n\nI cannot understand why something definite was not submitted for your perusal by our H. M. Board. We were actually expecting to get started on the job last January, had timber cruised a small amount for and an agreement had been made for a list of materials to the last nail. We were ready to go ahead and thought that by next September we would have at least 100 of our children in school. Until your letter arrived this week I was totally ignorant about the fact that nothing whatever had been proposed by the H. M. Board. I can hardly credit it yet.\n\nOf course I put the blame on Mr. Hoey and thought he was giving us the run around. This was natural in the circumstances as it is generally thought by all Protestant workers in this area that Mr. Hoey will do what he can to assist the R. C. Church at the expense of the Protestant denominations. Whether that surmise is correct or not I do not know but certainly in the case of the Island Lake discussion it was unfair to Mr. Hoey.\n\nIf any construction is proposed at this point that would make a start in getting our children to school this Mission is as able to handle the work as any other denomination. Of course I am in full going on with the idea of regular day schools so far as I am concerned not that I should have nothing to do with it but would actively work against such a development. If you were in possession of the facts you would agree with this stand.\n\nThanking you again for your patience and consideration and hoping that this explanation will some way make plain to you what must have been incomprehensible in my former letters,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.) Gavin H. Grieve.\nIsland Lake, Manitoba,\nJune 22nd, 1932.\n\nHonourable T. A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of April 28th which got in here this week. For the time you took from your many duties and the information so clearly set out therein.\n\nI think that an explanation is due both you and Mr. Hoey for what must have looked like an unwarrantable outbreak on my part and also a lack of diligence and co-operation on the part of Mr. Grafton. I will try to set out the circumstances in order of occurrence and you will readily see that both Mr. Grafton and myself were misled about proposed developments in respect to schools for our people.\n\nFor the past five years we have pleaded with our Home Mission Board through the officials with whom we work for something to be done about schools for our people. Last summer on the visit of Dr. John A. Cormie, our superintendent, we went into the whole picture, giving every conceivable detail in connection with the need and the desire for an improvement plan to come with it. This all in writing. We were given to understand that this plan was to be submitted to you and were assured that we would be given the result of the conference with you as to what would be done. Our Indians were assured that this would be presented to your Department in as strong a manner as possible. At different times we have received letters in reply from the Superintendent, Dr. Cormie, that he had not had word yet, the last coming at the time of Mr. Hoey's letter to Mr. Grafton. From your letter it is clear that nothing whatever in the shape of a plan was submitted by anybody in our Church except a few snap shots. Mr. Grafton at once replied to Mr. Hoey's letter which in the face of our assurance that the same had worked out and been submitted, was quite an adequate reply to the letter but in reality with nothing whatever submitted by the Home Mission Board was of course unsatisfactory. Due to our poor mail service it was not for weeks that Mr. Grafton's letter got to Mr. Hoey and in the meantime Mr. Hoey had suggested that Mr. Grafton be asked to resign and Mr. Hoey wrote a letter to the House of Parliament that it was likely due to his influence that Mr. Grafton had evaded giving the information asked for.\n\nOf course-\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 29, 1939.\n\nI am enclosing a letter (June 22) received by the Minister from the Reverend Gavin H.

Now, I have a letter before me from Dr. Comrie, our Superintendent of Missions in Manitoba, in reference to the Island Lake School. He has passed on to us the name of a young man whom he has recommended as teacher of this school. The Island Lake School, as you know, begins in June and has continued for ten months, with a salary of $1000.00 a year. Now you know that the expenses in the North, and to and from the North, are higher than in other places. What I want to know is, does your Department intend to have the new regulation affect such a place as Island Lake? Can we not expect a salary of $1000.00 for this school, even though the period of teaching may be only nine months?\n\nIf the salary is to be reduced by $100 for such a school as Island Lake, we may find considerable difficulty in getting qualified teachers to go in at all. If there is to be this reduction in Island Lake, we must let the young man whom we propose to nominate know, so that there will be no misunderstanding about the matter. I hope that the new rule will not apply to this school.\n\nOf course, what I have to say about Island Lake School applies to such schools as Garford House, Nelson House, Cross Lake, Little Grand Rapids, Berens River, and any others in this class.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you at the earliest possible moment in regard to this matter.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Director in that circular letter intimated that all schools, for the time being at least, would operate from October 1 to June 30 rather than from September 1 to June 30, as at present.\n\nOur instructions are that this regulation applies to all schools throughout the Dominion. We have been assured by the Government that it is simply impossible in this crisis to secure the funds necessary to maintain our regular services on the same scale on which they have been maintained until now. I can only express the hope, therefore, that the conditions of the moment will pass quickly. In the case of the Island Lake school, it should be opened this year on July first and continue for a nine month period.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

I ask the opportunity to put my grievances before the headquarters of the Indian Department for my band of Indians and their rights. My Council has given me their authority to present any grievance that we have for our band.\n\nMy people have no education. We have about three hundred children at present fit for school but no school to take them in. We have two small schools, one on each side of the lake, Roman Catholic and Protestant, but these are too small for the present population of school-age children. We would very much appreciate a boarding school instead of the day schools, and the children from our neighbouring reserves, God's Lake and Oxford House, could also attend. All the Indians from these Reserves could benefit by a boarding school, as well as by a hospital.\n\nI very much appreciate this opportunity to lay our grievances before the Department and will be very thankful if the Department can give consideration to our requests.\nNorway House, Man.\nOctober 30, 1943.\n\nA.G.

The Chief's estimate of the number of children of school age in the band is approximately correct. The problem of education is similar on all the reserves of this Agency to a greater or less extent.

Brandt,\nR.R.No.3,\nBox 37,\nWinkler, Man.\n\n/B\nI wish to submit the following report on the schools of the Norway House Agency, inspected in June, 1945.\n\nIsland Lake U.C. Indian Day School\n\nThe teacher, Miss E. Loewen, had left before I arrived. The roll showed 42 - three in grade 2 and the balance in grade 1.\n\nThis is a log school. Some repair is needed to the roof and the floor needs painting. The material is on hand, I understand, and the work will be carried out during the summer.\n\nIf we had a school residence I would recommend that a married couple be engaged and that they do social and welfare work, as well as teach. They should be hired by the year with, say, a month's holidays. They could then supervise a good garden and help in the organization of social groups. The woman could instruct and help the Indian women in the sewing clubs and social organizations. A married couple interested in the work would be a great help to the Agent and could do very excellent work. There are about 160 United Church children of school age. If these are to be accommodated in day schools we would need three more schools. These Indians are trappers and I doubt if day schools can even be considered as an answer to the great need. The parents cannot remain on the reserve in the winter and trap, and the children cannot be away with their parents and attend a day school; consequently there appears only one solution and that is more boarding schools.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, August 28, 1945.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nI desire to refer to my letter of June 27, with reference to the teaching services at the Island Lake United Church School. Please let me know as soon as possible if Mr. Rempel returned the school on September 1. If so, the necessary forms should be completed and returned immediately, as payment of salary cannot be made until these forms are received.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 10th September, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Island Lake U.C.

However, if you feel that there will be enough children to justify keeping the school in operation, it may remain open for the months of April, May and June. The summer holidays can then be taken during the months of July and August and the school should re-open on September 1st, 1946, and operate for the full ten-month period.\n\nYou should ascertain from the present teacher if he intends to remain in charge of the school through the next academic and if so you should advise him of the change of the opening and closing dates. If he intends to give up duties you should let me know so the new teacher may be informed that in future the school will operate on the normal school year of September 1st to the subsequent June 30th.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIsland Lake, Man.,\nFebruary 23, 1946\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Man.,\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI am the teacher for the school at Island Lake, which has the name of The United Church Indian Day School Garden Hill, Island Lake, Man. and my term is over at the end of March.

Day School at Garden Hill, Island Lake; 28 pupils present. Mr. Rempel, the teacher is not a qualified teacher and gave me the impression that he didn't quite know what it was all about. I gave him what advice and help I could. The school building is of log construction with a low ceiling and no ventilation. It is 17' x 27' and there is no porch. There are enough children in this settlement to fill 3 day schools. There are no Teacherages for any of the schools in this Agency. The children, wherever I went were well-fed and well-clothed. I gave a half holiday in order that I could use the building for a Band Meeting. The meeting assured me that the people were doing their best to see that the Family Allowance money was spent in accordance with the regulations laid down. Here again we discussed the 5 year building and improvement plan, and general satisfaction was registered. They asked about their Saw Mill and I assured them that our engineer Mr. Stevenson would install it for them as early as possible in the spring. I am doubtful of the success of this venture unless an experienced man is placed in charge. I have already recommended that such an appointment be made by the Dept., i.e. a married couple, the man to act as overseer and his wife as Field Matron. I advised the Indians to start getting their logs ready.\n\nA request was made by the meeting for a grant of $40.00 to repair a foot bridge and its approaches to enable children to attend school.\n\nIn the afternoon I visited several homes in company with Dr. Corrigan and Father Dutil.

Next winter we will have three qualified teachers from an Order of teaching Sisters. We have just completed arrangements for taking over a trader's store at Island Lake which can be converted for use as an additional classroom.\n\n(2) Garden Hill\nHere we have operated a one-room United Church Day School. We have had a teacher there for some years now but were unable to get one for the last academic year (1947-48). However, we are now building a new school with attached teacherage at Island Lake and we feel that we will be in a position to interest a teacher in view of the better accommodation being offered.\n\nHowever, we would point out that it is becoming increasingly difficult to interest teachers in going to isolated Indian reserves, particularly where there are no facilities for entertainment and social contacts.\n\nBernard F.

Best D.D.,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n441 Somerset Building, Winnipeg.\n\nDear Dr Best:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 9th 1948 and your inquiry regarding the situation at Island Lake in connection with the U.C. Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department is building a combined Day School & Teacherage at Island Lake but this building will not be complete until approximately 15 November, and at this time it would be impossible to transport a Teacher to Island Lake with the result that school would not open at Island Lake until 1st January 1948.\n\nThe old Island Lake U.C. Indian Day School which is located on the Treaty Grounds at Garden Hill is in good condition and at the present time is fully equipped. With the object of opening the old school until such time as the new School & Teacherage is complete, I telegraphed Mr Austin Hodgkinson at Island Lake this past week asking if he were in a position to board & lodge a teacher until 15th November and below give reply which was received this morning:\n\nRETEL WILL BE IN POSITION TO BOARD AND LODGE TEACHER\nSTOP AUSTIN NOT HOME BUT BELIEVE SATISFACTORY RATE CAN\nBE ARRANGED - SIGNED MRS HODGKINSON\n\nI should state that Austin Hodgkinson is quite close to the old Day School and is the only one at Island Lake in a position to supply board & lodging.\nIf Miss Clinton accepts position as teacher to commence duties 1st September in the Old School, she would have sufficient time after she arrives at Island Lake to make her own arrangements concerning provisions for the balance of the term. She could either have her supplies flown in before freeze-up or they could come in by tractor freight in the month of January.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nQ.P. Jackson,\nAgency Clerk.\nMr E.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agency, Norway House, Manitoba\n\nDear Mr Goodman:\n\nI am sorry to know that you have not been well. I hope that you will have a speedy and complete recovery.\n\nI am anxious to know the situation regarding the school at Island Lake. My information is that a new school including teacher's living quarters, is being built. Can you tell me when it will be ready and when it will be furnished? Miss Joyce Clinton of St. James, Man., is making an application for this school. She is 20 years old, has Grade XI standing but no professional training. She has taught in the Anglican Residential School at Sioux Lookout. I have had an interview with her and believe that she would prove satisfactory. Of course, I would very much prefer to nominate a fully qualified teacher and until two weeks ago had one in view, but she has withdrawn her application. It is still very difficult to find qualified teachers for Indian Schools and I am told that many schools throughout the province will have to employ permit teachers again this year.\n\nIn the event of the new school and living quarters not being ready for the 1st of September could the term begin in the old school? And have you any suggestion as to where Miss Clinton could live in the meantime? Will it be necessary for the teacher to take in her own provisions for the year and if so how should they be shipped?\n\nI will hold Miss Clinton's application until I hear from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) C.H.

I have been able to communicate with him and he tells me that he is not able to recommend Miss Joyce Clinton for the Island Lake Indian Day School. He wrote Miss Clinton in July telling her that he could not nominate her for this position. The main reason for this decision was that after Miss Clinton had made the application her mother came into the office and advised us that her daughter had had a nervous breakdown and was under the doctor's care still so could not be sent where medical help was not available. Island Lake is fairly isolated and it did not seem right to send a young girl there unless she was in the best of health.

Day School.\n\n(2) The appointment of Miss Laura Butler, 9108 Dufferin St., Toronto, to replace Mr. Mitchell at the Norway House School.\n\nThey stated that Miss Butler has senior matriculation but is not a fully qualified teacher. However, if she were to reach Winnipeg in time to catch the last boat for Norway House, it would be necessary for her to leave Toronto on the 28th instant. An immediate decision had to be made and I notified them that the above appointments would be later confirmed. Mr. MacDonald promised to forward us an application from Miss Butler on one of our regular forms.\n\nP.

As the votes out of which payments could have been made have lapsed for such a length of time, the Department would like to know what explanation is to be offered in case the Auditor-General should enquire as to the delay in making these returns. Cheques will not be sent to Dr. Sutherland until your reply is received.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-3, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo re the return of the Island Lake School, and beg to say that communications between here and Island Lake are of the most precarious nature and it takes many months to get in touch with these regions. This is about the only excuse I can give for the late arrival of the returns. Revd. John McDougall was advised that the grant would be available as early as the 16th of June 1902 and the school work could hardly start before October of that year. The returns, so far as I know, have been made bona fide and the attendance is better than at most of the Day Schools. I hope this will satisfy the Auditor General. I will write to the Teacher to send his returns in future, if possible, at the end of every quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept.

The number of School days in Quarter are counted only from August 1st, as the school was opened on that date.\n\nThough the average was small, it was fair for a beginning, since there has been no school for some years. Whether the school will be a success for some time remains to be seen. The people are divided into three groups and in each almost the whole population goes trapping. The locations of the groups are also quite a distance apart. There has been considerable discussion among the groups as to the possibility of a permanent location for the whole number together, but as yet no conclusion has been arrived at.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

This was true of the families near the Mission, where the school was located. The teacher, Miss Sturdy moved over to another Village, where a building was placed at her disposal, repairs and alterations being made by the Indians, so that she was fairly comfortable, and where the Report shows she had 12 pupils, who attended the balance of the term very regularly. Miss Sturdy is an excellent teacher with a professional certificate, and I am sure the children who attend are getting a good grounding.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

This return shows that the school was only open for ten days during the September quarter and, in a note appearing on the return, the teacher states that the school did not open until September 15th, as she was unable to be on hand until that date.\n\nUnder the above circumstances, it would appear that only one-half month's salary should be allowed. Before making payment, I would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Kenneth J.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your favour of the first instant concerning the School Returns for the Island Lake Indian Day School in connection with which the Department is paying only one half month's salary for the September quarter.\n\nThe circumstances connected with Miss Frances Patterson's appointment to the Island Lake School are these: Mr. James Hart and his wife were appointed as missionaries, and Miss Patterson expected to have gone in with them. Mr. Hart's plans were suddenly changed as his wife had a stroke. Miss Patterson felt that it was her duty to proceed both in the interests of the Government and of the Church, but as she had planned to live with Mr. and Mrs. Hart she was now obliged to purchase an outfit of household necessities for her own use and to send to Winnipeg for it so as to take it along with her. She was at Norway House at the time. The delay thus occasioned prevented her from reaching Island Lake until the middle of September. It was no fault of hers or ours that she was not there to open the School at the beginning of the month. I feel quite sure she did her utmost to reach there in time.\n\nUnder the circumstances if the Department felt like paying the salary for the full month of September, we shall feel obliged as our arrangement with her calls for payment of her salary from September 1st.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-3, part 1)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have forwarded returns for United Church Day School at Island Lake to Mr. Gordon and hope they will catch mail boat out on July 5th.\n\nI am opening an account at the Royal Bank, Carlton and Portage Branch, Winnipeg, Man., and would like cheques for my salary deposited there.\n\nWe are about 150 miles from Norway House, the nearest Post Office and our mail reaches us though various sources from there, often with considerable loss of time.\n\nI am anxious to send some money home and would appreciate having the cheque forwarded at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\nClive Northcott\nOttawa, July 10, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, I beg to say that, before the Department was aware that you had taken charge of the Island Lake United Church Indian Day School, the salary cheque for the teacher for the month of June had been forwarded to Mrs. Chappell. It will, therefore, be necessary for her to reimburse you for the period you taught the school during the month of June, and the Rev. Kenneth J. Beaton, Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church, is being so advised.\n\nIt is noted that you wish your cheque forwarded to the Royal Bank of Canada, Carlton and Portage Branch, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nClive Northcott, Esq.,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nIsland Lake, Via Norway House,\nMan.\nOttawa, July 10, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Mr. Olive Northcott, teacher of the Island Lake United Church Indian Day School, with reference to the amount due him during the month of June. I enclose a copy of our reply to him.\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible if this school will be open during the months of July and August. If so, you should state when the regular two months' holidays will be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter No. 123-4-3 of July 10, in which you ask me to state whether Island Lake United Church Day School would be open during the months of July and August, I would say that it was.\n\nAs to the regular two months holidays, I cannot say when these will be taken, as they will probably cover some time in November when the Indians are out fishing and possibly again in the spring after the rut season. It may also be that very few of the children will be in attendance at this school during the winter months, as practically all of the people from this point go trapping during the winter season.\n\nWe may find, if enough men are engaged for the winter at the Island Lake Mines, that it may be advisable to transfer the school to the Mines for a few months if suitable accommodations can be secured for a class room. This, however, is a matter which will have to be dealt with later as conditions arise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nKAG\n123-4-3 Island Lake, Man.\nSept. 18, 1934.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 123-4-3, July 10, I wish to say that eventually I received payment of salary for month of June.\n\nI taught during July and August as well and, to my knowledge, there has been no further deposits to my account.\n\nIf this matter has not already been attended to I am sure you will settle it satisfactorily.\n\nYours truly,\nOliver Northcott.\nOttawa, October 15, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of July 10th addressed to the former Agent, Mr. Wm. Gordon, and his reply of September 6th, in connection with the Island Lake U. C. Indian Day School.\n\nAs the matter now stands, the teacher has been paid for the month of September, but in letter just received he advises that he kept the school open during July and August, presumably due to the reason that the children were living in the vicinity of the school at that time. Before a cheque can be issued in payment of his services for July and August, it will be necessary for the Department to know the two months during which the holidays will be taken.\n\nAs you are aware, salaries of teachers of Indian day schools are paid on a basis of ten months in the school year, and, consequently, between July 1, 1934, and June 30, 1935, the Department can only allow salary for ten teaching months. Please let me know as soon as possible the two months which you consider the school should be closed during the period just mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nRef: 16-A\n\nNorway House, Man.\n6th December 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt on the 4th December, of Departmental letter No; 123-4-3 dated 15th October 1934, having reference to the time for holidays at the Island Lake U.C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that after making a number of enquiries, it would appear that the most appropriate time for the pupils of this school to take their two months holidays would be the months of April and May each year, as at that time, the Indians are out trapping muskrats and usually wish to take their families to their camps. It is also the time of year when the spring break-up begins, making travel more or less difficult.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the teacher be paid salary in full to date, and that salary be deducted for next April and May when the school should be closed.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nOttawa, January 7th, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to your 16-A of the 6th instant, I beg to say that, when issuing Mr. Northcott's cheque for the month of January, we will include payment for the months of July and August, during which months, it is noted, the school was open.\n\nThe Department approves of the annual two months' holidays being taken during the months of April and May, 1935. You should so inform Mr. Northcott at once and no salary will be allowed for these two months as the Department can only pay ten months' salary in any one academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nJanuary 14th, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\n\nRe:- School No. 516 -\nIsland Lake United Church School.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. Clive Northcott, as teacher of the Island Lake U. C. Indian Day School was approved by the Honourable the Superintendent General in memorandum dated June 19th, 1934, on File 123-4-1.\n\nMr. Northcott's name was not placed on the paylist until the month of September. It now appears that he began duties on July 1st and taught for both the months of July and August, as well as the month of September. It is intended to take the annual two months' holidays during the months of April and May, next.\n\nThis school is rather isolated and, although the Department wrote about the matter last October, a reply has only recently been received.\n\nOn the January paylist, therefore, payment is being requested for Mr. Northcott for the months of July and August, 1934, and January, 1935, as follows:-\n\n516 - Island Lake U.

C. - C. Northcott - Royal Bank, Carlton & Portage Branch, Winnipeg, Man. - $1000 -$100\nOttawa, August 29th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nIn accordance with your letter of December 6th, 1934, and official reply of January 7th, 1935, no payment was made to Mr. Northcott, teacher of the Island Lake United Church Indian Day School for the months of April and May, 1935.\n\nPlease let me know, as soon as possible, if Mr. Northcott kept this school open during the months of July and August this year. If so, payment for these months will be made to him when paying his September salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nP. G.

Mr. Mutch began duties at this school on June 11th, 1936, but, as yet, no salary has been paid him for the period he has taught the school since that date.\n\nIn view of the above, arrangements should be made to pay Mr. Mutch on the August paylist, as follows: 20/30 of June salary ($66.66); plus salary for July ($100) and salary for August ($100) or a total of $266.66.

(RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nMiss Cunningham, the school teacher at Island Lake who has opened up a new day school at Island Lake last fall, is requesting that she be allowed to purchase from the H.B. Company's store at Island Lake some necessary articles for the school. As this school has only been in operation since November, and as no information had been supplied by the Methodist Mission to this office last summer that a day school would be opened at Island Lake Xkim last year, it is therefore in need of a good many things necessary to a school. I am sending a small list of the articles required for the present.\n\nI had a letter from Miss Cunningham the school teacher in regard to the housing and feeding of 5 or 6 pupils, who are children of widows living around the Mission, this seems to me a very laudable effort on the part of Miss Cunningham to undertake this extra work, and I think that if Miss Cunningham really intends to remain for a long time at Island Lake, why not let her school be a sort of semi boarding school, then the Department would I think grant her a certain amount of provisions and clothing for these pupils next year.\n\nMiss Cunningham mentions that she could take care of 5 or 6 pupils in this way or if assisted by the Department possibly a few more. She also states that as some of the children who live quite a distance from the school, that she would like to give them a warm meal at dinner time and that this would encourage those who live at a distance to come to the school. I respectfully submit this for your careful consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 1)\nOttawa, February 2, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant enclosing a list of supplies required for the Island Lake School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may authorize the teacher, Miss Cunningham, to purchase the articles included in this list from the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nThe Department approves of a mid-day meal being given at this school and you should furnish the teacher with a limited quantity of supplies for this purpose.\n\nYou will be further advised in reference to Miss Cunningham's offer to board some of the children attending this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I also note that the Department approves of a mid-day meal for the children, instead of having them enrolled as regular boarders.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn letter No. 22847/5, dated Feb. 2nd, I feel that it is a step in the right direction in allowing day schools such as Island Lake a mid-day meal for the children. On my visits to some reserves this winter, this same appeal was made by the Revd Mr Gaudin for the Cross Lake day school and also by the Revd Mr Nutty at Nelson House, whose reserve is also under the Revd Mr Gaudin's supervision.\n\nWould the Department be kind enough to authorize the purchase of plates, cups, saucers, dessert spoons, towels, etc., for dish cloths, large dish pans, cooking pots, table salt, and oil etc., for the use of day schools on any reserve in this Agency that would require this additional help to their day schools.\n\nI would recommend that this be done so as to enable children coming from a distance to attend school more regularly. Many of the children who went some to school now on account of the distance and the small allowance of biscuits for their mid-day meal, would probably feel more like attending the school, knowing that they would be assured of a good hot meal in the middle of the day and they would feel contented and happy, and more eager to learn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIsland Lake and Inland Missions\n\nSEP 10 1915\n\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nWill you please allow me to call your attention to the fact that a teacher for the day school at this point is on the ground, but on account of the migratory habits of these Indians, it is almost impossible to keep up an average. The Indians have a number of homes at what is called the Big Village, about 15 miles from here, and would willingly send their children to the Day School if there were some way of doing it there. They are quite generally disposed toward the education of their children, as can be seen by the readiness to obey Mr. Agostino's instructions regarding School work, all of which was promptly and faithfully done.\n\nMy object in writing you this letter must be well appreciated. In the same manner as the Indian Dept. would be willing to supply said 12 days of Board, 100 lbs. tea, 100 lbs. sugar, 20 lbs. tobacco, etc., and 100 lbs. flour, I am prepared to get some charity of clothing from the Women's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church, and request an old school house near to be used for the children, and such items as the success of this school may be willing to supply a bed and tableware to assist them in making up a goodly started average. If successful we would be more than pleased to still have the Indian women do the advance work of earliest opportunity of this matter.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In mild weather, the church could be used, but to keep this warm in severe weather would be almost impossible. There was an old house just behind the school, of which the walls and a pole roof only remained. This was the property of an Indian of Oxford House. I told the Missionary that if it could be secured, I thought it likely that the Department would meet a small expense in making it fit for use for the purpose of the school. Mr. Chapin secured the house, and Mr. Gordon, as above, secured the slate, or used some he had on hand, and other material from his own supply, has put these in at cost, and he and the teacher have done considerable work free of charge. The school children also assisted, in gathering moss, etc., for the walls, as described to us by the teacher, the building is now fairly comfortable for the purpose intended. The attendance at this school up to October, warrants the expenditure. Later, if the building should not be required as a classroom, it can be utilized as a store room, for which purpose I understand the amount of $50. was allowed in the Estimates of 1925-26.\n\n[Signature]\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNo. 659.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The classes are held in a new house belonging to one of the Indians. Owing to the largely increasing average attendance, I arranged for an additional supply of biscuits, which are greatly appreciated by the children.

Chapin, now of Norway House, for goods supplied at Island Lake to Indians in payment for labor in the building of the United Church Day School at that point.\n\nMr. Chapin, as missionary at Island Lake, had a large supply of food stuffs on hand which he was using for payment in the building of a church and mission house. The Indians were paid at the rate of $3.00 per day on the school work, and the goods supplied at as nearly cost as can be computed. In this way the laborers received from 20 to 25% more for their work than if paid with orders on the stores, and considerably more than if paid with cash, as the cash would be taken up at Island Lake at higher prices for the goods.\n\nThe getting of the logs, peeling same, and getting them on the site, was considerable work. Sand and stone also had to be brought in canoes, and then carried a couple of hundred yards from the shore. Joists, both for floor and ceiling, had to be hewn, also rafters, planks, and all division stuff for the school, and lumber also had to be shipped. The grounds were covered with a heavy growth of small poplar and spruce, which had to be cleared away for a playground, and to afford some protection from fire. Moss for chinking had to be gathered and dried.\n\nI have not seen the building since finished, but I saw it at Treaty time when the walls were up. It is certainly a fine building as all logs, and other material is of the best, and the whole building, from stone foundation, and stone chimney, walls, windows, roof, interior lining with lath, etc., and with double floor, the finishing one of maple, was well done. It should make a satisfactory building for many years. Mr. Chapin gave a great deal of time to the oversight of the work.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nIndian Affairs.\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDecember 28th,\n1931.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nWhen Miss Frances Patterson agreed to teach the school at Island Lake during the summer months, I told her that, if it were possible, I thought the school should be screened. My personal experience at Island Lake in July, 1930, led me to doubt the possibility of carrying on any kind of teaching in a room which was not screened from mosquitoes. I had seen clouds of mosquitoes in China, but the Chinese variety are small and very gentle compared with the ones that they breed in the lakes and marshes of Northern Manitoba. The screening was already on the ground, and Miss Patterson proceeded to have the work done at a cost of $24.98. When she sent the bill for this to Mr. Wm. Gordon, the Agent at Norway House, he returned it, stating that she had exceeded her authority in proceeding with this work without his consent. Now, Mr. Gordon's attitude is perfectly right and I am not complaining about it. I was under the impression that I had discussed this with him during the week that I was at Norway House in July, but it is quite evident that I forgot to mention it to him at all.\n\nI am writing to ask if the Department considers this $24.98 a legitimate charge on their miscellaneous budget. If so, I should be glad to receive a cheque for the amount. If it were not for the fact that Island Lake and Norway House are so isolated and mail service so irregular, I should write to Mr. Gordon and make all the necessary explanations. Under the circumstances, however, I feel that a direct approach to you is justified.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, December 30, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th instant regarding the payment of an account to the amount of $24.95 covering the cost of window screens purchased by Miss Frances Patterson, teacher of the United Church Indian Day School at Island Lake. It is noted that Miss Patterson submitted this account to Mr. Agent Gordon, Norway House, but that he returned same to her on the grounds that the necessary authority had not been obtained by her before making the purchase.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that if Miss Patterson has the receipted account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the screening material, and will forward same, the Department will favourably consider reimbursing her for the outlay incurred by her. It is necessary, in order to meet the requirements of the Auditor General, that the account be forwarded in duplicate. If Miss Patterson paid the merchant from whom she obtained the material, the account should be receipted and she should endorse thereon that the material was received and the price charged fair and just. A cheque in payment could then be forwarded direct to Miss Patterson, or, if desired, to your Church treasurer. I regret being unable to forward a cheque until the account, completed as stated above, is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. K. J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nJanuary 7th,\n1932.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI regret that my previous letter concerning Miss Patterson's account of $24.98 was not sufficiently explicit.\n\nThe screening which was used was quite evidently sent in with the materials for the building of the school. Miss Patterson made no outlay on this account whatever. Her expenditure was entirely for labor. It undoubtedly involved, as you will realize, the sawing of the logs into the proper lengths, - perhaps even the cutting down of the trees from which the window-frames were made. The bill is for labor only. If you desire Miss Patterson to obtain receipts from the Indians who did the work, covering the amounts expended, these can, I think, easily be secured. There is not any special hurry about paying this account, and I would simply write to her, saying that the requirements of the Auditor General demand this type of voucher. When the account is finally settled, it will be better to pay the amount to our Board and we will deposit it to her credit in the bank at Winnipeg where she has her account.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, January 12, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, in further reference to an account to the amount of $24.98 incurred by Miss Frances Patterson, teacher of the United Church Indian Day School at Island Lake, in payment of Indians for labour.\n\nIn this connection I would request that you have Miss Patterson obtain receipts, in duplicate, from the Indians for the amounts paid by her and forward same either direct to the Department or through your office. These receipts are required by the Auditor General before reimbursement can be made to Miss Patterson. When these are received, a cheque in payment will be sent your Board for deposit to Miss Patterson's credit in the Bank where she has her account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Last year a small grant was made for the services of a teacher who was sent in to give instruction for a short period during the summer. You state that the Government R.C. School operated for a season before the Indian agent was informed of the fact. This statement is no doubt true but if the school were operated without the knowledge of the agent, it was conducted without cost to this Department. If the United Church, the Catholic Church or any other religious denomination are prepared to erect schools and provide teachers for the education of the Indians without cost to the Department, such action in my judgment should call forth commendation rather than criticism.\n\nI have discussed the subject matter of your letter with the Reverend Dr. George Dorey, who visited the Department a few days ago. I suggested to him that Missionaries who had been critics of the educational policy followed by the Department should send forward their criticisms to the Home Mission Board at Toronto, the members of which Board could in turn bring the matter to the attention of the Government. The officials of the Department are not primarily interested in missionary effort, nor are they responsible for educational policy. This policy is carefully reviewed and modified from time to time by the Ministry in charge of the Department. I think the officials have the right to expect, however, a prompt answer to the letters that we are compelled to send out from time to time to the teachers in charge of Indian day schools whose employment has been authorized and recognized by the Department. In the case of the school at Island Lake, it will not be possible for us to proceed with the construction until the information requested by the Surveys and Engineering Branch has been supplied by the school teacher and by the Indian agent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 28, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 13th instant, in which you express surprise at the request sent forward by the Department to the teacher of the Indian Day School at Island Lake with respect to additional school accommodation that may be needed on the reserve.\n\nI may state by way of explanation that when this Department was reorganized in December 1926, the construction of Indian day and residential schools, which had until that date been undertaken by the Department of Indian Affairs, was transferred to the Surveyors and Engineering Branch of the Department. The officials of this Branch, who have no access to our files, request the fullest possible information with respect to the construction of any school that may be referred to them from time to time. The regular forms upon which this information is usually supplied are sent out to Indian agents who, in turn, secure all the details through the teachers employed on the reserves. The letter dated February 2, 1939, sent to Mr. Grafton, was the usual letter sent out to teachers in charge of schools on reserves where additional accommodation is required.\n\nA careful record is kept of all letters reaching this Department. I have had a diligent search made of the records in an attempt to discover the communication dated November 20, 1927, referred to in your letter. The officials inform me that there is no such letter on file and I am convinced that no such letter ever reached this Branch. This communication, if it were on file, would be of no value for the purpose we have in mind. The information required by the Surveyors and Engineering Branch must be supplied by the senior official of the Department in the particular district from which a request for the construction of school has come. In this particular case the senior official is Mr. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nThe Department has no knowledge of the existence of Indian day schools at Marias Portage or Massagamash Bay, nor have we at any time contributed directly or indirectly to the construction or operation of these schools. The Department has not at any time contributed\n\nReverend Gavin H.

A copy of this letter was sent to you, and you will remember that, when you visited the Department, I discussed with you what might be done to improve the facilities at this school.\n\nIf you have not yet received any information from Mr. Grafton, it would be appreciated if you would communicate with him and obtain his views at the earliest possible date. When you receive his report you should submit it to the Department, with detailed comments regarding what you consider should be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Ross,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. G. Lasenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nIsland Lake Mission U. C.,\nMarch 8th, 1939.\n\nHon. T. A. Crerar,\nSupt. General,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nI am taking the liberty of writing you direct in connection with the school situation at this point as it concerns the people of our Communion. I have written Mr. Hoey and got a letter today in answer to mine, which is entirely unsatisfactory and in which he conforms my opinion that he has not the slightest grasp of the situation here. In one paragraph he states: \"The Department has no knowledge of the existence of Indian day schools at Marias Portage or Wasagamach Bay, nor have we at any time contributed directly or indirectly to the construction or operation of these schools\". This from the Director of Training and Welfare of the Department. You will know that the Marias Portage school has operated for years under the auspices of the R. C. Church and the teacher paid through your Department at a salary of ninety dollars per month. We have been told that the wife of this man receives a salary from the Department for teaching the school at Wasagamach Bay. You will also know that the Department built a new school for them at their Mission last year at Marias Portage.\n\nThe Wasagamach Bay people were mostly of this communion until the school started there last year. Our application for a school in our building at that point was refused by the Department in 1936 and we find that the R. C. people were given permission and a teacher supplied last summer. Mr. Hoey denies that this is the case.\n\nHere is the situation at Island Lake. We have around 650 Indians in our communion, over 170 children of\nschool age and one room with seats for 18 pupils to accommodate them. We have continually for the past five years pressed on the Church the necessity of further accommodation here and have seen the R.C. Church get a new up to date school at Marias Portage and a summer school at our point of Wasagamach which was denied us when we made application through the usual channels.\n\nWe have made a study of the needs of the people here and submitted plans to the Home Mission Board for what we think would be an ideal set-up for the problem here and have been told that the Department has been approached by the Mission Executives with a view to having something done for the children here who have no way to get any schooling of any kind. The only rise to date is a letter from Mr. Hoey to our tea cher dated Feb. 2nd suggesting that the present one-roomed log building might be enlarged to accommodate the 170 odd children and the letter from the same gentleman today from which the above quotation is lifted. Mr. Hoey's letter of Feb. 22nd tells me that I am not in order writing to the Department and probably he is quite right technically. However, I have written him a letter which I am sure will not please him in which I set out my determination to press the claims for the Island Lake United Church Indians in any direction that may get some action notwithstanding his displeasure.\n\nThis is the largest reserve in this part of the country and fast increasing in population. As I see it, Mr. Crerar, you have a great opportunity to make an experiment in something different in Indian education, as I think that you will agree that the present type of residential school is not doing the job. And that is something that cannot be laid at the door of your Department or the present administration. Here you have a large band of Indians. They have no old educational systems to live down, nothing to forget. They are far enough away from outside influences to be free from harmful criticism to enable a new plan of education to get going.\n\nYou know that we have one visit each year from the Agent and his party when they pay treaty. It is not\npossible for your Agent to have any idea of what would be good for these bush people when he sees them for one day per year.\n\nI have done my best to get the problem over to the Department for the past five years but with so many hands to go through and the last two men, ours and yours not having the slightest knowledge of the problem first hand it is not getting us anywhere. This is my excuse for writing you direct and asking you if it would be possible for you to open a direct route from me to the Department or yourself in order that our views might be made known. I would go at my own expense to Ottawa if you could do this and it would be considerable and I know that if you could get to know the set up you would welcome the opportunity to do what you could to get a worthwhile school plan in operation.\n\nWe know that if the present session is concluded without provision made for schools here that another year will pass before anything can be done and I do not want that to happen nor do I think that that is your wish. And if we follow the instructions as laid down by Mr. Hoey nothing possible can be done worth while.\n\nThis is written without the knowledge or consent of the Home Mission Board of our Church as were my letters to Mr. Hoey to which he takes exception. I consider that the circumstances and the urgency require your personal consideration and if this letter obtains that I will be content.\n\nWith every good wish to yourself and the Party and Principles you represent, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGavin H. Grieve.\n\nP.S.- Have just got the news that you have been able to give us a post office on the lake, Postmaster T. Wass. We appreciate this development greatly and herewith our thanks.\n\nG. H. G.\noperation of Indian day schools under the auspices of the Roman Catholic and United Churches in your district.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank you for the information contained in your letter and for your interest in the education and general betterment of the Indian population of your district.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 1)\nthe Home Mission Board, the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch and myself. I have been informed that this practice has been followed since the Indian Department was first organized and has proved on the whole very satisfactory. It has been the aim of the present administration to provide annually the amount of money necessary to meet the educational needs of the Indian population as the urgency of these needs has been emphasized by the representatives of the United Church from time to time. It is my understanding that the educational needs of the Island Lake district were carefully investigated by Dr. Cornils about a year ago and that Dr. Cornils's recommendations were submitted to the Department by the Secretaries of the Home Mission Board a few weeks after the investigation. I make this statement to remind you that the claims of your district have been carefully reviewed by the officials of your own Church and by the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch at least on two or three occasions in recent years. It is only fair to the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch, however, to state that there is not a single letter on the official file 123-4-5 relating to the educational needs of the district. If letters were sent in by you, they do not appear to have reached the Department. In view of the practice that has been followed, therefore, I hesitate to say that the procedure could be in any sense improved by having the officials communicate directly with the missionaries in charge of mission stations on the reserves. This is a suggestion that might be submitted to the members of the Home Mission Board and by them discussed with my colleagues and myself.\n\nI am requesting the officials of the Welfare and Training Division to send forward to you a list of the Indian day schools operated by the Department in the province of Manitoba, the name of the teacher and the post office address in each case. It is my hope that this list will remove any misunderstanding that may exist between you and the officials with respect to the operation -\nrepresentatives of other denominations labouring in\nthe same district secure greater concessions from the\nGovernment of the day than they are able to secure.\nThis, in my judgment, is a most unfortunate attitude.\nI am not sufficiently optimistic, however, nor have I\nthe faith necessary to suggest a remedy. I can state\nthough that there is not in the Department a vestige\nof evidence to justify this attitude or to support\nthe charges of discrimination made periodically by\nthe representatives of all the churches.\n\nThen the Superintendent of Welfare and\nTraining stated in his letter to you of February 28 that\nthe Department had no knowledge of the existence of\nIndian day schools at Kerias Portage or Wazagamach Bay,\nthis information was secured by him from the official\nrecords and is literally correct. However, it is just\npossible that the school referred to by you as in\noperation at Kerias Portage is the school officially\nknown as the Island Lake R. C. school. This school was\nnot built by the Department but by the church author-\nities and was erected on the understanding that the\nDepartment would make a grant toward the cost of material\nand labour. The total of this grant, I am informed, was\n$300.00.\n\nThere is no record here of an Indian day school\nat Wazagamach Bay. If a school is in operation at that\npoint, the cost of its operation must be borne wholly by\nthe Catholic Church. The Treasury regulations do not\npermit the payment of a salary or an allowance to the wife\nof an individual employed in the government service.\nTherefore, the rumor to which you refer, that the wife\nof the Island Lake school teacher is receiving a salary,\nis wholly without foundation.\n\nThe educational needs of the Indian population\nthroughout the country for the spiritual welfare of\nwhich the United Church assumes responsibility are care-\nfully reviewed from time to time by the Secretaries of\nment of the school at Island Lake in the departmental letter already referred to. This information, when secured, is used as the basis of an official questionnaire or report submitted by the Indian Affairs Branch to the Surveys and Engineering Branch, the officials of which are responsible for the actual construction of school buildings.\n\nThe regulations governing the expenditure of public funds may at times resemble red tape and are, I know, very trying on the patience. I must state, however, that such regulations are unavoidable. A Minister may be called upon at any time by Parliament to supply the most up to date information on any particular project, and Civil Servants have no alternative but to secure, not only the information necessary for the Minister, but in addition, information that may be demanded by the Auditor General.\n\nI can readily understand the anxiousness of the Indians to secure adequate school accommodation when the school population is as large as the school population at Island Lake appears to be. If there has been delay in supplying the needs of your district, this delay, I can assure you, has been in no sense intentional but has been due wholly to the difficulties experienced in obtaining the funds necessary to provide adequate school accommodation for the Indian population with the enrolment increasing at the rate of 300 pupils per annum. In this connection I am frequently reminded that the taxpayers of Canada, from whom the funds necessary for the Indian service are secured, have in many cases witnessed the closing of their own schools during the depression and in other cases seen them reduced to a six or eight months' operating period.\n\nA number of missionaries engaged in work among Indians appear to have convinced themselves that\n\nrepresentatives -\nOttawa, March 17, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Grieve:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 9, in which you submit for my personal consideration the claims of certain Indians at Island Lake for additional educational facilities.\n\nYou will be glad to learn that provision has been made in the estimates now before Parliament for the construction of a school on the Island Lake reserve. It will not be possible, however, for the officials to decide on the exact amount of accommodation that can be provided in the new school or the actual dimensions of the building until they receive from the teacher now in charge of the United Church school at Island Lake the information requested in departmental letter addressed to him and dated February 2, 1939. In that letter the teacher was requested to send forward this information to Indian Agent Lazenby. At this date, however, the Department has not received the information requested, either from the teacher or the agent.\n\nI may state that the letter sent to the teacher is the ordinary letter sent out to teachers and Indian agents employed at agencies where additional school accommodation is requested. In the case of a reserve where a day school is already in operation, the officials of the Surveys and Engineering Branch invariably ask if the present building can be enlarged or reconstructed - hence the reference to the enlarge-\n\nReverend Gavin H. Grieve,\nUnited Church Missionary,\nIsland Lake, Manitoba.\nOttawa, March 20, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. DOREY:\n\nI am attaching hereto, for your information, copy of a letter received by me from the Reverend Gavin H. Grieve, United Church Missionary, Island Lake, Manitoba.\n\nThis letter is, in my judgment, a striking illustration of the misunderstandings and difficulties that are apt to arise when missionaries are permitted to enter into negotiations with the Department in respect to either the construction or operation of Indian day schools.\n\nIt is not my intention to acknowledge receipt of Mr. Grieve's letter of March 9.\n\nMr. Grieve appears to challenge my right to seek on secure information from the teacher in charge of the Island Lake Indian School, who, although nominated by the United Church, is an employee of the Department. If Mr. Grieve does not challenge my right to obtain this information, he resents bitterly my attempt to secure information at this particular time and seems to resent even more bitterly my suggestion that he communicate with the Home Mission Board of the United Church. You can readily appreciate the fact that I am not a free agent in this matter. The information asked for in the letter dated February 2, 1939, is information requested by the Surveys and Engineering Branch - information without which we cannot proceed with the construction of the building. Mr. Grieve, of course, has a perfect right to complain against the inadequate school accommodation at Island Lake. He has the right employed by employees of the Department, and the right to communicate with his federal representative in the Dominion House, who happens in this case to be Mr. Crerar himself. Mr. Grieve has no right, however, to interfere with a Civil Servant in the discharge of his duties, and I must feel free to take whatever steps I may deem necessary to prevent him from indulging in this interference.\n\nI may state that the letter sent to the teacher dated February 2, 1939, is the ordinary letter sent out to teachers and Indian agents employed at agencies where additional school accommodation is requested. In the case of a reserve where a day school is already in operation, the Survey and Engineering Branch would invariably ask if the present building can be enlarged or reconstructed - hence the reference to the enlargement of the school at Island Lake in the departmental letter already referred to. This information when secured is used as the basis of an official questionnaire or report and is submitted by the Indian Affairs Branch to the Surveys and Engineering Branch, the officials of which are responsible for the -\nfor the actual construction of school buildings.\n\nThe regulations governing the expenditure of public funds may at times resemble red tape and are, I know, very trying on the patience. I must state, however, that in my judgment such regulations are unavoidable in a democracy. Ministers may be called upon at any time by Parliament to supply the most up-to-date information on any particular project, and Civil Servants have no alternative but to secure, not only the information necessary for the Minister, but in addition, information that may be demanded by the Auditor General. The Treasury officials and my immediate superiors naturally insist that I secure this information from the senior officials employed by the Department on our reserves throughout the country.\n\nA number of missionaries engaged in work among Indians appear to have convinced themselves that representatives of other denominations laboring in the same district secure greater concessions from the government of the day than they are able to secure. This, in my judgment, is a most unfortunate attitude. I am not sufficiently optimistic, however, nor have I the faith necessary to suggest a remedy. I am enclosing, for your information, a statement of the appropriations either passed by Parliament or now under consideration by Parliament for the erection of Indian day schools since I entered the Department. This statement, you will note, is fully self-explanatory.\n\nWhen I stated in my letter to Mr. Grieve of February 22nd that the Department had no knowledge of the existence of Indian day schools at Marias Portage or Wasagamach Bay, this information was confirmed by me from the official records and is literally correct. Mr. Phelan, with whom I discussed the matter, had no knowledge whatever of the operation of an Indian day school at either of these points. However, it is just possible that the school referred to by Mr. Grieve as in operation at Marias Portage is the school officially known as the Island Lake R. C. School. This school was not built by the Department, but by the Catholic Church authorities, and was erected on the understanding that the Department would make a small grant toward the cost of finishing material and labour. The grant made amounted to $300. Mr. Blackburn is employed as teacher of the R. C. school at Island Lake and receives a salary of $90 per month, or $10 a month less than the salary received by the teacher in charge of the United Church school.\n\nThere is no record here of an Indian day school at Wasagamach Bay. If a school is in operation at that point, the cost of its operation must be borne wholly by the Catholic Church. The Treasury regulations do not permit the payment of a salary to the wife of an individual employed in the government service. Therefore, the rumor to which Mr. Grieve refers, that the wife of the Island Lake school teacher is receiving a salary, is wholly without foundation.\n\nIt has been -\nIt has been the aim of the present administration to provide annually the amount of money necessary to meet the educational needs of the Indian population as the urgency of these needs has been emphasized by the accredited representatives of the Churches. It is my understanding that Dr. Cormie visited the Island Lake district about a year ago and that immediately following that visit the claims of the Island Lake Indians for additional educational facilities were discussed with the Minister here by Dr. Coochiching and myself. It is scarcely necessary to remind you that the Minister himself has experienced the utmost difficulty in securing public funds for the erection of Indian day schools. This difficulty is due in part to the fact that the taxpayers of Canada, who provide the money for the Indian service, have throughout the depression witnessed either the closing of their own schools or the reduction of the operating period of these schools to six or eight months annually.\n\nIt is my intention to ask the Minister to secure from the United Church an assurance that the responsibility for the operation of residential schools will be assumed wholly by the Home Mission Board and that the nomination of Indian day school teachers be assumed by the same body. I am convinced that unless these assurances can be given the task of a man occupying the position that I occupy at the moment will become an almost impossible one. My experience has been that just as soon as steps are taken to establish a school to be operated under the auspices of the United Church, local difficulties are ended and that these local difficulties are due wholly to the intervention of missionaries employed on reserves. It is scarcely necessary to recall to your mind the difficulty we experienced at Caughnawaga when the missionary and the members of the Montreal Presbytery visited Ottawa and protested vigorously against the temporary accommodation we had made for the United Church pupils of the R.R. School (Kateri). They said, in the case of Alberni, a very thorough investigation of the educational needs of that district was undertaken by the school Inspector and the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia. These officials spent weeks in carrying out an intensive investigation, in preparing a census of the Indian population and in the preparation of reports. Their recommendation was accepted by the Minister and the officials here but was later overruled when the officials of the United Church in British Columbia, at their annual conference, passed a resolution asking for the rebuilding of the school at Alberni. This pressure ultimately prompted the Government to rebuild at Alberni, despite the recommendations of their own officials. Apparently the delay of the building was charged to us but there has been in my judgment unnecessary delay that might have been avoided, had our officials been permitted to proceed with the building programme, as recommended by them.\n\nThe request for these assurances will no doubt reach you from the Minister in due course. I am referring to them now in the hope that you may desire to discuss the matter with the Home Mission Board when it meets toward the end of this month.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 20, 1939.\n\nRe - Island Lake Indian Day School\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter dated February 8, 1939, addressed by the Department to Mr. B. Grafton, teacher, United Church Indian Day School, Island Lake, Manitoba; copy of a letter received by the Department from Reverend Gavin H. Grieve, of Island Lake, dated February 13, 1939; and copy of my reply to Mr. Grieve, dated February 25, 1939. I am enclosing also a statement of the appropriations made by Parliament for the operation of Indian day schools since I entered the Department 24 years ago; and a statement of the Indian day-schools operated by the Department in the province of Manitoba, showing the official name of each school and the post office address of the teacher in each case.\n\nYou will note, in respect to the statement of appropriations, that I have not included the Mud Lake school in the United Church column, although Mud Lake is nominally at least a United Church cause. You will note also that there is not on the official list of schools in Manitoba schools in operation at either Marias Portage or Wasagamack Bay.\n\nI have made a careful study of the official file 123-4-5 and there is not on this file any of the letters to which Mr. Grieve refers in his communications. It is just possible that these letters, if written, were sent to the Indian agent or to the Home Mission Board. In any event, there is nothing whatever on file here to indicate that they ever reached the Department. I shall be glad to place the official file at your disposal for perusal when you visit Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\nR.M. Hoey\nSupt. of Training and Welfare,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThank you for your letter of February 22nd here today. I note that you are displeased that I should ever have written you also I note that the Department does not consider any information from my value. In the face of this rebuke I again address you to correct some misstatements in your letter of 2nd ultimo.\n\nFirst I was not surprised that you had written to Mr. Grafton but was surprised that you should ask him for data which each teacher has supplied to the Department for the past few years in respect to additional seats, paint, etc., from your letter one would get the idea that we were trying to go over the Indian Agents head in these matters which the records will show is not the case. We asked for these things in the usual way and got nothing. Also Mr. Grafton has written a report as you asked for.\n\nNow in respect to R.C. Schools at Marinas Portage and Wasagamack Bay. You say that the Department has no knowledge of any Indian Day Schools at these places nor have you contributed to the construction or operation of these schools. From a man with your official Title of Head of Training and Welfare this statement is to say the least remarkable. Have you ever heard of a school teacher by the name of John Blackburn of Island Lake, or of his wife Mrs. Blackburn? If they were not engaged to teach the schools under the R.C. auspices at Marinas Portage and Wasagamack Bay, what schools are you paying them to teach? A little research work in the records of the Department will show you that the R.C. people have conducted this school for years at Marinas Portage at the expense of the Department also will show you that the new school was constructed there last summer at the expense of the Department. Mr. Blackburn's salary was ninety dollars per month and we heard that Mrs. Blackburn received eighty dollars per month for Wasagamack Bay school. I am sure you will be glad that I have uncovered two of the teachers that you had no knowledge of for you. I am sure that they have done good work here even without their knowing that their names had come to the attention of the Dept. of Training and Welfare.\n\nI have a high regard for the Indian Agent Mr. Lazenby and all our relations have been cordial and entirely satisfactory. Our experience teaches us that something else besides the procedure you outline for us will be necessary if the people under our Church are to be given consideration in respect to education. To this end I will continue to exert every effort to bring the subject before everyone who in my estimation might be able to get some action irrespective of consequences to myself or my effect.\nit may have on your responsibilities.\n\nI am more than pleased that you are not responsible for the policy of Indian education.\n\nThe very successful efforts of the R.C. Church in obtaining school facilities are not matters that I have ever criticized, indeed I envy their ability and enterprise in getting through the Department schools not only for their own people but for our people.\n\nI am sure that Dr. Dorey could have told you that this missionary had brought his views to the attention of the Home Mission Board through the proper channels at regular intervals for the past five years.\n\nAs to you not being able to locate my letters on the subject of schools in the Department I do not wonder at that when you do not even know that you have any schools under the R.C. Church at Island Lake. I myself have handled Department supplies going to the school at Eagle Portage both for the building of the new school and for the maintenance of it.\n\nIn the meantime is your only solution to the problem of getting over one hundred and seventy children to school the possible enlargement of the one room log building at present in operation. If you can solve the problem in this way you certainly deserve the plaudits of the Architectural world. Reminds me of the chaos that the Manitoba department of Education got into a few years ago under similar misdirection.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I hope that you refer this letter to Dr. Dorey also. If you can convince him that the R.C. people have no schools at Manitou Portage or Tasagamach Bay and that you did not build a new school at Manitou Portage which is taught each day by one John Blackburn and that the preliminaries to the Tasagamach School were made through the Indian Agent you will insist that we do instead of direct through a gentleman in the DEPARTMENT AT OTTAWA. Then Mr. Haey I suggest that get back in politics direct, there is a great future for you. As for me I wonder how I have been in the bush too long. Today I will go across the lake and take pictures of these buildings that do not exist and maybe have dinner with Mr. and Mrs. Blackburn who are also but familiar folk. And the new school that we all were boasting last summer for its nice appearance was just a mirage, even the Indians who carried the stuff over the 140 portages between here and Norway House did not paid nine cents a pound for it, they were fooled along with the rest of us. Mr. Haey says it is not so. And the radio message we thought we heard from Inspector Hamilton to the R.C. Priest about the materials for this school which does not exist. Of course not Mr. Haey says so and will spank us if we dare go against his wishes. I think the only cure for your disease is publicity and you are in a fair way to get it.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 1)\nOttawa, March 17, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Grieve:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 8, in which you submit for my personal consideration the claims of certain Indians at Island Lake for additional educational facilities.\n\nYou will be glad to learn that provision has been made in the estimates now before Parliament for the construction of a school on the Island Lake reserve. It will not be possible, however, for the officials to decide on the exact amount of accommodation that can be provided in the new school or the actual dimensions of the building until they receive from the teacher now in charge of the United Church school at Island Lake the information requested in departmental letter addressed to him and dated February 2, 1939. In that letter the teacher was requested to send forward this information to Indian Agent Lasenby. At this date, however, the Department has not received the information requested, either from the teacher or the agent.\n\nI may state that the letter sent to the teacher is the ordinary letter sent out to teachers and Indian agents employed at agencies where additional school accommodation is requested. In the case of a reserve where a day school is already in operation, the officials of the Surveys and Engineering Branch invariably ask if the present building can be enlarged or reconstructed - hence the reference to the enlarge-\n\nReverend Gavin H. Grieve,\nUnited Church Missionary,\nIsland Lake, Manitoba.\nment of the school at Island Lake in the departmental letter already referred to. This information, when secured, is used as the basis of an official questionnaire or report submitted by the Indian Affairs Branch to the Surveys and Engineering Branch, the officials of which are responsible for the actual construction of school buildings.\n\nThe regulations governing the expenditure of public funds may at times resemble red tape and are, I know, very trying on the patience. I must state, however, that such regulations are unavoidable. A Minister may be called upon at any time by Parliament to supply the most up-to-date information on any particular project; and it is not sufficient to alter- native but to secure, not only the information necessary for the Minister, but in addition, information that may be demanded by the Auditor General.\n\nI can readily understand the anxiousness of the Indians to secure adequate school accommodation when the school population is as large as the school population at Island Lake appears to be. If there has been any delay in supplying the needs of your district, this delay, I can assure you, has been in no sense intentional but has been due wholly to the difficulties experienced in obtaining the funds necessary to provide adequate school accommodation for the Indian population with the enrolment increasing at the rate of 15 pupils per annum. In this connection I am frequently reminded that the taxpayers of Canada, from whom the funds necessary for the Indian service are secured, have in many cases witnessed the closing of their own schools during the depression and in other cases seen them reduced to a six or eight months' operating period.\n\nA number of missionaries engaged in work among Indians appear to have convinced themselves that representatives -\nrepresentatives of other denominations labouring in\nthe same district secure greater concessions from the\nGovernment of the day than they are able to secure.\nThis, in my judgment, is a most unfortunate attitude.\nI am not sufficiently optimistic, however, nor have I\nthe faith necessary to suggest a remedy. I can state\nthough that there is not in the Department a vestige\nof evidence to justify this attitude or to support\nthe charges of discrimination made periodically by\nthe representatives of all the churches.\n\nWhen the Superintendent of Welfare and\nTraining stated in his letter to you of February 22 that\nthe Department had no knowledge of the existence of\nIndian day schools at Kerias Portage or Wasaganach Bay,\nthis information was secured by him from the official\nrecords and is literally correct. However, it is just\npossible that the school referred to by you as in\noperation at Kerias Portage is the school officially\nknown as the Island Lake R. C. school. This school was\nnot built by the Department but by the church author-\nities and was erected on the understanding that the\nDepartment would make a grant toward the cost of material\nand labour. The total of this grant, I am informed, was\n$900.00.\n\nThere is no record here of an Indian day school\nat Wasaganach Bay. If a school is in operation at that\npoint, the cost of its operation must be borne wholly by\nthe Catholic Church. The Treasury regulations do not\npermit the payment of a salary or an allowance to the wife\nof an individual employed in the government service.\nTherefore, the rumor to which you refer, that the wife\nof the Island Lake school teacher is receiving a salary,\nis wholly without foundation.\n\nThe educational needs of the Indian population\nthroughout the country for the spiritual wellbeing of\nwhich the United Church assumes responsibility are care-\nfully reviewed from time to time by the Secretaries of\nthe Home Mission Board, the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch and myself. I have been informed that this practice has been followed since the Indian Department was first organized and has proved on the whole very satisfactory. It has been the aim of the present administration to provide annually the amount of money necessary to meet the educational needs of the Indian population as the urgency of these needs has been emphasized by the representatives of the United Church from time to time. It is my understanding that the educational needs of the Island Lake district were carefully investigated by Dr. Cornie about a year ago and that Dr. Cornie's recommendations were submitted to the Department by the Secretaries of the Home Mission Board a few weeks after the investigation. I make this statement to reassure you that the needs of your district have been carefully reviewed by the officials of your own Church and by the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch at least on two or three occasions in recent years. It is only fair to the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch, however, to state that there is not a single letter on the official file 123-4-5 relating to the educational needs of the Island Lake district which was sent in by you; they do not appear to have reached the Department. In view of the practice that has been followed, therefore, I hesitate to say that the procedure could be in any sense improved by having the officials communicate directly with the missionaries in charge of mission stations on the reserves. This is a suggestion that might be submitted to the members of the Home Mission Board and by them discussed with my colleagues and myself.\n\nI am requesting the officials of the Welfare and Training Division to send forward to you a list of the Indian day schools operated by the Department in the province of Manitoba, the name of the teacher and the post office address in each case. It is my hope that this list will remove any misunderstanding that may exist between you and the officials with respect to the operation -\noperation of Indian day schools under the auspices of the Roman Catholic and United Churches in your district.\n\nI am sure if you were here you would appreciate the many problems connected with Indian educational work. Mr. Hoey, the officer in the Branch directly concerned, has been doing everything humanly possible to improve the conditions existing at the time he joined the Department. I have every confidence in his judgment and therefore regret that you should feel the way you do towards him.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank you for the information contained in your letter and for your interest in the education and general betterment of the Indian population of your district.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.A.

The floor, I may add, is maple.\n\nI do not know whether or not the church officials at Toronto have submitted the 'plan' to the Department, to which Mr Grafton makes reference in his letter.\n\nIf the materials set out on the attached requisition are approved and purchased, they should be shipped addressed to me at Norway House, c/o Selkirk Navigation Company, Redwood Dock, Winnipeg, so as to arrive here as soon as possible after receipt of consignments, and each package of the shipment should be plainly marked on the outside, \"Island Lake U.C.School.\" No package should weigh more than 90 or 100 pounds, and everything should be very well and securely packed, as they will have to stand considerable handling and hard usage.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.;\nOttawa, April 26, 1939.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI regret that the limited time at my disposal yesterday prevented me from discussing with you certain difficulties confronting us with respect to the construction of an Indian day school at Island Lake.\n\nYou may remember that Mr. Grafton, the teacher in charge of the school, is asked in a letter dated February 2, 1939, to supply the Department with certain information with respect to and concerning the availability of labour, lumber, etc. I am sorry to state, however, that the teacher does not appear to be disposed to submit this information.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter dated February 10, 1939, sent forward by Mr. Grafton to Indian Agent Lazenby. This communication reached me only this morning. The Department has no knowledge whatever of the \"complete and most excellent plan\" to which Mr. Grafton refers. As a matter of fact, we have not a vestige of evidence on file here that could be likened to such a thing used by the Surveys and Engineering Branch in the drawing of plans for this building. I find it exceedingly difficult to understand why a teacher, who is an employee of the Department, steadfastly refuses to supply us with the information without which we cannot proceed with the project. I have today written to Indian Agent Lazenby and asked him if he knows of any person somewhere which we can secure the information requested for the Surveys and Engineering Branch. Unless this information reaches us almost immediately, I am afraid we shall be unable to proceed with the construction of the school this year. It is just possible, however, that we might purchase a certain amount of material out of this year's appropriation and proceed with the construction next year.\n\nIt is my opinion that unless Mr. Grafton has sent forward to you or to Dr. Cochrane the plan to which he refers, he should be asked for his resignation. The Department simply cannot afford to keep in the service employees who refuse to supply us with the information requested by the officials from time to time.\n\nI should like to hear from you with respect to this matter just as soon as you can have time to reply. I am daily expecting an enquiry from the Minister's office with respect to the delay in starting the construction of the school at Island Lake.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 1)\nOttawa, April 26, 1939.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI regret that the limited time at my disposal yesterday prevented me from discussing with you certain difficulties confronting us with respect to the construction of an Indian day school at Island Lake.\n\nYou may remember that Mr. Grafton, the teacher in charge of the school, was asked in a letter dated February 8, 1939, to supply the Department with certain information with respect to accommodation, the availability of labour, lumber, etc. I am sorry to state, however, that the teacher does not appear to be disposed to submit this information.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter dated February 10, 1939, sent forward by Mr. Grafton to Indian Agent Lazenby. This communication reached me only this morning. The Department has not received whatever of the \"complete and most excellent plan\" to which Mr. Grafton refers. As a matter of fact, we have not a vestige of evidence on file here that would be likely to prove at all useful to the Surveys and Engineering Branch in the drawing of plans for this building. I find it exceedingly difficult to understand why a teacher, who is an employee of the Department, steadfastly refuses to supply us with the information without which we cannot proceed with the project. I have today written to Indian Agent Lazenby and asked him if he knows of any other source from which we can secure the information requested for the Surveys and Engineering Branch.

In respect to Mr. Grafton's letter enclosed with your communication, I note that it is dated February 10, 1939. I should like to know exactly how long it takes a letter to reach the Department from Island Lake via Norway House.\n\nI regret to state that the Department has no knowledge of the \"complete and most excellent plan\" to which Mr. Grafton refers in his letter. As a matter of actual fact, we have not on file here to guide us a vestige of evidence with respect to conditions at Island Lake, and unless we can secure the information necessary, it will not be possible to proceed with the construction of the school this year or indeed at any time.\n\nThe Surveys and Engineering Branch are, as you probably know, responsible for the actual construction of Indian day and residential schools. The officials of that Branch will naturally ask us to supply information with respect to the proposed school and its equipment or if it is the intention to build a separate unit. They will also want to know if lumber can be secured from Island Lake or from a local sawmill or if we have in mind log construction. They should also be supplied with a brief summary of shipping instructions.\n\nI find it exceedingly difficult to understand why the local teacher has refused to supply the information requested. Would it be possible for you to secure this information from any other source? If it is impossible to proceed with the construction this year, would it be practicable to buy a certain amount of the material out of this year's appropriation and proceed with the construction next year?\n\nIt is important that we keep in mind the fact that the Surveys and Engineering Branch have had no experience in the construction of Indian day schools until now in the outlying sections of the Dominion. You can readily understand, therefore, why they hesitate to proceed with any project until they have full and complete information at their disposal.\n\nImmediate steps will be taken to supply the paint requested in your requisition of the 18th instant.\n\nYour prompt attention to this matter will be deeply appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 1)\nOttawa,\nApril 27, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received a requisition dated January 21 for the Island Lake U.C. day school. This requisition is approved by you.\n\nMany of the articles on it were also entered on the requisition forwarded to the Department under cover of your letter of the 18th instant and the Purchasing Agent has already been requested to secure these.\n\nYou may purchase for use at this school 1 axe, 2 axe handles, 2 hammers and 6 lbs. of wool.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nrespect to schools as they are only transients in the work. What I object to is that you will not accord our Church the same consideration and the R. C. Clergy carry on an active proselyting campaign amongst OUR PEOPLE on the strength of what they claim to be able to get from the Department and the results seem to bear them out.\n\nWe have been informed that Four Thousand Dollars have been placed in the estimates for this year to take care of new school accommodation on this lake. Of course I do not know what is in the mind of the Department re spending this amount of money but can not see anything worthwhile being done with that figure. To erect one or two more such buildings as we have would be just a waste of money. If you are so pleased to do something worth while for goodness sake let it alone until you are so disposed. I can assure you that any attempt to continue with any such set up as the present or any addition to the present day school program will be fought to the last ditch.\n\nI have affidavits from three citizens of this area in respect to the school at Wasaganach and I think you will be able to find that at least one of your officials was in correspondence with the R. C. Clergy in respect of that school and I think that they were justified in believing that they would be allowed to conduct a school there at the expense of the Department.\n\nCan you wonder that the teachers in the day schools are a little suspicious of letters bearing Mr. Hoey's signature. About the first thing they heard of Mr. Hoey was a letter from him asking them to write DIRECT TO HIM about the school problem. Some of them did so and found out later that copies of their letters were forwarded to the Indian Agent. This information did not come from Mr. Lasenby or anyone in his office but you can check up on the truth of it by asking what disposition was made of a letter from Miss Shoup at Cross Lake. Mr. Hoey has the ability to create active animosity towards himself and the administration amongst those who should be warm friends and supporters.\n\nI feel that one of my family has the right to address any Minister of a Liberal administration and consider it my duty also. I was reared in a home where Liberal politics were about as important as the family Bible. A member of the family has the right to be heard just as the family has the right to exact his loyalty when the time comes. That is our position and I hope that you will read this letter in that light.\n\nWith every good wish, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.) Gavin H. Grieve.\nIsland Lake, Manitoba  \nU. C. Mission,  \nApril 17th, 1939.\n\nHon. T. A. Crerar, M.P.,  \nMinister of Mines and Resources,  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nThank you for your letter of March 17th. I think that you have not been informed fully about the letter sent to the teacher here about the school and his reply thereto. He was asked to send a report to Mr. Lazenby setting out what materials were needed to decorate the present school and to report what provision could be made for the necessary increased number of pupils.\n\nThe teacher sent a copy of the letter to Mr. Lazenby and set out what was needed to redecorate the present school and at the same time reported that Dr. Cormie was reporting on the other report asked for. You say that Dr. Cormie's representations were made in due course to the Agent so what further information you need is not quite clear. The teacher is not available just now for further information as he is on his holidays and will not be back until June. Certainly there is no excuse for delay in going ahead if you are in receipt of Dr. Cormie's report.\n\nThe facts about new school buildings where the R. C. Church are concerned are not in line with the procedure you set out for us to follow. We have never, so far as I know, went over the head of the Indian Agent but have each year asked for paint, seats, etc., for our present school without getting anything. You have confidence evidently in the R. C. people to allow them to build a new boarding school at Crosslake to give one of the Brothers at that point an order to purchase furniture, etc., for their day school at his discretion and presumably without any supervision by the Indian Agent, to permit expenditure of a lot of money on this lake on a new deal without the Indian Agent entering into the deal at all. I heard mention go over the air to the local Priest about supplies for this school with Inspector Hamilton's name read out as the sender. I could go on giving you further cases for the rest of the day. Now I do not think that this is anything but right that you should have that confidence and I am sure that your confidence has not been misplaced. The R. C. Bishop and the Priests at the Missions are the best sources of information that you could have about the needs for the people in their care. The teachers of that communion or any other communion are not in a position to give a worthwhile opinion on the needs of the Indian people in\nConfidential.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\n\nWill you please refer to the draft letter which you prepared for the Minister's signature to the Reverend G.H. Grieve, of Island Lake, Manitoba, dated March 17th, 1939. I am now enclosing herewith a reply which the Minister has received and which you might be good enough to return after you have read it. Do you suggest the Minister should make any further reply?\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nEnclosure (1).\nApril 17/39.\nOttawa, April 28, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. JACKSON:\n\nI am returning herewith a letter received by the Minister from Reverend Gavin H. Grieve, Island Lake, Manitoba.\n\nI am not at all sure that it is wise to reply to Mr. Grieve's letter. This communication has, to me, about it a semblance of irrationality. However, I am sending forward a draft reply, in case the Minister feels that he would like to acknowledge receipt of the letter.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 28, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Grieve:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 17, in which you submit for my consideration additional information with respect to educational facilities at Island Lake.\n\nI must express regret that the letter dated February 2, 1939, sent out by the Indian Affairs Branch to Mr. Grafton, the teacher at the Indian Day school at Island Lake, has resulted in a long-range general discussion of the actions of certain departmental officials and of the Government's educational policy, particularly in northern Manitoba. It is my opinion that a great many problems brought by you to my attention are of such a character that they might be taken up at a round table conference between the representatives of the Home Mission Board of the United Church and myself.\n\nYou will be interested to know that Mr. Grafton's letter in reply to the departmental communication of February 2 reached the Indian Affairs Branch on April 26. This letter, a copy of which I am enclosing for your information, does not contain the details requested by the Branch, nor have we any knowledge whatever of the plan to which Mr. Grafton refers. When the representatives of the Home Mission Board visited the Department, immediately following Dr. Cormie's trip to Island Lake, they discussed with the officials the general educational needs of the district and left behind a number of snapshots taken by Dr. Cormie at the time of\u2014\n\nReverend Gavin H. Grieve,\nUnited Church Missionary,\nIsland Lake, Manitoba.\ntime of his visit. They did not at that time or at any time supply the information requested by the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nI am particularly anxious that no misunderstanding should exist in your mind with respect to the policy followed by the Government in regard to Indian day and residential schools. The Cross Lake School (a church-owned building) was destroyed by fire in 1930. The Roman Catholic Church authorities have been demanding the reconstruction of this school since that date. Bishop Lajeunesse, at his own expense, visited Ottawa on a number of occasions and on each occasion supplied us in writing with full and complete information in respect to the Catholic population and the educational needs of the district. When an appropriation of $56,000 for the reconstruction of this school was placed in the 1938-39 estimates, the Chief Architect of the Public Works Department, resident at Winnipeg, was sent to Cross Lake, not only to make an investigation of the building site, but to draw, while there, a complete plan of the building to be erected. This official submitted to the Surveys and Engineering Branch not only a plan of the building but a complete list of the materials that would be required for the entire project. An agreement was then reached with the Church, whereby the actual work of construction was undertaken under the supervision of the Oblate Order.\n\nThis year, the same procedure exactly was followed with respect to the construction of the Alberni (United Church) Residential School, British Columbia. An architect was sent from Vancouver to make a complete investigation of the site and to submit a sketch plan of the proposed building. This report and sketch plans were submitted a few days ago to the representatives of the Home Mission Board of the United Church for their approval. There is this difference, however, that the work at Alberni, which it is estimated will cost -\nwill cost at least double the amount to be expended at Cross Lake, will be advertised and tenders called for the construction. The United Church representatives have never, so far as I am aware, expressed a desire to proceed, under their own direction, with the construction of an Indian day or residential school. If they are now anxious to undertake this responsibility, I can assure you their representations will be very carefully and very sympathetically considered.\n\nI have learned from the departmental records that the letter to which you refer in the penultimate paragraph of your communication is a letter signed by Miss Shoup and is dated Cross Lake, Manitoba, June 16, 1937. In this letter Miss Shoup states: \"It is my intention to discuss these suggestions with the Indian agent when I pass through Norway House on my way out in July. I will also send a copy of this letter to Dr. Dorey, our United Church Secretary of Indian Affairs\". The suggestions to which Miss Shoup referred in her letter were suggestions with respect to the operation of the Cross Lake School on an annual basis with holidays in April and May rather than in July and August. Miss Shoup's letter was submitted by the Superintendent of Welfare and Training to the Indian agent for investigation and report. Mr. Lazenby replied in a letter dated July 19, 1937.\n\nI find it difficult to fully understand your reference to this letter. Letters reaching departmental officials become, as you are no doubt aware, part of the government records and are liable to be tabled in the House at any time and thus become accessible to the Press. There is nothing whatever in Miss Shoup's letter of a confidential or semi-confidential character, nor was the letter marked \"Personal\".\n\nIn the last paragraph of your letter, you refer to your right to address a letter to myself as\n\nMinister -\nMinister of the Department. This is the undisputed right of any citizen of the country. I hope I am not mistaken, however, when I state that I have an impression from your communications that you resent to some extent the action of certain officials in communicating with Indian day school teachers and Indian agents. May I state that the officials are not free agents in this matter. They are compelled to communicate with our field officials from time to time. Indeed, it can be said that our field officials would be of little value to us in our administrative work if we were not in a position to secure from them the information necessary to carry forward the programme of the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRAH\nDear Sir,\n\nReceived letter today from Dr. Cormie stating that a difficulty had arisen between myself and your department. I was unaware of this difficulty to which he refers.\n\nTo date I have received one letter and one questionnaire from your office. Any further correspondence you\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 1)\nmay have forwarded will be answered upon receiving same. Our mail system at Island Lake leaves much to be desired as we are entitled to ten mails a year at the most.\n\nYou asked for plans for a new school. I understood that a suggestion for a larger school had been made to the department and that it would be approved. I referred under a misapprehension.\n\nThe day school at Island Lake is in good condition.\nbut is quite inadequate to accommodate the pupils which should be in attendance. There are seats for 18 pupils but there are about 70 pupils in the summer and 30 in the winter who could go regularly, and many more on the reserve farther away.\n\nWhat we need are more seats.\n\nI am extremely sorry that this misunderstanding should have arisen as I endeavor to do the best work I can at all times and have never before, to my knowledge,\nhad any complaints at any school in which I have taught. I hope this reply clears up the difficulty to which you refer.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nBernard Grafton\nof course, that there may have been delay on the part of the Indian Agent in sending it forward. In your letter you state \"the Church has a most complete and most excellent plan which they no doubt have already submitted to the Department\". Immediately following the receipt of your letter I communicated with the church authorities with the result that Dr. Dorey visited the Department and went fully into the matter with me. Dr. Dorey informs me that the church authorities have no knowledge whatever of the plan to which you refer, nor has such a plan been submitted to the Department at any time. In view of these facts, therefore, it is not possible for the Surveying and Engineering Branch to proceed with the construction of the school at Island Lake. However, we have sent forward ten double desks and a supply of paint.\n\nI have already written to Agent Lasenby and expressed the hope that there was someone at Island Lake from whom we might secure the information we are seeking, particularly the information with respect to lumber that might be supplied locally. It is not at all likely, however, that this information will reach us for several weeks.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, May 15, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 10th instant, in which you refer to a misunderstanding that has arisen between yourself and the Department, in respect to the extension of educational facilities at Island Lake, Manitoba.\n\nI may state by way of explanation that Indian Agent Lazenby visited the Department during the month of January, 1939. At that time we discussed with Mr. Lazenby the matter of school accommodation at Island Lake and ways and means whereby it might be extended. He was not in a position to supply us with much information at that time but suggested that we communicate with you in regard to the matter. I should state also that immediately following the reorganization of this Department, a little over two years ago, the repair and construction of Indian day and residential schools was assigned to the Surveys and Engineering Branch. This is a distinct and separate unit of the Department with an independent status in the Department as the Indian Affairs Branch. The officials of the Surveys and Engineering Branch are not prepared in any instance to proceed with the construction of a school until we have secured for them from the senior official in the district full and complete information with respect to the government buildings already established, the desirability of extending such buildings or the construction of new buildings, as the case may be.\n\nWe wrote to you on February 2, 1939. In that letter we asked you to prepare a report stating what provision you considered should be made for the increased number of pupils at Island Lake. You were asked also if it would be possible to enlarge the present building at Island Lake. You were asked if the lumber could be secured locally and thus save the expense of freighting lumber to the school. We intimated to you that you should give very careful consideration to the whole matter and supply as complete information as possible to Indian Agent Lazenby.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, a copy of your reply to this letter, dated February 10, 1939. If you study this reply you will note at once that it is wholly unsatisfactory to the Department. I might state also that this letter did not reach the Department until April 26. It is just possible, of course -\n\nBernard Grafton, Esq.,\nOak River,\nManitoba.\nMr. R. A. Story,\nDept. of Welfare and Training.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 15th instant to hand. Your kindness in forwarding 10 extra double desks would enable us to accommodate those able to attend our day school at present.\n\nIn regard to additional accommodation:\n\nThe present school is a log building. I do not think you could enlarge same without tearing it down and re-building with longer logs.\nAll rough lumber might be secured locally as the Catholic mission across the lake has a saw mill. All finishing lumber, shingles etc., would have to be sent in.\n\nAs I will be returning to Island Lake early next week, and as the Hudson Bay Co. erected new buildings last summer, I could obtain accurate information for you as to cost handled price of lumber and cost of labor in connection if you so desired.\n\nIf you intend building a new school at this point, might I suggest a\nschool large enough to accommodate sixty pupils, as the Indians take more building permanent houses and growing gardens an establishment of sixty in the near future might be expected.\n\nI trust this letter contains the information you require.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nBernard Grafton.\nOttawa, May 31, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIn view of the delay experienced in securing information with respect to the construction of the Island Lake Day School, it may not be possible to proceed with the construction this year. I am hopeful, however, that we may find it convenient to purchase the necessary supplies this year and have them shipped to their destination. Therefore, any additional information that you can secure and send forward to the Department will be very much appreciated.\n\nIn your letter you state that if it is our intention to build a school at Island Lake, a school large enough to accommodate 60 pupils should be erected. I should like you to state if a school capable of accommodating 60 pupils should be erected in addition to the school now in operation. I should like to know also, if there is basement accommodation at your school and if you consider it advisable that basement accommodation should be provided at the new school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBernard Grafton, Esq.,\nOak River,\nManitoba.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Mr R.A. Hoey's letter No; 123-4-5 of the 26th April, which arrived with a small quantity of mail brought in by an airplane bringing in a load of freight for the Hudson's Bay Company, from Winnipeg. The mail service is not as yet on regular schedule.\n\nIn reply to the first paragraph of Mr Hoey's letter, I beg to advise that it is impossible to say exactly how long it takes for a letter to reach the Department from Island Lake via Norway House, as there is no post office at Island Lake at the present time, and no mail service to and from that point, as such. Letters are brought out from there, and taken in there, just whenever there happens to be an airplane of any sort visit there. However, I may say that I heard an announcement over the radio a week or two ago, to the effect that the Post Office Department had decided to establish a post office at Island Lake this spring, and that there would be a regular monthly airmail service put into effect.\n\nWith regard to the rest of Mr Hoey's letter, I beg to say that I have written again to Mr Bernard Grafton, the teacher at the Island Lake U.C.Day School, asking him for all the information he can possibly supply, as requested in Mr Hoey's letter to him of the 2nd February last. However, as it is at present impossible to say when Mr Grafton will receive my letter, I have written also to Rev: J.A.Cormie D.D. the Superintendent of Mission for the United Church, at Winnipeg, and enquired of him if he has the 'most complete and most excellent plan' which Mr Grafton mentioned in his letter.\n\nAs I did not know what Dr Cormie's business - address -\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 1)\naddress in Winnipeg was, I went to ask the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, and while in conversation with him this morning, he told me that Dr Cormie had made mention to him last summer or fall, that Mr G.H. Griveau, the U.C. Missionary at Island Lake, had given him some plan for the increasing of the pupil accommodation at the Island Lake school, when he visited there, while on a tour of the northern missions.\n\nI have asked Dr Cormie to let me have these plans in fullest detail by return mail, if he has such on hand, and as soon as I hear from him, I will again write the Department.\n\nIn the meantime, I may say that, as the R.C. Mission at Island Lake has a saw-mill, and supplied the lumber for the erection of a new day school at their mission last year, it should be possible to secure from them the necessary lumber for the U.C. School also. However, roofing, windows, frames, doors etc. would have to be shipped in from Winnipeg, and the required quantities of these materials can possibly be figured out from the plan which Dr Cormie evidently has.\n\nIt is noted that steps are being taken to supply the paint requisitioned for, for this school.\n\nMr Hoey's remarks regarding the Surveys & Engineering Branch, being responsible for the construction of Indian schools, are also carefully noted, and as quickly as it is available, all possible information as to the requirements for the Island Lake U.C. Day School will be forwarded.\n\nAs stated in the first paragraph of this letter, our regular mail service has not as yet been resumed, but I am advised that there is a possibility of another plane load of freight coming in from Winnipeg for the Hudson's Bay Co; to-morrow or the day following, and I will try to get all my mail out by this means if at all possible.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nReply to be sent to this\nletter when A.E.\nHamilton's answer\nverifies is received\nSir,\n\nFurther to my letter of the 15th May last, in connection with proposed improvements at the Island Lake United Church Indian Day School, I beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter I received last mail from Rev: J.A.Cormie D.D., of Winnipeg, in this connection.\n\nThe Department has possibly by this time, received further communication from Mr Grafton, the teacher of this school.\n\nIt would appear, from Dr Cormie's letter, that the United Church offices in Toronto, have all the details of the plan suggested for providing additional pupil accommodation at this school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.:\nMr P.G. Lazenby  \nNorway House,  \nMan.\n\nDear Mr Lazenby\n\nWhen I was in Island Lake last summer Mr. Grieve, our missionary, drew attention to the inadequate provision for the education of the children on that reserve. It appears that the average attendance last year was thirty during the summer and twenty-four during the winter, but that there was seating accommodation for not more than twenty. I understand that there are more than 250 pupils of school age in the vicinity of the school and that the new policy governing the Norway House residential school will close that institution to new pupils from the Island Lake Reserve.\n\nMr Grieve presented a plan pretty much along the line of the new school at Cross Lake. I handed it on to our office in Toronto, leaving the matter with that office to make what representation to the Indian Affairs Branch they thought wise. I do not communicate direct with the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIn my report to our office I urged the need of action somewhat along the lines adopted at Cross Lake but was unable to go into details. I felt when I drew attention of our office to the need of some definite and decided change of policy for the education of the Indian children on this Reserve that the details could be worked out by those more familiar with the matter than I.\n\nI have had two conversations with Mr Grafton who is now on holidays, returning to Island Lake to-morrow, and I believe he has written to Mr Hoey on the matter.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nSigned:- John A Cormie\nOttawa, June 21, 1939.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by the Department from Mr. P. G. Lasenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba, and also copy of a letter received by Mr. Lasenby from Dr. John A. Cormie. Both of these communications, you will note, are self-explanatory.\n\nWe sent in early this year a number of additional seats and certain supplies to the Island Lake school, and no doubt these have been delivered by this date. The reference in Dr. Cormie's letter to a school at Island Lake, much along the line of the new school at Cross Lake, is the first suggestion I have had from any source that a residential school should be built in the Island Lake district.\n\nI have discussed with Mr. Phelan Dr. Cormie's reference to the new policy governing the administration of the Norway House residential school. We know nothing whatever of this new policy, and no changes in the administration of the school at Norway House have been discussed at any time by the officials here in recent years.\n\nThere is a small amount - approximately $4,000 - in the estimates of this year for the construction of an additional room at Island Lake. In view of -\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n239 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\nview of the difficulty I have experienced, however, in securing information with respect to the site itself, the lumber available locally and other such matters, I have not been in a position to send forward to the Surveys and Engineering Branch a questionnaire required by them before they are prepared to proceed with the construction of a school. I am really at a loss to know what should be done at Island Lake either this year or any other year. If I could secure the services of the right man, I would have him go into the district and make a thorough survey of the educational needs of the Indians and the type of school which in his judgment should be erected. I should like you to give some thought to this matter and let me have any expressions of opinion you may care to offer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 1)\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe - Island Lake Day School\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 21st, addressed to my colleague, Dr. Dorey. The letter has come to my desk for answer, as Dr. Dorey is in the Maritime Province for three or four weeks.\n\nI have gone over the correspondence with your Department in regard to the question of a new school at Island Lake, and I have recalled several conversations that Dr. Dorey and I have had with you in the past year about this matter. I also have before me a letter which Dr. Dorey wrote regarding Island Lake to Mr. Chapin, of Norway House, who wrote us very recently about the situation there.\n\nFirst of all, let me say that on August 8th, 1938, Mr. Chapin wrote us a letter in which there occurs these sentences: \"Norway House treaty is this week, so we are looking for a busy time. I was not permitted to recruit from inland, so did not get a visit to Island Lake, Gods' Lake or Norway House. The Doctor said to get what recruits I could from Cross Lake, so I went up there last week.\" \"...With Island Lake children shut out or coming to residential school, it would be a wonderful thing for the Roman Catholic Church to get a residential school going in there.\"\n\nNow, it seems strange to me that you say that neither Mr. Phelan nor yourself knows anything of this new policy to which Mr. Chapin refers, and that no changes in the administration of the school at Norway House have been discussed at any time by the officials in recent years. Perhaps you could find out what representations were made to Mr. Chapin at Treaty time last year in regard to this matter. If he is laboring under a misapprehension, we should like to tell him so.\n\nNext, let me say that I have a clear recollection of a conversation Dr. Dorey and I had in your office last year or early this year, when we impressed on you the need of making provision for the children of the Northern Reserves, who hitherto had been accommodated at Norway House. We made special reference...\nto Island Lake. We carried away your promise that there would be in the Estimates $4,000, to make at least an addition to the school at Island Lake. We gathered from what you said that this amount would be used to complete the first unit of a building which would ultimately meet the needs of the Island Lake Indians.\n\nNeither Dr. Dorey nor myself has had any defence to make of the kind of letter which Mr. Grieve, our representative at Island Lake, wrote you some time ago. We agree that Mr. Grafton should have sent the information which you desired, in the way you desired it. It seems unfortunate if, because of the difficulty in securing information from Mr. Grafton, who is in fact an employee of the Government and of the Department, the $4,000 in the Estimates this year should not be spent at Island Lake. There is certainly, according to our Superintendent of Missions, Dr. Cormie, an imperative need of immediate action in order to get some kind of adequate school accommodation. I should like to impress upon you the advisability of something being done in this direction at the earliest possible moment, and if there is anything we can do to help secure the information necessary before construction of this new unit is possible, we shall be glad to do it.\n\nWe endorse very heartily your suggestion that there ought to be a thorough survey made of the educational needs of the Indians at Island Lake, but if this means another year's delay before any beginning is made, I think this would be very unfortunate. Why not go ahead with the first unit and spend the $4,000, and then by thorough survey find out how much more will be needed? Dr. Cormie may be visiting the area again this year, or at least if we asked him specially to do so, he might be able to arrange it. He gave us a very lucid and comprehensive report last year of the conditions he found on his visit. We communicated to you the facts he presented to us. If you think it would help any to have him go in again, I will see what can be done.\n\nWe are anxious that the children of these United Church Indians should have a decent school building, and I do not think we can be blamed for the delay. As it is now, apparently Dr. Cormie and our representatives in Manitoba are blaming us here in Toronto for not making the representations to your Department that we should have made. I do not know of anything more we can do. I note that in Dr. Cormie's letter to Mr. Lazenby, he says that Mr. Grafton has, he thinks, written to you on the matter. Has he sent you the information you desire?\n\nLet me in conclusion urge that something be done this summer to correct the educational conditions at Island Lake.\n\nBelieve me,\nVery sincerely yours\n\nRBC.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 1)\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, June 24, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Chapin:\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Dr. Cochrane, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church, which convinces me that there is a misunderstanding somewhere with respect to the territory from which you are permitted to recruit pupils.\n\nIt would appear that on August 8, 1938, you wrote a letter to the Home Mission Board, in which these sentences occur: \"Norway House Treaty is this week, so we are looking for a busy time. I was not permitted to recruit from Island Lake, so did not get a visit to Island Lake, Gods Lake or Oxford House. The Doctor said to get what recruits I could from Cross Lake, so I went up there last week\".\n\nI am anxious to know at the earliest possible date the name of the official from whom you received instructions not to recruit at Island Lake. I have made a diligent search of the files here and there is nothing to indicate that such instructions were ever sent out from Ottawa. I should like to know, also, the name of the doctor to whom you referred in your letter to the Home Mission Board. This information must be secured before a decision can be reached with respect to the construction of a day school at Island Lake. I am sending this letter forward by air mail, to expedite matters, and it is my hope that you will be able to send your reply by air mail, also. Your immediate attention to this matter will be deeply appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend R. T. Chapin, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nNORWAY HOUSE, Manitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 1)\nit will be simply impossible for us to proceed with\nthe erection of these buildings in the outlying districts\nunless we can secure from the teachers in charge of the\nschools and the missionaries labouring in the districts\nthe fullest possible cooperation. This is a matter\nthat should be discussed very fully with Dr. Cormie.\nIn the case of a number of Roman Catholic schools, the\nchurch authorities themselves undertook the construction\nof the buildings on the understanding that the Depart-\nment would pay a grant to defray part of the cost.\nI feel confident, however, that the United Church would\nnot be prepared to adopt this policy.\n\nYour immediate attention to this\nmatter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAIR MAIL\n\nEXTD\n\nOttawa, June 26, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nIn the estimates of this year the sum of $4,000.00 was provided for additional accommodation at the United Church Indian Day School, Island Lake, Manitoba.\n\nYou are no doubt aware that Mr. Lazenby, the Indian Agent at Norway House, visited the Department a few months ago. At that time we attempted to secure from the agent sufficient information to permit us to proceed with the construction of at least an additional room. Mr. Lazenby, however, appeared to be rather vague in respect to local conditions at Island Lake and particularly the actual needs of the Indians for additional school accommodation. He suggested that we communicate with Mr. B. Grafton, the teacher in charge of the United Church Indian Day School. We communicated with Mr. Grafton in a letter dated February 2, 1939. Mr. Grafton appeared to be somewhat reluctant to supply the information requested and we have had a number of abusive letters from the local missionary at Island Lake, Mr. Gavin H. Grieve, all of which suggest that the missionary seems to resent the action of the Department in seeking information.\n\nYou are aware that the construction of Indian day schools comes directly under the Survey and Engineering Branch. However, the officials of that Branch are not prepared to proceed with the construction of a school until they have secured from us the fullest possible information with respect to the type of construction, lumber or logs, the condition of the present building, basement accommodation, etc. This information is usually supplied in the form of a questionnaire. At this date we have not -\n\nA. C. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nhave not been able to secure this information. The only information we have is that the Catholic Mission have a sawmill at Island Lake, from which the lumber for the construction of the United Church school might be secured. However, we are not even sure of this.\n\nDr. John Cormie, in a letter to Agent Lazenby dated Winnipeg, Man., May 30, 1939, states:\n\n\"Mr. Grieve presented a plan very much along the line of the new school at Cross Lake. I handed it on to our office in Toronto, leaving the matter with that office to make what representations to the Indian Affairs Branch they thought wise. I do not communicate direct with the Indian Affairs Branch\".\n\nDr. Dorey, of the Home Mission Board, informs me that the plan to which Dr. Cormie refers is not in their possession, nor have they any recollection of receiving such a plan at any time. At this date it is exceedingly difficult for me to know what I should do to provide additional accommodation at Island Lake. I have been wondering if it would be possible for you to interview Dr. Cormie, who might be in a position to supply you with certain information, he having visited the Island Lake district about a year ago. Would it be possible for you also to interview Father Plourde, in an attempt to discover if it would be possible for us to purchase lumber from the Island Lake Catholic Mission. In addition to this, you might discuss the matter with Mr. Allan, if you can find it convenient to do so. Mr. Allan has had a certain amount of experience in the construction of buildings in outlying districts and might be in a position to give helpful advice.\n\nI should emphasize that under the new arrangement, whereby the Surveys and Engineering Branch are responsible for the construction of Indian day schools,\n1. Island Lake School Plan\n\nReasons for:\n1. Due to the nomadic life of the Indians only a small percentage of the children are able to live in the vicinity of the day school.\n2. The curriculum of a day school does not contain manual training.\n3. The residential schools are exceptionally fine in every way but are much too far above the Indians means for him to apply much that he sees and learns to his after school life.\n4. The residential schools do not fit their pupils for after school life, hunting and fishing although they do teach them excellent English.\nIsland Lake School Plan\n\nAims: Boys:\n1. To give the children training which will be both useful and profitable in after school years.\n2. To have living conditions in the school comparable to those attainable by the Indians in after school years and still raise their standard of living.\n3. To provide instruction in manual training useful in later life, i.e.,\n   1. Trapping\n   2. Fishing\n   3. Bush carpentry\n   4. Gardening\n   5. Home making\n4. To give all children an opportunity of receiving an education.\n5. To instill into the pupils the habits of cleanliness, preparing in advance, independence, etc.\nIsland Lake School Plan.\n\nOutline of Plan.\n1. Buildings. (This is for one unit of plan, about twenty-five or thirty boys).\n   a. The present school for cultural subjects.\n   b. A log building of two stories with thirty wooden bunks upstairs.\n      Having homemade tables and chairs downstairs.\n   c. A small log building for manual training.\n      The total cost of these two buildings should not exceed five thousand dollars.\n\n2. The cost per pupil for food would be very small as most of it would be obtained from the net and the gardens similar to what they receive at home, and could afford themselves.\n(4). 3. Manual Training.\n\na. Children could be taught:\n   1. How to build a good log house.\n   2. How to make suitable furniture with the means at their disposal.\n   3. How to make snowshoes.\n   4. How to make a boat.\n   5. How to make a toboggan.\n\nb. They could be given instruction in net making and repairing.\n\nc. Classes could be held during the winter months by a good trapper in the art of trapping. At present boys generally become as good trappers as their instructors.

R. T. CHAPIN, B.A.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nNORWAY HOUSE, MAN.\nJune 29th 1939.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours of the 24th to hand on last night's mail.\nIn reply I might review the events of last summer.\n\nDr. Turpel told me that the Indian Affairs Branch were endeavoring to make some kind of a medical drive against T.B. on the Northern reserves. The funds they had for this purpose were limited so the movement had to be started where it could be best controlled. In Norway House there was both a school and a hospital so that was the logical place to start work, using the facilities of both School and Hospital. Further, the aim was to work more with the younger generation. If a drive were made to put all possible children who were fit in Residential School, where they would be away from the contagion of reserve contact, there would not be room for children from the outside reserves also. So in order to use the School to best advantage, and have the children in it from one locality where medical work could be followed up closely, children could be taken in only from Norway House, though Dr. Turpel said to also include Cross Lake as he is in fairly close touch with that reserve.\n\nThe children taken into the School were to be divided into two classes - Those who were normally healthy and could carry on with regular School routine, and those who, while not active, would need special care, rest, food and a modified routine. The latter group were to be segregated as far as possible and the Indian Affairs Branch were to allow twenty-five cents a day extra for their special care.\n\nIn acting on the above and writing to Dr. Cochrane I said I regretted that the inland children could not thus have the opportunity of Residential School training. However health is of primary importance and I said I was ready to cooperate with the Department in any move they might promote.\nIn the fall Dr. Turpel left on leave of absence and Dr. Searle, who was supplying for him, had no instructions re the above mentioned program. So as far as our School was concerned we carried on along the usual lines. We had only four or five children who needed special watching and these have come through the year splendidly.\n\nIf the Department has in view a medical drive we are ready to cooperate in any way we can. If that is not to be put into effect just yet we would like the inland Reserves to send some of their children to Residential School. We cannot accommodate all the children by any means but we like to have a percentage from each reserve.\n\nWe have only weekly mail service so this cannot go out till next week but I will send it Air Mail to hurry it through from Winnipeg as speedily as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume_6236, file 516-5, part 1)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n536 Dominion Public Building\nWINNIPEG, MAN., July 12th, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter 123-4-5, dated June 26th. Dr. Cercle is away on holidays and not likely to return before July 31st. The Rev. Father Plourde wired the Bishop at The Pas and yesterday advised me that, with 15 days notice, they could saw from 10 to 15 thousand feet of spruce lumber with their mill at Island Lake. This lumber would be green and would require careful piling so as to dry.\n\nMr. Lazenby will be at Island Lake July 24th. I would suggest a letter be sent him with a questionnaire covering all the information required. This could be sent out by air mail and perhaps even yet the school could be erected. If not, information would be on hand for next year.\n\nI am not impressed with a winter school on the reserves where the Indians hunt for a living. The Indian either goes with his family out to the trap line or remains at home and cries out for relief. It seems to me the only logical school is a summer school and then close the school in winter and send the Indians away to hunt and trap. I have visited many of these outlying schools and scarcely a child will talk. Boys who have quit school require an interpreter.\n\nBefore any expensive schools are built in these outlying points I think all detailed information required should be provided and the Agent should definitely recommend that the school is a necessity and state that he should attend the summer school or during the winter. I cannot help but feel that in many cases we invite hunger and relief by insisting that the children attend school when they perhaps would be learning better how to make a living if out on the trap line with their parents.\n\nIf a letter addressed to Mr. Lazenby c/o this office, arrived here by Air Mail not later than Monday the 17th, I could send it North with Nurse Nelson and she could deliver it June 20th. Ottawa should then receive full information not later than June 31st.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

(RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 1)\nOttawa, July 14th., 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of June 12th. and previous correspondence with reference to improvements at the Island Lake United Church Indian Day School.\n\nAs you have previously been informed there is an amount of $4000.00 provided in the current year's appropriation for the new school at this point. The Department considers that the best plan to follow would be to erect a one room school, large enough to accommodate 35 to 40 pupils with a full basement in which Vocational Training could be given.\n\nI understand that you will be at Island Lake in the near future, and I wish you would fully investigate conditions, with a view to determining if the building suggested in the preceding paragraph of this letter, would be suitable for Island Lake.\n\nYou should also ascertain and advise me what material could be secured locally. Inspector Hamilton, states that with a 15 day notice, 10 to 15 feet of spruce lumber could be obtained from the Roman Catholic Mission at Island Lake. This lumber would be green. Would it be advisable to use green lumber in erecting a building at Island Lake, or can dry lumber be secured locally? You understand that bringing in lumber would not only increase the costs, but would certainly delay building operations.\n\nIn the event of building being erected this summer, is there any competent carpenter living in the vicinity of Island Lake who can supervise the work? If so please give his name and address. Are there any Indians capable of assisting a competent foreman in building the school.\nAny other information that you can obtain at Island Lake, should also be supplied for the Department's consideration, and your letter giving the details required should be forwarded to Ottawa by air-mail.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare & Training.\n\nP. J. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nManitoba.\nOttawa, July 14th., 1939\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th. instant, which reached me this morning, I enclose a letter directed to Indian Agent Lazenby.\n\nI note from the last paragraph of your letter that you can send the enclosed with Nurse Nelson, in order to reach Mr. Lazenby before he goes to Island Lake.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\nthorough campaign might be carried out at Norway House Reserve.\n\nAs there were at Norway House yourself, the Medical Superintendent, and the Principal of the Residential School, all available for consultation, the Department did not think it advisable to lay down such rules by mail, which might apply in any given instance or in respect to any individual child and it does not want to do so now. It does wish to keep the school clear of communicable disease and to have the hospital used for the treatment of tuberculosis so far as space is available. It does not wish to have the school deprived of the benefit of the hospital. Its whole programme in tuberculosis control in schools is based on the doctrine that the school shall not be used as a sanatorium, but that it shall be free, so far as possible, from its tuberculosis problem so that it may function in the best manner as an educational institution.\n\nThe correspondence suggests, though it does not state in so many words, that there was not very close cooperation among the three officers concerned at Norway House last year. It is seldom that plans of this kind can be based on anything but compromise among the different officers concerned, and the Department would prefer a workable programme which would not hamper any of the various kinds of work undertaken, rather than one which might possibly be more effective along one line if that line were the only one to be considered.\n\nThis letter is being written somewhat hastily so that it may catch the air mail tonight, and if possible, reach you before you leave for your annuity payments. I would advise you and the Medical Superintendent to see the Principal of the school and talk over and if necessary revise any arrangements you have had during the past year and to work out your plans to the best interest of all concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nJuly 17, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has a letter from Mr. Chapin, Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, in which he states that he was not permitted to recruit pupils from Island Lake last year so did not visit that place or God's Lake or Oxford House. In another place, he speaks of an arrangement whereby he should only accept pupils from Norway House and Cross Lake as part of a plan of tuberculosis control. Mr. Chapin's letter is dated June 29.\n\nThe correspondence about tuberculosis work at Norway House in 1938 cannot be located at this moment. As it is recalled, the Department's instruction was the residential school and hospital should be used in the best manner that could be devised for the control of tuberculosis among young people of school age. It was scarcely anticipated that this would lead to a restriction of the field of recruiting as the Department had in mind the benefit of all the children in the Agency so far as they could be reached. The only strict rule that can be recalled was that the school should be kept free of active, communicable tuberculosis, and it was supposed that when the fall session opened, the pupils would be gone over and those with active disease removed to the hospital or at least removed from the school. The impression derived from Mr. Chapin's letter is that recruiting from the outside reserves was stopped or restricted so that a more thorough........\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNORWAY HOUSE, Man.\nOttawa,\nJuly 20, 1939.\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nBefore Mr. Hoey went on holidays he requested me to forward you the attached correspondence. You will note that Mr. Hoey wrote to Rev. R.T. Chapin, B.A., with reference to the statement that he had written to you in regard to recruiting for the Norway House residential school.\n\nYou will also note in Mr. Chapin's reply of June 29 that he was acting on the strength of a discussion with Dr. Turpel who was anxious to make certain that the Norway House school was kept as free as possible from tuberculosis.\n\nOn receipt of Rev. Mr. Chapin's letter I discussed the matter with the Superintendent of Medical Services and for your information I also enclose a copy of a letter which has been sent to Indian Agent Lazenby.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

We think the plan above has some merit.

Diet at school to be as near as possible what will be available in their life after school. A great deal can be done in this regard, especially in respect of curing and saving the products of the country. It would be advisable to either bring in for one year a man from the coast who has the knowledge of fish curing and storing or to get the best literature on the subject. Supplementary diet of cereal and dried milk to be kept and used only to round out the produce of the district as will be made available from gardens and the bush and the lake.\n\nClothing for girls made entirely on the spot and work clothes supplied for boys.\n\nNo stock of any kind would be kept, except dogs.

A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRE ISLAND LAKE\n\nYou will remember there was considerable discussion about the educational needs of Island Lake and a suggestion as to how they might be met. After some correspondence, I have now a memorandum prepared, I believe, by Mr. Greive, outlining the needs and how they can be met.\n\nIn the first place, you will note that there are 179 children of school age belonging to the United Church at Island Lake. At the present time there is a one-room school with seats for 18. You can check the figures over, but from the Census they look to be approximately correct. What Mr. Greive has in mind is the establishment of a school, the details of which are given on a couple of islands of approximately 80 acres, not far from the present school. On these he would erect cabins or log structures. He has also outlined the curriculum which should be very glad if you would give this matter your consideration as it is evident that the present educational facilities are not sufficient for all these children.\n\nThis memorandum was prepared a year ago but, for some reason or other, was never sent to this office, and consequently you will note that the last paragraph will have to be revised as far as the date is concerned. Apart from that, it strikes me as being a pretty reasonable and intelligent way of dealing with the educational needs of these children.\n\nIt is altogether likely that Dr. Cochrane and I will be in Ottawa before very long to discuss Alberni and Coqualeetza, and we should like to have the privilege of discussing this matter at the same time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGDBJ\nHCL.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 1)\nOttawa,\nAugust 15, 1939.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nRe: Island Lake Indian Day School\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 14th instant and also a memorandum relating to educational facilities at the Island Lake Indian Reserve, Manitoba, attached thereto.\n\nI have been somewhat disturbed to realize that a combination of circumstances have prevented me from proceeding with the construction of the Island Lake Indian day school. I have on file here a letter dated June 21, 1939, from Mr. Grafton in which he takes 9 pages to explain what, in his judgment, the actual educational needs of the Indians of that district are. These suggestions are all very interesting but unfortunately I am limited to the appropriation of $4000.00 included in this year's estimates. The proposal submitted by you in the memorandum is one that would have to be carefully studied and later forwarded to the Minister for his approval. In the meantime, and until I have an opportunity of discussing this matter with you and Dr. Cochrane, I may state that there are a number of almost insurmountable difficulties that occur to me at once. We have had four fires at residential schools this year and it is not at all likely that either the Minister or Parliament would permit the expenditure of public funds for the construction of a building anywhere in Canada unless the building were fireproof throughout. This means the establishment of a fully equipped, fireproof building at Island Lake the cost of which would be exceptionally\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nhigh, probably between $250,000.00 and $300,000.00. However, I shall be glad to go into the whole matter with you rather fully just as soon as you visit the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nAugust 15, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Grafton:\n\nPlease pardon me for my failure, until now, to reply to your letter of June 21. I have been absent from the office for several weeks on holidays and your letter has only now been brought to my attention.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that I am today in receipt of a letter from Toronto, dated August 14, from the Rev. Dr. Dorey who, in his communication, submits for my consideration a memorandum strikingly similar to the suggestions you have already made with respect to the establishment of what one might term an improved Indian day school at Island Lake. It is my intention to go into the details of this proposal very fully with the United Church representatives just as soon as these men visit Ottawa. In the meantime it appears to me that there are a number of almost insurmountable difficulties standing in the way of the proposal. You will be interested to learn that we have had four destructive fires at residential schools this year. This includes the Carcross residential school which was totally destroyed by fire early in the year. In view of this fact I am convinced that Parliament would not vote public funds for the construction of a Government-owned building anywhere in the Dominion other than a building fully fireproof throughout. If this is the attitude of Parliament, and I know it is the attitude of the Minister, the cost of establishing a fully fireproof residential school at Island Lake would probably cost between $250,000.00 and $300,000.00. In any event you can rest assured that the suggestions made by you will be very thoroughly investigated by the Church authorities and the officials of this Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard Grafton, Esq.,\nIsland Lake, Man.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Mr R.A.Hoey's letter of the 14th July, and previous correspondence, in connection with proposals to enlarge the Island Lake United Church Indian Day School, or rebuild, I beg to say that when I was at this reserve on my treaty trip, I discussed this matter thoroughly with both Mr Bernard Grafton, the teacher, and Mr C.H.Grieve, the United Church missionary.\n\nThe conclusion arrived at, was that, with the new desks provided this year, and having the interior repainted, (the paint also having been provided), the present building would do. Even if a new, and larger building were erected, all the children of school age could not be provided for, as there are too many of them.\n\nAnother aspect of the matter, to consider, is that if we provide a big school there, and then urge the parents to keep their children going to school all through the year, it would mean that the Indians would tend to stay on the reserve all winter, which would be the worst thing that could happen to them. They cannot possibly earn a living on the reserve in the winter, and to encourage them to stay on the reserve would mean that, although their children might get some education, the Department would, without doubt, have to feed the families, and they would eventually become entirely dependent upon the Government for their living. These Indians can only be independent, and stand on their own feet, provided they go out to the bush for about eight months of the year, and to encourage them to do otherwise, for the sake of having their children attend school, would not be good policy.\n\nThis school now, with the addition of the new desks -\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.:\ndesks that have been installed this summer, will accommodate from thirty to thirty-five pupils. The school building itself, is in very good condition, and the re-decorating of the interior this summer will make it very much pleasanter to work in, both for teacher and pupils.\n\nShort of a residential school, or the building of five or six more day schools at this point, it would be impossible to accommodate all the children of school age in any case, as, according to the missionary there are approximately 250 children of school age, belonging to the United Church.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.

McLean\n(United Church Missionary)\n\nRev. W. Webster\n(Teacher)\nNorway House, Man.,\nJuly 5, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attached communication has been received from Rev. J. A. McKim, missionary, and Mr. Robert Huestis, teacher of the Island Lake United Church Day School.\n\nI have prepared requisitions covering Mr. McKim's request, but if the Department approves supplying these midday lunch supplies, I would recommend that authority for local purchase be granted in order to obtain quicker delivery, as these supplies would have to go in by canoe freight from Norway House this summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, July 17, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing requisitions for supplies for the Island Lake United Church Indian Day School.\n\nI have reviewed the returns for the last two quarters and find that they have only had an enrolment of 8 at this school. It is hoped that the attendance is much larger at the present time.\n\nIf you believe it advisable, you may purchase the quantity of oatmeal, beans, canned milk and cocoa which you consider necessary for midday meal purposes, keeping in mind the attendance. I may say that it is not usual for us to give midday meal supplies during the summer months. It is felt that this service should be limited to the winter months.\n\nYou may also purchase two stock pots, if you consider these are needed.\n\nIn the event of finally deciding to give midday meal supplies to the Island Lake United Church School, you should give similar treatment to the Island Lake Roman Catholic School. When forwarding accounts, however, separate accounts should be submitted for each school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. C.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/MGD\nJanuary 6, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRequisitions for Buildings Supplies for -\n(1) Cross Lake R.C. Day School,\n(2) Island Lake U.C. Day School.\n\nThe above day schools are to be built in the Norway House Agency next summer. As the only means of transportation for heavy supplies is by tractor train, it is necessary to purchase these building materials now.\n\nYou will note the following closing dates of tractor train departures,\n\n(a) For Cross Lake, to reach Wabowden not later than 4 March, 1948.\n\n(b) For Island Lake, to reach Ilford not later than 12 February, 1948.\n\nYou will note that these requisitions are for the standard bill of materials of our usual one room Indian day school with attached teacherage. The only deletions are for the dimension lumber which our own Indian sawmills are providing. The sole difference between the two requisitions is that we are ordering insul-bric siding and extra nails for Island Lake because the mill there will not turn out lumber siding.\n\nIn view of the short period of time left to you to arrange for purchase orders, it is suggested that you order these materials from the same firms who supplied identical materials and quantities.\nOttawa, January 7, 1948.\n\nMr. E. B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\n1948-49 Building Programme - Norway House Agency\n\nReference your letters of December 19 and December 27 - on File 9-B\n\nWe have taken the following action with regard to the proposed building of three new day schools and teacherages in your Agency:\n\n(a) Cross Lake R.C. Indian Day School -\n\nWe have forwarded a requisition to our Departmental Purchasing Agent for the building materials listed on your requisition. We have asked that these building materials be ordered to reach Wabowden not later than March 1, 1948. Inspector Hamilton is being forwarded a copy of this letter and is requested to approach Tom Lamb regarding the transportation of these supplies from Wabowden to Cross Lake.\n\n(b) Island Lake U.C. Day School -\n\nWe have forwarded a bill of materials for this school to our Departmental Purchasing Agent with the request that the supplies reach Ilford not later than February 12, 1948. We have asked that these supplies be forwarded via Johnson Transportation Company. If Inspector Hamilton wishes to advise concerning the two other transportation companies at Ilford, we will be glad to hear from him.\n\nYour comments concerning the gypsum board have been noted and we have substituted Ten-test, as required.\n\n........... With\nWith regard to the siding for the Island Lake School, we have substituted Insul-brick for Asbestos-siding shingles. We have found that Asbestos-siding shingles sustain a great loss in shipping even on the railways. Therefore we have replaced this item with Insul-brick and hope that it will prove satisfactory. If you wish literature on the method of applying Insul-brick, I would suggest you contact the firm supplying it when you receive the purchase order.\n\n(c) God's Lake Narrows U.C. Day School -\n\nUnfortunately, North American Buildings Limited have such a large quantity of orders from the Army and Department of Transport ahead of them, that they will not be able to build our prefabricated schools until the late spring. Therefore, we have no alternative other than to place the order for this school and request that it be delivered as early in the winter as the tractor train allows. We may also agree this action, but so many other concerns are ordering prefabricated buildings, that we must wait our turn for delivery.\n\nI would draw your attention to the policy of the Department in naming these day schools so as to provide a minimum confusion in our filing system here. At the present time there is considerable confusion concerning the naming of the schools in your agency. For example, we are now dealing with three Cross Lake Schools, namely,\n\nCross Lake Residential School,\nCross Lake U.C. Day School,\nCross Lake R.C. Day School.\n\nA similar situation exists at God's Lake, at Oxford House and at Island Lake. The inevitable errors have occurred in filing accounts, letters, etc., and in the filling of requisitions and orders.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Major Clark and we would like to hear your views concerning other names\n\n....... for\nfor certain of your schools. Similar situations have arisen in other agencies when new schools were being built. For example, we have a school at Fisher River but a new one is under construction there now. Rather than have a Fisher River No. 2, we have accepted Mr. Indian Agent Lasenby's suggestion that it be named the \"Burdoch Indian Day School\", after the present Chief. Major Clark suggested the name Sagitowock for one of the Cross Lake Schools. We will expect to hear further from you in this regard.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJanuary 20, 1948.\n\nMr. F. B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nGypsum Wall board - Northern Bay School Construction.\n\nWe passed your comments concerning the use of gypsum wall-board to our Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nWe have today received a letter from this Branch reading as follows:\n\n\"Gypsum wallboard 3/8 inch thick with filled and taped joints is specified for interior walls and ceilings as it has a smooth hard surface for painting approximately equal to that of a hardwall plaster surface. It may be that if gypsum board sheets not longer than eight feet were used, these would withstand the rough handling involved in transportation to distant points, without anything like the 40 per cent loss by damage reported by Indian Agent Goodman of Norway House where sheets up to 12 feet in length were used.\n\n\"An objection to 'Ten-Test' is that it is a soft material with edges and surface easily subject to damage not only in transportation but by the ordinary wear and tear of school usage. Also all joints have to be covered with wood strips or moulding to present a neat appearance which would involve a considerable amount of extra material and labour. For Ten-Test 1\" thick window frames should be deepened, so that the interior window trim can be correctly applied. The extra thickness of the Ten Test plus the deeper frames will of course add to the cost, and is not required.\n\n\"More durable alternative materials than Ten-Test, would be 3/8\" Masonite board or ply-wood, both of which should be available.\"\n\n......

Mr Thompson advises that it would be impossible to burn anything larger than stove length wood in this furnace, and I would recommend that a 5' Cordwood Length Furnace be shipped in to take its place. The furnace which is at Island Lake at present was supplied by Neale, Stothard and Chapman, 118 Eighth Street, Brandon, Manitoba and was paid for by this Agency's voucher #688 d/16 August 1948 in the amount of $592.56. The furnace such as illustrated in Ashdown's Catalogue Page H70 #951 B, I believe is the type which should be used in this building.

Indian Day School\n\nI have been advised by Mr. Hughes, Acting Superintendent at Norway House Agency, that the furnace shipped in last year is a coal burning furnace, and the fire box will only take - if used for wood - an 18\" stick. Or in other words, a stick of wood that would only fit an ordinary box stove. If this furnace is put up it would not be able to heat the school, coal being out of the question at this point.\n\nI cannot find anything on record regarding the ordering of this furnace. However, I understand it was purchased from Neale, Stothard & Chapman in Brandon.\n\nThe only thing I can see to do now, is to have the furnace shipped out and a wood burning furnace shipped in. If the coal furnace was shipped to the Pas for storage, it could be used in one of our day schools that we are building.\n\n- over -\n\nIndian Affairs.

If purchased in this way, the price would be approximately $736.70 f.o.b. Ilford, Manitoba. Unfortunately the above requisition came to us only yesterday, and it would be impossible for the eastern manufacturers to deliver the goods at Ilford by the 28th instant, which is the date of the last tractor shipment for this winter.\n\nUnder the circumstances my recommendation is that authority be granted Regional Supervisor Davis to arrange for local purchase of these desks, for delivery within the required time, if it is possible for him to do so. The desks could probably be obtained from Moyer's Limited, Winnipeg, at about $825.00.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 2)\nMr. R.S.

F. Neary,\n\nThe furnace for Island Lake U.C. School was delayed and delivered to Ilford only after the last tractor train had left for Island Lake. In addition, the furnace for Maria Portage was delayed enroute by the railway. Therefore, these two furnaces are still sitting at Ilford, Manitoba.\n\nI have made inquiries regarding the shipping of these items in by air, and find it is much too expensive a proposition, as the price quoted was in the neighborhood of $1,000.00.\n\nIn view of the above I would suggest purchasing Camp Comfort stoves - setting these up in the basement and connecting with pipes - using these until tractor freight opens up again next fall.\n\nI intend to go up to Island Lake whilst Treaty payments are being made, and I will take this matter up with the Brothers in charge of the school to make definitely certain if the makeshift heating arrangements will be satisfactory until shipment of the furnaces can be made.\n\nR.

It is noted that you intend to visit Island Lake at Treaty payment time, and you should inform the management of both these schools regarding the furnaces. At the same time you should give definite instructions regarding the extreme care that must be exercised in the operation of these Camp Comfort stoves, in order to avoid any fire hazards.\n\nBernard F.

There is a lot of painting to do; doors to the furnace room have to be made and put on; and basement has to be done over with cement wash; also the furnace has to be set up.\n\nThe outside of the building and the trimmings need painting, and the brick siding has been very poorly put on. While it is nailed on well, it has been put on with roofing nails on the outside, which show - one wonders what Mr. Hughes was thinking about, letting men do work such as this on the building. Mr. Waite visited the school this summer, but has done nothing to get it into shape. I sent to Norway House for a carpenter - Mr. Stanley Campbell, who, I understand, is a very good man, and advised Mr. Waite to send him down to start working on the school. I estimate that his labour will come to over $400.00 at least.\n\nThe chimney in this school is very poorly built and I feel it should be pulled down and another chimney put up, as I would hate to take a chance on it.

However, since the 1st of April, 1949, we have found it necessary to transfer an amount of $3,700.00 to complete payments due for the construction of this school. The amount mentioned has been expended with the exception of $200.00. We are forwarding this amount to Mr. Waite.\n\nIt would require some time before we could transfer additional funds, but we will try to obtain them when we are making application for another transfer. In the meantime, it is hoped that the $200.00 will meet the most pressing work that has to be done.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nChief, Education Division\nREQUISITION FOR CHEQUE\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: Mines and Resources\nBRANCH: Indian Affairs\nDATE: September 7, 1949\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Norway House Indian Agency | $200.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nMr. R.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6236, file 516-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nI am sorry to have been unavoidably delayed in replying to your letter of April 26. It seems to me that to some extent the questions raised have already been touched upon but I should like to elaborate as follows:\n\n1. School on Island:\nThis location was suggested first because there was a suitable piece of property, secondly a great number of the children concerned live on the Island, thirdly children at the northern part of the area concerned could walk to Rossville by mainland while if the school were on the mainland the children on the Island would have water to cross no matter which way they went. Also the children at the greatest distance from the school (i.e., towards the R.C. school are on the Island). I do not have my map to hand but it also seemed to me that in terms of geography the Island location was more central. I might add that no one up here was dogmatic on this point though almost all concerned felt the Island was the better choice.\n\n2. As to children at the north end attending Rossville I am quite sure that hardly any family included in the area as defined on the map sent in would find it more convenient to go to Rossville. It is a long and difficult walk around the bay over a very poor road or quite a long open distance over the ice in winter. There is of course a sort of in-between area where children could go either way. Perhaps implicit in your question is a further question as to whether the school might not with advantage be located further up\nthe river. All I can say is that in my opinion, even faced with your question, the answer is still no i.e. that whatever extra distances for any of the children might be involved in the location under consideration this would be more than compensated by improvement in terrain which it would be necessary for them to traverse.\n\n3. Many of the same people signed both petitions. I might say that I personally had nothing to do either with the origination nor signing of these petitions. I expect that some of the same people signed as they do anywhere just on principle. As you are no doubt aware it is not always easy to be certain as to what the real intentions of the Indians are. I think if you examine the lists closely you will not find complete identification. Also two points are worth noting: 1 Some of the people signed the Residential School petition for the sake of others' children in their capacity as members of the Norway House Band. I know this to be true from personal contacts in some cases. Also there are some with large families who, while desiring the day school would still appreciate the privilege of easing their burdens by sending some of their children to Residential school. I realize that with some white people this \"shoving off\" of children on the government is considered a poor policy; but it seems to me that unless the government is prepared to initiate and supervise a birth control program some consideration of those with large families is warranted. I might say that I seem to be able to find so far little enthusiasm for such a program among Government officials with whom I have discussed the matter.\n\nI think that the real answer to your third question aside from human inconsistency is that the Residential School has a wider social aspect which excites the interest of all concerned. I state this fully aware of the fact that will be those who would like to have\nBoth schools on the \"Let's get everything we can\" principle. That persons with this outlook are in the minority in this area I feel is indicated by the readiness of several of the more responsible men in this area to donate firewood to the new school. I might add that in view of the horrible logs which our poor teachers have had to struggle with at Rossville this last winter that this offer is not as trifling as might appear. I do hope that if a school is built as suggested that the local Superintendent will take them up on their offer as it would seem to me an excellent step in citizen training if it could be carried out.\n\nIncidentally we were requested by Dr. Dorey to forward him a list of potential orphans social cases etc for whose benefit a residential school would be advantageous. I have never had opportunity so far to really analyze this community on this basis but would suggest tentatively that such a list from Norway House would seldom be less than 15 and more likely would be about 20 children. I should appreciate it if when you are writing to me at any time you could give me explicit assurance that this policy of confining Residential School education to social cases is to be applied rigidly and impartially to all denominations.\n\nThanking you for your courteous and prompt attention to suggestions made I am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nGilbert C. Johnson\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gordon, Indian Agent at Norway House, in connection with the official recognition of a Roman Catholic Day School at Massinicap, under the name of St. Theresa Indian Day School. I suppose that Mr. Gordon will send you the letter of the Reverend Father.\n\nI wish to add what His Lordship Bishop Charlebois mentions in his letter: \"There are already a few Indians on each side of the Mission near the lake. The house of the chief is about a mile and a half away. And I know that other Indians intends to locate themselves in the neighbourhood. It would therefore be a central location for a day school. I believe that a good attendance could be secured. I therefore strongly recommend the official approbation of this school. For the coming year a part of the mission house could be utilized and in 1928 a school house could be built. For the first year if a school teacher is not available, Rev. Father Chamberland, O.M.I., who will be sent to this mission next June could accept the task as he knows English perfectly. If the Department approves, it will be sufficient for the present year to send books, slates, biscuits, etc.\"\n\nYou can judge by yourself of the desire of the Bishop and the Missionary.\n\nWith the hope that you will give this request your consideration, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to the request made by His Lordship Bishop Charlebois that official recognition be given to the Roman Catholic day school which is being conducted at Island Lake, Massinacap.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is the Department's practice to assist this type of activity only when it has been proved successful, and I regret that a grant for teacher's salary cannot be allowed at the present time.\n\nAt a later date, if you will report concerning the success of this school, the Department will give consideration to its official recognition and assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gordon, Indian Agent,\nNorway House.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nAbout fifty children of school age have been given to me at Island Lake to be educated in the Roman Catholic Faith. At Massinicap, the place of our mission, thirty children of school age are Roman Catholic. This winter, when I am at the Mission, I, myself, am the teacher, and twelve to fourteen children are coming regularly.\n\nSo, at the parents' request, I am asking the Indian Department to recognize a Roman Catholic Day School at Massinicap, under the name of St. Theresa Indian Day School.\n\nHoping that school supplies will be provided for next summer, and the payment of the teacher granted.\n\nI am\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Joseph Dub\u00e9au, the Roman Catholic Missionary at Island Lake.\n\nIt would appear, from the statements made by the Reverend Father, that he has secured the requisite number of children for the starting of a day school. How many of the parents of the children mentioned have already become Roman Catholic, I do not know. It will be noted that the Rev. Father states that he is teaching when he is at the Mission this winter, and that twelve to fourteen children are attending regularly.\n\nUnder the circumstances I recommend that an allowance be set aside for the salary of a teacher for next year (such salary to be rated according to the qualifications of the teacher secured), and also for biscuits and school supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir;\n\nOn January 25th I visited the Day School conducted at Island Lake by the Roman Catholic Mission. I found 18 pupils present, all apparently doing well, with Rev. Father Chamberland as teacher.\n\nBelow is a copy of a letter received from Rev. Father Dub\u00e9au, who has been in charge of the Mission, and which speaks for itself;\u2014This letter was written January 24th, 1928.\n\n\"Our day school, opened two years ago at Massinicap, Island Lake, has given good success last winter, and far better this year.\n\nFrom June 1927 to January 1928, forty-five children have attended the class. The average attendance was, June 29, July 27, August 22, September 17, October 13, November 12, December 18.\n\nAll the circumstances, the central place of the mission buildings, the number of the Indians staying, even in winter, at Massinicap, the great desire of the people of having their children educated, the steady attendance we have in class since two years, establish the success of the school.\n\nSo, referring to your own letter (File 775-252) and to one (123-12-1) from the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, I am asking the Indian Department to give to our school official recognition and assistance.\n\nHoping my request will be heard favorably, I am\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

This school is taught by the Rev. Father Chamberland and the work being done is very satisfactory. The parents have been working hard for Government recognition and support for this school, which has now been carried on by the Church for about two years. The average attendance for the past seven months approximates twenty.\n\nWm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\nReferring to your letter of March 27th last, No.123-12-1, (received in the last winter mail) re the day school conducted at Island Lake by the R.C.Mission, I return the enclosed map, having marked in red ink the location of the R.C.Mission thereon. The school is carried on in one of the buildings of the mission. This building is about 24 by 40 feet, the downstairs of which has two rooms for the accommodation of the staff, and one large room which is used as classroom during the time the children are present, and for other purposes at other times. The upstairs is used as a chapel.\n\nIt is the intention of the mission to build more buildings this year, and the classes will then have better accommodations.\n\nThe seats are homemade benches only, are none too comfortable.\n\nThe teacher is a young French Canadian priest, who speaks fair English, and who has the usual education necessary for the ordination to the priesthood. If the Government recognizes the school, it can stipulate the qualifications necessary for the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\nThe Roman Catholic Missionary at Island Lake, in northern Manitoba, has been conducting a day school at the mission on Indian Reserve 22. From the enrolment and average attendance that have been reported, the activity appears to be successful, and the Department is now asked to recognize it as an Indian day school and allow a salary of $80 per teaching month. Mr. Indian Agent Gordon reports that the average attendance during the past fall and winter was approximately 20.\n\nThe school is carried on in one of the mission buildings. The teacher at present is the Rev. Father Chamberland, O.M.I. However, Bishop Charlebois has nominated Mr. Inglott - who has taught in our service before with fair success - provided a salary is allowed.\n\nI wish to recommend that this school be recognized and a salary of $80 per teaching month be paid as from the first of September, next.\n\nAt least since 1926 Board voted to give first premise for R.C. mission\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 12, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of April 28th, last, relative to the day school conducted at Island Lake by the Roman Catholic Missionary, and furnishing a map showing the location of the school and particulars regarding the building in which the school activity is being carried on.

We are informing His Lordship, Right Rev. O. Charlebois, accordingly. You should see that the usual returns of attendance showing the days taught, etc., from the 1st of September, next, are forwarded to your office.

Indian day-school for a salary of eight hundred dollars a year, I had no idea of what the cost of life out here. If it were the same condition as it is at Norway House, this salary would be satisfactory as I could live on it with my wife and three children; but from Norway House to here we have to pay fifteen dollars a hundred pounds for transportation at our own risks, which means that if a sack of flour costs me seven dollars in Norway House, it costs me twenty-two here and I will be lucky if there is not more than ten pounds lost through an accident of some kind; either it be torn open in a portage or dropped a few times in the rapids, and it is the same for anything else. I write this letter it is to ask the Department...\nto be fair and give me a salary that I could make both ends meet. The teacher who was here last year was not married and yet he could not make up with that salary. I do not want to quit but on the other hand I can not afford to keep on with a salary that does not at least cover the essential expenses of life.\n\nHoping that my request will be approved by the Department and will soon receive a just and fair answer I remain\n\nYour faithful servant\n\nJ.R.

In reply I have to say that, in view of your report as to the cost of living, the Department will allow you an increase at the rate of $10 per teaching month in your salary from the first of January, last.

R. Bilodeau as teacher of the R. C. Indian Day School, Island Lake. I now have to inform Your Lordship that, in view of the cost of supplies at this point, the Department is granting this teacher an increase of $10 per teaching month in his salary from the first of January, last. This will make his total salary from that date at the rate of $90 per teaching month.

I understand, considering the present state of finance, that this reduction may be fair in many cases; but here at Island Lake it is impossible for me to cut down any expenses as I have already cut down all what I possibly could, life insurance included, and yet the first year I could not make both ends meet and I had a deficit of about seventy five dollars. After the ten dollars per month increase the Department allowed me (years of Oct 24th 1931 no 123-12-1) and for which I was very thankful, I figured that, though it was not any too much I would be able to save a few dollars to cover the $150. I spent to move from Montmartre Sask. to here; and in a few years make enough to pay my fare back; but 10% off my salary means that I can not possibly see the time when I will be able to go out of here. Two years ago when I came here I did not intend to stay here forever.\nThe teacher who was here for two years before me, with $700 a year, could not make both ends meet and still owes $100. He borrowed from the mission to go back south; and he was single. I am married and have three young children that I must bring up decently. I am confident that the Department will understand that 10% off per month means more to me for my children than $90 a year to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nTrusting that the Department considering that we are in a less accessible locality than most other schools and therefore all transportation more expensive and more risky, will agree that it would be only fair that I, or anyone in the same case, should not be included without consideration in a salary reduction.\n\nYour most obliged,\n\nJ.

If there has been misunderstanding as to the time of his vacation, that is not his fault, as he was told to teach during slack months as the other school was teaching. Besides, that would be deplorable, should this teacher lose his salary, who has a family to support and who is a conscientious teacher, with a normal assistance, it would be deplorable, say I, when at the other school you pay a teacher for winter months to teach, to four or five children only. I think this man should get his salary and I declare he deserves it.\n\nI would be thankful to the Department for such good actions in his behalf.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Day School.\n\nFor your information, I enclose copy of a letter sent to Mr. Gauthier on August 14th, 1936.

Your letter has been carefully considered but the Department cannot see how you have any claim for additional salary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Rev. M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I., Vicar-Apostolic of Kaswatin, the Department is advised that Mr. Aristide Gauthier has left Island Lake.\n\nAs you are aware, the two months' holiday period at the Island Lake R.C. Indian Day School has been taken during the months of April and May on the understanding that the school would re-open on the first of June. Bishop Lajeunesse's letter does not state definitely whether or not Mr. Gauthier is teaching for the month of June. Please advise me definitely on this point at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nRef: 17-A\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No. 123-12-1 of the 23rd June, and in reply, to say that Mr Aristide Gauthier, who had been teacher at the Island Lake R.C. Indian Day School, came out from there by plane, with his family, on June 15th last, to the Jack River R.C. Mission here.\n\nUntil that day, I had no idea that Mr Gauthier intended leaving, and had heard nothing concerning the matter. I was given to understand that another teacher from Virden, Manitoba, was being sent to Island Lake to take his place, but whether or not this has been done, I do not know.\n\nUp to the present, I have received no Return for the June quarter for this school, and do not know if Mr Gauthier did any teaching during June. If he did, it can only have been what school days there were between June 1st and 15th. I expect that the pupils of this school were on annual vacation during the months of April and May as usual.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP. J.

I must say, however, that this paragraph is not exactly clear, as you state that it would be well nigh impossible to secure a teacher for three months, and, at the same time, you suggest that the nomination of the teacher be placed in the hands of Bishop Lajeunesse. Possibly it is your idea that the Department will allow a salary to Reverend Father Dutil for teaching school.\n\nYou might communicate with Bishop Lajeunesse with a view to having him nominate a qualified person to take charge of this school for a three months period during 1938. As soon as you have received his nomination you should let me have full particulars and, at the same time, state what amounts you consider should be allowed. When I receive this information from you, your request will have further careful consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O.

(RG 10, Volume 6236, file 517-1, part 1)\nOttawa,\nJune 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is noted from your letter of the 8th instant that the Island Lake R.C. Indian Day School re-opened on June 3, 1940.\n\nAs you are aware salary for 9 months only is provided in the current year's appropriation for each Indian day school. In other words only 9 months' salary can be paid from April 1, 1940, to March 31, 1941. Consequently if this school were in operation from the time it re-opened until March 31 it would be a 10 month period. However, the teacher will not be paid for 9 months. Consequently the teacher can take one other month's holidays or if he conducts the school he will not be paid for one month. Please let me know which month the school will be closed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. G.

Consequently the teacher should be paid salary for the month of June. Between now and the end of March, 1941, the school will be closed for another month. I am not exactly certain at the present time which month the school will be closed but as soon as I have definite information you will be advised.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nAugust 14, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of June 19 with reference to the Island Lake R.C.

It will be necessary for it to be closed one additional month before March 31. Please let me know the other month that this school will be closed.\n\nPayment of the teacher's salary for the month of July has been withheld until a definite reply is received from you.

B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to the Island Lake R.C. Indian Day School, my telegram of the 18th instant authorized the employment of Mrs. Blackburn as teacher for the months of April, May and June. I enclose the necessary forms which she should complete and return.\n\nIt has been brought to our attention that the attendance at this school is so large that the services of a second teacher are actually necessary. We do not appear to have received the December quarter return from this school and consequently are not aware of the number of children attending at the present time. The September quarter return showed an enrolment of 69, and this number is actually too large for one teacher. However, there is not much use in employing a second teacher unless a second room is available. We do not favour two teachers in one classroom.\n\nIf there is another room available and you consider a second classroom should be opened, you may do so, and in that event Miss Martha Lauze should be employed as assistant teacher for the months of April, May and June. If you engage her, it will be necessary to receive the required forms for her and I enclose a set of these. At the same time, you should let me know her age, qualifications and experience.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, April 10, 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nArrangements are being made for a second classroom at the Island Lake R.C.

However, we will not employ the latter until we have the new classroom in shape. Am I to understand that the services of these two ladies will be available for the academic year 1946-47?

It was one of the few human documents I have ever received from the Indian Affairs Branch. I have just concluded a hurried tour of my Empire and speaking generally things are going along pretty well.\n\nI was unable to inspect the God's Lake U.C. Day School at the Narrows as, in spite of -40 below zero, there was open water in front of the mission and poor ice for a considerable distance beyond that. There was a strong north wind blowing and the snow was too deep for walking. However I saw Mr Howard Gibson who came out with a dog team to the plains. He will be back and has been forbidden by the Indians to continue teaching but Mr Gibson will carry on. At the first opportunity I will get him documented, but in the meantime please continue to have cheques sent to Mrs Gibson as cessation of the monthly cheque would involve hardship.\n\nI have already submitted a report on the 3 classrooms at Marla Portage which you will no doubt peruse. They wish to name the 3 classrooms as follows:-\n\nRoom 1 - St Martin\nRoom 2 - St Marius\nRoom 3 - St Louis\n\nAt Cross Lake the new United Church School and Teacherage at Wassegamac is completed with the exception of the blackboards. We have had in several requests for these but they have failed to materialize. I wonder if you could get some action. I sent pictures of these buildings to Col Neary - I hope you saw them.

It would be of little advantage to close school right now for April and May with no assurance of teachers for July and August.

I also had an application from Miss Yvette Roy of St. Jean Baptiste, Manitoba. Miss Roy has a letter of recommendation from Sister Mary Agnes de Jesus, Principal of the St. Jean Baptiste Collegiate. The letter of recommendation reads as follows:\n\n\"This is to certify that Yvette Roy is a girl of good character.

A third teacher, Miss Yvette Roy, is also understood to be available.\n\nI have written to Bishop Lajeunesse in Montreal in order that he might confirm the facts as presented above. In the meantime we will expect to hear further from you with regard to the purchase of Mr. Blackburn's warehouse.

On April 24 1948 I visited Maria Portage and found there had been a mass exodus of the entire Indian population. Every man, woman, child and dog had picked up and departed for the Rat Hunt. I inquired of the teachers as to when this exodus took place and they stated it had started shortly after Easter.\n\nThe 3 teachers are there but there will be no children attending school for April and most of May. They expect the Indians to start returning about the 20th May. This is the 1st time since I took over the Agency that such a situation has arisen and I do not know how to cope with it or what action I should take. I suggested to the teachers that they remain for the month of July to make up for lost time but their replies were non-committal, but I understood from Mrs Blackburn that she intends to leave as soon as the school year closed to join her husband who has now started a business in the vicinity of Ottawa, at Meach Lake I believe. I have heard no further word from Bishop Lajeunesse with regard to the installation of the Grey Nuns. The 2 teachers Misses Martha & Denise Lauze expressed a wish to teach at Maria Portage for another year. I told them this would be contingent upon the decision reached between Bishop Lajeunesse and yourself. It is evident that a decision of some kind should be reached shortly, otherwise we are liable to find ourselves without teachers for these 3 classrooms at the commencement of the next academic year.\n\nMiss M. Lauze - age 30\nMiss D. Lauze - age 20\nI enclose reports on schools that I have been able to visit recently.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nJune 10, 1948.\n\nMr. E. B.

It is felt that these teachers should be willing to at least teach a part of the month of July to make up for lost time.\n\nMy letter of June 8 clarifies the other points which you have raised in the letter. We will expect to hear from you further with regard to the future employment of the Misses Lauze.\n\nBernard F.

Before making any definite arrangements with regard to the appointment of these teachers, it would be appreciated if we could have your recommendations as to the following:-\n\n(1) The months during which this school should be closed for annual holidays.\n\n(2) The number of teachers who should be employed on a full time basis at this school.\n\n(3) The number of teachers who should be employed on a part time basis at this school.\n\nIn view of past correspondence it is presumed\nthat at least two teachers should be employed on a full time basis and one teacher on a part time basis. However, in view of your knowledge of local conditions, we will defer any action until we hear from you.\n\nBernard T. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJuly 5, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. T. H. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nReference your 470-2-3 of June 30 -\n\nWe are conducting two day schools on the Island Lake Reserve,-\n\n(1) Maria Portage. Last winter we conducted a three-room school at Maria Portage and had an attendance of some 90 children.\n\nWe employed 3 lay teachers and I understand that everyone was pleased with the results of their efforts. Next winter we will have three qualified teachers from an Order of teaching Sisters. We have just completed arrangements for taking over a trader's store at Island Lake which can be converted for use as an additional classroom.\n\n(2) Garden Hill. Here we have operated a one-room United Church Day School. We have had a teacher there for some years now but were unable to get one for the last academic year (1947-48). However, we are now building a new school with attached teacherage at Island Lake and we feel that we will be in a position to interest a teacher in view of the better accommodation being offered.\n\nHowever, we would point out that it is becoming increasingly difficult to interest teachers in going to isolated Indian reserves, particularly where there are no facilities for entertainment and social contacts.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Mr Davis, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for Manitoba, visited Maria Portage while we were paying Tweaty at Island Lake and is dealing direct with the Department on the matter of the purchase of Warehouse which belongs to Mr J E Blackburn. The building which was used as a third classroom during the last 6 months by the Indian Department belonged to the R.C. Mission and is being converted into living quarters for the Fathers and Brothers stationed at Island Lake and will not be available. Until such time as it is known as to the action taken on the warehouse owned by Mr J.E. Blackburn, only 2 classrooms will be available on a full-time basis at Maria Portage. Two teachers therefore should be employed on a full-time basis.\n\n3.

Only one of them is entitled to a salary, as the other will teach to the pupils of the Residential school.\n\nThere are three teaching Sisters at Island Lake: Sister Gouin, Sister Mary Christine and Sister Pouliot. All of them, at different dates, have already been teachers at Norway House.\n\nIn my letter of September 8th, I was advising you that Sister Pouliot had been granted a permit by the Department of Education of Manitoba, because of the following statement in your letter of June 8th (File 123-12-1) to Sister Pouliot: \"You would be entitled to a higher salary classification if you held a teaching certificate granted by a Provincial Department of Education.\"\n\nThree classes have been opened at Island Lake with a total of 95 children.

Day Schools.\n\nThe teachers at Island Lake are entitled to the following salaries and classifications:\n\n(a) Sister Mary Christine - Grade 2 $1920.\n(b) Sister Pouliot - Grade 1 $1320.\n(c) Sister Gouin - Grade 1 $1080.\n\nAll the above salaries are effective September 1, 1948 and are for the academic year of ten months. I am pleased to note that Sister Pouliot has a teaching permit for the Province of Manitoba. Unfortunately this is not a Teaching Certificate and is only permission or authority to teach in the Schools of Manitoba. Our salary regulations require that a regular Teacher's Certificate based on attendance at Normal School during a regular session, be obtained before we can grant classification as a Grade 2 or Grade 3 teacher.\n\nAt the Jack River School, we have requested our Chief Treasury Officer to forward a salary cheque monthly to Sister St. Hubert who will be teaching the day school pupils. She has been classified as a Grade 3 teacher at a salary of $1800 an academic year, effective Sept. 1, 1948.\nI hope that my letter will clarify the points raised in your letter as well as your communication dispelled the doubts in our minds concerning the whereabouts of these teachers.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

There is no compensation being paid to her for this work. I think that something might be done by the Department in this matter, as it is hardly fair to ask this Reverend Sister to spend so much time doing work which is beyond her duties as a teacher.\n\nYou might wish to place this case before your Manitoba Inspector as well as the local Agent. I am sure that they will want to approve an expenditure for this purpose.\n\nI have also written His Excellency Bishop Lajeunesse regarding the lumber and shingles that will be needed for the erection of the teacheerge and I have asked him to set a price for both. I am under the impression that the saw-mill which the mission has at Island Lake can prepare all the rough lumber and some of the finished product that are necessary for this new building.\n\nAs soon as I have received an answer, I shall write to you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, o.m.i.\nDecember 4, 1948.\n\nMr. F.M. Hughes,\nActing Superintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nNorway House, Man.,\n\nIsland Lake R.C. Day School.\n\nAt the present time we are employing three teachers at this school. They are:\n\n(1) Sister Mary Christine, Grade 2, $1920. an academic year\n(2) Sister Pouliot, Grade 1, $1320. an academic year\n(3) Sister Gouin, Grade 1, $1080. an academic year\n\nWe have now received representations that one of these teachers should be classified as a Welfare Teacher. We are advised that one of the Sisters spends all her free time distributing medicines and visiting sick Indians on the Maria Reserve.\n\nYour comments in this regard would be appreciated.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBPN/HM.\nNorway House, Manitoba\n6 January 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nI have your letter 517-1 E of December 14th advising the ratings of the three teachers at our Island Lake R.C. Day School. In your second paragraph you state that you have received representation that one of these teachers should be classified as a Welfare Teacher. You also state that none of them spends all her free time distributing medicines and visiting the sick at Maria Portage.\n\nI am not too familiar with conditions at Maria Portage but understood that no stock of drugs was being kept at this point since the Department opened the new nursing station, and a registered nurse has been installed in the Garden Hill area of Island Lake. I will be visiting Island Lake shortly and will take up the question with our assistant agent, Father Fleury and Dr Corrigan. On my return I will write you further and will be in a better position to express an opinion as to the necessity of a Welfare Teacher at this point.\n\nF.M.

This will make the total salary allowed him from that date at the rate of $90 per teaching month. Mr. Biledieu has been so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nWm.

I find, on further inquiry, that the returns from these schools did not reach the Department until about the 9th ultimo, at which time our Vote was exhausted. Payment of these salaries will be made about April 1st. At that time, arrangements will also be made to forward an additional amount in lieu of per capita grant in connection with the Cross Lake Residential School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Bilodeau, teacher of the Roman Catholic Day School at Island Lake, has been lost.\n\nI handed this cheque to Rev. H. Boissin, in charge of the R.C. Mission at Norway House, as the Mission was sending freight teams in to Island Lake. The cheque was intrusted to the care of one of the Brothers of the Mission. On reaching Island Lake he found that it was gone. There are very few people travelling this road, and almost all of these are Indians, who would, should they find it, turn it in.\n\nIt is possible that I may be in error in the number of the cheque. The number given above is the latest of which I have record. It is possible, however, that I might have handed the cheque to Father Boissin in the envelope in which it was received by me, and that the accompanying slip might have gone with the cheque. If a later cheque was issued, say in January, that would probably be the cheque, if forwarded in my care.\n\nOf course Mr. Bilodeau is very anxious about the loss of the cheque, especially as he has a family to support, and the cost of living at Island Lake is very high. Would it be possible for the Department to duplicate this cheque? Should the original be found, we will return it to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm.

March 18th 1933\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI certainly dislike very much to have to write to the Department to settle a question I thought could have been settled through the Indian agent long ago; but as the matter has been delayed long enough I refer it to you.\n\nWhen I first came here as teacher for the R.C. Indian Day-school; my cheques were sent to me through the office of Indian agent at Norway House who generally passed them over to Fr. H. Boisson of the R.C. Mission at Norway House, who then sent them to me by first opportunity. As many times cheques were delayed too long I requested the Department to make all my cheques payable to Fr. M. Lapineuse or the R.C. Diocese of Keewatin. The last cheque I received through the R.C. Mission of Norway House was cheque No. 2454 for June Quarter 1931 which I endorsed in favor of Fr. Lapineuse (end of December 1931).\nIn April 1932, Brother J. Gosselin of Island Lake returning from Norway House told me that Mr. Boisson of the R.C. Mission had given him a letter with cheque from the Department to me, enclosed. The letter and contents were lost or most likely stolen with some of his clothes from his suitcase on the road. As soon as he noticed the fact he sent word to Mr. Boisson telling him to notify the agent and have the cheque stopped at any bank.\n\nAt treaty time July 1932 we had not heard anything yet about it; nothing had been found; I could not see the agent myself but Mr. Dubois of the Island Lake Mission asked him about it, but he did not seem to know or have heard anything. I have received word from Mr. Lapajouesse that the first cheque he received for me was drawn in favor of the R.C. Diocese of Red River for the month of September 1931 and increase of salary for 6 months from January 1931.\n\nIf you look up the matter you will find out that the cheque for payment of summer months July and August 1931 was never returned or if so never endorsed by me or other person authorized. I hope these informations will help you in settling a question which has called for an answer long ago. As I did not get notice and from Mr. Lapajouesse about cheques since June quarter 1932, would you kindly while looking up cheques see if my mistake of not sending return for July and August 1932 on separate forms from September, has caused any error. Thanks for your trouble. Yours sincerely,\n\nJ. Rosalie Bilodeau, Island Lake, Man.\nOttawa, June 21st, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 18th instant, I beg to say that, on several occasions in the past two years, the Department has been requested by Mr. Agent Gordon to ascertain if any of your salary cheques remained outstanding.\n\nVery careful inquiries have been made on each occasion and it has been ascertained that you have received and endorsed all your cheques.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have started teaching here at Island Lake last July 1935 and my first cheque was dated September 1935. So far in all I received only eight cheques thus placing me in an embarrassing position for board and lodging arrangements as two cheques are not yet settled. For a prompt settlement in this matter, I would be very grateful.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nAristide A. Gauthier,\nSchool Master.\nOttawa, August 14, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo, in connection with your salary as teacher of the Island Lake R. C. Indian Day School, the Department understood that you began duties on September first, 1935. That would mean that you would complete one year's service on August 31st, 1936.\n\nThe academic year consists of ten months and you are allowed salary at the rate of $90 a teaching month, or $900.00 for the academic year.\n\nThis is the first year that the two months' annual holidays at the Island Lake R. C. School have been taken during the months of April and May. The teacher who preceded you at this school taught until the end of June, 1935, and was paid until that time.\n\nAs stated above, only ten months' salary can be allowed during each year, and you have been paid salary for the months of September, October, November, December, 1935, also January, February, March, June and July, 1936. You will also be forwarded a cheque at the end of August, 1936. Consequently, by the end of August, you will have been paid your full yearly salary of $900.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nAristide Gauthier, Esq.,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nIsland Lake, Man.\nIndian Day School\nIsland Lake, Man\nAugust 1st, 1936.\n\nI am sorry to find in your letter concerning my salary coming short of two cheques which I have not received. They are of September and July and August 1935.\n\nOf course in this region we have our vacations in April and May. So far I have received the cheques of the following months: September, October, November and December of 1935, January, February, March and June 1936; in all eight cheques.\n\nPlease see that I receive the balance as soon as possible, as I am in great need, everything is so dear up here.\n\nYours thankfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, I was told when I was hired last spring that I should begin teaching from July, which I did when I arrived and which is shown in your pay stubs that you should have sent me back to verify. Furthermore, I sent my first quarterly report and had no official receipt for it. I sent two reports to the agent. The last one was never written up. Now I have a letter from him in which he tells me to fill in my report on regular paper or else I will not get paid. I understand that if the agent had right to get my report and the school was teaching in July and August, he would have right to get paid for my work.\n\nBesides, when ever on your paper\nfrom now. I should like to go and teach in civilization. It would be difficult to pack up and travel down south carrying on the end of August and start teaching in the beginning of September.\n\nI know there was a great misunderstanding about this matter; still I have two months of sickness account for which I did not get paid as expected last year and understand how hard living is truly high (for example, $40 for a bag of flour).\n\nPlease consider the matter seriously again as we people living in the far North need help and encouragement. Hoping to meet with favorable demand, I am, as ever, with thanks in anticipation.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher.\nApril 12, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nRe: School No. 517 & No. 516.\n\nThe annual two months' holidays at the Island Lake R.

Mr. Lazenby is the Agent in charge of this district, located at Norway House, and I am of the impression that the returns required should be sent to Father Dutil by Mr. Lazenby and returned to him to be forwarded to the Department.\n\nIt seems to me the building at this point can be handled to much better advantage by the Indian Agent who is responsible for the agency. All vouchers naturally, should pass through his office, and I would like to suggest, if it meets with your approval, that I forward a copy of your letter together with the forms, to the Indian Agent who will in turn deal with Father Dutil in connection with the building of the school.\n\nMr. Lazenby will be at Island Lake paying treaty on July 23 and 26, and this will allow a good opportunity to report on the work and to see that the forms have been properly filled out as requested. Kindly reply by return mail if this arrangement meets with your approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nT.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6236, file 517-5, part 1)\nNo start has been made on the erection of the new school building at the R.C. Mission, which has been authorized, although they had all the materials, which were furnished by the department and shipped in from Winnipeg. However, the Rev. M. Dutil, who is the priest in charge, stated that they would have the building completed in two months.\n\nP. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 15, 1938.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch was in correspondence some months ago with Rev. Father Dutil, O.M.I., Island Lake, in connection with the erection of a new school at that point. Material to the value of $580.00 was forwarded and the Surveys & Engineering Branch also sent an advance for wages. They have written several letters within the last couple of months but have been unable to obtain any reply and are, therefore, not aware whether or not the school has been built. The last report we have on the matter is in Indian Agent Lazenby's report for the month of July in which he stated that at that time work had not commenced although Father Dutil told him that the building would be completed for the end of September.\n\nI do not like to bother you unnecessarily but we would certainly appreciate it if Father Dutil would correspond either with us or with the Surveys & Engineering Branch and if the building has been completed a detailed statement should be forwarded showing how the money has been expended.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Father Dutil. In his answer he informs me that he will send you shortly a detailed account of what has been done with the money supplied to him by the Department. One of the Lay Brothers who worked on the erection of the new school at Island Lake informs me that the building, less painting, has been completed and that school has been taught in it since November the 2nd 1938.\n\nPlease let me know if Father Dutil fails to send his report to the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Day School\n\nWhile at Theresa Point, Island Lake on Mar 11th, I inspected the school building, which is too small to accommodate the children of this community.\n\nThe present school building has an unfinished upstairs, which could be converted into a classroom of approximately 15' X 24' with an 8' ceiling, which would make a temporary classroom. The material and labor would cost $243.50 and the material supplied locally. If the construction of this classroom should be approved, a second teacher would be required, for whom board and lodging is available. As it is unlikely that any new school can be built at Island Lake prior to the summer of 1947, I recommend that this scheme be given consideration; the building is in good condition, and should a second school eventually be built, the upstairs could readily be converted at little expense into living quarters for a teacher. I submit herewith an estimate of the material and labor:\n\n| Item       | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Flooring   | 600 ft.  | $75.00 per ft. | $45.00 |\n| Walls      | 1500 \"   | $65.00 \"    | $97.50 |\n| Stairs     | 500 \"    | $65.00 \"    | $32.50 |\n| Paper      |          |            | $15.00 |\n| Nails      | 25 lbs   |            | $5.00  |\n| Gals paint |          |            | $18.00 |\n| 20 days work one man | | | $50.00 |\n\nTotal $243.50\n\nE.B.

In making the proposed change in the building, care should be taken to make certain that there is a proper exit in case of fire.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n5th February 1946\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIn Account with R.C.M.

The December quarterly return to which you refer, was forwarded to you as soon as it was received in this office which was the 21st day of March, 1946. With regard to the second classroom to which you refer in your letter of March 27th in paragraph 3, there is such a room available but it needs finishing. It is on the 2nd floor above the existing classroom and has been inspected by both Dr Corrigan and myself. This room, before it can be used, will require finishing. The estimated cost $243.50 was submitted to you in a letter from me dated Mar 19, 1946 in which I submitted details of the estimate.\n\nMay authority be granted for this project. All the materials required are on hand at Maria Portage. As our communications by mail are now severed until early in June, a reply by wire would be appreciated.\n\nI would like to point out that our official mail service terminated for the break-up period, Mar 29th and will not be resumed until the opening of navigation early in June.\n\nThis letter is going out by courtesy of a pilot who landed here unexpectedly.\n\nE.

What supervision would be required. If supervisor does not return to Island Lake, could Nackaway handle supervision logging operations in winter and sawing operations in summer or should attempt be made to find experienced foreman. What equipment such as axes, saws, etc., would it be necessary to furnish.

There are no desks for the second classroom and the pupils are using homemade benches and tables and there are no teachers' desks or chairs for either classroom. I requested Mrs Blackburn the senior teacher to submit forthwith a requisition for whatever is required. The attendance of this school has been good and the pupils were well-clothed and neat and clean.\n\nWhile at Island Lake I also visited the U.C. Mission. There was 1 pupil at the school and I told the teacher that he had better get busy and round up his flock. He explained to me that they had all moved out to do their fall fishing but he expected them back at the end of the week.\n\nE.B.

Hamilton Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies, 538 Dominion Public Bldg, Winnipeg\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter d/Mar\n18th 1947 file 207-11 A.G.\n\nI have already written the Department in this connection and have pointed out that it is quite impossible to build item 3, Island Lake R.C. 1 room day school and residence this year and I have suggested that the appropriation of $8000.00 be expended for building material for 2 schools and 2 residences and that the materials be collected and warehouses at Oxford and shipped in by next winter's tractor freight and that a similar appropriation next year be used for the construction of 1 day school and 1 residence R.C. Island Lake and 1 school and 1 residence U.C. Oxford House or any other denomination or any other place where they see fit.\n\nThere is no-one in this country that I know of who can take on this work on a contract. There are 2 or 3 fairly good self taught carpenters whom to date I have been unable to contact as they are away at the Rat Hunt. There is enough local labour to do the proper supervision. I have already submitted requisitions to Ottawa for building supplies needed for construction of items 1 and 2 in your letter. I will go ahead with this program and do the best I can with whatever unskilled self-taught native artisans I can command.\n\nIf you know of anyone in Winnipeg who would be willing to come out and supervise this work for the summer, it would be appreciated if you could obtain his services and let me know. In any event apart from the excavation of basements, no work of construction can go forward until supplies arrive by boat from Winnipeg. I figure on supplying the lumber locally.\n\nE.B.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 27, 1947 file 123-12-5(WT1).\n\nI was at Maria Portage last Sunday morning. As no-one was around I walked through the school building and examined both classrooms. The Junior classroom had every appearance of not having been in use for days; dust lay thick and undisturbed on all the desks including the teachers', and the register had not been entered since September. Later in the day I had a talk with Father Fleury, parishioner in charge and he told me that the classroom had not been in use for a week as the attendance had fallen off owing to the departure of many families for fall fishing. I discussed with him the opening of a 3rd classroom and he informed me that it would only be worth while for 6 months of the year, the same being September, January, February, March, April, June. He stated that he was quite willing to rent to the branch the Parish Hall for a small nominal fee, which he would not at the time name.\n\nIn the 3rd para of your letter you state the Department is requested to accept the services of Miss Martha Laune as teacher of the 3rd classroom. Miss Martha Laune is already employed as a teacher by the branch in the 2nd classroom above referred to. Her sister Denise is employed by Mrs Blackburn to instruct her child Mark but I understand from Father Fleury that she would be available at any time to teach the 3rd classroom if it is open.\n\nAs there was no immediate need in having the Staff Questionsirre and T.D.I filled, I used them for Mr. Toole, teacher of the C of J Jack River School. Will you please therefore, send me some more blank forms.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 18, 1947.\n\nMr. E.B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to the Island Lake R.C. School. In view of the information contained in the first paragraph of your letter, there is no necessity for opening the third class room at the present time.\n\nDo you consider it advisable to open a third class room during the months of January, February, March and June, 1943? Before authorizing the opening of a third class room we would like to be definitely assured that there would be sufficient attendance to justify the services of a third teacher.\n\nIt occurred to us that possibly the Sub Agent, Mr. Stevenson could visit this school monthly and let us know the number of children in attendance.\n\nBernard F.

Goodman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nIsland Lake N.C., Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 9-ii (123) of 16 April\n\nI have for answer your above letter and note your comments with regard to the Blackburn warehouse.\n\nI have this afternoon had an interview with Bishop Lajeunesse and he advises me that he has definitely made arrangements for Sisters to take over the Island Lake School. I understand that Sister Christine from Jack River and Sister Pouliot, formerly at Jack River, will be moved to Island Lake to take over the new school. The Bishop is quite prepared to have these Sisters live in the Rectory this winter and to wait until next summer to build them a proper teachersage.\n\nHe is entirely in agreement with you about the Blackburn warehouse and feels also that it would be more advisable to erect a proper teachersage rather than to convert a makeshift building.\n\nHowever, he has drawn to our attention the need for a third classroom at Island Lake and has suggested the possibility that Mr. Blackburn's warehouse could be converted quite easily for such a use. If you concur in this recommendation I would like to be advised so that I can make a firm offer to Mr. Blackburn. I had intended to suggest to him the sum of $2,000.00 (if you agree). I advised the Bishop that\nno funds had been provided in this year's estimates for the construction of such a teacherage but that we would endeavour to secure sufficient funds to purchase the building materials for shipping in this winter. I understand that we can buy lumber from the R. C. mill at Island Lake at a very reasonable cost. Therefore, I am returning to you the bill of materials, so that the lumber which can be supplied from the R. C. mill can be deleted. We will then have on hand a bill of materials for outside purchase. If you could do this deletion and return the bill here we can begin to negotiate for the purchase of the remaining requirements.\n\nI understand that Brother Boucher will be nominated by Bishop Lajeunesse for the construction of this teacherage.\n\nIt will not be possible for the Sisters to report to Island Lake until the middle of August. Therefore I would suggest that the school term re-open on 1 September, 1948.\n\nBernard E.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n8 June 1948.\n\nEducation Division, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nAttention: Mr B.F. Heary\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of May 20th 1948 file 123-12-5 and 123-12-6 re Island Lake R.C. Indian Day School with regard to the purchase of the Blackburn warehouse for conversion into a 3rd classroom. The figure of $2,000.00 which you mention as payment for this building is in my opinion a generous offer and should be satisfactory to Mr Blackburn. I have thought from the first that his assessment of the building at $2,600.00 was extremely high.\n\nWith regard to the bill of material for the proposed teacherage I will go through this carefully and eliminate material which we can provide locally from our own mill at Island Lake. I will submit this at an early date.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nOttawa, June 24, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIsland Lake R. C. Indian Day School.\n\nAt Island Lake we have two separate Indian settlements, one at Maria Portage and the other some 10 miles away at Garden Hill. At Maria Portage we have a day school which has now grown to three classrooms with an attendance of nearly 100 pupils. We have never had a teachers' residence at this point but have rented a small house from the R. C. Missionaries for use by the teachers.\n\nUnfortunately, this teachers' residence was burned on December 11. Arrangements have had to be made to house the three teachers temporarily accommodated in the Priest's residence. The Priest and the brothers have moved out to a small shack in order to permit this arrangement.\n\nWe have had some correspondence with Mr. Indian Superintendent Goodman with regard to the purchase of a ware-house from Mr. Blackburn, who was a free trader at Maria Portage. Mr. Blackburn erected this ware-house in September 1946. You will find enclosed a complete description of this ware-house as submitted by Mr. W. L. Stevenson, Assistant Indian Agent at Island Lake. There is little doubt about the fact that this building is well constructed and could be quite easily adapted for use as a teacher's residence.\n\nMr. John Blackburn, who was at one time one of our day school teachers, recently visited the department and offered to sell this building to the Department at cost less the amount which was received from the insurance company for scouring which it obtained in the fire. This building cost $2,600.00 and he\nreceived $200.00 from the insurance company. Mr. Indian Superintendent Goodman has recommended the purchase of this building at the price of $2,000.00. Mr. Blackburn has indicated that he is willing to accept this price.\n\nIn addition to the purchase of the building, Mr. Goodman has also recommended that we purchase the following furniture which Mr. Blackburn has available at Island Lake:\n\n(a) Chesterfield and chair (good quality).\n(b) Dining room suite consisting of table, end tables, 5 chairs and buffet.\n(c) Kitchen table.\n(d) Ice-box\n(e) Gasoline washer, in good condition.\n(f) Knives, forks and cutlery.\n\nOther incidentals.\n\nMr. Blackburn has priced these items of furniture at $500.00 and Mr. Goodman has recommended their purchase at this price.\n\nThis will provide us with three classrooms at Island Lake and with some of the furniture required for the teacherage. It will not solve the problem of teacher's accommodation. Fortunately, Bishop Lajeunesse has offered the use of the Priests' residence for the three Sisters who will teach there next year. The Priest will live in a small shed during the winter in order to accommodate the teachers.\n\nIt will be necessary to ship in building supplies for a teachers' residence during the winter but this will be the subject of a further memorandum.\n\n..... In the\nIn the meantime it is recommended that approval be given to the following expenditures:\n\n(a) The purchase of Mr. Blackburn's store-house for the sum of $2,000.00.\n\n(b) The purchase of Mr. Blackburn's furniture as listed, for the sum of $500.00.\n\nDirector.\nExtract from requisition dated April 14th,\nfrom the teacher of the Island Lake R.C.\nIndian Day School.\n\nThe Teacher requests:\n\n12 Combs,\ncase Toilet soap,\n36 bars Wash Soap,\n4 Wash basins,\n6 Brooms\n3 Self-wringing floor mops,\n6 Nail brushes,\n4 doz.

I inspected this building and the size is about 30 x 24. It is built of one ply rough lumber; the floor is also rough lumber, and is on a foundation which is just posts. It has one door, but no windows or ceiling, and the studding is 2 x 6. I do not consider this building is worth $2,000.00, and would suggest around $1,000.00 would be a good price for it.\n\nTo remodel this into a school will be fairly expensive, as a chimney has to be put in, sheeted and insulated, also windows. It is very doubtful if we can get this material in at this time of year. However, in the event of purchasing, if the mill can turn out enough material, it could be sheeted with our own lumber and papered on the inside and insulated.\n\nI would recommend that the Department take up with the Bishop the matter of using half of the Hall. At present half of this building has been fixed over as a Priests' residence, as the Sisters are going to live in their present quarters. This building would also need some remodelling, but this could be done by them and rent paid to the Church which would be high\nenough to cover any alterations that would be necessary. The Sisters from Norway House will be moved in August, and we should take action as soon as possible to get matters straightened up.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

C. Indian Day School.\n\nAt Island Lake we have two separate Indian settlements, one at Maria Portage and the other some 10 miles away at Garden Hill. At Maria Portage we have a day school which has now grown to three classrooms with an attendance of nearly 100 pupils. We have never had a teacherage at this point but have rented a small house from the R. C. Missionaries for use by the teachers.\n\nUnfortunately, this teacherage was burned on December 11. Arrangements have had to be made to have the three teachers temporarily accommodated in the Priest's residence. The Priest and the Brothers have moved out to a small shack in order to permit this arrangement.\n\nWe have had some correspondence with Mr. Indian Superintendent Goodman with regard to the purchase of a ware-house from Mr. Blackburn, who was a free trader at Maria Portage. Mr. Blackburn erected this ware-house in September 1946. You will find attached a complete description of this ware-house as submitted by Mr. R. L. Stevenson, our Assistant Indian Agent at Island Lake. There is little doubt about the fact that this building is well constructed and could be quite easily adapted for use as a teacher's residence.\n\nMr. John Blackburn, who was at one time one of our day school teachers, recently visited the Department and offered to sell this building to the Department at cost less the amount which was received from the insurance company for scorching which it obtained in the fire. This building cost $2,600.00 and he\nreceived $200.00 from the insurance company. Mr. Indian Superintendent Goodman has recommended the purchase of this building at the price of $2,000.00. Mr. Blackburn has indicated that he is willing to accept this price.\n\nIn addition to the purchase of the building, Mr. Goodman has also recommended that we purchase the following furniture which Mr. Blackburn has available at Island Lake:\n\n(a) Chesterfield and chair (good quality).\n(b) Dining room suite consisting of table, end tables, 5 chairs and buffet.\n(c) Kitchen table.\n(d) Ice-box\n(e) Gasoline washer, in good condition.\n(f) Knives, forks and cutlery.\n\nOther incidentals.\n\nMr. Blackburn has priced these items of furniture at $500.00 and Mr. Goodman has recommended their purchase at this price.\n\nThis will provide us with three classrooms at Island Lake and with some of the furniture required for the teacherage. It will not solve the problem of teacher's accommodation. Fortunately, Bishop Lajeunesse has offered the use of the Priests' residence for the three Sisters who will teach there next year. The Priest will live in a small shed during the winter in order to accommodate the teachers.\n\nIt will be necessary to ship in building supplies for a teachers' residence during the winter but this will be the subject of a further memorandum.\n\n..... In the\nIn the meantime it is recommended that approval be given to the following expenditures:\n\n(a) The purchase of Mr. Blackburn's store-house for the sum of $2,000.00.\n\n(b) The purchase of Mr. Blackburn's furniture as listed, for the sum of $500.00.\n\nApproved,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nHull, Que.,\n16th July, 1948\n\nMr. Neary, Superintendent,\nEducation Branch,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is to certify that I built and presently own the following property at Island Lake, Manitoba.\n\n1 One storey frame building measuring 24 feet by 30 feet.\nWalls are nine feet high.\nAll studdings, rafters and cross beans are of 2 x 6\".\nThe cellar, 14 x 16 feet, 8\u00bd feet deep, is walled by 4 x 6\".\nThe roof is of extra heavy roofing paper.\nThe following furniture is stored in the above building:\n\nI hereby declare that both building and furniture are clear of all encumbrance and this can be considered as a clear title declaration.\n\nJ.

Dept. I just received a letter telling me that all the accounts had been forwarded to you on Nov. 22nd inoucher #1081.\n\nWill you kindly see that this is paid at your earliest convenience.\n\nThe address is - St. Norbert, Man.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. E. Blackburn.\nISLAND LAKE, Manitoba.\n\nThe information which we have available does not indicate that the provision of this school should be given any immediate priority. A day school (now three rooms) has operated successfully at Maria Portage for some years. There has been some competition evident between the two denominations working in this area. As I have previously intimated to you, I had hoped that the United Church would not press for the rebuilding of the Norway House Residential School but would have been satisfied with the erection of day schools on the various reserves. However, with the preparation of a petition from the Roman Catholic Missionary of Island Lake, we were soon advised that the United Church would press for the rebuilding of the Norway House Residential School. Unfortunately, there have been instances in the past of the Churches using residential schools as a means of proselytizing the Indians and it would seem that care will have to be taken in determining the exact educational needs of these Indians.\n\nAn educational survey committee is therefore recommended in this area also. For its composition I would suggest the following members be considered:\n\n(a) Mr. A. J. Doucet, Supervisor of Vocational Training, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\n(b) Provincial School Inspector nominated by the Manitoba Department of Education.\n\n(c) Roman Catholic Missionary nominated by the Oblate Order.\nOttawa, March 28, 1949.\n\nMr. F.M.

Sisters in charge of the above school have found it necessary to purchase a piano for training the children of the school in singing and music in general. They have paid $150.00 for it and would appreciate a refund at least in part of this amount.\n\nThe Rev. Sisters have given the noon-day meal to all the children of the school from Nov. to March and would like to be compensated for this service. I am given to understand that the Department has allowed $15.00 per class per month. The amount due then would be $225.90\n\nThe Sisters are in need of six sheets of veneer 4'x 8'x 3/8\".

School. This motor was to operate a pump which you furnished on order from our Purchasing Department No. 28312.\n\nThe motor supplied for this pump was 110 volts A.C. This school is serviced by a 32 volt D.C. Hence the necessity of exchanging the 110 HP motor for a 32 HP motor. This motor should be forwarded to the following address:\n\nMr. J. Staunton,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nIlford, Manitoba.\n\nWe appreciate the fact that you are willing to exchange this motor. We understand that there will be an extra charge of somewhere around $20.00. Kindly send the bill for this motor to this office in duplicate.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

We have arranged to have the correct motor forwarded to this school. On the recommendation of Regional Supervisor Davis, it will be sent to you, as Mr. Davis stated the pump could be taken into Island Lake when Treaty Payments are being made.\n\nThe pump already at the school could be brought out at the same time, if it has not been used, and we will give you instructions at a later date regarding the address to which it should be shipped.\n\nBernard F.

Please let me know if the teacher's residence at this point is owned by the Church authorities or by the Department. If it is owned by the former, you should state what rent you consider might be allowed.\n\nI wish, also, to direct your attention to official letter of May 18th, last, to which no reply has yet been received. Please let me have an estimate of the cost of providing a new school at this point.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher is paid a good salary at this point, and I am of the opinion that he should be expected to pay his own personal expenses from his salary, as other teachers have to do. However, if the Department feels that this teacher's rent should be paid, I consider that $8.00 per month would be a fair rental.\n\nWith reference to the matter of erecting a new school building, as mentioned in the final paragraph of the above mentioned Departmental letter, I beg to say that this is being dealt with in a separate letter of this date.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 517-8, part 1)\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 15, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the request received for rent for the building occupied by the teacher of the Island Lake R. C. Indian Day School.\n\nAs you are aware, the salary of the teacher of the Island Lake R. C. School is $90 a month, while the salary of the teacher of the Island Lake U. C. School is $100 a month. The latter teacher is supplied a residence by the United Church authorities. Possibly this is due to his acting as United Church missionary. Please let me know if such is the case. If so, the Department is inclined to allow something for rent for the residence of the teacher of the R. C. School, but it is considered that possibly $75 a year would be sufficient.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. G.

Nutch, the teacher of the United Church Indian Day School at the Island Lake Reserve, is not acting as United Church Missionary at this reserve, but as day school teacher only.\n\nMr. Gavin H. Grieve is the United Church Missionary, and Mr. Nutch is boarding with him and paying, I understand, $22.00 per month for his board, out of his salary of $100.00 per month as teacher.

Indian Day School.\n\nIn my letter dated 16th December 1947 under file 17-A, I informed you of the destruction by fire of the R.C. Mission, Maria Portage, on December 11th. This building was used as a teacherage for the R.C. Day School, and for its use the Department paid rent. The teachers, Mrs. Blackburn and Miss Martha Lauze, have been temporarily accommodated in the Priests house.\n\nOn December 17th I received the following wire from Assistant Agent R. L. Stevenson:\n\n\"BLACKBURN WILL SELL WAREHOUSE FOR TEACHERAGE TWENTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS/WOULD REQUIRE FLOORING WALLBOARD NAILS/TWENTY EIGHT FT.

I have never observed the premises with a view to converting it into a dwelling, but it seems to me it would require additional doors, windows and other materials. I do not feel justified in making a recommendation with regard to any purchase until I have made a thorough inspection, but from recollection the price seems high. I wired on December 15th for authority to fly to Island Lake, but to date have received no reply.\n\nI recommend the purchase of the household furnishings and equipment as listed and at price requested, $500.00, but this again would be contingent upon our acquisition of the warehouse for a teacherage. I will write you again as soon as I have made an inspection of the building in question. There is an urgency in the housing of these people which might outweigh to some extent the consideration of the exact valuation.\n\nE. B.

I enclose a sketch indicating the proposed adjustment.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, I would not recommend the purchase of this building but since it is imperative that we find living accommodation for the teachers as soon as possible, I suggest that we buy the building from Mr. Blackburn. The price he asks is $2,600.00 but since 1 side was scotched and charred he will deduct from the purchase price, the allowance made by the Insurance Co., which he expects will be $300.00 or $2,300.00.\n\nI enclose also a report submitted on the same building by Mr Stevenson. In this report he has omitted to list the windows which would be required and the doors. The following will be required:\n\n- 8 windows - 4 light check rail 14\" x 26\"\n- 8 storm windows to match\n- 2 outside doors 2'4\" x 6'8\"\n- 2 Combination storm doors to match\n- 6 inside doors 2'6\" x 6'5\"\n\nThis material should be shipped immediately to Ilford c/o Mr H.L.

Is Mr. Blackburn still engaged in\nbusiness at Island Lake and would he live in the\nhouse?\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nNorway House, Manitoba\n25 February 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nAttention: Mr Bernard F Neary\nSubject: Maria Portage Indian Day Schools\n\nIn reply to your letter of February 11th 1948 file 123-12-8(EL) as far as I know there will be at least 4 people residing in the Teacherage when it is built. I have been informed verbally by Bishop Lajeunesse through Father Trudeau of Cross Lake that they are sending in 3 or 4 sisters to take over 3 classrooms in the Blackburn's house which Mr Blackburn states will be in July. Mr Blackburn is closing out his business in Island Lake and I do not know his future plans but anyway he will not be living in the house.\n\nI have also been informed by Father Trudeau speaking on behalf of Bishop Lajeunesse that they are prepared to take over the warehouse of Mr Blackburn's and convert it into a residence for the Priest and brothers and that they will provide temporary quarters in the present men's residence for the sisters. The Sisters will be the Order of Grey Nuns, however the whole future set up is in a rather nebulous state and nothing can be done about building a teacherage until the summer of 1949.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 4, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIsland Lake R.C. Indian Day School\n\nAt Island Lake we have two separate Indian settlements, one at Maria Portage and the other some 10 miles away at Garden Hill. At Maria Portage we have a day school which has now grown to three classrooms with an attendance of nearly 100 pupils. We have never had a teacherage at this point but have rented a small house from the R.C. Missionaries for use by the teachers.\n\nUnfortunately, this teacherage was burned on December 11. Arrangements have had to be made to have the three teachers temporarily accommodated in the Priest's residence. The Priest and the Brothers have moved out to a small shack in order to permit this arrangement.\n\nWe have had some correspondence with Mr. Indian Superintendent Goodman with regard to the purchase of a warehouse from Mr. Blackburn, who was a free trader at Maria Portage. Mr. Blackburn erected this warehouse in September 1946. You will find attached a complete description of this warehouse as submitted by Mr. R.L. Stevenson, our Assistant Indian Agent at Island Lake. There is little doubt about the fact that this building is well constructed and could be quite easily adapted for use as a teacher's residence.\n\nMr. John Blackburn, who was at one time one of our day school teachers, recently visited the Department and offered to sell this building to the Department at cost less the amount which was received from the insurance company for scorching which it obtained in the fire. The building cost $2,600 and he received $200 from the insurance company, so the building would cost $2,400. Mr. Indian Superintendent Goodman has recommended\nthe purchase of this building and has submitted a report as to the windows, doors, etc., which would be needed to convert this building from a warehouse to a teacherage. You will note that the building is strongly constructed of 4 x 6 squared timbers with 2 x 8 joists.\n\nIn addition to the purchase of the building, Mr. Goodman has also recommended that we purchase the following furniture which Mr. Blackburn has available at Island Lake:\n\n(a) Chesterfield and chair (good quality)\n(b) Dining room suite consisting of table, end tables, 5 chairs and buffet\n(c) Kitchen table\n(d) Ice box\n(e) Gasoline washer in good condition\n(f) Knives, forks and cutlery,\nOther incidentals.\n\nHe has placed a price on these of $500.\n\nThe only way of reaching Island Lake with supplies is by tractor train during the months of January, February and March. It is understood that the last tractor train has now left for Island Lake and that we will therefore not be able to get in supplies or materials until January 1949. Therefore, it would seem a sound proposal to purchase this building and furniture at these prices. It is understood that Bishop Lajeunesse is prepared to have his Priest and Brothers live in this ware-house and to have the three or four Sisters who are taking over this school next year, live in the Priest's residence until the ware-house - teacherage can be properly fitted up. It is estimated that some $1,600 will be required to convert this ware-house into a teacherage. I would recommend that in view of the very isolated situation at Island Lake you approve the purchase of this building and furniture from Mr. Blackburn at the above prices.\n\nDirector\nQua I, line 2: \"send your mails\" - 9 by air, 10 by water.\n\nI don't see any cheaper alternative to the plan you suggest.\n\nEX'D.\n\nAll indications are that this Indian settlement is likely to last a long time.\n\nsee letter care\n\nsee letter care\nAIRMAL\n\nApril 22, 1948.\n\nMr. E. B. Goodman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nIsland Lake R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nFurther to my letter of April 6, we have now been advised by Mr. Blackburn that Bishop Lajeunesse is having some difficulty in securing the services of teaching Sisters for the above Indian Day School. It is understood that in the event that the Sisters cannot take over the school for 1948-49, the two Laune sisters are willing to stay on. A third teacher, Miss Yvette Roy, is also understood to be available.\n\nI have written to Bishop Lajeunesse in Montreal in order that he might confirm the facts as presented above. In the meantime we will expect to hear further from you with regard to the purchase of Mr. Blackburn's warehouse. It would seem that in either event, we are assured of teachers at Island Lake and that we will have to consider the provision of accommodation for them.\n\nBernard F.

Indian Day School. I have discussed this matter with Father G E Trudeau - Principal Residential School who acted on behalf of Bishop Lajeunesse. Neither he or Bishop Lajeunesse, as I understand it, have any wish that we should take over the Blackburn warehouse and convert it into a teacherage. Bishop Lajeunesse, through Father Trudeau has submitted to me the plan of a building which he desires for a teacherage in the event that the Grey Nuns take over Island Lake. Comparing his plan with the Blackburn Warehouse - the latter is entirely inadequate.\n\nI submit the plan to you for your perusal. I have never been enthusiastic about taking over the Blackburn Warehouse as considerable money would have to be spent on it and when finished it would still be a makeshift building.\n\nThe furniture at $500.00 I think would be a good buy.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nMr. E.B. Goodman, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Norway House, Man.\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th ultimo regarding the Island Lake R.C. School, and it is noted that you do not now recommend purchase of the Blackburn warehouse.\n\nWe have noted your plan for a building that would be suitable for a teacher's residence. Would it be possible to give us an estimate of the cost of the labour in erecting this building. No funds have been specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a teacher's residence at Island Lake and consequently before submitting the matter to the Minister's office we will have to have an idea of the total cost of the proposed building.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nMay 20, 1948.\n\nMr. E. B. Goodman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nIsland Lake R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 9-B (123) of 16 April\n\nI have for answer your above letter and note your comments with regard to the Blackburn warehouse.\n\nI have this afternoon had an interview with Bishop Lajunesse and he advises me that he has definitely made arrangements for Sisters to take over the Island Lake Day School. I understand that Sister Christine from Jack River and Sister Pouliot, formerly at Jack River, will be moved to Island Lake to take over the new school. The Bishop is quite prepared to have these Sisters live in the rectory this winter and to wait until next summer to build them a proper teacherage.\n\nHe is entirely in agreement with you about the Blackburn warehouse and feels also that it would be more advisable to erect a proper teacherage rather than to convert a makeshift building.\n\nHowever, he has drawn to our attention the need for a third classroom at Island Lake. He has suggested the possibility that Mr. Blackburn's warehouse could be converted quite easily for such a use. If you concur in this recommendation I would like to be advised so that I can make a firm offer to Mr. Blackburn. I had intended to suggest to him the sum of $2,000.00 (if you agree). I advised the Bishop that\nno funds had been provided in this year's estimates for the construction of such a teacherage but that we would endeavour to secure sufficient funds to purchase the building materials for shipping in this winter. I understand that we can buy lumber from the R.C. mill at Island Lake at a very reasonable cost. Therefore, I am returning to you the bill of materials, so that the lumber which can be supplied from the R.C. mill can be deleted. We will then have on hand a bill of materials for outside purchase. If you could do this deletion and return the bill here we can begin to negotiate for the purchase of the remaining requirements.\n\nI understand that Brother Boucher will be nominated by Bishop Lajeunesse for the construction of this teacherage.\n\nIt will not be possible for the Sisters to report to Island Lake until the middle of August. Therefore I would suggest that the school term re-open on 1 September, 1948.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNorway House, Manitoba\n8 June 1948.\n\nEducation Division, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nAttention: Mr P Phelan\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of May 7th 1948 file 123-12-8 (E.I.) re the contemplated teacherage at Island Lake for the R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nIt is the opinion of the writer that the estimated cost of the labor in erecting this building will be approximately $4,500.00. This would include the hauling of sand, gravel and broken rock.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nOttawa, June 24, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nInland Lake R. C. Indian Day School.\n\nAt Island Lake we have two separate Indian settlements, one at Maria Portage and the other some 10 miles away at Garden Hill. At Maria Portage we have a day school which has now grown to three classrooms with an attendance of nearly 100 pupils. We have never had a teacherage at this point but have rented a small house from the R. C. Missionaries for use by the teachers.\n\nUnfortunately, this teacherage was burned on December 11. Arrangements have had to be made to have the three teachers temporarily accommodated in the Priest's residence. The Priest and the Brothers have moved out to a small shack in order to permit this arrangement.\n\nWe have had some correspondence with Mr. Indian Superintendent Goodman with regard to the purchase of a ware-house from Mr. Blackburn, who was a free trader at Maria Portage. Mr. Blackburn erected this ware-house in September 1946. You will find attached a complete description of this ware-house as submitted by Mr. H. L. Stevenson, our Assistant Indian Agent at Island Lake. There is little doubt about the fact that this building is well constructed and could be quite easily adapted for use as a teacher's residence.\n\nMr. John Blackburn, who was at one time one of our day school teachers, recently visited the Department and offered to sell this building to the Department at cost less the amount which was received from the insurance company for scouring which it obtained in the fire. This building cost $2,600.00 and he\nreceived $200.00 from the insurance company. Mr. Indian Superintendent Goodman has recommended the purchase of this building at the price of $2,000.00. Mr. Blackburn has indicated that he is willing to accept this price.\n\nIn addition to the purchase of the building, Mr. Goodman has also recommended that we purchase the following furniture which Mr. Blackburn has available at Island Lake:\n\n(a) Chesterfield and chair (good quality).\n\n(b) Dining room suite consisting of table, end tables, 5 chairs and buffet.\n\n(c) Kitchen table.\n\n(d) Ice-box\n\n(e) Gasoline washer, in good condition.\n\n(f) Knives, forks and cutlery.\n\nOther incidentals.\n\nMr. Blackburn has priced these items of furniture at $500.00 and Mr. Goodman has recommended their purchase at this price.\n\nThis will provide us with three classrooms at Island Lake and with some of the furniture required for the teacherage. It will not solve the problem of teacher's accommodation. Fortunately, Bishop Lejeune has offered the use of the Priests' residence for the three Sisters who will teach there next year. The Priest will live in a small shed during the winter in order to accommodate the teachers.\n\nIt will be necessary to ship in building supplies for a teachers' residence during the winter but this will be the subject of a further memorandum.\n\n..... In the\nIn the meantime it is recommended that approval be given to the following expenditures:\n\n(a) The purchase of Mr. Blackburn's store-house for the sum of $2,000.00.\n\n(b) The purchase of Mr. Blackburn's furniture as listed, for the sum of $500.00.\n\nDirector.\nYK85 14=ST JEAN BAPTISTE MAN 10 1000A\n\nCOLONEL NEARY=\n\n283 MINES & RESOURCES CARE INDIAN AFFAIRS BR OTTAWA=\n\nWHEN CAN WE EXPECT PAYMENT HOUSE AND FURNITURE URGENT TO HAVE BEFORE SEPT THIRTIETH=\n\nJ E BLACKBURN.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The latter are occupying for the time being a large hall which served as a recreation place for the Indians.\n\nThe Fathers would like to move their furniture from their old residence but unfortunately the Department has been unable so far to send any furniture for the Sisters who number five in all. As you know there are three teachers, one social worker and one cook. As the furniture which they are asking for will be used in the new teacherage which it is your intention to build next summer, it should be as complete as possible, without of course any extravagance.\n\nThe enclosed list is based on six persons as the Sisters must have a spare room for visitors, particularly the reverend Mother Provincial who, as you know, visits her community once a year. The attached list is as reasonable as possible and should be supplied in full.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. G. Plourde, O.M.I.\nExtract from a letter to B.F.

Neary, Superintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Teacherage of Island Lake, R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nPlease find enclosed the plans requested in your letter dated November 23rd for the Teacherage of the Island Lake R.C. Day School. In my reply of November 25th, I have informed you that the requested plans were at the time at the Island Lake Mission in order to be looked over and checked by our constructor, the Rev. Brother Ed. Boucher, O.M.I., who just returned them to us.\n\nHerewith also you will find a list in triplicate of the materials required for the construction concerned. I would suggest that the ultimate date to have all these materials assembled at Ilford, Man., be next February 15th, 1949. From there, as you probably know, they will be hauled by tractor to Island Lake. Since all the supplies for the mission are also directed through Ilford, it would be advisable, in order to avoid confusion, that all the building materials for the Teacherage be addressed to the name of \"R.C. Day School, Island Lake, Man.\"\n\nOur list mentions a water pump & engine only, we leave to you to decide whether the Teacherage will be provided with running water or not. The list will have to be adapted according to your decision. Moreover, there is the heating system to decide upon and approve, and to this effect we leave it to you to have a plan made for the installation of the suitable hot air furnace and air conductors to the different rooms, etc., It shall then be required to send the complete heating system for the above Teacherage, as nothing of this equipment appears on the enclosed lists of building materials.\n\nHoping that you will find everything quite in order and that you will do your utmost to have every item at Ilford for above mentioned date so that no delay shall hinder transportation before the Spring break-up.\n\nWishing you but the best for a Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year!

We hope that they will be returned as soon as communications will be resumed.\n\nIn the meantime, may I refer you to a copy of the same plans and bill of materials which were given to Mr. Goodman by Rev.

If you could not find the same, please let me know by return mail and I may be able to procure another copy for you.\n\nNow, dear Sir, I would like very much to have for our files a written statement of what was understood between the Indian Department and our Corporation regarding the erection of the Teacherage for the Island Lake R.C. Indian Day School, viz., the wages of the Brother in charge, the price of the lumber, the supplying of the materials that will not be found locally, transportation, payment of the labor, the mode of presenting labor returns and other claims, etc. As I am often away from home, I would deem it very important to have everything well set-up in order to avoid every possible misunderstanding that otherwise might very well arise.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nVicar-Apostolic of Keewatin\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOttawa, January 6, 1949.\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nVOTE 516 ALLOTMENT 13-491 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS.\n\nSHIP TO The Principal, R.C.

Are the partitions in the Sisters dormitories full partitions or are they open above and below?\n4. What are the sizes of the windows?\n5.

Indian Day School Teacherage of Island Lake, Man., for the making of the Electrical and Water Systems of said Teacherage.\n\nHoping that the plans will satisfactorily meet your request, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Vicar-Apostolic of Keewatin]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 517-8, part 1)\nJanuary 20th, 1949.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary, Superintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 19th instant, here are the informations I am able to give you regarding your request.\n\n1. The height of the basement will be nine feet high from floor to floor.\n\n2. The clearance between the basement floor and the beams is eight feet high.\n\n3. The Partitions in the Sisters' dormitories are not full and are opened below and above.\n\n4. I suppose that you mean the windows of the Sisters' dormitories, if so, the sizes of these windows are those listed on Sheet 1, asking for 7 cheakrail windows, 2 lights. size: 16\"x 20\", whose outside measures are: 20\" wide x 46\" high.\n\n5) As I do not see any chimney flues ordered for the chimney, and that I am too far to discuss this matter with our Brother for a rush answer, I presume that he was intending to build same without flues. But I surely prefer to have 2 separate flues in a single chimney. As for the sizes, I suggest for the kitchen stove: 8\u00bd\" x 8\u00bd\" flues, and the other for the furnace: 8\u00bd\" x 10\", presuming that the last size will be sufficient for the proposed furnace.\n\nMoreover, with the sufficient flues to be ordered, you shall have to check if there are sufficient chimney red bricks, which I doubt, to complete this rectangular chimney. As there is no lime ordered for brick mortar, I presume they will need a few sacks. It would be wise to send some with the bricks, etc..\n\nSorry that we are so far apart from Island Lake to reach and discuss such matters with our Brother builder. Nevertheless, I trust this will give you the informations you require.\n\nWith best regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nVicar-Apostolic of Keewatin.\nJanuary 21st, 1949.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary, Supt., of Education,\nDept., of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to yours of the 18th instant, your file 517-8 (E), may you be informed:\n\n1. That I took notice that blankets, sheets, and comforters are not to be supplied by the Department.\n\n2. As the Island Lake Mill shingles are not suitable for the Teacherage as per Mr. Hughes statement, I take for granted that your Dept., will send the required shingles.\n\n3. I am greatly surprised to hear that you are intending to take the lumber for the R.C. Teacherage and School from the Dept., sawmill at Island Lake!\n\nIn all our previous talks it was always understood that the lumber needed would be made by the R.C. Mission sawmill in order to give work to our Catholic Indians during the coming months. You no doubt remember the lengthy discussion we had in your office with Rev. Father O. Plourde, O.M.I., on the cost of the required lumber for the R.C. Teacherage and School at Island Lake, Man.,\n\nI understood by your statements that this matter was settled and that the R.C. Mission had to go ahead with the manufacturing of this lumber. In fact, the builder Brother wrote us today that over a thousand logs are already cut and this would give some sixty thousand feet of lumber. Permits has been paid for cutting logs. Moreover, we have already bought a $3,000.00 new tractor already at Ilford, Man., for the hauling of these logs and to supply power to our sawmill, etc. We would never have bought this tractor had we known that we were not to supply the required lumber for the Teacherage and School. Neither engaged Indian laborers for the cutting, etc., of these logs allowed by permits.\n\nI hope that you shall write me soon about this matter, giving me the clear facts about this lumber question. Moreover, kindly let me know in details all what is to be expected from us and all what we are to expect from your Department, in this question, in order to avoid any misunderstanding between all concerned about the R.C. Indian Day School and Teacherage. I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVicar-Apostolic of Keewatin.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Day School\n\nDear Bishop Lajeunesse:\n\nWhile not in a position to report on all items yet, I can advise with regard to furniture and to the rough lumber.\n\nPurchase orders are now being prepared by the Departmental Purchasing Agent for the furniture requisitioned, with the exception of the following articles, which we do not supply for Indian day school teachers:\n\n- Blankets,\n- Sheets,\n- Comforters.\n\nWhile we do provide furniture for our school teachers, you will appreciate the fact that we cannot supply personal items such as those listed above.\n\nWith regard to the shingles and rough lumber, I have just received an airmail letter from Mr. Hughes, reading as follows:\n\n\"For a building of this type I would not recommend Island Lake Mill shingles.\n\n\"With reference to the lumber order I would state that we have the following rough lumber on hand at the...\"\nDepartment's Island Lake mill and have started a logging operation from which we hope to realize 300,000 feet:\n\n| Size       | Quantity |\n|------------|----------|\n| 2 x 6      | 5,290    |\n| 2 x 8      | 4,274    |\n| 2 x 4      | 6,702    |\n| 1\" Rough Lbr.| 19,637   |\n\n\"This lumber is sawn to standard and will be pretty well seasoned by the time your building program is started. I presume that the carpenters will prefer a dimension lumber surfaced at least 2 sides and will require a quantity of shiplap from our rough 1\" stock. This can be done provided the planer we have requisitioned is supplied. Might I suggest that you talk this matter over with Mr. Davis who I understand is in Ottawa until the end of the month.\n\n\"I would like to have at least a portion of this lumber order for our mill but unless our planer is being supplied in time to go in by tractor this winter - then the sawmill at the R.C. Mission will be your best source of supply.\"\n\nI expect to see Mr. Davis tomorrow and will then be able to advise you whether a planer will be sent in to the Department's Island Lake mill.\n\nI presume that you have a planer at the Island Lake R. C.

Henry\n\nI have your wire of January 5th re lumber etc. for the proposed new teacherage at Island Lake.\n\nFor a building of this type I would not recommend Island Lake Mill shingles.\n\nWith reference to the lumber order I would state that we have the following rough lumber on hand at the Department's Island Lake mill and have started a logging operation from which we hope to realize 300,000 feet:\n\n- 2 x 6: 5,290 F.B.M.\n- 2 x 8: 1,270 \"\n- 2 x 4: 6,702 \"\n- 1\" Rough Lbr: 19,887 \"\n\nThis lumber is sawn to standard and will be pretty well seasoned by the time your building program is started.

Davis\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nOn October 16th 1948 I wrote the Department with regard to cement which was purchased from the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co Ltd., Winnipeg, payment being covered by this Agency's voucher #975.\n\nAs mentioned in this letter, these supplies were intended for use in construction of the Jack River C of E Teacherage which had been completed the year previous. I suggested that this cement could be used in construction of basement for teacherage to be built at Island Lake R.C. Indian Day School this coming spring. If this cement is not used within the next six months it will be destroyed due to atmospheric conditions. Mr Stevenson will be making his trip to Norway House by tractor very shortly and could take this cement into Island Lake.\n\nAlso at Island Lake at the present time there are 375 bags of cement which belong to the Department, these being made up of cement shipped in for construction of basement for Assistant Agent's house which the department considered building several years ago and surplus left over re construction of Island Lake U.C. Indian Day School & Teacherage. Officials from the Provincial Government visited Island Lake recently and wanted to know if the Department would be willing to dispose of 270 bags of this cement as they are constructing a Game Guardian's residence there this year. They would have to know immediately whether the Department would sell as they would otherwise bring same in by Tractor Freight. Of this 375 bags of cement, at least 300 are useable, the balance having to be written off as destroyed.\n\nKindly advise by wire as to whether you wish to have cement shipped to Island Lake and if you wish to dispose of cement to provincial government.\n\nF.M. Hughes, As Supt, Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Island Lake Teacherage - Building Materials\n\nFurther to your letter under file No. 517-5 dated February 4, 1949. Please be advised that I have today completed all outstanding purchases as per your requisitions forwarded to this office.\n\nArrangements have been completed with all contractors to have these items shipped in time to catch the last tractor train out to Island Lake.\n\nR.S.

It is understood that we did not supply all the furnishings necessary, and we also understand that you can purchase some of the articles from the Hudson's Bay Company at Island Lake. Authority is, therefore, granted for local purchase of the following:\n\n- 4 wash basins\n- 1 double boiler, size 10 quarts\n- 12 lengths of stove pipes, two with damper, two with collars, two with elbows, one side roof pipe and 1 ridge roof pipe.\n- 2 stove boards size 30 x 30 (to protect the kitchen wall).\n- 1 complete set of dishes for 5 persons\n- 1 doz. water glasses\n- 1 complete set of cutlery for 8 persons, 8 knives, 8 forks, 8 spoons, 8 dessert spoons, 1 sugar spoon, 1 ladle.\n- 1 kitchen set, 1 table and 8 chairs\n- 1 complete set kitchen utensils, for 8 persons.\n- 1 dishpan\n- 4 oil lamps\n- 3 dust pans\n- 1 ironing board\n- 8 doz. large brooms\n- 16 Green window shades (36 x 70)\n- 3 paint brushes, 1\", 2\" and 3\"\n\n.....2\nIf any of the above articles are not available at the Hudson's Bay store you should advise us.

The Department does not supply pillow covers, sheets, quilts or blankets. These have to be supplied by the teachers and remain their property.\n\nBernard F.

These were ordered and we understand that they have reached Island Lake by winter freight.\n\nWe have now received a request to supply 4 dressers, 4 washstands, 4 single beds, 4 matresses and 4 pillows. These were not included on the original list from Bishop Lajesnesse. We understand that if these are needed at the present time it will be necessary to forward them by air. I would appreciate it very much if you would make some enquiries and ascertain the approximate cost of shipping the articles mentioned by air.

Brother Boucher who will be in charge of its construction would like to know how much he should pay the Indians who will be employed as laborers on this job.\n\nI have written to him today asking him to get in touch with Mr. Stevenson of Garden Hill to find out how much the latter has paid the Indians for the work they did during the winter for the Department and to use that as a guide for the wages which himself will be paying. I also told him to follow Mr. Stevenson's advice in this matter so that there will be no difficulty between the Mission and the Indians regarding these wages.\n\nThe payment of wages offers another difficulty which should be faced immediately and arrangements made to avoid any inconvenience to the Indians themselves. Island Lake is 300 Miles from here. There is no Bank or facilities for cashing checks. Therefore the money used to pay wages should be forwarded in kind. Your Mr. Stevenson who has handled money for wages should be able to give you the necessary advice in this matter.\n\nBrother Boucher will be very busy on the construction itself and we believe he should not be asked\nto keep books or to do more than keep the time of the Indians.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nMr. R.S.

I am reasonably sure that arrangements can be made through the Hudson's Bay Company at Island Lake to pay cash to the workmen and forward invoices to this office monthly, supported by signed Labor Returns. My reasons for suggesting this procedure are that the Indians will require weekly pay. There are no banking facilities in Island Lake, Mr Stevenson lives some 10 miles from the Maria Portage area and weather conditions will no doubt prevent him from going to Maria Portage on pay day several times during the construction of the building. If satisfactory to the Department I would suggest that Brother E Boucher prepare the necessary paylists for the Indian workmen and submit them weekly to the Hudson's Bay Company who will get the required signatures as the Indians are paid and invoice this office every month.

There are no desks, two tables and forms are used for classroom work. The room is lined with building paper. The teacher will kalsomine the room to make it a little more comfortable. She suggested that she discharge all pupils under the school age of seven years of age.

Laronde who taught it some time ago but lately it has been taught by Mr. Leonard Hart, a former teacher. I would be glad if you will kindly put Mr. Hart's name instead of Mr. Laronde.\n\nLaronde is now charge of the R.O. of St. Peter's Indian and we want Mr. Hart to take charge of the school. Will you also be kind enough to give Mr. Hart a supply of medicine for the children as he takes the drugs out him now.\n\nBe good enough to send Mr. Hart a supply of medicine.\n\nRobert B.\nSup't of Indians\nDear Archdeacon Phair:\n\nMr. Leonard Hart presented to me yesterday your letter of that date. You are evidently unaware that, under an arrangement effected some months ago, the Indian Commissioner's Office here was abolished, and that the entire executive management and general administration of Indian Affairs is now centered at Ottawa. From the position of Assistant Commissioner I was relegated to that of \"Inspector of Roman Catholic Indian Schools\". My official sphere, therefore, I am sorry to say, no longer extends to your schools. All that remains is the gratifying memory of our pleasant relations.\n\nI am sending by this day's mail your letter to the Secretary of the Department at Ottawa; and at the risk of being extra-official, I am advising as to the medicines which Mr. Hart stated would be required.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.)

I beg to forward report as instructed.\n\nJack Head Band is a small one 77 persons.\n\nThere are about 20 persons of school age.\n\nDuring the year 1907-8 Mr Leonard Hart was school teacher. He married an indian woman who after her marriage became\u2014if even a small portion of reports are true\u2014a disgrace to the Band.\n\nAs a result all efforts Mr Hart could make were offset by his wife's behavior.\n\nThe next year Mr Louis Larende was appointed teacher.\n\nAt the time of the Treaty Payments the Councillor informed me that Mr Larende's behavior with the women on the Reserve was such that he was compelled to send him from the Reserve.\n\nHe also said Mr Larende used to close the school to visit other women on Fisher River Reserve.\n\nI have been unable to find any boy or girl on Jack Head Reserve who can talk any English and I am of the opinion that all expenditure in connection with this school is money wasted.\n\nI wish however to call THE DEPARTMENTS attention to the fact that I have had very little opportunity to go into this matter thoroughly.\n\nOnly at Treaty time has the opportunity been given and perhaps MR INSPECTOR SEMMENS could give more information.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSIR\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA\nOttawa, November 6th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo forwarding a special report on the Jack Head School, and in reply I beg to say that the Reverend Archdeacon Fair is being written to in connection therewith.\n\nYou have omitted to state whether Mr. Hart's wife accompanied him to the Reserve when he took charge of the school for the second time.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th ultimo, in reference to the Jack Head Indian school and asking that Mr. Hart's name be substituted for that of the Rev. L. Laronde as teacher of this school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would like to know whether Mr. Hart was accompanied by his wife when he returned to the school. If so it would object to his continuing as teacher.\n\nYou state that the Rev. Mr. Laronde has been placed in charge of the Parish of St. Peter's Indian Settlement. I regret to say that the reports received concerning Mr. Laronde's behaviour are so unfavourable that the Department has strong objections to his doing missionary work among the Indians.

His course was a most brilliant one and possessed the confidence and respect of both his professors and of his fellow students. Your letter therefore is a great shock.

Louis Laronde, and that Your Grace desires to investigate the matter and requesting to be furnished with the authority and evidence for the grave statements made.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the letter above referred to was written on the strength of a letter received from our Agent in reference to the Jackhead school, in which he stated as follows:-\n\n\"At the time of the Treaty Payments the Councillor informed me that Mr. Laronde's behaviour with the women on the reserve was such that he was compelled to send him from the reserve.

I am leaving today for Toronto but on my return I will at once look into the matter. In the past we have had trouble with gossip mongers at Jackson Head & one very worthy man had simply to resign in order to get out of the range of the vile tongues of some of the people there. However, the accusations will be thoroughly gone into & I thank you for giving me the particulars.\n\nYours very truly\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 518-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nSt. Peter's, Dynevor, Man.\nJan. 3rd 1910.\n\nHis Grace, the Primate,\nYour Grace,\n\nI find that it is almost impossible for me to leave St. Peter's just at this time. I am not over my vino season yet, as I have still two vinos here. I would also have to prepare beforehand before I could leave here without leaving my housekeeper in discomfort. I will have to leave a good supply of wood etc., and to arrange other details. But any time after the next two weeks provided your grace gives me ample notice beforehand, I shall be ready to make the trip to Fisher River and Jack Head.\n\nShould your grace think it necessary that I should as your grace may not be quite clear about the affair at Jack Head, I wish to submit the following facts:\n\n(1) Ever since 1905, when I had occasion to rebuild the Mission house at J.H. the Councillor, Geo. Harvey, has borne ill will towards me, owing to some supposed slight to his dignity and authority as Councillor. He then tried in every way to place obstacles in the way of my successfully carrying on the work, and also forced me to move the chapel from his land to a site near the mission house.\n(2) He, as Councillor, expected me to pay tribute to him for the privilege of ministering to his people and on his Reserve, which I think did not think it right to do.\n\n(3) The Councillor also tried to get me to make a compromise with him in the work viz. that I should not antagonize Christianity and Heathenism, so that I should not proselytise, which I could not do.\n\n(4) I did my best to put an end to the heathen customs and illegal dances, by teaching the Christian Indians that they were wrong. These the Councillor feared, being the head of the heathen, and they were the chief means of his support.\n\n(5) When I was going out last summer to J. H., I was met with the message that I was not wanted out there, and that the Councillor had vowed to drive me out.\n\nFrom this you may see the reason of the Councillor's enmity.\n\nHe employed his strongest weapon\u2014Slander\u2014when he reported me to the Indian Agent as being immoral, and his motive was to prevent me returning to Jack Head.\n\nHe has repeatedly declared that he was satisfied with catechists and did not want an ordained man, as catechists could not proselytise, and could not interfere with heathenism to any extent.\nThe Councillor never had charge that he could bring against me, till this affair gave him an opportunity to charge something definite against me.\n\nIn this affair, the charge was not immorality. John Davies, a brother of the Councillor, instigated by his wife, endeavored to force me to marry his daughter. He claimed that I had asked him for his daughter, while as a matter of fact, it was they who were so anxious that I should become their son-in-law that they asked me on two occasions to make their daughter my wife. The parents, to prove that I was in love with their daughter and that I had asked for her, tried to show that I kept company with the girl, or paid court to her. I wrote and conducted my own defense, with the parents and five or six prominent heathen endeavoring to convict me of immorality with the girl. The witness called testified against the parents, as in every case they were falsely quoted. Not one of the alleged dealings with the girl were established. Even the chief witness, the girl herself denied that I had any dealings with her, or had ever asked for her, and she gave this testimony in the face of threatening and commands. My accusers, the parents and the heathen declared that she was shielding me.\n\nTwo men from Fisher River Reserve were called as witnesses of my carrying-on at Fisher River. But these also\nwere falsely quoted, as I subsequently obtained a written testimony of one in the presence of Mr. Stevens, the clergyman at Fisher River, declaring that he had never said a word to the detriment of my character, and that he knew nothing to defame my character. The other man gave the same testimony to Mr. Stevens.\n\nAt the end of the trial before the band of the Reserve, there was nothing established against my character; on the contrary, my character was completely vindicated. \"Thus the purest things are saved.\" They were at the meeting some, viz., the father of the girl and the parents who believed I was guilty, and that the girl was shielding me. I attended the meeting of the band because I felt it was in the interest of my work to face the charge at once and show up the lie.\n\nTwo or three weeks after this trial, I kept in one girl during recess because she had not done her work. And though, knowing these people thoroughly, I took the precaution to have the sister of the girl in the room with her, and I went out for the ten minutes of recess with the other children, yet this act was construed by the Councilor as one of immorality on my part. This was the chief foundation of the charge against me.\n\nThey claim in the report against me that I had to file Jack Head, while as a matter of fact, my\ndeparture at the beginning of May had long before been arranged with the Indian Commissioner and with your Grace for the necessities of my work.\n\nThey claim also in the report that the two councillors at Fisher River can testify as to my immoral life at Fisher River. Here is another weak point in their charge, for these men can testify that I conducted myself always as befitted my calling.\n\nMr. Stevens at Fisher River, Mr. Hart at Jack Head, and Mr. John Wheeler of St. Louis, Miss., can testify as to the purity of my conduct. When at Fisher River I stayed with Mr. Stevens, while Mr. Hart and Mr. Wheeler, an A.B. brother, were at Jack Head during the troubles in question.\n\nI do not fear but would welcome investigation into my past life, as a school boy at the Battleford Industrial School I lived blamelessly as Rev. E. Matheson can readily testify. Seven months I was at St. Paul's Middle Church, where I was known to J. G. Dagg. I was two years at Lac Steil, as a teacher, and there also there was nothing to stain my character, and your Grace knows my character during the six years of my College course, in which I can confidently claim that I never gave you cause to suspect the purity of my life. Four years, or nearly so, was I at Jack Head, and there was never said anything to the detriment of my character.\nAll I had stirred up the enmity of Councillor Travers.\n\nThe Jack Head Indians are a class by themselves. They wish to cling to their heathenism, their feasts and illegal dances, and because an ordained man is a menace to the interests of their head men, they will resort to the most devilish means to drive out the clergyman. No clergyman, however pure his life, and however unblameable he may have been, who has laboured at Jack Head, has ever left the place without some slander attached to his name. But in every case these slanders were built on lies and were created by despicable machinations.\n\nYour Grace will believe me when I say that I took my vows for the Priesthood in all sincerity, with a due sense of their importance and from a conviction that my life has been such as not to debar me from assuming those vows. And I wish to declare, as far as my witness, that I am not guilty of the charge brought against me by the Councillor of Jack Head.\n\nIf your Grace think it will do any good, I wish you would forward this to the authorities at Ottawa, and if they are not satisfied, I desire them to allow me to accompany Mr. Swiford to Fisher River and Jack Head, to investigate the charge.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nLouis Laronde.\nDear Mr. McLennan,\n\nI wish to inform you that I have seen Rev. L. Laronde in regard to the charges which have been made against him by the Councillor at Jack Head through the Indian Agent in that district. He denies all the charges and protests stoutly his innocence and declares that he has never been guilty even of the slightest indiscretion. I am perfectly satisfied with the truth of his statements. He is the last man whom I would suspect of any immoral conduct. His life during his School and College course has been scrupulously clean in every respect. When I sent for him the other day and placed the charges before him he at once suggested that he should accompany one of your inspectors and subject himself to a thorough investigation before the Indians. I thought that this would be a good plan and at once telephoned to Mr. Swinford in order to ascertain whether he could arrange for carrying it out. He replied that he was starting for Fisher River the next but would not be able to go on to Jack Head. For the complete vindication of Laronde's character and for the sake of the work, I would like to see the investigation take place, for no man whom we have ever sent to Jack Head has escaped from the vilest slanders against his character. I remember the case of an excellent fellow named Bartlett whom I sent out there. He returned within two or three weeks declaring that the place was too vile for him to live in, adding that no matter how scrupulous his conduct might be he would be branded as an adulterer. Mr. Laronde's experience has been...\nthe same only he had apparently faced the charges before the Indians and defied them to prove them. He never fled from the place as is charged. I removed him because I wanted him for a more important post and he was very reluctant to leave and at first refused on the ground that he had brought the work at Jack Head to a point when it would be a serious set back to abandon it or give it into the hands of a new man who did not understand local conditions. It was only under pressure from me that he was induced to leave Jack Head and accept Dynevor. I enclose a letter which I received from Mr. Laroche this morning.\n\nYours very truly\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecy.

Laronde in regard to certain charges made against him by the Councillor at Jack Head; and in reply I beg to state that the Department is quite satisfied by the explanations given by Your Grace and by the Rev. Mr. Laronde that there is no truth in the statements made by the Councillor.\n\nAs, however, Mr. Laronde asks for an investigation in the matter, the Department will see that it be thoroughly investigated on the occasion of the next visit of the Inspector to the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

He should be given to understand that his engagement is temporary and his retention will be dependent upon the success with which he meets.\n\nThe school supplies asked for will be dealt with in another communication.

Our records show that there are only 18 children of school age on the Reserve and as this is a comparatively small number it is doubtful if a very successful day school could be hoped for. However, I am most anxious to meet your Grace's wishes in so far as possible. I should like to know if it is proposed to combine the duties of missionary and teacher. I think the Department would be doing its duty if it made a grant say of $500.00 for the educational work, the continuance to be dependent upon results attained.

The Agent and Inspector will visit this Reserve about June 12th to pay treaty and attend to their other ordinary duties. If it could be convenient for Your Grace to arrange to be at Fairford at that time instructions will be given the officers above mentioned to explain to the Indians the attitude of the Department respecting a boarding school and what we are prepared to do for them in the way of a day school. I am sure that the cooperation of these officers with Your Grace on the ground would enable us to come to a settlement of this question which has been so long under consideration.\n\nI shall take no action in either of the above cases until I hear from you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nMarch 31, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nSeveral years ago the Church of England had a teacher and a Catechist at Jack Head, the Government paying part of the salary and the Church supplementing the grant. Though we had some specially good men there the work was so discouraging and the Indians so troublesome that on the advice of the Superintendent of Missions, I withdrew from the work. Both the Superintendent and the Missionary advised me to close down the work and leave it closed until the Band would ask that it be resumed. A message has now come to me from the Band pleading that a teacher be sent. We have a good house there, a fair Church and I am told that there is a school-house which is considerably out of repair. I wish to ascertain whether the Department will sanction the appointment of a teacher and if I secure a good man what salary the Department would offer. In view of the history of the place in the past it would be prudent to send a married man rather than a single one.\n\nI hope you are keeping in view the matter of the Fairford school and that you will give me a considerable period of notice if you wish me to accompany the person you send to deal with the matter. I had hoped to go\nthere in July but it is possible that I may have to go over to England during that month, instead.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nS. P. Ruperts Land.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nApril 7, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI thank you very sincerely for yours of April 3rd regarding the Jack Head school. The number of pupils which you give is rather disappointing but I will look out a teacher at once and have him ready if possible to go out there at the opening of navigation. My intention is to supplement the man's salary by a grant from the Church and to make use of him as a Catechist on Sundays.\n\nI note what you say in regard to Fairford and it will be a great disappointment to me if I cannot accompany the agent at the date you speak of, but I am due in Regina just about that time for a very important appointment and it is just possible that I shall not be able to get back in time. However, if you give full instructions to your agent I dare say matters can be explained to the Indians in a satisfactory manner. My only desire was to assist in negotiations and endeavor to persuade the Indians to accept of an improved school instead of their wished for boarding school.\n\nI must again thank you for your prompt attention to my letters. I have a feeling that with you at the head of affairs a great deal may be accomplished.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt., Gen.

Original on File 42702136.\n\nJack Head\n\nAt Jack Head reserve there has been no day school for some years. The Indians here have, however, intimated to Mr. Agent Carter that they would like to have a teacher placed with them. Archbishop Matheson has been advised and he has in turn asked the Indians to send him an application stating that they will loyally support and assist a teacher by sending their children to school and keeping the school supplied with fuel so that the work will run successfully. As soon as this is signified to his Grace, he will nominate a suitable person for teacher, so that it may be hoped that a school will be in operation on this reserve this year.\n\nSgd. J. R.

The Department approved of this transfer and of the closing of the Cumberland School until such time as there is a sufficient number of children to warrant its being re-opened. It is presumed that Mr. Taylor has carried out the Department's instructions, in which case the Department regrets that it cannot appoint Mr. Daniels to this position.\n\nIn a communication received from Mr. Agent Carter of the Fisher River Agency the Department learns that\n\nRight Rev.

As the payment of this salary, together with the incidental outlay in connection with the up-keep of the school, will necessitate a considerable expenditure, it is to be understood that the continuance of the grant will be dependent upon the success of the school.

As the building mentioned, which would be the most suitable available, is the property of the church authorities, the Department could not undertake to authorize any expenditure being incurred in having it fitted up.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to hear from Your Grace as soon as you have secured a suitable teacher.

The old school building will need considerable repairs, if it is decided to start the work, but before authorizing any expenditure for the purpose, I would be pleased if Your Grace would state your views as to the advisability of conducting a school at this point, and also whether you would be able to obtain the services of a competent man to carry on the work as teacher.\n\nIf a teacher is obtained, it will be necessary to provide living accommodation. The Department understands there is a house, the property of the Church of England, located just outside the Reserve, which might be available. This house will require some repairs, and as it is the property of the Church authorities, the Department could not undertake any expense in having it fitted up.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your views regarding the question of reopening this school at your early convenience.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\nOTTAWA, June 16th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 4th instant, in which you recommend that the Jackhead Indian Day School be reopened and the services of a suitable teacher obtained, as there is a fair prospect of success owing to the death of the Councillor whose influence was against the carrying on of the school; in reply I beg to say that the Department is taking this matter up with His Grace The Archbishop of Rupert's Land to ascertain whether His Grace can obtain the services of a suitable teacher, and whether he would advise that the school be reopened.\n\nAs soon as his reply is received, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nT. H. Carter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway P.O.,\nMan.\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 22nd instant, informing me that you are endeavouring to obtain the services of a suitable teacher for both the South Peguis and the Jackhead Indian Day Schools and requesting to be informed as to the salary that will be paid by the Department.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if a qualified teacher is secured for each of these schools, a salary of $600.00 per annum together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the present fiscal year, will be paid.\n\nIt is hoped that Your Grace will be able to secure suitable teachers in time to re-open these schools, especially that at South Peguis, after the summer holidays.\n\nI will be pleased if you will submit the names, qualifications and experience of the teachers nominated by you, for the consideration of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. Nelson,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 518-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nYesterday Mr. H. Bjornson of Riverton and Mr. Baldwin Anderson of Gimli, Manitoba, in company with the Revd Mr. Turner of Calgary called at the Indian Office, Peguis and made a statement in reference to conditions at the Jack Head Reserve.\n\nThe statements of Mr Bjornson and Mr Anderson were, briefly, to the effect that they considered it a disgrace and an outrage the way the children of the Jack Head Band had been allowed to grow up into young men and young women without any education whatever; that there were young men and young women who could not even tell the difference between the letters A and B; and that if nothing was done at once to rectify this disgraceful state of affairs they would seek another avenue for improvement.\n\nI informed Mr Bjornson and Mr Anderson that this was a matter for which I could not be held responsible as I had done all I possibly could by writing the Department and the Church Authorities urging that a teacher be sent to the Jack Head Reserve, but that I would at once report their statements.\n\nAs Jack Head has been about 14 years without a teacher I respectfully beg to recommend that the matter of sending a teacher to Jack Head without delay be given serious consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, December 13, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 29th ultimo, referring to the need of the children of the Jackhead reserve and the desirability of the reopening that school as soon as possible.\n\nIn reply, I beg to state that I have written to His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, Winnipeg, Man., asking him if at all possible to secure the services of a teacher for the Jackhead Indian Day School. Would you in the meantime ascertain what would be necessary in the way of repairs for the school and what arrangements would have to be made concerning the residence that the teacher would use. I understand that there is an old Mission building that could be used to accommodate the teacher. The Department might be asked by the Church Authorities to put this in shape for residential purposes. Kindly estimate the total cost in connection with this matter, and as soon as the Department is in receipt of a nomination from Archbishop Matheson, you will be informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nT. H. Carter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway P.O.,\nMan.\nOttawa, December 13, 1921.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Agent Carter, of the Fisher River agency, to the effect that it is extremely desirable to reopen the Jackhead Indian Day School.\n\nYour Grace will kindly refer to our communication of June 29th, last, in connection with this matter. If you are able to nominate a qualified teacher, a salary of $600.00 per annum, together with a bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the present fiscal year, will be paid.\n\nIt is hoped that Your Grace will be able to secure a suitable teacher, as soon as possible. I would be pleased if you would submit the name, qualifications and experience with the nomination, for the consideration of the Department, so that we can make arrangements to reopen the Jackhead Indian Day School as soon as possible.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMost Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6276, file 518-1, part 1)\nDec. 16th, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter re the opening of the school at Jackhead. It has been a source of great regret to me that I have not been able to procure a suitable man for the post but, as I explained in former letters to the Department, past experience of the Indians at that point has convinced me that the teacher must be a married man, and, up to a very short time ago I was unable to find such a man with the proper qualifications. Recently, however, my Archdeacon persuaded a Mr. Cooke to take the combined duty of Lay Missionary and Teacher but, just as I was about to have the appointment made we learned from Mr. Carter and others, that the Mission House and also the School and Church were in such a condition that they should not be habitable for the winter. I arranged, therefore, with Archdeacon Thomas that he should visit the place early in February and ascertain what repairs for the building were necessary and where the material, etc., could be procured. As soon as he reports I will be in a position to give the Department some satisfactory information as to when Mr. & Mrs. Cooke can go out.\n\nRe the Fairford improved school about which Mr. MacKenzie wrote you some time ago we have found it impossible to procure a suitable place to which Mr. Hyson can be transferred so that the matter will have to remain in abeyance until the spring. Should you be passing through Winnipeg in your travels I shall be grateful if you will kindly call upon me and talk over the question of our various Indian schools. I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOTTAWA, December 22nd, 1921.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 16th instant, referring to the re-opening of the Jackhead Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that, after Archdeacon Thomas has visited this point in February, and you have been able to make a recommendation concerning what repairs and alterations are necessary, the Department will be pleased to receive again from you the nomination of Mr. and Mrs. Cooke.\n\nWe are extremely desirous that this school be re-opened as soon as possible.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

He has arranged for Archdeacon Thomas to visit Jackhead early in the month of February for the purpose of enquiring into the necessary alterations and equipment before the Jackhead Indian Day School can be re-opened.\n\nHis Grace has also nominated a married teacher, whom he believes, would fill this rather difficult position to the satisfaction of all concerned.\n\nI would be grateful to you for a report on the total cost in connection with the re-opening of this school. I made this request to you under date of the 13th instant. I trust that in the month of February we will be able to get this school re-opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Carter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway P.O.,\nMan.\nReferring to your letter No. 136-3-I of the 13th ultimo I beg to say that I have endeavoured to obtain some information about the old Mission building upon the Jack Head Reserve but have been unsuccessful.\n\nI am not at all sure of the extent of repairs required to put this building in a livable condition as I have not seen the interior for several years.\n\nLime would have to be obtained at Hodgson and freighted out and is almost impossible at this time as it will be frozen solid, but I would judge that $100.00 would perhaps be sufficient to make the place fairly comfortable for the present time and a full inspection and repairs made when the warm weather admits of a more thorough work being performed at a reasonable cost.\n\nThe repairs and equipment for the school I gave in my letter of December 2nd, 1919 at $110.00.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOTTAWA, January 30th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the repairs that would be required to fit up the old Mission building on the Jackhead reserve for school purposes, and stating approximately the cost of having the repairs required carried out.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are awaiting a report from Archdeacon Thomas concerning what repairs and alterations will be necessary.

Everett as teacher approved. Salary $600 per annum plus any bonus provided by law.\"\n\nIt is noted that the Indians are most anxious to have a teacher appointed and the school opened. We are, therefore, approving of the appointment of Joseph Everett, and consider that he will give satisfactory service and carry on the work at this point with a fair measure of success. It is hoped that the Indians will avail themselves of the privileges offered and see that there is a good and regular attendance of their children.\n\nRegarding the building, I beg to refer to Your Grace's letter of the 16th of December, last, in which you stated that you would arrange with Archdeacon Thomas when he visited this locality to ascertain and report as to what repairs were necessary to be made to the building, and where the material, etc., could be procured.\n\nI will be pleased if you will have Archdeacon Thomas forward any information he has regarding the repairs that will be required, and the cost of same; also whether the work in connection therewith should be placed in the hands of Joseph Everett to be satisfactorily performed, or if he has any other suggestions to make as to the best means of getting the work done. Mr. Agent Carter considered that it would cost approximately $110 to repair the building.\n\nMr. Everett should prepare a requisition for the books, stationery, etc., he requires and as soon as this is received the Department will order these supplies to be sent him.\n\nMr. Agent Carter is being informed of the authority granted for the opening of this school and the appointment of Mr. Everett and the salary he is to receive.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's,\n\nMost obedient servant,\n\nMost Rev.

The Archdeacon has visited Jack Head Indian Reserve in the latter part of March 1922, and he has fully informed himself about the requirements necessary to put the School building in shape for occupation as a school that will comfortably accommodate the pupils and the teacher.\n\nWith reference to the statement of the Archdeacon as to the condition of the school building, I beg to quote from his report to his Grace Archbishop Matheson, it is as follows:-\n\n\"The School is situated in the centre of the occupied part of the Reserve and is a fairly commodious log building, \"with living room above. Before it can be used again for school purposes, it will require new windows, new stove pipes, \"a thorough cleaning and an entire equipment.\"\n\nFollowing his remarks on the condition of the school building, the Archdeacon has given me a list of the articles required. This List is as follows:-\n\n| Item | Quantity | Description |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| Windows, double, 4-lights | 4 | 12\" x 24\" |\n| do | 6 | 8\" x 10\" |\n| lengths Stove Pipes | 24 | |\n| only | 2 | 7\"; Elbows |\n| do | 1 | 7\"; T. |\n| Good Broom | 1 | |\n| Handled Axe | 1 | 3\u00bd lb. |\n| Desk, assorted | 10 | |\n| Map of Canada | 1 | |\n| \" The World | 1 | |\n| Teacher's Table and Chair, also 1 hand bell, Black Board, 5' x 3', 1 box Chalk, white | 1 | |\n| Elementary Books for teaching | 1 | assorted color |\n| Wall Cards, Alphabet, and simple words | 1 | |\n| I have the honor to be, your obedient servant |\n\nInspector of I.A.\nforward a Map of Canada, a Map of the World, hand bell, blackboard, chalk and the textbooks required.\n\nYou may purchase and forward with the other supplies, the number of slates which you consider will be necessary; we have no information as to the number of children who are likely to attend.\n\nI will be pleased if you will give the matter of the purchase of the articles mentioned above your early attention and arrange to have them sent forward as soon as navigation opens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActg. Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOTTAWA, April 12th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the re-opening of the Jackhead Indian Day School under the auspices of the Anglican Church.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, at the request of His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, the Department has decided to give the re-opening of a school at this point a trial, its continuance to depend upon the success which is met with and the attendance of the Indian children. The Department has approved of the appointment of Mr. Joseph Everett, the nominee of His Grace, as teacher. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $600 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nRegarding the statement submitted to you by Archdeacon Thomas, who recently visited Jackhead, as to the supplies required to fit up the building and the material required in the classroom, I have to request that you will be good enough to arrange for the purchase and shipment of the following:\n\n- 4 windows, double, 4 lights, 12\" x 24\",\n- 1 window, \" 8\", 3\" x 10\",\n- 24 lengths stove pipes, 7\",\n- 2 only \" 7\" elbows,\n- 1 \" 7\" T,\n- 1 \" good broom,\n- 1 \" handled axe, 3\u00bd Lb.\n\nIf possible, competitive prices should be obtained and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price. You should forward properly certified vouchers covering the expenditure incurred, with receipt attached for any freight charges, and a memorandum showing the names of the firms asked to quote a price and the prices quoted. No undue expenditure should be incurred.\n\nRegarding the 10 desks, assorted sizes, and the teacher's desk and chair the Department is not prepared to purchase these at the present time, but would prefer to wait until we are definitely assured that this school will meet with the success which would warrant the expenditure in supplying the desks. It is thought that, for the present, whoever does the work of fitting up the building for classroom purposes could also make tables or desks that would be satisfactory, and later, if the school proves a success we could then consider the supplying of pupils' desks, a teacher's desk and chair.\n\nRegarding the classroom supplies, I beg to say that we will requisition through the Government Stationery Office here to\n\nR.

O.,\nMan., Feb. 26th, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn my recent visit to Jackhead reserve, I took the opportunity of visiting the day school on that reserve while the classes were in session. When you consider that nine months ago not a child on the reserve could speak a word of English and today they can read or at least pronounce all the words in the second reader up to the fiftieth lesson, as well as count all Indian children have a habit of coming to a full stop after each word and the teachers tell me that it is hard to break them of it. This school is also doing well in arithmetic and writing. The boys and girls between the age of six and ten are making more progress than the older ones. The teacher Mr. Joseph Everett, who is a full blooded Indian seems to be possessed of an uncommon amount of patience, and has good influence upon the children, and the older people upon the reserve.\n\nI find this building badly in need of repairs I would recommend a new floor and a new front door, also four rolls of patent roofing for the South side of the building, as the North side was covered with the same material last summer. The interior of the building is badly in need of a coat of whitewash. This school should also be equipped with new outhouses, one for the girls, and one for the boys. I would estimate the cost of the above improvements, laying floor and building outhouses, laying roofing and whitewash at $24, and $25. The material for the floor could be furnished from stock at the Agency. A door could also be furnished from the Agency. Four rolls of roofing $12. Two bushels of lime $1.20, whitewash brush $.35. The heaviest item would be the freighting which would be $25. Included in this item would be school biscuits and some furniture for the Teacher's living quarters, which I was instructed to purchase in a former letter. All of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"M. McQuash\"\nIndian Agent\n\nW. M.

You may also have two outside toilets erected. As far as possible any material in stock at the Agency should be supplied for the purpose of the repairs and the building of the toilets. You may purchase any other materials required after having secured competitive prices. The expenditure for labour, freight, etc., should be kept down to the lowest possible point. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in carrying out the repairs to the school building and in the erection of the toilets.\n\nFor your guidance I may add that the usual procedure for an Agent to follow when he considers it necessary to incur certain expenditures in connection with a school is to communicate direct with the Department, furnishing full information and requesting the necessary authority.

A white man, who would be suitable, would not stay there unless it were a clergyman, a married man, who could be induced by better living quarters and good remuneration. Joseph Everett is 62 years of age and will soon be past his period of usefulness as a teacher.\n\nA new school was erected last year and this has given the teacher an added zest and interest in his work.\nOttawa, June 10, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your report for the month of April last, on the Jackhead Indian Day School, relative to the work being performed by Joseph Everett, the teacher, I have to request that you will inform him that it is expected the English language only is to be used in teaching in the classroom.

He lives very much like the rest of the Indians as he has been brought up amongst them. His conversation with the Indians is, of course, always carried on in that language. Taking everything into consideration, I do not think that Mr. Everett is a very suitable man for the position.\u2014However, Mr. Everett has been with the Department for a number of years, and I do not wish to see him lose his position this winter. I think the Department should bear in mind that a change of teachers here would be beneficial to the Indians, providing, of course, that we can get a white couple to take charge of the school.\n\nGENERAL,\n\nI did not inspect the other four schools on the Fisher River and Peguis Reserves, as I was so busy visiting the Indian homes, etc., but I have reported on them on several previous occasions in the last two or three years. I did, however, pay a visit to each of these schools, when I enquired into conditions, and everything seemed to be progressing quite favourably. The attendance was very good. As you are no doubt aware, a hot midday meal is served at the Fisher River Day School, and the same arrangements are being made for serving this meal at the three schools in the Peguis Reserve.\n\nMiss Wright, the teacher at the South School on the Peguis Reserve brought to my attention that most of the time she had an attendance of around 55 children. This, the Department will realize, is too large a number of children for one teacher to handle, when you take into consideration that there are something like nine different grades.\n\nIn my opinion\n\nIndian Affairs.

REGINA, SASK....December 14th, 1931.\n\nINSPECTOR CHRISTIANSON'S REPORT ON SCHOOLS IN THE FISHER RIVER AGENCY:\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report as follows on the schools in the Fisher River Agency, which I visited during my recent trip to Manitoba:\n\nJACKHEAD INDIAN DAY SCHOOL,\n\nI inspected this school on November 5th. This is the first time I have visited this reserve. There were 23 children enrolled, and on the day of my visit 5 boys and 5 girls were present.\n\nThe school building is 20 Ft. X 30 Ft., and in a good state of repair. The walls are of spruce logs and the gables of lumber, the roof being covered with boards, tar paper and shingles. There is a teacher's residence about 200 yards from the school. This house is quite small, but I presume it meets the requirements of the present teacher.\n\nMr. Joseph Everett, the Teacher, has been in the employ of the Department for quite a number of years. I know very little about his qualifications as a teacher.\u2014At times I believe his daughter, who lives with him, does the teaching. I suppose the children are learning to write, read and do a little figuring, but from what I gathered, the teacher has very little influence over the Indians.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian commissioner,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 518-1, part 1)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\nB. REGINA, SASK., December 22nd, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI enclose herewith the report of an inspection made of the schools in the Fisher River Agency.\n\nWith reference to the teacher at the Jackhead School, Mr. Joseph Everett, it is noted that he has not the proper qualifications of a teacher, and that he lives more or less in the same manner as the Indians in that Reserve. However, I do not expect that the Department would be able to procure the services of a white man in this isolated district.\n\nUnder \"General\" the Inspector reports that the other schools seem to be carrying on their work satisfactorily as in the past.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan J. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have learned that Mr. J. Everett who teaches the school at Jack Head, Manitoba, is not very satisfactory. I shall be glad to hear from you with regard to this man, as no doubt your representatives will have some knowledge of the situation at Jack Head.\n\nIf your report is unsatisfactory I shall be pleased if you will give your consent to having him dismissed from his present position. However I shall be pleased to hear from you regarding this matter.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Everett, teacher of the Jack Head Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that from the reports which we have received, Mr. Everett's services are not really satisfactory and he is not a suitable man for the position. I should be pleased if Your Grace would nominate a suitable teacher for this school to succeed Mr. Everett, in time, if possible, to begin duties on or about September 1st, next. The salary allowed would depend upon the qualifications possessed by the teacher whom Your Grace nominates. I would suggest that you inform Mr. Everett that his services will not be required for the coming school year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMost Rev. I. O. Stringer, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge yours of July 16th and have noted what you say regarding Mr. Everett the teacher of the Jack Head Indian Day School. I have written to Mr. Everett stating that his services will not be required in the school for the coming year.\n\nArchdeacon Jeffery is visiting Jack Head shortly to look over the situation. We are hoping to get someone suitable for a teacher by the first of September though it is not an easy matter because of the remoteness and the peculiar circumstances connected with it.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIsaac O. Rupert's Land.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Jackhead, I have a report from Mr. Alexander of Hodgson agency regarding the conditions at that place. He advises sending a married couple if possible.\n\nI have in mind a married couple who may consent to go namely Archibald MacKay MacKenzie and his Catherine Ruth MacKenzie his wife. Mr. MacKenzie was formerly a teacher in Cleophas School and at Fairford who was satisfactory to the Department. However, he came last year in October. Mr. MacKenzie is a carpenter but there is not much doing in that line and he might go to Jackhead with his wife if everything is satisfactory.\n\nWill you please let me know what the Department will give, if in the way of salary as teacher in the case of Miss MacKenzie. I hope you will allow the highest amount.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6226, file 518-1, part 1)\nIt seems wise to have a married couple and I think this couple will be dependable in every way but at the best the remuneration will not be very great for the two of them.\n\nIs there some allowance for dispensing potions & medicines?\n\nI understand the buildings (especially the house) are not in very good condition. Would you allow Mr. MacKenzie a grant for putting the buildings into good shape.\n\nAlso something would be required for some simple furniture if you would kindly make an allowance for this.\n\nI feel secure Jeffrey is to visit the place soon and he could then give details. I expect to visit Jackhead the first part of October.\n\nI spoke to Mr. Hamilton your Superintendent in Winnipeg about the above matters the other day and he seems quite interested. I think it is time something helpful was done for the Jackhead Indians and I shall be pleased to cooperate with you in every way possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsaac O. Rupert's Land\nOttawa, August 17, 1932.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 11th instant, nominating the services of Mrs. Catherine Ruth McKenzie (nee Miss McCabe) for the position of teacher at the Jackhead Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department has knowledge of Mrs. McKenzie's qualifications, as she was previously in our employ as teacher for several years. It is noted that her husband would reside on the reserve with her if she received the appointment. I may say that it is against the usual practice of the Department to engage the services of a married woman as teacher when there is no employment for which the husband could be engaged. However, in view of the situation at Jackhead, the opportunity to obtain a teacher having the required qualifications and the success which Mrs. McKenzie has had in the other schools under her charge, the Department will approve of her appointment as from the first of September next at the salary allowed. The McKenzie will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month less 10% for the current fiscal year. Our funds this year are extremely limited and the above amount is the full salary we can provide at this school for teaching services. If Mrs. McKenzie undertakes the duties as dispenser, she will be allowed salary at the rate of $60 per annum for that service - this being the same amount paid per Mr. Everett, the former teacher. The Department is informing Mr. Lavender, the local Indian Agent, of the approval granted for the appointment of Mrs. McKenzie and the salary that will be allowed her for her services as teacher and dispenser.\n\nWith reference to the repairs required to the buildings, I have to say the Department is requesting Mr. Agent Lavender to furnish a report, stating the work that should be carried out. Further, he is being asked to submit a recommendation as to the minimum furnishings that would be required, with the approximate cost of same. When this information is to hand, consideration will be given as to whether funds can be provided to effect any but minor repairs and what furnishings can be supplied.\n\nI shall be pleased if Your Grace will inform Mrs. McKenzie of her appointment and arrange with her to take up duties on or about the first of September, next.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMost Rev. I. O. Stringer, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, August 17, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land has nominated the services of Mrs. Catherine Ruth McKenzie for the position as teacher and dispenser at the Jack Head Indian Day School. The Department is approving of Mrs. McKenzie's appointment, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year, for her services as teacher. If she carries out the duties of dispenser, $50 per annum, less 10% for the present fiscal year, will be allowed her.\n\nMrs. McKenzie's husband, if unable to obtain employment elsewhere, will live with her at Jack Head. His Grace informs the Department that he has had a report from you regarding conditions at Jack Head and that you advised that a married couple be appointed. I may add, however, that it is not the general practice of the Department to appoint a married teacher when there are no duties for which the services of the husband could be engaged.\n\nHis Grace is being requested to notify Mrs. McKenzie of her appointment and to arrange with her to begin duties on or about September first, next. I would request that you give her every assistance you can in her work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H.

In talking over the question with your representatives here everyone seemed to agree that the wisest plan was to send if possible a married couple to this place, and I think we are doing the right thing. Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie will find it a little difficult financially but they are willing to undertake it.\n\nI hope your Department will do everything possible in making it easy for Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hardinge DD\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land\nBishop's Court\nWinnipeg\nMan.\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1937.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department has in mind certain activities which, it is hoped, will work for the betterment of the Indians on the Jackhead Reserve. In order to do this effectively, it is believed that if Mr. G. McKenzie, at present teacher at the Jackhead C. E. Indian Day School, were transferred to the position of teacher of the Brokenhead Indian Day School, it would be of considerable benefit, as we understand that both Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie are extremely interested in community work.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will find it possible to agree to transferring Mrs. McKenzie to Brokenhead from September 1st, 1937. The salary allowed at Jackhead has been at the rate of $900 a year and at Brokenhead $950 a year. In the event of Mr. Sage, the present teacher at Brokenhead, being transferred to Jackhead, the Department would be prepared to allow him the same as he has been paid at Brokenhead. Possibly, it would prefer to transfer Mr. Sage to some other reserve and send the teacher from that reserve to Jackhead. The Department would have no objection to this action.\n\nAs soon as you have had an opportunity of considering this matter, I would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

Sage is efficient, both as a clergyman and competent Teacher at Brokenhead; indeed I am administering Confirmation to no less than twenty-six of his parishioners, Indians and others, on May 11th. I feel it will be disadvantageous to both the school and the parish at Brokenhead to remove Mr. Sage at this particular time to Jackhead unless he himself expresses the desire for a change.\n\nI am anxious to fall in with the wishes of the Indian Department as far as possible and perhaps another change might be equally as acceptable to the Department. Could we consider possible changes in the Missions of Jackhead and Sandy Bay.\n\nI am,\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The cultivation of community gardens and an extension of farm operations occupy a very conspicuous place in the programme we are about to adopt. The suggestion was made to us that the teacher now at Jackhead and his wife would be very valuable at Brokenhead, in the encouragement of garden operations and in the supervision of agricultural operations, generally. In view of your comment, however, we have no desire to press the matter at this time. I do hope, though, that we shall have the active cooperation of all missionaries in the promotion of our programme. With the cost of commodities steadily increasing, I feel that our Indians must be encouraged to produce more vegetables and cereals for their own use.\n\nMay I thank you very heartily for your prompt response to my enquiry.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

I have an housekeeper and non-official helper, my 18 yr old daughter, Miss Audrey Jeffery. We also the only whites on this River. This is my first experience in work of this nature.\n\nAlong the Jackhead river, a small stream emptying into Jackhead Bay, a long shallow bay dotted with reefs & boulders, an indentation of Sialis Bay proper, on West shore Lake Winnipeg about 15 Mi North & Northeast. There is no post mail service, nor any regular transportation. Personal arrangements are made with individual Indians in these respects. Only sailing ships are the only craft that navigate in and around the River. No power boats come in if they can avoid it, and if they do come in, invariably get out of the bay before dark, as very poor anchorage, and a low N.E. storm would very likely pile up the boat on the rocks or shallows. There is consequently very little contact with outsiders.\n\nPopulation:\n\nAbout 110 all told; men women and children. Tribal origin & speech Salteaux. Practically none of the grandparents or grandmothers speak.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6236, file 518-1, part 1)\nany English; many of the fathers and mothers do not either. Some of the younger men who go out working\u2014principally with the Icelandic fishing outfits\u2014speak some English, but none fluently and very few can read it with in English. The children starting school speak only Icelandic. All depend on subsistence, and I believe judge that about 80% of the Band's living is derived from this industry. Scarcity of fuel has been a serious handicap to a promising point. Food and clothing are ever present problems, preserving and insuperable. Living standards are of a primitive order.\n\nAgriculture:\n\nNo attempt is made to farm. Some families have very small garden plots 25x30 ft. mostly. In these they plant a few potatoes, when seed can be had. No fertilizing has been done, they are often late in their cultivation, weeding etc., and results are often poor. No work of any kind has been done for three seasons on the School & Mission Cottage gardens. I find that \"quick lime\" has taken quite hold, but I have turned the land over, gathered manure, and purpose to plant potatoes & a few small seeds and grain for a start. Land is generally light and sandy. Easily cultivated but requires constant fertilizers and plenty of rain.\n\nA few cattle about 15 head run on the Reserve, one cow, bull aged 7 or 8, bull about 3 years old. Cattle thin, good size & condition, run out all summer and most of the winter. There are no horses on the reserve. All hay is made and harvested by hand. Two oxen have been helping to work.\nsingly-they never work double. Used princi-\npally to haul out wood in winter. Machinery con-\nsists of one boat wagon-set of sleigh-couple\nof plows-a mould-pan. These two latter are\nin very poor condition and have not been\nused for a long time.\n\nCommunity Work and Social Service.\n\nMuch of this is centred in the Anglican\nMission here, and carried into effect through\nthe local Women Church Auxiliary. My\ndaughter, who is managing President, Secretary\n& Treasurer of this organization has a large part\nin the direction and implementation of this\nwork. As the W.C. hold their meetings in our\ncottage, and as all the non-school age children\nas well as the babies attend with their mothers\nthere is no lack of contact with the families. As\nthe people are very kind they she has become\ngreatly interested in the work and seems to get\na great deal of pleasure out of it. In the\nschool and in visiting the homes, emphasis is\nalways on cleanliness & sanitation, on some\ntimes\u2014but not all\u2014are very dirty & squalid.\n\nBuildings.\n\nPoveshell's new log church, approx 20x30 ft.\nLog school.

I presume that you received your cheques while you were attending the University of Manitoba and feel that an explanation should be forwarded here concerning this matter.\n\nTo summarize, you left your Welfare position without permission during the months of July and August and received a salary during these months when you were not engaged in teaching or welfare activities for the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The Department is approving of Mrs. McKenzie's appointment, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year, for her services as teacher. If she carries out the duties of dispenser, $50 per annum, less 10% for the present fiscal year, will be allowed her.\n\nMrs. McKenzie's husband, if unable to obtain employment elsewhere, will live with her at Jack Head. His Grace informs the Department that he has had a report from you regarding conditions at Jack Head and that you advised that a married couple be appointed. I may add, however, that it is not the general practice of the Department to appoint a married teacher when there are no duties for which the services of the husband could be engaged.\n\nHis Grace is being requested to notify Mrs. McKenzie of her appointment and to arrange with her to begin duties on or about September first, next. I would request that you give her every assistance you can in her work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H.
