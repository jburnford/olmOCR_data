COUNCIL.\n\nThe speech with which his name the Lord Mayor, Mr. Smith, opened the present session of the North-West Council contains very little of interest to the people of this district, except the reference to the Municipal and School Ordinances. Both of these Ordinances are now in need of amendment, and the Council should endeavor to put them in a workable condition at once.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance to us to have good schools, and to have good schools we must have a good school law. If the Public School system was in its infancy there might be some excuse for the Ordinance which at present governs the schools of our Territorial District. But with the experience of the whole of America before them, there is no excuse for the Council not putting a good workable system upon the statute books. The general principles of which the Ordinance is based are excellent, but the minor details upon which the working of the system depends are very faulty. The fact that the Ordinance was not revised in town as well as in rural communities seems to have been lost sight of altogether, but it will have to be remembered in amending the Ordinance or it will still be unsatisfactory. The Council will in their regular business meet more frequently in their labors by the practical information which has been obtained from the school boards already organized.\n\nAlthough the Municipal Ordinance shows signs of being drawn by a more skilled draftsman or from a better model than the School Ordinance, there is a great deal of room for amendment in it also. Certain powers should be given to Town Councils, and others taken away, raising a question thus by direct action, which is always a heavy burden upon early settlers, and is especially apt to retard the growth of a new town. Large portions of the revenues of towns in the east are raised by fees for licenses, and duties laid for infringements of laws made and enforced by the Town Councils. It is the intention of the North-West Council to levy shop, auctioneer and other licenses in order to the raising of revenue for municipal purposes. The Town Council, the only legislative body which is likely to be elected, has made a request for some time to come for billiard tables and arcana. These are at present issued by the Lieutenant-Governor to raise revenue for territorial purposes, and the power to issue a list of licenses which are not likely to be in demand until there is a much greater population than at present is given to Town Councils. The Councils are far too weak to make laws on the Territories if the power to issue all these licenses, within their own limits was delegated to Town Councils in order to assist them in raising a revenue for municipal purposes. The satisfactory and efficient habitation for municipal elections would be another amendment that would improve this Ordinance.\n\nAlthough there are at present a majority of elected members in the Council, it can hardly be called a representative or responsible body, with eight appointed members, none of whom has two votes, and who are all dependent upon the Government at Ottawa for their bread; it must of necessity be the creature of the Minister of Justice. This system might work very well among the natives of India, but in free America it is not to be tolerated, and the \"servile\" of the Territories should each vote twice to be satisfied any longer with the shadow of responsible government.\n\nA circulating itinerant connection with the Presbyterian Church is doing good work amongst the Indians. We commend the scheme, and hope some of the surplus cash in town might be put to a similar use.\n\nThe Mansehows say\u2014Mr. Page, president of the Regina and Long Lake Railway, is rapidly in proving his health. He states that tracklaying on the Regina and Long Lake Railway has now reached the Qu'Appelle Valley. It is now intended by the company to have a steamer on Long Lake in the spring, which will run from the Qu'Appelle valley about six miles north. This will greatly facilitate travel between the Canadian Pacific and Prince Albert and Battleford. It is also expected that the railway will be pushed on to the Saskatchewan next season.\n\nConsiderable talk has been indulged in during the past week about the uneasiness manifested amongst the Indians, and we believe not without foundation. This state of affairs is very detrimental to the trade and commerce of the North-West. It is now gladly to be regretted that B Battery has been removed from our midst. We think that steps should be taken immediately to secure its return. At present there has only a small force of Mounted Police, and a limited number of arms, and in case trouble should arise assistance could not be rendered in reasonable time, being so far from reasonable communications.\n\nThere is great excitement in Regina over a sentence which Judge Traverse passed upon Mr. J. Clark, one of the commissioners of that town. It appears that the N. W. M. Police have been in the habit of entering and searching the premises of any person suspected of having liquor in his possession without a permit, and when such a search is made and a man has finally decided whether the Police had this power, Mr. Clark refused to allow two policemen in plain clothes and without a search warrant to search his store. For this refusal he was tried and convicted of assault and sentenced to six months imprisonment. The Town Council passed a resolution, in which the sentence was referred to as \"unjust, severe and arbitrary,\" and a deputation was sent to Ottawa and interview the Minister of Justice for the purpose of having the imprisonment reduced. A large sum of money was raised by the expenses of the delegate to Ottawa. This is not the first occasion on which Judge Traverse has come into conflict with the people of Calgary and accused the settlers with which he has met with punishment. Shortly before that he had sentenced a prisoner to a long term of imprisonment for a minor offence, but he afterwards wrote to the Minister of Justice that he would reduce the sentence. It is, but since the actions of the people in the Clark case, he has telegraphed the Minister to leave the sentence as it is. We are sorry for the residents of the Calgary district that they have not felt justified in congratulating themselves that Judge Rouleau choose to remain in this district when the chance of either remaining here or taking the Calgary district was given him when the fourth appointment for the Territories was appointed.\n\nDRY LUMBER.\n\nMOORE & MACDOWALL\n\nWish to inform the Public that they have on hand and for sale a Half Million Feet of Dry Lumber, consisting of Matched, Dressed and Undressed.\n\nDressed Flooring, $48\nUndressed do., 42\nDressed Siding, 48\nUndressed do., 42\nSheeting, 30\nCommon Lumber, 35\nDimension do., 40\n\n\"Over 11 feet extra.\"\n\nLath, 75 cts. per bundle.\nShingles, $6 50 per M.\n\nWe are prepared to Contract for Buildings as cheaply as any firm in Town.\n\nBuilders paying Cash or giving good security for LARGE Orders, will have a reduction made.\n\nTHOS.

Malo has a specimen of native flour from red file wheat, grown at Hartney's farm last fall, which he finds very superior in color and quality with the best Winnipeg flour. The return was 190 pounds of flour to two and three quarters bushels of grain.\n\nBATTLEFORD.\n\nFrom the Herald.\n\nBATTLEFORD, Nov. 28.\u2014Wagons by the hundred are now coming in, all filled with goods, and they have been going down the river for weeks.\n\nA completely established post and agency building is among the industries established here this fall.\n\nAn agent resides for the officers and a smithy is being erected in course of erection for the purpose of blacksmithing.\n\nThe patients in the police hospital have been removed to the building carried and will shortly occupy by Constable Guthrie.\n\nMore building timber has been brought into town during the past month than in any similar period in the history of the town.\n\nThe Industrial School has been removed to its present location, the house lately occupied by Mr. Ross. Mr. Ross's house is to be made for Principal's residence, and the schoolroom is part of the school, when the house at present occupied will be converted into a school room and storehouse.\n\nFORT MELROD.\n\nFrom the Gazette.\n\nFort Melrod, Nov. 17.\u2014It has been decided to build the Methodist churches at Melrose and Lethbridge, although money has been subscribed at both places, and teachers will soon be called there.\n\nWhile A. F. Gray was putting up new chimneys at the barracks on Tuesday morning, the iron hooks on the end of the ladder broke off, and fell to the ground a distance of about fifteen feet. He was rendered unconscious by the fall, and has been obliged to keep his bed for some days.\n\nOn Thursday night eleven persons took advantage of the darkness, a few miles below town, and ran off. At midnight the people on the range were called, the guns were loaded, and the sound of the horses' hoofs was heard. The men were let down, hid beside the fence, and the horses driven away. An opening was made in the fence, and the men were lifted over. They were only in the middle of the trail near the corner. This was evidently a very clumsy attempt at escape, as it appeared well known that the line was too wide.\n\nQUAPPILLI.\n\nFrom the Progress.\n\nQuappilli, Nov. 20.\u2014H Battery is now in comfortable quarters.\n\nGENERAL NEWS.\n\nPORT MOODY, B.C.\n\nFrom the Gazette.\n\nPort Moody, B.C., Nov. 14.\u2014There are now four boats of Indians brought back by Mr. Macdonald.\n\nThe mountain peaks north and east of here have received a fresh coat of snow.\n\nWest bound train No. 2 on Sunday last came into collision with a hand car loaded with logs, killing the engineer and fireman.
