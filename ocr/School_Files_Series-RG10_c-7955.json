Owing to the unsafe conditions of travelling my wife and I have been prevented from completing the journey to Cedar Lake, and thus prevented from entering on my duties through no fault of my own.\n\nDuring our residence in this place I have paid visits to the Indian Reserve and visited the schools there to study the methods employed in the schools and assisted in any way I could.\n\nIn view of this and the expense involved by our being held up here through no fault of our own, I desire to apply that my stipend commence from Monday November 10th.\n\nThe continuance of our journey to\nCedar lake must necessarily depend on the weather, but a start will be made as soon as it is found that travelling is safe, and I give assurance that the school will be opened and duties commenced immediately after my arrival there.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\nDonald Banks\n\nCertified\nRural Dean Jason\nThe Pas, Man\nSir,\n\nIn reference to letter 128/4/1 of the 25th ult., regard the appointment of Mr. Donald Banks to the position of teacher at the Chemawawin Indian Day School. I beg to state that this gentleman has been in The Pas since November 6th.\n\nI received the telegram from the Department authorizing an advance for transport of Mr. Banks and his wife to the reserve, and this will be attended to when the weather turns colder. The ice on the rivers and lakes is not fit to travel on with dog transport yet, and there are no signs of a cold spell, so Mr. Banks may be held in The Pas for a couple of weeks yet. In this connection I beg to enclose an application from this teacher that his salary should commence on November 10th, as it was no fault of his that he could not open school at that time.\n\nAs I mentioned in my telegram to the Department, this man is very hard up, and if he eventually reaches Chemawawin Indian Reserve and starts the school I will make a recommendation regards his application for salary to commence from November 10th. I will not do anything in the matter until he goes to work.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnc. 1.\nOttawa, December 10, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, regarding the appointment of Mr. D. Banks to the position as teacher of the Chemawawin Indian Day School, and informing the Department as to the date upon which he opened the school and began duties. In reply I beg to say that the Department will allow Mr. Banks salary from the 10th of November last, as it is noted that he was ready to proceed to the school on that date, but was unable to do so, owing to travelling conditions.\n\nPlease inform Mr. Banks that his salary will date from the 10th ultimo. He should prepare a return, showing the attendance and days taught by him at the end of the present quarter and send it through your office to the Department, in order that the balance of the salary due him for the current quarter as well as the bonus can be paid him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

An allowance was made on the list for a new school; if possible, I would like to know at an early date, if the amount will be allowed, as the Indians will have to take out the logs during the winter, as they have agreed to furnish logs and labor. It also found that the scale in use at Chemawawin is absolutely useless, and that a Butcher Knife and two Padlocks are requested for the Dispensary and the school. If the Department can supply a platform scale, capacity 240#, I would recommend that it be shipped from Winnipeg, as there are none procurable here; the other items could be purchased here.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSLM(H)\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nIndian Affairs.

The old school is in very bad shape and liable to collapse at any time. The band have 50 spruce logs on the ground, 25 of them being 30 ft long and 25 18 feet. This would make a school 18 x 30 outside, and say a 10 ft wall. The old floor will be used also the V Joint inside.\n\nThey wish assistance from the Department to the following extent:\n\n- 8000 shingles $60.00\n- 34 lbs 2 x 4 14 ft $24.00\n- 17 \" 2 x 6 18 \" $9.00\n- 2 windows 12 x 14 6 lights $5.00\n- 2 sets Frames $5.00\n- 1000 ft inside boards $40.00\n- 200 ft siding $12.00\n- 4 rolls tarpaper $6.00\n- 200# nails from shingle to 5 in. $14.00\n- 10 bushels of lime $5.00\n\nWm Captain, an ex-pupil, will do the carpenter work on the school for $10.00 if the following tools are furnished him free:\n- 2 claw hammers, 2 handsaws, 1 cross cut saw,\n- 1 Jack Plane, 1 smoothing plane, 1 square, 1 level) $19.00\n- Red paint for roof and paint for inside $50.00\n- Freight on material, say $50.00\n\nThis will be a cheap school when finished, and I would recommend that Agent Waddy be instructed to buy the material required and let the job of building to Wm. Captain so that the school may be finished this fall.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nDeputy Assistant/Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should obtain competitive prices, if possible, and make the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nIt is also noted that the teacher requests that a teacher's desk and chair be supplied. You may obtain prices for the supplying of a teacher's desk similar to that described in the catalogue of the Christie School Supply Co., Brandon, as their No. 10 Sanitary Desk, and for a Teacher's Arm Chair, No. 10, and arrange for the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nYou may also purchase 80' rope for the flag pole, 2 axe handles, and 1 wash basin.\n\nWhen the above purchases have been made, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nWe are sending you a 6' Union Jack for the use of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

WADDY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1927, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE CHEMAWAWIN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school requires two closets. They would cost $50 delivered at the school I estimate. The present arrangement they have is not sufficient. This school should be plastered and have the door fixed. The floor is also wearing out, but this will stand a while yet. I do not like to ask for expenditure on this building as they should have a better building there. Then again it looks like poor business to put up a school if the people have to leave the district twice annually to make a living and have no pupils at the school for months. However, I cannot see that we can get away from the expense of plastering it.\nOttawa, June 22nd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to your report on your inspection of the Chemawawin Indian Day School for the month of June in which you state that two closets are required and that the cost would be approximately $50 delivered at the school, I beg to say that you may arrange to have two closets furnished and placed in a suitable location near the school. You may also arrange to have the door fixed.\n\nAfter the closets have been installed and the door repaired, you should forward a certified account, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nRelative to the plastering required to the school building, I have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the cost of having this work done and for any other minor repairs in making this building comfortable. This matter should receive your early attention.\n\nI have also to request that you will state whether you have arranged for the purchase of the teacher's desk and chair as authorized in official letter of April 7th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Pas, Man., June 30th, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to your letter No. 128/4/5 of June 22nd, 3rd paragraph. I estimate that at least $75.00 would be required to plaster this school and affect minor repairs required.\n\nIn reference to the 4th paragraph. I beg to state that the desk and chair authorized were supplied to the school this month, by first boat.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 6th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, giving an estimate of the plastering required at the Chemawawin Indian Day School building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have this work carried out during the present summer holidays. The total cost of material and labour should not exceed your estimate of approximately $75.\n\nYou should also arrange to have the closets installed and the door fixed as authorized in official letter of June 22nd.\n\nWhen all this work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nIt is noted that the desk and chair which you were authorized to supply this school have been forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. H. P. Barrett is in charge and has rendered good service, although he is not a qualified teacher. This is an out of the way place, and it would perhaps be more difficult to obtain qualified teachers for this point.\n\nThe roll calls for 24 pupils and 23 were present. When the parents are home, the attendance at this school is usually quite good. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\n- Grade I - 10\n- Grade II - 6\n- Grade III - 8\n\nThe children, as you will note, are not very far advanced, but appear to understand the work given them and are not as shy and backward as one might expect. They speak out quite well when questioned and their reading can be heard fairly distinctly.\n\nThe building is of log construction, quite large, and in fair repair. It is an old style school with windows on both sides. The building is whitewashed inside and out, and presents a good appearance.\n\nWith the present enrolment the school lacks one desk and two seats. Homemade benches are being used at the present time. Biscuits are served as a lunch.\n\nA. S. Williams, Esq.,\nActg. Deputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This house needs repairing around the foundation, and the interior should be painted. Mr. Barrett takes excellent care of all the Government property, and although he is a bachelor, I have always found the house clean and very tidy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI visited this school on March 7th. Mr. H. P. Barrett is the teacher in charge and fair progress is being made. There are 22 on the roll, and the grades are arranged as follows:\n\n- Grade I - 8\n- Grade II - 7\n- Grade III - 5\n- Grade IV - 2\n\nThe average attendance for the December quarter was 20.4. The children appeared fairly well along in their grades. They are somewhat shy, due to the fact that they rarely have an outsider visit the reserve. However, they appear to understand when questioned and reply in an intelligent manner. They were somewhat poorly clad, but clean in person and in most cases their hair was neatly combed.\n\nThe children receive a lunch at noon, consisting of hot cocoa and biscuits.\n\nThe school is a large log building with windows on both sides, but fairly well preserved, and the teacher stated that he found no difficulty in heating it during the cold weather.\n\nThe teacher's residence is in good repair, but is badly in need of paint. No decorating has been done.\n\nDr. Harold W.

It is noted that the pupils, under the charge of Mr. H. P.

(RG 10, Volume 6230, file 506-5, part 2)\nExtract from report of Mr. Halcrow regarding his survey of the Chemahawin Reserve:\n\nI also examined the school building which is in a very bad state of repair. The building, being old, it would be both expensive and difficult to put it into a state that would be safe and satisfactory as a school room. It could, however, be fixed up to be used as a warehouse for the storage of supplies. I might say it would be quite easy to get logs, located only two miles from the present school, which could be used for the walls of a new school. The Indians could do all this work.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 128-4-5, dated the 17th ultimo, in connection with school building for Chemawawin Reserve, Cedar Lake.\n\nThis school building is not in the best condition, but it is certainly not the worst one we have got. I have put in the estimates for 1940, a School for Red Earth and this is far more urgently required than one at Cedar Lake.\n\nLumber could not be taken down there before May, after the river is free from ice.\n\nAs regards using the old building for a warehouse, Mrs. Gowans is looking after our issues and drugs on Chemawawin Reserve and she lives quite a distance from the School house. At present the Department's supplies are stored in a warehouse belonging to the Hudson's Bay Co. This is handy and they charge us no rental and the arrangement has proved satisfactory to date.\n\nIt was my intention to ask for a school house for the Chemawawin Reserve in the estimate of 1941-42 and I still recommend that that course be adopted. It is almost impossible for me to superintend several buildings being put up in the same year, which are situated a couple of hundred of miles apart and to which travel is difficult.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to Rev.

Yule's report for the month of March, 1944, on The Pas Agency.\n\nWhen we reached Cedar Lake we found the teacher and preacher, Rev. Barrett, in school. It so happens that this is the first time I have visited this reserve during the school year. I must confess that both the building and the furniture were a shock to me. The building is not properly lighted and is thirty-five or forty years of age. There were even some broken panes of glass. Several of the seats the children were in were homemade and not suitable.\nOttawa,\nApril 26, 1946.\n\nMr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas, Man.\n\nThe Department has recently received Doctor Yule's report in connection with his recent visit to the Chemawawin Day School. In this regard he writes as follows:\n\n\"When we reached Cedar Lake we found the teacher and preacher, Rev. Barrett, in school. It so happens that this is the first time I have visited this reserve during the school year. I must confess that both the building and the furniture were a shock to me. The building is not properly lighted and is thirty-five or forty years of age. There were even some broken panes of glass. Several of the seats the children were in were homemade and not suitable.\"\n\nPlease let me know what can be done this summer to improve conditions at this school and at the same time you should let me have an estimate of the expenditure that would be required.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIn reply to your letter dated April 26, 1944, No. I28-4-5. This School is an old building and I did not want to do much repair work until after the War, then I would suggest that a new building be built. The windows have been repaired and the glass had been sent down but had not been put into place at the time of Dr Yules visit.\n\nRegarding the seats a few are home made but answer the purpose for the time being. I was given to understand we could not get new seats owing to the War.\n\nI would like to lime wash and chink up the School also do some minor repair work on the toilets. I estimate the cost of the above work at approximately forty dollars.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nS. Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 9, 1944.\n\nMr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $40 for making minor repairs to the Chemawawin Day School. If the glass has not been put in the windows, you should arrange for having this work done at once.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI submit the following report on the schools in The Pas Agency, inspected during the Treaty Payment from June 1st until June 15th.\n\nCedar Lake School:\n\nRev. Mr. Barrett is in charge here. He has carried on the work at this point for about fourteen years and is highly respected both by the Indians and whites.\n\nThe school attendance is good and the children do nice book work. They were all well dressed and clean. The health was good and the children are apparently well fed.\n\nThe school building is past repairing and should be discarded. A new school building is urgently needed. The stove is warped and unsafe. A new one should be provided. New seats and desks are also needed. At present biscuit boxes are used as seats and many of the desks are home-made from rough lumber. The teacher's chair has the back off and this is the only one in the school.\n\nThe school residence should be painted both inside and out. No painting has been done to this building for years; in fact, it has not been repainted since it was built many years ago. The foundation is breaking away and it may be necessary to renew this altogether.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, June 29, 1944.\n\nMr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas, Manitoba,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from Inspector Hamilton, with reference to the Chemawawin Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Hamilton states that the stove is unsafe and should be replaced and that new children's desks and teacher's chair are needed. Please let me know the type of stove that is required and if you can purchase one locally. Also let me know its cost. At the present time school desks can only be secured in three sizes, namely, large, medium and small. Please let me know the number of each size that you think is required.\n\nMr. Hamilton also states that the school residence should be painted inside and out. Please let me know the approximate cost of doing work of this nature.\n\nThe foundation of the teacher's residence is breaking away and should either be repaired or renewed. An estimate of the cost of this should be supplied for our consideration.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Pas, Man.,  \nAugust 8, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nIn reply to your letter L28-4-5, dated June 29th, 1944, in connection with Chawawwin Day School,\n\nThe type of stove required would be one similar to the Oakwood Box Stove No. 236. This is a wood burning box stove and was sold by the T. Eaton Co. two years ago for $18.00. It may cost more now. In addition there would be the stove pipes and cost of freight to Red Earth. The number of the stove in T. Eaton's Catalogue of the winter of 1942-43 was 45-L206 on page No. 404. We would require 14 lengths of stove pipe 6 inch and two elbows 6 inches.\n\nWe would like 30 single desks, 6 small, 18 medium and 6 large.\n\nRegarding painting the school residence inside and out, the painting could be done as soon as the teacher returns which will be early next month. The cost of the material and labour will be about $100.00. I will get this done if you will send me the necessary authority.\n\nWith reference to the foundation for the teacher's residence, we are asking for a new school for Chawawwin for next year and it will be cheaper if we do the foundation of the teacher's residence at the same time. I will put this item in the estimates.\n\nS. Lowell,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nIn reply to your letter 128-4-5, dated the June 29th, 1944, in connection with Chemawwin Day School.\n\nThe type of stove required would be one similar to the Oakwood Box Stove No. 230. This is a wood burning box stove and was sold by the T. Eaton Co., two years ago for $18.00. It may cost more now. In addition there would be the stove pipes and cost of freight to Red Earth.

Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, regarding the Chemawawin Day School, you may purchase the box stove from the T. Eaton Company at approximately $20.\n\nWe are requesting the Departmental Purchasing Agent to secure the desks.\n\nYou may also incur an expenditure of $100 for material and labour in painting the interior and exterior of the teacher's residence.\n\nR.A.

There are no decorations, nor is any attempt made to improve the attractiveness of the school. Although window space is very small (ratio floor area to glass area: 11 : 1) one window has been blocked in with logs and clog. Floors sag badly. School was quite warm and comfortable at time of my visit. Interior and exterior whitewash finish.\n\nThere are no outhouses of any kind and children use space behind a large rock about 20 yds. from the school. There are no washing or drinking facilities, and no supply of water is kept in the school. I find this condition to exist in many of the schools in the north. It seems useless to teach principles of cleanliness by word of mouth, but provide none of the facilities necessary to put these principles into action in the classroom. I know that you will make basins, soap, etc. available upon requisition. It might be advisable to call attention to this matter in subsequent issues of the Bulletin.\n\nThe blackboards consist of two pieces of cloth 3' x 7', badly checked and glazed.\nOttawa, March 26th, 1947.\n\nMr. Samuel Lovell, Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nReporting on his inspection of the Chemawawin School, Inspector Bateman writes as follows:\n\n\"There are no outhouses of any kind and children use space behind a large rock about 20 yds. from the school.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from memorandum from Dr. F. E. Moore, Director of Indian Health Services, dated 15 September 1947.\n\nGrand Rapids\n\nRation House and School:\n\nWhen I see these buildings I am not at all proud of our Department. We should set an example and we certainly not doing it here. However, any comments I shall make are purely from a health angle. There has been a lot of rain recently and I discovered that the ration house leaks in places, the plaster has fallen away from between the logs which must allow both rain and snow to penetrate. At one corner the logs are so rotted that the dogs had dug a hole large enough for them to enter and steal some of the bacon. The man has repaired this opening temporarily with tin and stones.

(RG 10, Volume 6230, file 506-5, part 2)\nExtract from Regional Supervisor Davis' reports dated January 4th on the Chemawawin Indian Day School.\n\nThere are 43 children of school age and 15 non-treaty children. We are at present operating a Church of England school at this point. Mr. Taylor, the teacher, is a man of 77 years of age, but very young for his years. The present school is an old log building, falling to pieces and in very poor state of repair. Glass in the windows was broken and the building had not been put in shape at all for the winter. I instructed Mr. Law to see that this work was done at once, so it would be in condition and make it possible for the teacher to carry on if very cold weather came. It would be impossible to hold school in it in its present condition. There is a total population at this point of 80 half-breeds. I would recommend that, if possible, some arrangements be made for a joint school. If it would be possible to have the school operate under the Province it would be more satisfactory - we giving a grant towards the building. If this cannot be done, it will be very necessary that we build a school at this point as soon as possible, as the present old building will not be fit to teach school in for another year. At the time of my visit there were 26 children in the schoolroom and it was very overcrowded. The teacherage is an old building and the property of the Church.\nApril 23, 1949.\n\nMr. E. Law,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nChemawawin Indian Day School.\n\nMajor Clark and I have just finished discussing your letter of March 29th with attached correspondence from Mr. Taylor.\n\nWe are agreed with your recommendation that a new teacherage should be built with the school. Attached please find plan 888 which is the type of school which we propose erecting at Chemawawin.\n\nYou have probably received from Mr. Davis the information reports which each superintendent is required to submit concerning his various construction projects for next year. We will expect to receive these from you concerning Chemawawin when its erection can be given further consideration.\n\nConcerning the site Mr. Taylor's recommendation would seem to be satisfactory. You will note that plan 888 does not call for a basement, so we would not have to worry about excavation. I note that you will be checking on this site in the near future.\n\nBernard F.

It is our intention to follow the identical plan for these three projects. Due to transportation difficulties, we arranged to ship in, by tractor train during the last winter, complete bills of materials for God's Lake and Oxford House. These materials are now on site ground at the sites selected for these schools.\n\nThe materials for Cheumawin, which is on Cedar Lake in The Pas Subdivision, are now being ordered by the Departmental Purchasing Agent and will be shipped by barge from The Pas in the near future.\n\nMr. Regional Supervisor Davis has been approaching contractors who specialize in construction work in Northern Manitoba. As a result, he has been able to obtain the following labour tenders for the construction of these three schools:\n\n| Contractor          | God's Lake | Oxford House | Cheumawin |\n|---------------------|------------|--------------|-----------|\n| E. Robison          | $5,000.00  | $6,000.00    | $ -       |\n| Matthews Construction Co. | $5,900.00  | $5,900.00    | $5,900.00 |\n| Evers Brothers      | $6,800.00  | $6,800.00    | $6,400.00 |\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6230, file 506-5, part 2)\nIt would seem evident that we can eliminate immediately the highest tenderer, namely Evers Brothers, of Flin Flon, Manitoba.\n\nGod's Lake\nAt God's Lake, Mr. Sebastion's tender is the lowest and I feel it should be accepted. Mr. Davis has some doubts about Mr. Sebastion as a contractor but we have investigated his ability through Indian Health Services. Mr. Sebastion was employed by them last year and I attach a letter from C. J. Connolly, Supervising Engineer, of Indian Health Services, concerning his ability. I would recommend that the Minister approve the acceptance of his Labour Tender for the erection of this school in the amount of $5,000.00.\n\nOxford House\nThe lowest of the three tenders is that of the Matthews Construction Company, of The Pas, Manitoba, and I have prepared a draft submission to Council for your consideration. A contract has recently been let with this company for the erection of the Nelson House Indian Day School, by authority of P.C. 347 of May 17.\n\nChassawarin\nThe lowest tender for the erection of this school is again that of the Matthews Construction Company of The Pas, Manitoba. Therefore, you will find a joint submission to Council covering both the Oxford House and Chassawarin projects.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\nDEPARTMENT OF\nNATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nMay 2, 1949.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. H. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nMr. Elmer Sebastion was employed during our construction work period last summer and fall. He worked at Nelson House both on the nursing station and the erection of your day school. Afterwards he was moved to several places west as far as Driftpile, Alta.\n\nAs a carpenter we found his work quite satisfactory and he is capable of being a very good tradesman. I do not have any information of value concerning his integrity as a contractor as he only worked for us on day labour for an hourly wage. However, he seemed capable of getting the natives to do a fair amount of work in a day. I think on a fixed price he would take necessary action to encourage active activity from the natives, because of his own interests.\n\nC. J. Connolly,\nSupervising Engineer,\nIndian Health Services.\nJune 10, 1949.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT it is immediately necessary, and funds are provided in the 1949-50 Estimates, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, to complete the erection of a new-room Indian Day School on the Chassawin Indian Reserve, in The Pas Indian Agency, in the Province of Manitoba;\n\nTHAT it is essential that educational facilities be provided for the Indian children on the Chassawin Reserve;\n\nTHAT Section 36 of the Public Works Act, Chapter 166, R.S.C. 1937, provides in part as follows:\n\n\"Whenever any works are to be executed under the direction of any Department of the Government the Minister having charge of such Department shall invite tenders by public advertisement for the execution of such works except in cases (a) of pressing emergency in which delay would be injurious to the public interest ..........\";\n\nTHAT the building materials for this school are being ordered by the Departmental Purchasing Agent and will be shipped by barge from The Pas to the site of the school in the near future;\n\nTHAT, due to the very isolated situation of this Indian reserve, there are few builders or contractors in the area, and outside contractors are not interested, as they have all the work they can do in their own localities;\n\nTHAT, as the result of enquiries made by our field officials, we have been able to obtain the following labour tenders for the erection of this building:\n\nMatthews Construction Company, The Pas, $5,900.00\nEnzy Brothers, Flin Flon, $6,400.00\n\nTHAT the lower tenderer, namely the Matthews Construction Company of The Pas, Manitoba, has building crews in this region and is known to be a satisfactory and reliable contracting firm. This tender covers all transportation and boarding costs and is considered to be fair and reasonable.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that authority be granted for the erection of the Chassawin Indian Day School by the Matthews Construction Company of The Pas, Manitoba, at the price of five thousand nine hundred dollars ($5,900.00), this being the most suitable arrangement possible at the present time and it being essential that this work be undertaken at once and carried on to completion in order to provide educational facilities for the Indian children on this reserve in time for school opening in September.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed by him or his labourers wages according to the rates so fixed in the schedule or fixed thereby by the Minister of Labour, or order regarding overtime and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any money owing by the Government to the Contractor; and any such payment shall be an obligation between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post, and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of this contract in respect of wages and labour performed prior to execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the rates of wages and hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) that the full amount of the wages and labour remain in arrears; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such information and produce such evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of failure to make payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister shall pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable to the Minister under this contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payment for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights in respect of moneys so owing as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuse which might arise from subletting, the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, whether in whole or in part, is prohibited unless the approval of the Minister is obtained; subcontractors shall be bound in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractors; the contract shall not be assigned or partly thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada unless the Minister of Labour approves in writing that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

The Contractor shall at all times furnish the Minister such further detailed information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen employed have been paid upon the payment of the wages in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim referred thereto be made by the workmen concerned, and if a statement attested by statutory declaration satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) The conditions herein contained shall apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to prevent the difficulties above which might arise from subletting, the subdivision of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than such as may be customary in the trades concerned, is prohibited unless the approval of the Minister is obtained; and no subcontractor shall be permitted to contract for any portion of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractor; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister of Labour, portion of the work to be executed shall be carried out at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that certain special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

You do not state the date of the letter giving authority to you to purchase the wagon. However, in preparing the voucher you refer to hauling gravel for the new school.\n\nAs soon as the school is completed, the wagon will be of no use as far as the school is concerned, and consequently, it should not be necessary to pay the whole amount of the account from the appropriation for Indian Education. I presume that when the school is finished the wagon will be used for farm purposes.\n\nYou should let us know what portion you consider should be charged to our appropriation.\n\nBernard F.

The last information we received from you was in late October.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\ncc Mr. Davis\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Chemawawin Indian Day School\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of Department letter of December 16th, 1949 requesting Progress Report on the construction of the above mentioned school.\n\nYesterday I forwarded the following telegram:\n\n\"Forwarding final progress report re Chemawawin Indian Day School. I am withholding $500.00 from final payment until building completed satisfactorily.\"\n\nI am enclosing Progress Payment Report No. 4 and have altered same to read $900.00 instead of $1400.00. The reason for holding back $500.00 of final payment is that last week I visited Cedar Lake and inspected this school and I am not satisfied with finishing work to the interior, the whole interior has been painted white instead of colours shipped and there are still two windows with frames to be set in. Also there is poor joining in several instances which I think should be corrected before paying total of final payment.\n\nI do not believe that it will be possible to have the work on this building completed to my satisfaction before the end of the fiscal year, and would be obliged if you would advise how this will effect appropriation already made for the construction of this school.\n\nE.

However, according to the contract the fourth payment should be final. I have signed the Progress Payment #4 for your consideration. I do feel, however, that the contractor should be made to finish the work before receiving final payment.\n\nI had made arrangements to visit this school on my return from Norway House but when landing at The Pas we had an accident and, therefore, the plane was unable to proceed to Cedar Lake.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. G. E. Lloyd,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nMay I direct your attention once more to the need of a teachers house at Cedar Lake reserve. There is a small log house there at the present time which has been used by the last Indian teacher and it is not fit for any self respecting white teacher to live in.\n\nWe now have Mr and Mrs Banks actually at that Mission and both are First Class Teachers fitted to take a place in any High School in the Province.\n\nFrom all I can gather they seem to be really missionary hearted people who will put their heart into the work and not merely do the \"job for the pay\". That is the kind of teacher we are trying to avoid.\n\nBut if we get decent teachers we must give them a decent place to live in. At present they are living in a condemned Hudsons Bay house which the Hudsons Bay factor very kindly lent to them. It has not been in use for some years but even so was much better than either the school teachers house or the Mission house.\n\nWith kind regards and all good wishes for the New Year\n\nBelieve me to be\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGeorge Exton Lloyd\nBishop of Saskatchewan\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6230, file 506-8, part 1)\nOttawa, January 9, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan has informed the Department that the teacher's residence at the Chamsawin Indian Day School is a small log house with a small lumber addition, that it is alive with vermin and is not suitable for any self-respecting white teacher. I am informed that Mr. Banks, the present incumbent, and his wife are living at present in a condemned Hudson's Bay house which the factor has loaned to them. Bishop Lloyd states that this building is better than either the school teacher's residence or the mission house.\n\nWill you please intimate if the Department will have to erect a suitable teacher's residence if qualified services are to be retained. I should be grateful for a full report in this connection and for an estimate as to the number of Indian children that will be available during the next few years. If you recommend that a residence be provided, please state whether it should be log or frame and under whose direction it could be erected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D.

I note that the present teacher and his wife are living in a house which has been loaned to them by the Hudson's Bay. I am writing to Indian Agent Waddy for a full report as to the best method of solving the problem, and when I receive his report and Mr. Commissioner Graham's recommendation, Your Lordship will be further advised.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. G. E. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir:\n\nThe teacher at Chemawawin Day School reports that the building which was occupied by the last teacher at that point is not fit for occupation. He asks if the Department will construct a residence for him, this next summer. The cost of a residence such as he requires would be about $1600.00.\n\nThe old building he refers to is just an old shack. It is really not fit for habitation. I beg to recommend that this man be supplied with a residence as soon as funds will permit.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir;-\n\nIn reference to letter 128-4-8 of the 9th inst, regards residence for teacher at Chemawawin Reserve, I beg to say I took up part of this question in my letter #4064-105 written on the 8th inst.\n\nThe situation at Chemawawin is that the Church has a house there which is uninhabitable, and the Department has a small two roomed shack formerly used by Mr. J.G.Kennedy. I can understand that there is a complaint regards vermin in this place, as when I wrote letter #2538-105 on March 12th last, recommending discharge of the teacher, I had just got through a thorough disinfecting of my own person from the lice I had collected in the house at Chemawawin while visiting there a few days previous. If it was only a matter of vermin the place could be renovated and cleaned, but the old shack is really not fit for a residence.\n\nThe prospect for pupils is fair, the teacher should have 20 on the roll shortly. I have a good opinion of the new teacher, he is a smart chap, with a wife who wants to settle down for a time. I think if a house is built for him he will remain some years with the Department.\n\nA house could be put up for about $1600.00 including freight I estimate. There is no carpenter in the locality of Chemawawin, one or two would have to be sent down to do the work, unless the Department saw fit to give a contract for the work. There are so many ways in which carpenters can run up expense on a job when they are out of sight that in my opinion it would be well to consider a contractor to do the work. This would be a frame building.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary, I am Sir,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, your obedient servant,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 28, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your No. 4036-105 of the 20th instant, with reference to the teacher's residence at the Chemawaswin Indian Day School. The Department is recapitulating the information on file in a communication to Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, and asking for his recommendation. If any action is contemplated in the immediate future, you will hear from that office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

These workers both hold first-class teachers' qualifications and have taken the position largely because of their missionary spirit. In November, His Lordship reported that the teacher's house, which was a small log structure with a small lumber addition, was not fit to live in and urged the Department to provide a suitable residence. Mr. Indian Agent Waddy has also reported that the present building is an old shack, not fit for habitation. He reports that the new teacher and his wife are apparently excellent workers and would remain some years with the Department if a proper residence were provided. Mr. Waddy estimates the cost of a suitable frame residence at $1,600, including freighting.\n\nIn view of the advisability of retaining Mr. and Mrs. Banks in our employ, the Department would give favourable consideration to providing funds for the erection of a teacher's residence. Please let me have your recommendation at the earliest opportunity. I am informed that Mr. and Mrs. Banks are at present living in an old house, loaned to them by the Hudson's Bay factor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nW. M.

I also note that Mr. Waddy has reported on this building and has made a recommendation.\n\nI will have Mr. Inspector Christianson, when he goes to The Pas, look into this matter thoroughly, and I will forward you a report in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A.\nSir:\n\nIn reference to conditions at the day school at Chemawawin Reserve, I beg to report that there is an old shack there, formerly used by a native teacher. Last summer Bishop Lloyd asked me if I would try to get an appropriation to put a verandah on it, I did place a small sum in the estimates for that purpose.\n\nThen a teacher was employed and sent down to the Reserve, but the place was so dirty he could not live in it, he has been staying in an old H.B.Co's house, but this place is uninhabitable in summer as the old roof leaks, it is a make shift at the best.\n\nI understand that Bishop Lloyd took up with the Department the matter of a new dwelling at Chemawawin, he told the teacher that the subject was being favorably considered. I was down at the Reserve yesterday and found the teacher worried about where he is to stay. He is a first class man, married and has expectations of family very soon, and I would like to have the house built immediately if it is to be built.\n\nThe plans for Red Earth could be used, the price would be much the same, perhaps $50.00 less for freight or thereabouts.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\n(Sgd.) J.W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6230, file 506-8, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI am herewith attaching copy of a letter which I have just received from Mr. Waddy, our Agent at The Pas, in connection with a teacher's residence at Chemawawin Reserve. I might say that nothing was placed in the Estimates for a new building on this reserve. The only items were $250.00 for repairs to the house and $50.00 for the school.\n\nJudging by what the Agent says there is no doubt in my mind that if the school is going to be kept open, the house is needed. You will note Mr. Waddy states that it will cost practically the same as the house for Red Earth, or perhaps $50.00 less. There was an amount of $2500.00 allowed for this expenditure and the house is already under way. As near as I can figure at the present time, the cottage will cost about $1850.00. There will be a saving of from $600 to $650.\n\nFrom the Agent's letter I gathered that His Lordship Bishop Lloyd took the matter up with the Department. I should be pleased to have your instructions in the matter, and if the work is to be gone on with it would be well to advise me as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnc.\nMay 23, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nFor some time the Bishop of Saskatchewan has urged the erection of a teacher's residence at the Chemawawin Indian Day School, in The Pas agency. The item was crowded out of the 1925-26 Estimates. His Lordship, Mr. Commissioner Graham and Mr. Indian Agent Waddy all strongly recommend during the past few weeks that a teacher's residence be provided. Mr. and Mrs. Banks, the teacher and his wife, both hold first class certificates and are imbued with the missionary spirit. A residence is evidently necessary if their services are to be retained.\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham reports that he can effect a saving of $650 from the amount allowed for another school building in this agency and recommends strongly that he be given authority to proceed with the building, which will cost approximately $1700. I wish to recommend that authority be given. Approximately $2,000 of the amount voted for a laundry building at Ermineskin will not be needed and Mr. Graham could be informed that, because of this saving, the Chemawawin residence can be allowed.\n\nRussell T.

Further it is the only place available for Episcopal and Diocesan visitors to stay--this may also apply to treaty parties etc.\n\nWould it be possible for us to buy the house and we can then maintain it as a furnished centre, used by the missionary if required and available for official visitors. If this suggestion is feasible perhaps you could advise me as to the price the government would put on the building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nArchdeacon of Brandon.\n\nIAN:hs\nJanuary 13th, 1950.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Chemawawin Indian Day School\n\nPlease find attached in duplicate, a self-explanatory letter from Canon Norris, concerning the teacherage at Cedar Lake.\n\nNo doubt we will be receiving a recommendation from you in due course concerning this matter.\n\nBernard F.

Kind personal regards.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nJanuary 21st, 1950.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 14th with regard to the selling of the house formerly used by the teacher at Cedar Lake.\n\nI am of the opinion that we should not ask the Church for more than $50.00, although I realize materials in same is far greater. This is an old building and is very cold in winter. In setting this price I have taken into consideration the fact that Treaty Parties and Department Officials will be able to stop over in this building; also the fact that Mr. Nelson House the Church turned over to the Department all the material in teacherage there.\n\nTrusting price set meets with your approval.\n\nE. Law,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Chemawawin Indian Day School.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a letter received from Superintendent Law of The Pas Agency, recommending that we dispose of the old house used by the teacher at Cedar Lake.\n\nIn view of Mr. Law's letter, I would recommend that this building be sold to the Church at a cost of $50.00.\n\nR.

In this connection it is noted that you intend to commence teaching services about April 15th, next. You have not stated the length of time the school will be in operation. Last summer, it is noted, it was conducted for a two month period.\n\nThe Department will continue the grant for salary at the same rate as was allowed last year, viz.: $80.00 per teaching month, for a period not to exceed four months. This will be paid upon receipt of returns, showing attendance, days taught, etc. On the return, you should state definitely the date the school opened and also the date it was closed for the summer.\n\nIt is noted that a regular full-time school would meet with little success, as the parents remain at Churchill only during the summer months. It is noted, further, that the classroom activities will be conducted in the back portion of your church and that you, personally, have made desks and necessary equipment. The Department will be prepared to supply a reasonable quantity of classroom materials, such as texts, scribblers, pencils, etc., upon receipt of a requisition from you, regarding the supplies of this nature required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Two months' salary is the maximum that can be allowed.\n\nI enclose a supply of day school return forms which should be completed and forwarded when the school closes.

The building is reported to be in a bad state of repair and requires further equipment, but before authorizing any expenditure, the Department would like to know what prospect there is of the present teacher, Mr. Tobin, remaining in charge, as unless the school is to be regularly kept open, the Department does not feel like incurring any further expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6230, file 508-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th inst., No.11875, referring to the Indian school at Cross Lake. Having learned in the earlier part of the winter that the school was without a qualified teacher, Mr Joblin, the teacher at Norway House Boarding School, was sent as a temporary supply; his place being filled by another member of the staff. Subsequently another qualified teacher was secured, and he was sent to Cross Lake, Mr Joblin returning to his work at Norway House. I hope that this last appointment will prove to be permanent, and that there will be no further interruptions of the school work.\n\nI have reason to believe that the report concerning the school building is correct, and it is very desirable that the building should be thoroughly repaired, or, which would be still better, a new school house erected. We have given authority for the erection of a new place of worship, and will be glad to co-operate with the Department in any practicable way to put the whole property in such a shape that it may be a useful object lesson to the Indians. The work of the new church will be undertaken as soon as we can find a suitable person who can go in and supervise the construction, and\nperhaps it might be practicable for the Department to take action respecting the school building at the same time.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Dr Sutherland reports that the last teacher appointed will remain permanently, and in view of his statement, the Department would like to be furnished with an estimate of the probable cost of putting the old building in a suitable state of repair, or erecting a new schoolhouse.\n\nI may add that Dr Sutherland has advised the Department that the Methodist Missionary Society is undertaking the erection of a new Church, which will be commenced as soon as a suitable person can be obtained to supervise its construction, and he suggests that it might be practicable for the Department to take action respecting the schoolbuilding at the same time.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nHon.

We are pleased to learn that the Indian Commissioner has been asked to furnish an estimate for the new school building, or the cost of putting the present one into suitable repair. As to the assurance you ask for, that for the future the school will be placed in charge of a permanent teacher, I may say that such is our sincere desire and firm determination. Already we have given authority for the erection of a new place of worship, and will proceed with building operations as soon as we can find a person capable of undertaking the supervision of the same. We are anxious to have both church and school building ready for use as soon as possible, and shall use our best endeavors to secure suitable persons as permanent Supplies.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nThe Honorable the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAssociate Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have before me the Department's letter of the 6th ultimo with further reference to Mr. Fleetham's report on the Methodist School at Cross Lake, and conveying the purport of a report of the Rev. Dr. Sutherland respecting the same School. In the estimates for the current year $100.00 is provided for the repairing of the School building. $60.00 had already been expended in lumber through Mr. Semmens, and Mr. Fleetham is now arranging for the expenditure of the balance of the appropriation in the purchase of lime and nails and the employment of labor in making the necessary repairs. An additional sum of $50.00 is provided in the estimates for the incoming year to complete the work, and in Mr. Fleetham's opinion that amount will be sufficient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Indian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant with reference to repairs required for the Cross Lake school, and in reply I beg to say that if necessary $50.00 in addition to the $200.00 already provided in the current year's estimates, may be expended for this work.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This building is in very bad shape, and is not very well equipped. The teacher, Miss Stout, was on the reserve but, I understand, was on the point of leaving for Selkirk. There are a very large number of children on this reserve, and if the day school system is to be continued, a strong effort is to be made to have fully qualified teachers in charge of these two schools.\n\nThe logs for the new school building are on the ground and are a particularly fine set of logs. I have already reported this to you and asked that a voucher might be issued in favor of Mr. McIvor for this work. I instructed him to proceed at once with the building of the walls and am expecting a report on the progress in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nC.C. Calverley,\nAgent\nSir,\n\nAs there is no Teacher at CrossLake, I beg to recommend Miss Gaudin a daughter of the Revd Mr Gaudin Missionary at CrossLake. She I think is well fitted for the post as she has been educated at Toronto High School and has just come back.\n\nAltho she has no certificate as Teacher yet there are many such Teachers amongst the Indians and I think Miss Gaudin is just the one to teach the Indians as she has been brought up amongst them and knows the Indian children's ways &c.

Sir,-\n\nThe Department is advised by Mr. Agent Stewart that you sent in a teacher to Cross Lake by the last boat. The Department has no information of this and does not know the name of the teacher nor anything about his or her qualifications, etc.\n\nAs the Department reserves the right to make these appointments I have to request that in all cases you will be good enough to advise it as soon as you are in a position to make a nomination for any existing vacancy.\n\nNo payment of salary can be made until this information is received. This is one of the schools at which the Department has promised to meet the increase in salary asked for by the Missionary Society. Of course, it is understood that the increase will be dependent upon a suitable teacher being engaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nYour file number 118275/1.\n\nReplying to yours of the 17th instant, re teacher at Cross Lake, I sent in Miss Annie Cunningham, who holds a second class teacher's certificate and who has given excellent service as a teacher in other places. The salary promised her is $500.00.\n\nThe Department is fully aware of the great difficulty in securing teachers for these places, and I am very glad to engage and send them whenever I have suitable opportunity, for any vacancy in our work. This has to be all done before I can correspond with the Department. It is only about one out of ten that I correspond with that I am able to secure the services of.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The attendance has been fairly good this month, Madeline Ross, Marian McKay, Assail McKay, and Thomas Mallet attending full time.\n\nI understand that a greater number of the Protestant Indians have gone away this winter than formerly, consequently the number of school children is less. Those who are here, with the exceptions of two or three families live quite a long distance from the school.\n\nProgress. Those who have come regularly have made fairly good progress, I have been making a special effort in English, (name of objects, etc.) Standard (1) and English sentences, written and Oral in Standards (2) and (3).\n\nThe need of a good Blackboard has been, and is still a drawback. Some of the school supplies are also very scant.\n\nWhen cold it is quite impossible to have the school comfortable.\n\nCalisthenics. We have Calisthenics twice a day, part of which time was used for drilling before Christmas.

The material that I have here for Black-Boards is stiff and solid, making it unsuitable for shipment.\n\nThe class of material required for distant schools should be what is called Black-Board cloth, which rolls up and can be shipped to these distant schools in a small and handy package so that it will arrive at its destination in perfect order and condition. The material I have here cannot be shipped without being badly damaged in transit; it will do very well for the day schools in the immediate vicinity of the Agency here.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI have received a letter from Miss Cunningham, stating that she had not yet received her cheque for December quarter, 1912. It does seem a little unfortunate that she has not received her cheque yet, as Miss Ramsay the other teacher has received hers.\n\nRamsay letter to the Department, dated Dec. 23rd, 1912, No. 153. I notified the Department that Miss Ramsay had been sent out by the last boat by the Revd Mr Ferrier, this teacher's name is Miss A. Cunningham who takes the place of Miss Gaudin who was appointed by the Department at the Revd Mr Gaudin's request.\n\nThe Revd Mr Ferrier has written to Miss Cunningham that no cheques for June, Sept., and Dec. quarters have been received at the Mission rooms Toronto, for school teachers salary at Cross Lake. I might mention that the school was closed all summer till late in the fall. Miss Gaudin opened school sometime in September, and kept it open till the arrival of Miss Cunningham in October or the first part of November.\n\nMiss Cunningham's quarterly school return was posted here on the 23rd of January, at the same time as Miss Ramsay's return for the R.C. school according to letters on file in my office.\n\nLetter, No. 225, dated Jan. 23rd, 1913, Miss Cunningham's return forwarded. Letter, No. 244, dated Jan. 28th, 1913, Miss Ramsay's return forwarded.\n\nKindly let me know why this delay has occurred, as perhaps the Methodist denomination may think I am lax in my duty to them, which is far from being so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This cheque was for the sum of $125.00.\n\nNo returns were received for the June and September quarters, 1912, and consequently no salary was paid for those quarters.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Miss Cunningham that payment of all salaries for schools conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church is made to the Treasurer of the Missionary Society and not to the teachers direct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am of the opinion that it will not hurt these children to go to school in July as they lose lots of time during the winter through cold weather and storms.\n\nI would therefore recommend Miss Cunningham's application to teach the number of days in July that she wishes to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 28, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant in reference to Miss Cunningham's application that she be allowed to teach the Gross Lake School in July for sixteen days to complete her full teaching year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if the Indians are agreeable the Department will make no objection to this arrangement, if on the other hand they object it would be well to close the school at the time provided in the regulations and, in view of the difficulty in getting into Gross Lake and the time lost by Miss Cunningham in so doing, the Department will not deduct anything from her annual salary for these sixteen days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of letter in reference to Miss Cunningham's application; that she be allowed to teach the Cross Lake school in July for sixteen days to complete her full teaching year.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that on my arrival at Cross Lake shortly I will inform Miss Cunningham of your decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary Department,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. H.S. Wright an undergraduate and probationer for the Methodist Ministry, has been appointed as teacher for Cross Lake, and has already commenced work. You will get the school reports from him during the year.\n\nThe Hon. G.R. Coldwell, Minister of Education for Manitoba, visited Cross Lake a few weeks ago. He stated that if the people there who had white children of school age, would provide a place and desks for the white children the Educational Department would give them a grant towards the teacher's salary.\n\nThe proposition that came to me from the white population is that they will provide a suitable place for teaching both Indian and white children and the desks that will be necessary for the white children, if Mr. Wright is allowed to teach them. I understand that the building where the teaching is done for the Indian children is far from satisfactory. This proposition of the white people is not to build a new school, but to rent a house that is available, and they claim suitable.\n\nWould the Department consent to any dual arrangement of this kind, whereby the teacher appointed for the Indian school could also teach white children?\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6230, file 508-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the letter hereunder from the Rev. Mr. Ferrier regarding the proposition of the white settlers at Cross Lake to have their children educated in the Indian school I beg to say that from information on file in the Department it would appear that white children have been in the habit of attending this school. The teacher's report for last year shows that there were eight white children enrolled. The building in which the school is held is a very old log house said to be in wretched condition and not fit for use and only 22 by 30. There is an enrolment of Indians from 34 down to 14, while the average runs from 15 down to 6 at different times of the year.\n\nSchool should be held in a more suitable building and I cannot see any objection to the proposition made by the white settlers to provide a place for teaching both Indians and white children. They say that they can rent a building.\nbuilding and that they will supply the necessary desks for the white pupils.\n\nThe salary allowed by the Department for the teacher of this school is $500.00 per annum. There is nothing to show whether the teacher receives anything for the white children and Mr. Ferrier does not state whether they are prepared to pay a portion of the salary. I should take it that they consider that if they furnish the building that is all they should be expected to do. It would certainly be an advantage to the Indians to have white children in attendance, as they would pick up English more readily, and there are never more children in attendance at the school than the teacher can look after.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6230, file 508-1, part 1)\nOttawa, September 22, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant submitting a proposition made to you by the white settlers at Cross Lake to have their children educated in an Indian school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department consents to the dual education of white and Indian children and approves of the suggestion of the white settlers to provide the building. There is no mention made as to whether they would bear any portion of the cost of the salary of the teacher. The amount allowed by the Department for this school is $500.00 per annum and this is all it can contribute. The Department admits that it would be of benefit to the Indians to have white children in attendance and trusts that this arrangement will be carried out satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In the meantime, I would point out to the Department that in as much as we have a male teacher who is an undergraduate, in the person of H.T. Wright, the salary I asked for him commencing with Sept. 37 was Six Hundred Dollars, which was consented to by the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTP/JM.\nOttawa, November 3, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo in reference to the salary of a teacher for the Gross Lake School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum for a teacher for this school. I would point out to you that when official letter of September 22nd in which it was stated that the amount allowed by the Department for this school is $500.00 per annum was written your letter of the 29th of September in reference to salaries for teachers or schools conducted under the auspices of your church west of the lake had not been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nCROSS LAKE.\n\nAt Cross Lake the day school (protestant) has not been operating steadily. I was informed that steps were being taken to correct this and that a school would be actively operated shortly with Mr. H. Wright in charge as teacher. The old building is in very poor condition and is not available to overcome this. Arrangements have been made to rent a house centrally located in which classes will be held.\n\nSgd. J.R.Bunn,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nDuring my official visit to Split Lake and on my arrival at Croce Lake, I was requested by the Chief and part of his Band to attend a council meeting to be held in the school house on Monday the 25th of January. Accordingly attended the meeting both Revd Mr Gaudin and Father Thomas being present.\n\nThe first subject gone into was \"Destitution\". Chief Peter Rose then spoke for his Band and explained to me how hard it was for them to make a living this winter with prices for fur so low and no labour of any account to be had. I pointed out to him and those assembled, that if they had only been diligent and energetic at their hunting operations and fishing, they would not have had any destitution amongst the Band. I told them how I had seen portions of his Band along the road to Split Lake and how these Indians were making their living, and that they were above all want and doing well. It was merely that some of his Band that were lazy and shiftless, and they had listened to vague reports scattered about the country by irresponsible parties, that the Government were going to assist them as the prices for fur had gone so low, that probably they would suffer by it. I told them they should have exerted themselves even more than ever, and made good hunts, as I knew that the traders round his reserve were paying fair prices for their fur and paying a great deal more than the H.B. Company, and that those who did not hunt could have had labour at either Mission, if they so wished it. They were the ones to blame for listening to these stories and for letting themselves get poor, and I told them the Department did not propose to assist any one.\nwho was lazy and any among them that did not work or make an effort and a strong effort to work or hunt, that they need not expect assistance. The Department would probably assist those who were sick or disabled from some accident, as it would be very likely that they might require assistance, but to any able bodied man, no assistance would be given, unless he could prove to the satisfaction of the Police or the Missionaries, that he had been hunting, and had made a failure, then probably a little assistance would be given in a case of that kind, to enable that man to make another effort in his hunting operations. But they were to make up their minds that no man able to work or hunt would receive any assistance whatever. The people at the meeting then promised that they would try and hunt or look for work.\n\nRe New School/\n\nThis question has come up again, they want a new day school, that is the Protestant part of the Band. A few years ago before my appointment as Agent, a new school was then to be built and logs had been cut and hauled to the reserve, lumber had been bought and sent to Cross Lake in care of the Hudson's Bay Company. Since I came to Norway House I have repeatedly asked some of the residents to put up those logs and commence the building, but no one seemed to care to take on the job, as I hear the logs cut and paid for were not large enough for a school of the size that they wish to have built now. The Revd Mr Wright who took up the duties of teacher for the Cross Lake school this year has had such a favourable turn out of scholars that the Revd Mr Gaudin and the Methodist portion of the Indians have decided to request the Department to build them a day school on a larger scale than was proposed some years ago by the Revd Mr Semmens, Inspector of Indian Agencies. The size of the building then estimated, was to be 25 ft x 20 ft with a 9 ft wall, this building was to have been erected by Mr McIvor of Cross Lake, as I can see by the correspondence, but was never done.\nI asked Mr. McIvor to have it done and he said he would do it, if he could get men, in this he failed. I tried another man, Macdonald by name, and he was going to do it, but he also failed to come up to time, live fox hunting being more lucrative. I then asked Mr. Gaudin to get men and superintend it himself; this he said he would do, but unfortunately Mr. Gaudin took ill and went to Winnipeg to undergo an operation, this of course obliged Mr. Gaudin to give it up, as it was very late in the season before Mr. Gaudin arrived home.\n\nThe old school house has been in such bad condition for some years now, (it is 25 years old) that I found it necessary to allow Mr. Gaudin to rent a house to be used for the purpose of a school house for the winter term. This house belongs to Councillor Thomas Ross and seats about 40 children, although a little crowded. I saw the councillor and asked him what rent he would take and he replied $4.00 a month. I think this is reasonable and I told him that I would recommend that he be paid this rent for his house. The councillor is a cripple and has a blind son to support, and I think a small sum like this would enable the councillor to buy clothing for his blind son who is a man and also for the rest of his family. Mr. Gaudin generously assists this family in any way that he can, but cannot altogether support him.\n\nThe new school that is proposed to be built and which is requested of the Department, is planned as follows:\n\nSchool building to be built of logs, 36 ft x 22 ft.\nPorch to building \" \" \" 8\" x 8\".\n5 Windows, 16 x 24, most of these windows ought to be stored at Cross Lake.\n2 Doors, one for main building and one for Porch. 6 ft x 3 ft.\nWall of building to be 5 ft 6 in. high.\n\nMost of the old logs could be used on the ends, the sides, 36 ft long would have to be secured. Lumber would also have to be bought. This I think could be saved up at the\nthe Roman Catholic saw mill, if the Indians would cut the logs and have them taken to the mill where I dare say the Brothers in charge of the mill would saw the logs into lumber. The doors and windows that were secured for the first building were put into the agency warehouse which has been used as a hospital until this winter when I had the I.W. supplies stored there.\n\nIn looking into the correspondence on the Cross Lake school building, I find that 15 rolls of roof feltting, 1 door, 6 windows, and 3000 feet of flooring were shipped to Cross Lake four years ago, and about 300 feet of rough lumber was sent down by York boat. It will be seen if a new building of the size they are asking for now, would require quite a lot more rough lumber to complete the building. Making a rough calculation of the roof, gable ends, bottom flooring, and porch, it would take in the neighborhood of 2,500 feet of rough lumber to complete the building.\n\nProviding the Indians would secure the logs and have them sawed up at the Catholic sawmill, the cost of sawing would be $20.00 at the rate of $4.00 a thousand feet. This would be a great deal cheaper than freighting lumber from Selkirk, which would probably cost 40 or 45 dollars a thousand feet to land it at Cross Lake.\n\nThere is no doubt that a school house of this size should be built, as Mr. Wright had 44 children on the register in his December report attending school. To seat this many children would require a few more desks as they have almost enough to do at the present. Their old equipment is in a fair condition, some of the ink pots being missing only. With part of a new school outfit and a new school they would be quite up to date in so far as reserve day schools go.\n\nAfter discussing a few more minor questions, the meeting came to a close at 6.30 p.m.\nTo the Secretary Department of Indian Affairs of Canada:\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI sent in a Mr. J. Haynes as teacher for the Cross Lake School last summer. He has been giving good satisfaction.\n\nI was surprised this morning to get a letter from him from Winnipeg. Family and other reasons are calling him back to England and he says delay was not possible.\n\nI have written Rev. McFadden to look after the school (which he is doing at present) and to make use of his daughter Irene who has had two years training at the Ont. Ladies College, and at home this winter. This arrangement will only apply for the balance of this year, this is July June.\n\nHoping this will be satisfactory to the Department as it is most imperative to send in a suitable teacher at this season of the year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was wondering if it would be at all possible to do anything for these during war times. They are certainly very much needed, especially at Cross Lake.\n\nPrevious to the war, a vote of some $600 was made and the building logs were got out and landed, and are lying there, and I believe beginning to rot. The building that they are using is a house rented from an Indian, who with his family occupies the back part of the house. The school is treated to all sorts of noises, smells, etc.\n\nYou might let me know if anything can be done.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTF/M.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esquire,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Benson -\n\nKindly report on the attached letter from Rev. T. Ferrier with reference to the establishment of a day school at Cross Lake and at Nelson House.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to Mr. Ferrier's letter of the 28th ultimo regarding the establishment of new schools for Methodist Indians at Cross Lake and Nelson House I beg to say, first with regard to Nelson House, Mr. Inspector Bunn, who visited this reserve three years ago, reported that there was no school building there. The old one still stands, but is in a very dilapidated condition; teaching is carried on in a large room in the missionary's house. The Department informed him that the matter of a new school would be taken up when the estimates were under consideration. Last December Mr. Bunn wrote that he had informed the Indians to that effect. He was then told that no new school buildings are being erected now, as, owing to the war, the funds at the disposal of the Department are limited.\n\nThe last quarter's returns showed that they had an enrolment of 26, with an average of 17. There is no record of the size of the room in which school is being held, but they could probably manage without a new\nnew building for sometime.\n\nWith regard to the Cross Lake School. This school is now being conducted in a rented building, which is badly out of repair and the owner is not disposed to do anything to improve conditions. Mr. Acting Agent Norquay was written to in April, last, to submit an estimate of the cost of putting the building in repair, but no reply has been received from him as yet. He was informed that if the Department repairs the building it will deduct the amount expended from the rent.\n\nThe sum of $500.00 was placed in the estimates for the year 1909-10 for a new building at Cross Lake and in February, 1910, Mr. Inspector Semmens was instructed to correspond with the Agent to take the necessary action to have the logs for a new building cut at once. Mr. Galverley, who was then Agent, was sent a memorandum in regard to the kind of building which should be erected and the material required. He informed the Department that he had arranged with Mr. McIvor of Cross Lake to supply the logs on the ground for $125.00. The logs were delivered and Mr. Semmens was directed to instruct the Agent to procure the rough lumber, doors and windows. The lumber was sent in and paid for in 1911 and some of the material was used for the\nthe hospital.\n\nMr. Agent Stewart reported in February, 1915, that the logs taken out would only be suitable for the ends of the building, as a larger building than at first contemplated would be required to house all the pupils, as there are 60 Methodist children of school age on the reserve.\n\nFresh material would have to be supplied if it is decided to build now and I think the Architect's Branch could give an estimate of the probable cost.\n\nIn the meantime; if the Department is not prepared to build, it seems to me that the best plan would be to use the logs now on the ground in putting up a house for the owner of the building used for the school, so that he could live there and let the Department have the use of the whole building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This man is an English Canadian by birth, he is married to Annabella Moar a daughter of the late Philip Moar, a member of the Norway House band, at the time of his death, Number 197 of that band; this woman is also a niece of William Moar, Number 82 of the same band, the present Chief of this band. Mrs. Mercer is the mother of five children of school age, by her husband, who is non-treaty.\n\n2 boys and 3 girls, aged as follows,\n1 boy 15 years,\n1 \" 9 \"\n1 girl 13 \"\n1 \" 11 \"\n1 \" 7 \"\n\nMr. Mercer is a settler and trader, living adjacent to the Cross Lake Indian reserve. There are no school facilities for white children at Cross Lake, and on account of the present conditions owing to the war, there is not much possibility that there will be any being provided. This family is Protestant. They have interviewed the Rev. T. Ferrier, Principal of Brandon Indian School, about taking these children in to his institution to be educated, and he is agreeable to do so; however as they are non-treaty children, when Mr. Mercer interviewed me, I told him I would have to submit the matter to you, and that I would give the facts, as I have done, when I submitted the matter to you. I also told Mr.\nD.C.S.\n\nMr. Mercer that I would advise him of your decision, as quickly as I received it. The basis on which this request is made, is the fact that Mrs. Mercer is an Indian woman, at one time a member of Norway House Band, so that her children are mixed blood. The desire of this Indian mother to give her children the privileges and advantages of education is commendable, and if it is possible I hope her wish can be realised.\n\nI also had a request, through Mr. Ferrier, with reference to the children of one Robert Anderson, a mixed blood, married to Emily Swanson, an ex-pupil of the Brandon Indian School, this is for the same privilege for three children of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Anderson, 2 girls, 1 aged 13 years,\n\n1 boy\n\nIn this case, as in the case, the absence of any white day schools are given as the prime reason for this request, it is also possible that Mr. Anderson may be removed, in connection with his service with the Hudson's Bay Company, to a point more remote from any possible chance to give these children educational privileges. The mother in this case is an ex-pupil who has benefitted by her opportunity to have been a pupil. I was asked to advise your decision in this case also, as soon as I received it.\n\nI might now intimate that I know these people, and I feel that they are seeking a great privilege, but as they are anxious to have their children educated, I am of the opinion that their desires should receive favorable consideration if it possible to permit this.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nAugust 19, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Bunn,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 14th instant, with reference to the application of Arthur Mercer, of Cross Lake, Man., and Robert Anderson, who are white men, to have their children educated in Indian Residential schools.\n\nIn this connection I have to point out that Parliament provides an appropriation annually for the education of Indian children, but it has not given us any money for educating white children as this is a responsibility which does not devolve upon the Indian Department. The rule that half-breeds are not to be admitted to Indian schools except under certain specified conditions, of which you have been advised, must be strictly adhered to, and while one naturally sympathizes with the desire of these citizens to have their children educated, this Department cannot take upon itself that responsibility.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6230, file 508-1, part 1)\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMiss Zella Richardson, our teacher at Cross Lake, Manitoba, writes that she is greatly handicapped for the want of proper accommodation and equipment. She suggests a new room, and some kindergarten equipment. Both of these are essential. The question of a building at Cross Lake has been approved of by the Department but has been deferred on account of war conditions. Would it be possible for the Department to put up a building this coming Summer? I would not suggest a very expensive one. A grant of $2,000.00 would fill the bill.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nRev. Mr. Ferrier wishes the Department to put up a building this coming summer for the Cross Lake Methodist School. He thinks that a grant of $2,000.00 would be sufficient for the purpose.\n\nThe school is now conducted in a rented building, which is badly in need of repair and contains only one room. The logs for a new building were got out some years ago and rough lumber, doors and windows were also supplied, but some of this material was used for the hospital. The logs have been lying there ever since and nothing has been done to start the new building and the material on hand would be of little use now.\n\nMr. Agent Norquay, in a report on this school dated the 2nd ultimo states that \"the Indians have not made any progress with the erection of the new building,\" \"the logs are on the ground and have been squared but that as far as they have got and their interest in the project has apparently evaporated. If the building is to be erected this coming summer it will be necessary to proceed along other lines.\"\n\nThe room now occupied is 18' by 21' which would only give floor space for about 23 pupils. They have had an enrolment of 46 there, with an average of 34 for one quarter. The general average is under 20.\n\nIf there is to be a new building there the Department will have to pay for it. The present building might be repaired and enlarged, but the landlord objects to the cost being taken out of his rent.\n\nThe kindergarten equipment Mr. Ferrier refers to can be supplied on requisition.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have looked into this matter carefully, and I note that the people of that reserve have displayed very little interest in their school-work. The material which we furnished has been allowed to lie on the ground to deteriorate, whereas a little activity on the part of the Indians might have resulted in their having a more suitable building long before this. At this present time, when our funds are so limited, it is impossible to meet even the most urgent needs, and I do not see how I can consider expenditure at Cross Lake.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal, Brandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nCross Lake Methodist Mission\nNorway House P.C. 1/7/19\n\nDuncan Scott, Esq.\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nBy the kind permission of Dr. Norquay, Indian agent, I am to tell you something of the needs of our Indians on this reserve.\n\nI came last October to teach school, but we had to close school on December ninth because of epidemic influenza. Since that date, Mrs. Sandin, field matron, has been confined to her room, leaving the work of visiting Indian homes in that capacity to me for a time.\nHence you will understand that I speak of conditions with which I am in touch, and from different sides.\n\nThese Indians are ill-nourished and underfed; not wholly because they have no food, for the missionary, Rev. S.D. Gaudin, gives supplies to the destitute each week, but they waste what is given by ill cooking.\n\nOne instance, out of many which might be cited, will suffice to illustrate. When visiting a very sick patient I asked to have some rolled oats cooked for him. It was immediately stirred into some boiling water on the stove. A few moments later, as I had turned to examine another patient, his wife had poured the mixture into a plate and was about to feed...\nInquiry revealed that this was their usual way of serving rolled oats. It is probable that if these people had been taught to cook as children, the women would have known how to feed her family and the man would not have died, as he did, next day.\n\nThe Indian children whom I have taught to cook have been much interested in the art, and have practiced it in their homes, the parents seeming pleased to have them cook like white people. Also this work has been a strong incentive to their using English.\n\nAs there is to be a schoolhouse built on this reserve next year would it be possible, sir, to have a section partitioned\nfor teaching cooking?\n\nThe government would soon make up the cost\u2014putting in a room and equipment, because the provisions given out would last so much longer in the homes of the school children.\n\nI understand that the biscuits which are provided by the government, to be given morning and afternoon to supplement home meals, are the only nourishment these children have at midday (our custom is to give the two at noon) and that frequently they have but one other meal. With a cooking class we would, by use of a few plain provisions, serve a simple meal.\ncooked by themselves each noon.\n\nOne peculiarity of the people here is that they like to have their children come to school when very young. Perhaps the biscuits attract them, but they do attend with fair regularity at the age of six. We need a kindergarten, so they could be taken in a year younger\u2014in time to learn a small vocabulary of English and to get rid of their thieving propensities, so that at the age of seven they would be really ready to enter a primary grade.\n\nThis plan would call for two teachers, a kindergartner, a directress who would also teach cooking, and a primary teacher. The building required would be little larger than that proposed.\nalready, but it would meet real needs of these people, while a mere ordinary schoolroom has proven far from adequate.\n\nThe upper storey would be divided into kindergarten and kitchen, while schoolroom and storeroom would occupy the ground floor.\n\nThere are in most urgent need of a hospital here; and we are in just as great need of a school building where the children may be taught food values and preparation, sewing and mending etc as well as to know something about the three R's.\n\nI wish to thank you, sir, beforehand, for the consideration you always show & suggestions for Indians welfare: and to beg you will do all you can for these Indians. Very Respectfully Yours\n\nS. Berta Richardson\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\n[Handwritten text]\n\nThere are any likelihood of any school being built at\n\n[Handwritten signature]\nOttawa, February 1, 1919.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo in regard to the needs of the Indians on the Cross Lake Reserve and also in regard to the erection of a new school-house there.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter has been looked into carefully and it is noted that the people of this reserve have displayed very little interest in their schoolwork, as the material which the Department furnished has been allowed to lie on the ground to deteriorate, whereas a little activity on the part of the Indians might have resulted in their having a more suitable building long before this.

H. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss E. Emma Richardson,\nTeacher,\nCross Lake Indian Day School,\nNorway House P.O., Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6230, file 508-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNorway House, Jan. 30, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report on my official visit to Cross Lake. I left Norway House on the 8th inst. at 7:00 o'clock A.M. and reached Cross Lake the same day at 6:00 o'clock P.M., having a fine trip.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to touch on the condition of the biscuits at the Cross Lake Day School. Miss Richardson had a box opened while I was there to show me what they were like. They had evidently got wet in transit. They were very mouldy, and uneatable. I then opened another one myself, and found it in the same condition. At least half out of each box would be spoiled if not a greater percentage. I told the teacher to open all the boxes and separate the mouldy from the good. This she had done, and says there are only five boxes of good out of the eight she had at the time of my visit. There will therefore be a shortage of biscuits for this school. If I find it necessary, shall I be allowed to purchase some locally?\n\nMiss Richardson asked me if I thought the Department would remunerate her for some cocoa she had, if she made a hot drink for the children at mid-day. I told her I did not know what the Department would do in a case of this kind. I would write and find out, and let her know. She writes and says she is giving the cocoa to the children at noon. She brought the cocoa with her last summer when she came back from her summer holidays. It will cost about $12.00.\n\nW. R. Taylor,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 28, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report of the 30th of January, last, regarding your visit to Cross Lake I beg to say in regard to the biscuits for the Cross Lake Day School, which were damaged in transit, that you may purchase a sufficient supply of biscuits for the use of this school until such time as the yearly supply arrives. Before purchasing the biscuits you should obtain prices and purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded, covering the expenditure incurred, together with the quotations received by you for the supply of the biscuits.\n\nThe Department will remunerate Miss Richardson, the teacher, to an amount not exceeding $12.00 for the cocoa supplied by her to the children for the mid-day meal, and you will be good enough to forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering this expenditure. It should be stated on the vouchers that this cocoa was for the purpose of the mid-day meal for the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nNorway House, Jan. 30, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report on my official visit to Cross Lake. I left Norway House on the 8th inst. at 7:00 o'clock A.M. and reached Cross Lake the same day at 8:00 o'clock P.M., having a fine trip.\n\nI then proceeded to the Chief's house, and had a long talk with him on matters in general concerning the reserve and Band. He reported cattle in good condition, with plenty of feed to carry them through the winter. The fur hunt is pretty good and splendid prices are being paid for the various kinds of furs the Indians kill. Therefore to date there is no hardship outside the regular recipients of destitute supplies. I looked over a splendid set of logs which had been cut and landed in the vicinity of the old school. These logs were got out by the Indians in the anticipation of a new school house being built, but I notice that, in looking over past correspondence on this matter, the Department is not in favor of a new school being built on this reserve. If the matter would be favorably looked upon, the Indians would be able to furnish the labor for the erection and finishing of the building.\n\nW. R. Taylor,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 16, 1920\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report dated January 30th, last, on the occasion of your official visit to Cross Lake regarding the building of a day school at that point, I beg to say that, as our funds are so limited it is impossible to meet even the most urgent needs and the Department cannot, therefore, consider any expenditure at Cross Lake.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.D.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Indian School, Cross Lake, Man.\n\nOn a recent visit to Cross Lake district I find that seven non-treaty children were receiving no education at Cross Lake and naturally discussed the situation from the point of view of the Province to find out what arrangement could best be arrived at. Some two years ago an arrangement was suggested by the Dept. of Education whereby a provincial school be built. This arrangement was not carried out by the residents for various reasons; I am assured, however, by the parents concerned, that if a satisfactory Indian school were established the children would be sent to the Indian school providing accommodation and teacher were satisfactory. I visited the school and discussed the matter with Mr Taylor, Indian Agent for the district, who informed me he had already taken up the matter of the school at Cross Lake. There is no doubt that the school under the Methodist Church Missionary Society is unsatisfactory from the point of view of accommodation and equipment and that it would be difficult for the non-treaty children to attend under present conditions. If, however, the Indian Department plan to arrange for a good school building, the Province would willingly co-operate financially in the matter of a grant to cover the education of the children whose education is the care of the Province. I feel that this is an important matter and I trust that it will be possible for the Province to co-operate with the Indian Department here as in many other districts throughout Northern Manitoba in the matter of Education of the children in the Cross Lake community.\n\nI am, Truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6230, file 508-1, part 1)\nMay 18, 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your communication of the 19th ultimo, with reference to the erection of a school at Cross Lake, Manitoba, at which halfbreed children might be permitted attendance. This is a matter which we have considered carefully on several occasions; at one time we even went so far as to have logs taken out, but the Indians did not show any enthusiasm in the project, and it was allowed to drop. Our funds are so limited that we cannot erect new buildings when there is no reasonable hope of conducting a successful school.\n\nI am quite sympathetic with your proposal, and, as we have a new Agent there now, I will ask him to go carefully into the matter, and report on it once more.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRobt. C. Wallhogs, Commissioner Of Northern Manitoba, The Pas, Man.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, May 20, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nA communication has been received from Mr. Robert O. Wallace, Commissioner of Northern Manitoba, The Pas, Man., regarding the educational facilities at Gross Lake for the Indian and half-breed children residing in that district.\n\nHe states that, if the Department would provide a good school building of sufficient size to accommodate all the children at that point, the province would willingly cooperate financially in the matter or a grant to cover the education of the children whose education is the care of the province. He also states that he discussed this matter with you on the occasion of his visit.\n\nI may say that logs for a new building were got out some years ago and roofing, lumber, doors and windows were also supplied. Some of this material was afterwards used for the hospital. The logs have been lying there ever since and nothing has been done to start the new building, and it is presumed that the material on hand would be of little use now.\n\nAs the Indians of the reserve displayed very little interest in school work the building of a new school was not proceeded with. A little activity on the part of the Indians at that time might have resulted in their having a more suitable building long before this. Our funds are so limited that we cannot erect new buildings where there is no reasonable hope of conducting a successful school.\n\nI may say that the Department is sympathetic with the proposal to Mr. Wallace for the establishment of a joint school for the Indian and other children at Gross Lake. I shall, therefore, be pleased if you will furnish a full report setting forth your views in the matter. You should state whether any of the material that was placed on the ground is serviceable, also the size of the building that would be required to accommodate all the children, the amount of material that would be required and the probable cost of erecting the same. The Department will be pleased to have as full information as possible regarding the establishment of a school to meet the needs at this point and will be pleased to receive your report at as early a date as convenient, before a decision is arrived at as to the providing of the necessary funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Zella Richardson's resignation as teacher of the Cross Lake day school, to take effect on June 30th 1920.\n\nIn sending Miss King's resignation of the Norway House day school, I recommended the appointment of Miss Christina McLeod of Cross Lake as teacher in Miss. King's place. I would now recommend her appointment to the place vacated by the resignation of Miss. Richardson. I had thought to recommend the closing of this school for a time as the attendance is so poor, and the Indians take so little interest in their school, but Miss McLeod being able to speak the cree language, might be able to work up a better attendance, and greater interest among the Indians towards the school. I would strongly recommend giving her a trial. She is a Methodist, and has a good college education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

It is noted that funds are limited, and expenditure for Cross Lake cannot be considered.\n\nI might mention that when Mr. R.C. Wallace the Commissioner for northern Manitoba was here in March, he consulted with me as to the advisability of approaching the Indian Department about building a day school at Cross Lake, with a view to allowing the children of white settlers, attend upon the payment of a grant, by the Provincial Government, for the use of the school. The Commissioner will doubtless write and explain matters from his point of view, as I told him I had no objection whatever to his writing to the Department about the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

He states that Miss McLeod is able to speak the Cree language and might be able to work up a better attendance and greater interest among the Indians towards the school. He strongly recommends giving her a trial. He states that she is a Methodist and has a good college education.\n\nProvided you consider that Miss McLeod would be a suitable teacher for this school the Department would consent to her appointment. If, however, you have any other teacher in view, the Department will be pleased to hear from you regarding the appointment of a successor to Miss Richardson and full particulars should be given regarding the qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you. The services of a teacher should be secured in time to re-open the school after the summer holidays on or about the first of September, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6230, file 508-1, part 1)\nExtract from Agent's Report on the Cross Lake Meth. Day School for the month of May, Original on 118275-7.\n\nMiss Richardson has no idea of imparting education to the children under her care. I am glad that she has tendered her resignation as it prevents my reporting on her inefficiency and asking for her removal.\n\nW. R. Taylor,\nAgent.\nSir,\n\nReplying to Department letter No. 116275/1 dated May 20th, regarding a joint school for Indians and whites at Cross Lake, I beg to say that Commissioner Wallace asked my opinion regarding this matter last winter while here. He said that there were not enough white children at Cross Lake to warrant the Provincial Government building a school, and if the Department of Indian Affairs would build a school, the Provincial Government would co-operate, by providing a grant, towards the teacher's salary. I fell in with his views on the matter, and wrote the Department accordingly.\n\nI have looked over the material which was sent to Cross Lake for the purpose of building the proposed school, and find that very little of it is of any use. There is some sheathing, probably 1000 ft. I did not measure it but roughly estimated it. Practically all the material for a building would have to be sent out.\n\nAs to the size of building, I would suggest a building 40x22 feet with a 10 foot wall. Of this to construct a main class room 32x22. The remaining 8x22 to be equally divided for cloak rooms, for boys and girls. Have two entrance doors, one for boys and another for the girls. This would necessitate two more doors from the cloak rooms into the class room.\n\nThe windows should be all on one side of the building, and there should be six, to give good light; with two more in front of building to light the cloak rooms. The side opposite from the windows would be used for blackboard, and for hanging maps.\n\nA raised platform 14x6 should be for the teacher's desk. On either side of this could be built cupboards for the storing of school material. The chimney should be built from the cloak rooms to the roof, and the stove placed in the centre of the class room. The pipes would thus assist in heating the building. Two rows of double desks would be placed down either side of the building, and a row of the same kind in the centre fore and aft the stove. I think there would be ample room to seat from forty to fifty children.\n\nIf a school of the size I have suggested is built, the logs taken out by the Indians will not do. In any case a frame building would be better, as it is not possible to get logs of any size in this rocky country.\nI would not advise shipping the material this season, as the season is so far advanced now. If it is decided to build the school, the supplies could be purchased and delivered at Selkirk, and an understanding made with the Northern Fish Co. to bring it out on the first boat coming out in the spring of 1921. Of course the building be let by contract, which would be better; it would be up to the contractor to get the building material out.\n\nBy waiting for another year, we could see how the Indians view the situation re the attendance of their children to school. I shall talk to them very plainly at the treaty payments and tell them it is up to them whether they get a school or not. I am getting the chief interested in the education of the children of his band, and as I suggested the appointment of Miss Christina McLeod to succeed Miss Richardson, she will be the figure she might work up good attendance. We don't want any more teachers of Miss Richardson's stamp. She couldn't teach. She had no influence over the children nor the Indians. Miss McLeod is a Methodist, and has a good college education.\n\nI am enclosing a rough ground plan in pencil which will give an idea of what I have explained in this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6230, file 508-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 29th, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with reference to the proposal to erect a union school on the Cross Lake Indian reserve. I have noted your sketch and your recommendation that a frame building should be erected. As this would entail an expenditure of several thousands of dollars to purchase the material in Winnipeg and ship it to Cross Lake, I regret it is not possible for the Department to consider the matter this year; unless something could be done with the material that is now on the ground so that the building might be completed with a minimum of expenditure, the whole matter will have to stand in abeyance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nReplying to Dept., letter No. 118275-1 dated June 29, in connection with building a union school at Cross Lake. If you will refer to my letter of June 14, reporting on this matter, it will be noticed that I recommended that the building be not erected this year but held in abeyance till next year, as this season was so far advanced.\n\nIf it is decided to erect this building I propose I would suggest calling for tenders, and letting the building by contract. This could be done during the winter, that the successful contractor could get his material together at Selkirk, ready for the first boat out next spring.\n\nI am afraid nothing could be done with the material on hand in constructing the proposed school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 21, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 19th of April, last, in regard to the erection of a school at Cross Lake, Man., to provide educational facilities for the Indian and half-breed children residing in that district, I beg to say that, as you were informed, the Agent at that point was asked to report on this matter. He has forwarded a sketch of a proposed building, 31' by 22' with a 10' wall; of this to construct a main class-room 33' by 22' and the remaining 8' by 22' to be equally divided into class-rooms for the boys and girls. He recommended that a frame building be erected, but, as this would entail an expenditure of several thousands of dollars to purchase the material in Winnipeg and ship it to Cross Lake, I regret that it is not possible for the Department to consider the matter this year, as there are no funds provided for the purpose.\n\nThe Agent recommends that the building be not erected this year, but held in abeyance until next year, as this season is so far advanced.\n\nI may say that this has been noted for the estimates for the next fiscal year and will receive consideration when they are being prepared for submission to parliament next session.\n\nI may add that it is doubtful whether the results would warrant the Department in authorising a large expenditure in the construction of a building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Shoup, missionary at Cross Lake reserve, to allow non-treaty children to attend the United Church Indian Day School on that reserve. It is noted that the school is not overcrowded by the attendance of Indian children and that, at present, there are only five or six non-treaty children of school age who wish to attend.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, provided the teacher will agree to accept the non-treaty children and they will not interfere with the regular classroom instruction to the Indian children, the Department will have no objection to permitting them to attend. They may use exercise books, etc., provided by the Department, but they are not to receive the usual issue of biscuits for the midday meal. Where possible, the parents should provide the necessary books and other classroom supplies. In preparing the quarterly returns of attendance, it is not necessary that their names be included.\n\nYou may advise the missionary and teacher accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

We hope for your best wishes for health and prosperity.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nMcKay Ross\nCounselor\nWe are telling for the Cross Lake Band\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6230, file 508-1, part 1)\nThicket Portage, Man.,\nJuly 23, 1935.\n\nSuperintendent Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I present my side of the case, relative to my position as teacher of the Indian Day School at Cross Lake, Manitoba? We are so isolated up here at these northern outposts that there is no one else to speak for me.\n\nThere are only two white families at Cross Lake, those of the Hudson Bay man and the missionary. The latter, because the school is called the United Church Indian Day School, assumes a little like control of the affairs of the school when there is no work attached to them, so that the teacher can't call her mind her own.\n\nI boarded at the missionary's home for one month and because I chose to live by myself as the other teacher did before me, during the last two years she was at Cross Lake, I have been the victim of a consistent vindictiveness on the part of the missionary, culminating in a whispering campaign during June with the Indian Agent and Head of the Church, with the result that I was refused nomination for the coming year of 1935-36.\nThe local and controlling authorities have no other source of information except the missionary and take whatever he says as the basis of their opinions. I applied in the spring for the school and received a very favorable reply from Mr. Beaton. But after his visit to Norway House in June, where he talked with the missionary and the agent, it was simply a case of thumbs down.\n\nThe missionary's wife has the field matron's job and she has a daughter just out of Normal School that he wants to get a position for. The Family Compact of historical fame has nothing on what is going on at Cross Lake. When the missionary gets his daughter in, they will have all the positions there are to be had at Cross Lake. The obvious way to accomplish this is to create a vacancy and the nomination of his daughter will follow.\n\nThe missionary maintains his daughter needs a position. Well maybe she does, but she doesn't need it any more than I do, as I support my seventy-year-old mother and a fifteen-year-old daughter, whom I...\nam sending through High School and later through University.\n\nThe missionary at Cross Lake is W.W. Shoup who lost his position as principal of the Norway House Industrial School last year, on account of his use of penitentiary methods of punishment of the Indian children there. I was a member of the staff at Norway House Industrial School that reported on the condition of affairs and know whereof I speak, as I was an eye-witness of the atrocities. This also is another reason why he is against me.\n\nMr. Beaton got the impression in Norway House this June, and told it in Winnipeg, that my work as teacher in Norway House was a failure. He got that from Mr. Shoup it is untrue, in proof of which I would respectfully refer you to the Public School Inspector's report which is on your file, and to the enclosed copy of a statement concerning my work, and written by W.W. Shoup at the close of my work there.\nIf the impression, that my work was a failure at Norway House came from the Agent, I would respectfully call your attention to the fact that the Agent just came to Norway House in Oct 1935, and that he was not in Norway House at the time I was teaching there and therefore his opinion is only based on hearsay and not on actual observation.\n\nIf the Agent got his impression from the teacher who took my place, she had never taught junior work before and has not had enough experience to be able to pass judgment on another teacher's work.\n\nIt might clarify your idea of the situation if I gave a resume of the work done at Cross Lake.\n\nI arrived at Cross Lake on Saturday, Sept. 1st, 1935, after a four day's journey by canoe via the Hudson Bay Railway, making running landings, portaging, and lining the canoe trip rapids of the swirling rushing waters of the Nelson River. My brother is a Forest Ranger and took me in.\nI went and saw the school the first day I landed there. I explained why I was on the journey in, and was unable to start school the first week and asked Mr. Shoup to go over to the school and put up a notice that school would begin the following week. He did so, as well as removing the school viola which I had seen at school on the first day of my arrival there. He took it to his home giving out the information through his children, that it was mission property. I naturally believed this. At Christmas I asked for the loan of it for the Christmas concert, and it was broken. I then learned that the viola had been purchased and donated to the school by a former teacher, Miss Macgill, and that my predecessor had spent Five Dollars ($5.00) on repair work and a new spring for it. Also that a former missionary had requested my predecessor to remove it from the mission when she left as it was not mission property. I might say that Mr. Shoup still has the school viola.\nI could not help feeling that if an Indian had entered the school and removed the victoria, he would have been up before the authorities for stealing, but when the missionary could do it and get away with it, in an out of the way place, it was alright.\n\nI was making a coat for a little girl at school, and Mr. Shoup just to shut my eyes to conditions at Cross Lake. I thought to myself that I did not come up here to shut my eyes, but to help the Indians. It seemed to me that the missionary's aims and ideas were diametrically opposed to mine and the sooner we went our separate ways the better.\n\nAfter we got started going to school, we were always fifteen minutes to a quarter of an hour late. I spoke nicely to Mr. Shoup about it asking if we couldn't leave at 8:30 or the latest 8:45 so I could start school at 9:00 o'clock. He was very snappy and replied that he didn't want his children on the Reserve a minute longer than they had to be, and if...\nI didn't like the way things were; I had better make other arrangements.\n\nIt turned very cold in Sept. and I asked Mr. Shoup to assist in getting some wood for the school. As nothing was done I began making inquiries and found that the agent had delegated the Hudson Bay man to get the school wood, and we soon had wood at the school.\n\nI noticed in the register that it was recorded that school had to be dismissed on very cold days because it was impossible to get the school warm enough for the children.\n\nThe teacher who preceded me had warned me to get the school building banked with earth in Sept. as the school was very cold. I asked Mr. Shoup to assist me with that but got no co-operation or help whatever.\n\nWe had snow the third week in Sept. and the school building was very cold. The wind blew through it the same as if it were only a shed. I was writing on the blackboard.\nand the wind was just pouring down on my head. I climbed up to the attic on the top ledge of a window and through a two foot square hole to see where the wind came from and found the top of the building in a very unfinished condition. There were gaps between the logs big enough to thrust my hand and arm right through outdoors. The windows did not fit the window frames and were only partly put in place, leaving gaps from one to two inches at the sides and top.\n\nDownstairs the windows, which were all along one side of the school room, had no finishing outside at all and the former teacher had pasted brown paper over the cracks to keep the wind out. The beaver board had great holes in it where wood had been piled; and since the quarter round had been omitted the floor was extremely cold.\n\nOutside the logs had been covered by siding to the gables and shingles had been used above that. The space between the siding and the shingles was left unfinished so that\nCross Lake, Man.\n\n9.\n\nan opening of from four to six inches was left where the wind and snow blew in at will through the loose and cracks making the school very cold.\n\nI saw that there was an immediate need to put the school into shape so that it would be fit to hold school in when the temperature sank to 40 below. That the school was very much in need of being fixed up, is substantiated by the fact that it is undergoing extensive repairs this summer.\n\nI asked Mr. Shoup to help but he said it was the business of the Chief. The Chief lived a long way across a bay and I had no way of getting over there. It was necessary to cross the river to reach the school. I asked for the boat to cross on Saturday but never could get it. Winter was imminent; it was almost the 1st of Oct. with freeze-up due any time between the 1st and the 15th; the need of repair was great and I got no help, so I concluded the only way I could get it done was to go over and stay in the school building and superintend the work myself. The agency was sixty miles away and can't be...\nreached only by canoe, by two days paddling or one day with an engine and the agent comes only once during the school year in March. Moreover, we heard that the agent had left and that a new agent would come in, in Oct. There wasn't time to write the agent and get an answer before the frost came and it would be impossible to fill the cracks with any mixture when it was freezing or to dig earth for the banking.\n\nOn Oct 4th I went over to stay at the school and carried out the following repairs. I found a half a bag of cement upstairs in the school. I hired a workman, although I had great difficulty as almost every man on the Reserve had gone off on the Fall Fishing Trip to provide food for their dogs for the winter just preceding freeze up; at the time when the weather is cool enough so the fish won't spoil and before the lakes and rivers are frozen.\n\nI had a mixture made of lime, sand, and cement and the cracks between the logs upstairs filled up and also the cracks around the windows downstairs.\nMoss from the muskeg was used in cracks where the cement mixture could not be used. Upstairs the windows were fitted properly; the foundation of the school was banked. There were two huge holes where the dogs used to get under the school and howl, and we couldn't get them out. A ladder was made and put in place so one could get to the attic without risking one's neck and so that extra books and supplies could be safely placed there. Glass was put in one window and the rest puttied. This work was completed before freeze-up.\n\nAlthough Mr. Shoup had previously taken no interest in the school he immediately became very much interested when I made a move to do things myself. He wrote the agent that I had gone over to the school which was unfit for occupation, and there was great danger of me burning the school down. The new agent had just arrived and wrote me to vacate, which I did the next day, having completed my work at the school.\n\nI moved on Friday night into a house without a roof or a floor, which at one time had been occupied by my predecessor. On Saturday I had the roof...\nput on and the floor fixed, also the inside lined with building paper. During the next week I had the cracks between the logs filled with clay, and white washed. Mr. Shoup told the owner of the house he had no business to rent me a house. Mr. Shoup would never have taken the trouble to write the agent only he was trying to force me to return to his house and when I did not do so he used all the influence he could against me although I taught his daughters music, and put the elder one through Grade VIII when I had my hands full teaching the Indian children without any white children.\n\nI never missed a day of school after I started to teach. On Sundays I helped with the playing & singing at church and trained a quartette to sing at special services. I have won the confidence and respect of the Indian people and as soon as they heard I was leaving the Chief & Councillors came to me and said they wanted me to stay and that they were going to send a letter on my behalf which may have reached you.\n\nWhen I used to run up the flag in the morning I thought, \"Canada is a free country, and the British flag stands for justice, but because I'm off in this isolated place I don't get a square deal.\" I am appealing to you to give me a chance to remain until the Pub. School Inspector from the Dept. of Ed. Winnipeg or Inspector Hamilton from the Dept. of Ind. Affairs has a chance to pass judgment on my work at Cross Lake and dwell (over)\nstand or fall by their statements; I have done the best I could under the circumstances, and it does not seem fair that I should lose my position through the spite work of the missionary.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nyour obedient servant,\nMrs. Grace Savage.\n\nEnclosure:\nWould you kindly return enclosed statements from W.W.

School, to have her salary cheque forwarded to the Imperial Bank of Canada, Main St. Branch, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nIf Miss McLaren has a savings account in the bank mentioned arrangements can be made to forward the cheque but before doing so it will be necessary for her to advise us the number of her savings account.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

To attend Summer School, it will be necessary for Miss McLaren to be in Winnipeg during the last week in June, as registrations have to be made on July 1st, and classes open on July 3rd.\n\nSo long as she can make up the required number of days of teaching, I would recommend that Miss McLaren's request be granted. I may say that she has no lost time to make up at the present time. Will you kindly advise me of the Department's decision in the matter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

McLaren to teach school on Saturdays or during the Easter holidays to enable her to close the school a week earlier.\n\nYou should point out to her that this is special permission that has been granted due to the fact that she is taking a summer course. In general practice it is considered that teachers should strictly adhere to the regulations regarding the opening and closing dates of Indian day schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Indian Day School.\n\nThe building in which this school is now operated, has been remodelled from a warehouse belonging to the United Church, and a very good job has been done. The school is well finished inside and bright. The new desks and other furnishings have so far been very well taken care of. Pupils were all clean and well dressed.\n\nThe register was marked up to date, and contained the names of thirty Treaty Indian pupils and eleven non-treaty pupils. At the time of my visit, there were 27 pupils present consisting of 17 Indians and 10 non-treaty pupils. 8 more beginners had started attending the school two weeks previous to my visit. The aggregate attendance for the week ending January 29th was 111, whereas the aggregate attendance for the corresponding week, the previous year, was 68.\n\nReading done by pupils of grades 3 and 4 was fairly good, but the reading done by pupils of grade 1 was very poor. The reason for this seemed to be that the teacher was endeavoring to teach the pupils to read by sentences, instead of by words. He would write a sentence on the board, and after telling them what it was made them repeat it, but when I asked any pupil to identify any single word in that sentence he could not do it.\n\nDuring recess the teacher discussed this matter with me, and said he had never taught reading in this manner before, but that he was trying it on instructions from the missionary, Mr H. Meadows. I then asked him if he was making any headway.\nwith this method, and he said he did not seem to be. While talking the matter over in the evening, Mr Meadows stated that this was the new method being used at the Universities in the teaching of languages. Personally I can see no sense in it, as applied to Indian children.\n\nThe teacher has heretofore not been doing much in the way of having pupils work at the blackboard, but thinks he will do more of this in the future.\n\nThe teacher, Mr Gerbrandt, is keenly interested in his work, and if a pupil is absent for more than a day or two he visits the home to find out the reason. He is well liked by all the Indians and tries to make the school so interesting that the pupils want to come. I think he will do well.\n\nF. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nUnited Church Mission\nCross Lake, Man.\n\nH. A. Meadows, B.A. - Missionary\n\nCross Lake Manitoba,\nMarch 4, 1944.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSup't. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nThe attendance at the Indian Day School operated by this mission is much larger this year than it has been for many years. This mainly due to the fact the school which is being held in one of our mission buildings is more easily accessible to a larger number of children than it was on the old site.\n\nSome of the Indians are anxious that when the school is re-built it will be located on the old site which is their \"Treaty Grounds\", losing sight of the fact that in the old location it cannot serve as many children as can be served in other locations. There has been a tendency in the past on the part of missionaries to have the Indian school built on mission property or near mission property. While this may make for an imposing row of buildings it often does not serve the needs of the majority of the children. I believe that when the school is re-built, care should be taken to locate the school where it can serve the majority of the children.\n\nLocated as the old school was on the \"Treaty Grounds\" it was at about the centre of the Reserve and this was good. But this is the older part of the settlement and the people living in this area are mostly older people without school-age children. Neither is our mission property the best location although it is better than the old one as I have stated; and it is not on the reserve.\n\nIf the Department would care to have me do so I am prepared to make a survey of the reserve to ascertain the areas highest in child population and areas potentially high i.e., areas where there are young married couples building new homes. The children below school-age at present would have to be considered also as it will indicate the future usefulness of a school in a particular area.\n\nIf the Department cares to have me do this and will supply me with a few maps of the reserve on which I can indicate the population areas and indicate possible sites for a school or schools I shall be glad to carry out this project. I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A. Meadows\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6230, file 508-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nLove Farm, Ont.,\nJuly 28, 1944.\n\nDept.

Mr Sparling the teacher, or I should say the alleged teacher is a youth totally unfit to teach an Indian Day School.

When I asked him to give me a demonstration of classwork, it was obvious to me that the situation was quite out of hand and discipline was non-existent. The porchway at the entrance to the school building was as filthy as a hog-wallow. The pupils were crawling with vermin, also Mr Sparling as he freely admitted at the time. I stayed in the vicinity of the school until it and the porch had been cleaned. I feel quite sure that Mr Sparling made no effort whatever to ascertain the reason for absence of any child.

Day School. I inspected this school on 6 December. There were 33 pupils present and the building was badly overcrowded. According to Provincial Health Regulations this building should only accommodate about 20 pupils and they have had as many as 50 in it. No action can be taken against absentees under Sec 4 Subsection 2 Family Allowances Act as there are enough U.C. children in this community to fill 3 day schools and at present there is only accommodation for 20.\n\nMr McKee the teacher is doing good work under trying circumstances. The building is neat and clean and the children look neat and clean and there is a considerable improvement in this school comparing it with last year.\n\nThere is a cross light in the school, the blackboard is old and made of cloth and no child in the body of the school can see anything on it. A new blackboard space is urgently needed and I have instructed Mr McKee to requisition for one.\n\nE.B.

Your kind offer to pack this material and ship it to the said school, which I believe is now called the D.R. Hamilton School, is deeply appreciated. This material needs to be very carefully packed as I understand it may face some rough usage while in transit. It should be addressed to\n\nREV. IAN HARVEY, M.A., B.D.,\nCROSS LAKE, MANITOBA.\n\nDuring his recent visit to Winnipeg the Reverend Mr. Harvey spoke to the St. James Collegiate student body and he knows that this material is being sent for use in the D.R. Hamilton School. I am also writing him a covering letter.\n\nAs you are aware, it is expected that some of the St. James pupils will, next year, follow a brief social studies unit concerning the history of Canada. I think too they will be providing further assistance for the D.R. Hamilton School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCopy for information of R. A. Hoey\nReverend Ian Harvey, M.A., B.D.,\nUnited Church Mission,\nCross Lake, Manitoba.\n\nDear Dr. Harvey,\n\nShortly the Department of Education expects to ship to you the gramophone and some 35 records so kindly donated by the student body of St. James Collegiate Institute to the non-denominational school (the D.R. Hamilton School) in Cross Lake. In accordance with our recent conversation this material is being addressed to you so that it will be properly utilized. Enclosed is a list of the gramophone records and a supply of needles will be found in an envelope in the sound chamber of the gramophone.\n\nSince Indian children frequently show considerable aptitude for music it is hoped that they will enjoy these records and that some degree of music appreciation will be developed.\n\nI have already sent a note of thanks to the St. James Collegiate Institute student body but perhaps if you think it appropriate some further note of appreciation might be sent to them perhaps by the Indian children themselves.\n\nAgain many thanks for your continued interest in this project and for your co-operation in addressing the St. James students during your recent visit to Winnipeg.\n\nPlease convey my heartiest greetings also to your good wife who has assisted us greatly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sig.)

There has been considerable delay due to the late spring break-up which suspends transportation while it is in progress.\n\nWe are addressing this material to the Rev. Ian Harvey who spoke to your student body and who will see that it is put to good use.\n\nBelieve me the keen interest shown by the pupils of St. James Collegiate Institute in the welfare of the less favored native children at Cross Lake is deeply appreciated by all concerned. WILL YOU PLEASE CONVEY TO THEM MY VERY BEST PERSONAL THANKS. I hope they will, throughout the years to come, continue to show a sympathetic understanding of the descendants of the original Canadians.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sig.)

I shall quote a few sentences from his letter to Father Trudeau:\n\n\"Personally, I would be against your being given such a right, simply because it would be so utterly illogical to grant it to you. If Indian schools were non-denominational, it would be different. Then I would be among the first to defend your right to equal treatment with myself.

C. Macomacq\nOttawa, March 17, 1948.\n\nDear Dr. Macdonald:\n\nRe: Cross Lake Indian Day School -\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 15th, in which you submit for departmental consideration the request of the Reverend Father Trudeau for permission to provide religious instruction to the Catholic pupils attending the Cross Lake Indian Day School.\n\nInasmuch as this is the first request of its kind that has reached me since I entered the department twelve years ago, I feel that it is one that should be very carefully reviewed and considered before a decision is reached.\n\nMay I point out, however, that a number of mistakes appear to have been made. The school in question is the property of the Crown, and any request for its use, such as the request of Father Trudeau or any other request for the use of the school for extra-curricular activities, should be submitted to the senior administrative officer in the district, which in this case is the Indian Agent at Norway House, Mr. E. B. Goodman. If this had been done in the first instance, it is altogether likely that Mr. Goodman would have discussed the matter with the members of the Indian Council and, having done so, would have forwarded the request to this branch for consideration. Had he done so, the matter would have been in due course referred to the Minister for his decision. It is always in the interests of our Indian Agents, school teachers and may I add, missionaries engaged in missionary effort on Indian reserves, to refer all such matters to the department. Such action on their part tends to keep friction and misunderstandings down to the irreducible\n\n-- 2\nminimum. It is my intention, therefore, to refer this matter to the Indian Agent, asking him to submit a full and complete report, together with his recommendations.\n\nYou are aware, of course, that a Special Parliamentary Committee is at present engaged in a review of Indian administration in Canada. The sections in the Act relating to the education of Indians are at the moment under consideration. What amendments will be made to these sections, I am not of course at the moment in a position to state. I do feel, however, that a number of the sections relating to religious instruction, the employment of teachers, etc., will be greatly clarified.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend Malcolm G.

The teacher in charge of the school should be told definitely that she has neither the right nor the authority to grant the use of the school for religious instruction or any other purpose. Teachers and missionaries on reserves should be informed that all such matters should be referred to the department and to the Minister for consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE. B.

Hoey Esq.,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of\nMarch 17, 1948 re Cross Lake Indian Day School and Religious\nEducation, and enclosures.\n\nI am to blame for this whole situation and\nno-one else. On a visit to Cross Lake on March 5 I stopped\noff first at the Catholic Mission and Father Trudeau in-\nformed me that quite a number of Catholic children were\nattending the new U.C. School at Cross Lake and he asked\nme if it would be permissible to have a period there for\nreligious education when he visited the settlement. I\ntold him how few Catholic children there were. He said\nhe didn't know but that there was a considerable number.\nI told him I was on my way to visit the school and give\nmy answer upon my return.\n\nI then proceeded to the Sagittawuk School,\nthis being my first visit since its opening. I found that\n50% of the children attending were Catholic - 19 Catholic\nand 19 Protestant. I asked Miss McDonald the teacher if\nshe would have any objection to allowing Father Trudeau\nto hold an occasional period at any time of the day for\nreligious education so that if any Protestant children\nwere to be dismissed during that period. I informed her that\nthis was a purely temporary arrangement until I could get\nthe R.C. Day School built this summer on an adjacent site.\nShe said she had no objection and would be glad to coopera-\nte. I so informed Father Trudeau on my return stipulating\nthat there should be no attempted proselytising and I infor-\nmed both Father Trudeau and Miss McDonald that under the\nAct I should expel the 19 children from the Sagittawuk\nSchool.\n\nUpon receipt of a copy of a letter from Mr\nHarvey to Father Trudeau, I proceeded at once to Cross Lake,\nwhere I met Dr Best of the United Church. We talked the\nwhole matter over in the presence of Mr Harvey and the whole\naffair was settled amicably, Father Trudeau withdrawing his\nrequest and Dr Best agreeing that he would explain the\nwhole situation to Dr Dorey whom he would be seeing in\nToronto in a few days, so that Dr Dorey will now be in full\npossession of the facts.\n\nI am aware that I contravened the act but ever\nsince I came here I have been attempting by threats and\ncoaxing to compel children to attend school, also I have\nbeen forced to take action under Sec 4(2) of Family Allowances\nAct. To expel from school - 19 children who are capable\nwilling to attend because they approach the Almighty God by\na different manner and ritual from their fellows created &\nparadox incomprehensible to their small minds and for that matter the minds of their parents.

(RG 10, Volume 6230, file 508-1, part 2)\nINFORMATION FOR THE EMPLOYEE\n\n8. Dependents. Taxpayers may claim as dependents only:\n\n(1) A person under 18 years of age, or under 21 years of age and attending school, or over 18 years of age and incapable of self-support, who is wholly dependent upon the taxpayer for support, and in whom the taxpayer has, or immediately before such person attained the age of 21 years did have, in law or in fact, the custody and control.\n\n(2) Sons and daughters (including illegitimate sons and daughters) or sons-in-law or daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters or brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law, and grandchildren under eighteen years of age, or under twenty-one and attending school, or over eighteen years of age and incapable of self-support.\n\n(3) Parents, grandparents, parents-in-law, or grandparents-in-law, incapable of self-support.\n\n(4) A daughter or sister under twenty-one years of age who is a nurse in a public or provincially licensed private hospital.\n\n9. If Child under 16 and not Registerable for Family Allowances. A taxpayer may claim an exemption of $100 for each child under 16 years of age, a grandchild \"that was or might have been registered under The Family Allowances Act, 1944, so that the allowance under the said Act was or might have been paid during any part of the last month of the taxation year.\" With a few exceptions, every child under 16 years of age may be registered and receive payments under the Family Allowances Act. Therefore, Form T.D.1 provides that only the $100 exemption may be claimed for any dependent shown in Item 5 as having been born after November 1931. There are some cases, however, of children under 16 years of age who are not registrable for family allowances. An employee supporting such a dependent child is entitled to claim the $300 exemption for tax purposes. The employer should be instructed to file a T.D.1 form in which an employee claims the $300 exemption for a child under 16 years of age.\n\nmay make deductions accordingly and he must immediately refer the T.D.1 form to the District Income Tax Office for confirmation, accompanied by a declaration signed by the employee outlining the facts which substantiate his claim that he has a child who is eligible for registration under The Family Allowances Act.\n\n10. If Income of Spouse in Excess of $250. A taxpayer is not entitled to claim marital status if his (her) spouse's income is more than $750 during the calendar year. If the spouse will have an income of more than $250 but not more than $750, the exemption permitted for married status will be reduced by the amount by which the income of the spouse will exceed $250 (e.g., if the spouse's income will be say $600, then $350 should be entered in Item 6(B) (2) (i.e., $600 less $250). If the spouse's own income for the calendar year will be not more than $250, Item 6(B) (2) will be left blank and the full marital exemption of $750 entered in Item 6(B) (3).\n\n11. \"Self-contained Domestic Establishment\" means a dwelling house, apartment or other similar place of residence containing at least two bedrooms in which the taxpayer and his family live as a general rule sleeps and has his meals prepared and served. (See Item 16).\n\n12. Change in Status of Dependents. If during the year there is a change in the status or dependents of an employee, the employee must complete and file with his employer an amended Form T.D.1.\n\n13. Missing Forms T.D.1. If an employee fails to file a completed Form T.D.1 not filed with the employer, deductions from all salaries or wages must be made as if the employee were a single person without dependents. Single persons without dependents need not file this form.\n\n14. Filing of Income Tax Return. In addition to filing this form, the employee must file Income Tax Returns for T.I Employees or T.I Special or T.I General for the calendar year on or before 30th April of the following year.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO THE EMPLOYER\n\n15. If Form T.D.1 Not Filed By Employee. Any employee who fails to file a completed Form T.D.1 must be regarded for tax deduction purposes as a single person without dependents and deducting the amount shown in the current Table of Income Tax Deductions.\n\n16. Employer to Scrutinize Claims by Single Persons for Married Status. The definition of a \"Self-contained Domestic Establishment\" contained in Item 11 indicates clearly that a taxpayer is not entitled to Married Status by merely supporting a dependent therein unless the dependent actually resides with the taxpayer. Therefore, employers are instructed to check the address shown under Item 4(B) (4) of each taxpayer's claim in Item 2 (which should show where he is actually living at the time of making the declaration) and even if the employee does not meet the same the employer must make deductions as if the taxpayer were a single person, with or without dependents as the case may be.\n\n17. Employer's Responsibility Regarding Form T.D.1. The employer will have regard to the instructions contained in Item 16 above, will check the employee's computation of the total exemptions in Item 6 and will otherwise make certain that the form is fully completed. If the employee claims a dependent under Item 5 the name of any person whom the employee has already listed in Item 4 unless the claim for marital status cannot be paragraph (C) thereof. If the employee has reason to believe that any of the information on this form is incorrect or false, he will not act upon the declaration until the employee has made the appropriate corrections or corrections. In case of doubt the matter should be referred to the District Income Tax Office.\n\n18. Action upon Receipt of Amended Form T.D.1 during Currency of Year. Employees are required to file an amended Form T.D.1 if any change occurs in their number of dependents. The employee should give immediate effect to a change from \"Single\" status to \"Married\" status and to an increase in the number of dependents. A change from \"Married\" status to \"Single\" status (e.g., where the employee becomes a widower) should not be made effective until the first pay period in the next calendar year because the employee will still be entitled to claim marital status for the balance of the calendar year in which the change took place. Similarly, a decrease in the number of dependents should not generally require a change in the deductions claimed until the next pay period. However, one important exception due to the provision that a taxpayer may not claim as a dependent any person who has an income in excess of $400 during the calendar year. If, for example, a son who was previously supported by an employee and was claimed as a dependent on Form T.D.1 takes employment from which he expects to earn $400 during the calendar year, immediate effect should be given to the amended form T.D.1 as otherwise the employee will be left with a substantial balance of tax to be deducted from future payments of Form T.I Employees or T.I Special or T.I General.\n\n19. Further Information or Forms with respect to deduction of tax may be obtained from any District Income Tax Office.\n\n20. Completed Forms T.D.1 must be Kept on File by the employer in order that they may be available at all times for payroll inspection by officers of the Taxation Division.\nExtract from Regional Supervisor Davis' report dated January 4th on the Cross Lake U.C. Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Owens was teaching in a small log building back of the United Church and lived with Miss Hogg in the Provincial quarters.

Miss Menzies was late getting in to Cross Lake last year, and as a consequence, the school was open only 176 days. In an effort to make up these days, or a part of them, she continued the classes into July. We hoped that the attendance would be as good as during the regular school terms, but were somewhat disappointed, although those who attended were fairly regular.\n\nI would recommend that if it is possible, Miss Menzies should be given credit for these 20 days teaching.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Asst.

In this, I refer to the Roman Catholic School here at Cross Lake. They apparently have a Day School, the children receiving two meals a day, and also clothing. Now we do not in the least object to this, but if theirs is an ordinary day school, then the Reserve School of equal standing should, it seems to me, receive equal treatment. If on the other hand the present arrangement for them is in lieu of a Residential School, then surely the same rule should apply that is enforced in all such schools; then only Catholic children would be eligible for attendance.\n\nThis seems to me to be a reasonable view of the Cross Lake situation, otherwise the Department would be aiding one church to proselyte the children of another which would certainly degrade education as well as religion. I would therefore respectfully urge upon the Department that Roman Catholics and Protestants keep to their own schools.\n\nI trust that in bringing this matter before the Department it will not be considered an intrusion on my part.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nUnited Church Missionary.\nAmount of food supplied for hot noon meal for the children of the Cross lake Reserve school by Rev.

We gave this meal for the greater success of the school, as well as to meet the need of a number of the underfed children.\n\nWe have wondered if the Department might not approve of our action in this matter and be willing to meet at least part of the expense. Thus, I am forwarding a statement of food so used.\n\nI leave this with the Department for such action as they may be pleased to take.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nS. B. Gardin.\nUnited Church Missionary.\nOttawa, August 11, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, requesting to be reimbursed for the expenditure incurred in the purchase of various food supplies for the purpose of serving a hot lunch at midday to the pupils of the Cross Lake (United Church) Indian Day School. The statement which you forwarded, giving a list of the supplies purchased and the cost, was also received.\n\nThe Department is referring your request to Mr. Agent Gordon, Norway House. He is being instructed to obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the expenditure incurred by you, and to certify same and forward to the Department, when favourable consideration will be given to payment.\n\nFurther, Mr. Gordon is being requested, if it is the intention to continue the serving of the meal during the coming winter, to purchase and forward you the quantities of the various supplies as purchased by you for use last winter. Our funds this year are extremely limited, and it is considered that the serving of the hot lunch from December first to approximately the middle of April will be sufficient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. S. D. Gaudin,\nCross Lake,\nMan.\nOttawa, August 11, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the Rev. S. D. Gaudin, United Church missionary at Grass Lake, Man., in which he enclosed a statement showing the amount of food supplies purchased by him and used last winter for the serving of a hot lunch at midday to the pupils. He states that this hot lunch was served from December until Easter last, a period of 4\u00bd months. He requests that the Department remunerate him for the expenditure he incurred in the purchase of the following supplies:\n\n| Item          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|---------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Beef          | 150 lbs. | @ 15\u00a2      | $22.50|\n| Beans         | 100 \"    |            | 5.25  |\n| Pearl Barley  | 18 \"     |            | 1.08  |\n| Pot Barley    | 15 \"     |            | .75   |\n| Vegetables    |          |            | 5.00  |\n| **Total**     |          |            | **$34.50** |\n\nThe Department will favourably consider repayment to Mr. Gaudin, upon receipt of receipted accounts, in triplicate, covering the purchase of the above supplies. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department.\n\nAs we understand it is the intention to continue the serving of the meal during the coming winter months, the Department will approve of your arranging for the purchase and delivery of a like quantity of the various supplies as mentioned in the above list as being used last winter. You should forward the usual accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. Mr. Gaudin has been informed that this matter has been referred to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nWm.

(RG 10, Volume 6231, file 508-5, part 2)\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter 123-2-5 of August 11, 1932, in which reference is made to the supplies furnished by the Rev. S. D. Gaudin of Cross Lake to the school children of the United Church Day School last winter and in which authority is given for the purchase of a like quantity of the various supplies for the coming winter may I say that I would suggest the purchase of a supply similar to that to be furnished to the Oxford House Day School, as shown in your letter of August 26th, No. 123-6-5. The cost of these goods should be approximately the same as the cost of those furnished by Mr. Gaudin. It appears to me that the Cocoa, sugar, beans and rice, as listed, would be more satisfactory than what was used last winter by Mr. Gaudin and which he, no doubt, took from his own supplies.\n\nMay I say that I have not seen Mr. Gaudin since receiving your letter of the 11th as he is in Winnipeg at the present time, having undergone an operation, but I will see him on his return which may be shortly. I fear, however, that it will be difficult for him to secure receipts for the purchase of the supplies enumerated as it is very probable that these were taken from the supplies which he had in hand for his own use and purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 16, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your 398-19A of the 5th instant regarding the Cross Lake United Church Indian Day School, I beg to say that you may forward a voucher, in triplicate, for the food supplied last winter for midday meal purposes by Rev. S. D. Gaudin. This voucher, certified by yourself, will be satisfactory to the Department. It will not be necessary to send receipts.\n\nIn connection with the midday meal that will be served during the coming winter, you may secure for this school the same articles as the Department approved for the Oxford House Indian Day School (official letter of August 26th - No. 123-6-5). You should only supply the quantity of these articles that you consider absolutely necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. H. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nWm.

(RG 10, Volume 6231, file 508-5, part 2)\nWINNIPEG, MAN... July 29th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have just had an interview with Miss M. I. Farris, who is in charge of the Indian Day School at Cross Lake, Norway House Agency. Miss Farris is a qualified teacher and has given two years service at this point.\n\nDuring the first year and part of her second year, Miss Farris resided with the missionary and his wife, Mr. & Mrs. Gaudin. However, conditions in this relation became somewhat strained and Miss Farris was obliged to seek another boarding house. She rented a small shack which she fitted up and lived in until the close of the term. The shack belonged to a halfbreed and now that it has been put in shape, he intends to use it himself during the coming winter. Miss Farris has made enquiries in connection with other places, but is unable to secure accommodation. She requested permission to live above the classroom, but as this room is not finished and would be very cold, I do not think we should expect her to do this.\n\nI am quite sure Miss Farris is prepared to remain at this point for some time and if at all possible, I would recommend that a small log house be erected close to the school - this could be supplied for about $150.00. Miss Farris is willing to supply the furnishings that will be necessary. If this work is to be carried out, authority should be granted at once in order that the necessary building material may be sent in not later than the 1st of September.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI trust\nI trust the Department will be able to give this request favourable consideration as I am sure Miss Farris is conscientious in connection with her work and I believe has rendered good service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nOttawa, August 2, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 207-11A Gen., of the 29th ultimo, with reference to living accommodation for Miss M. L. Farris, teacher of the Cross Lake Indian Day School and requesting that a small log house for this purpose be erected, close to the school, at a cost of approximately $160.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our funds have been so greatly reduced this year, the Department will be unable to provide the expenditure required in the erection of a log house for the teacher's use. It is hoped that she will be able to make satisfactory arrangements for boarding accommodation. If she took the matter up with the authorities of the United Church, they might be able to arrange with the missionary to continue providing her with living quarters. If satisfactory arrangements cannot be made for the accommodation of the teacher, the Department is not aware of any recourse but to close the school. As stated, our funds are limited, and it may be necessary to consider closing a number of schools for the next academic year. If this school is to be continued, it will be up to the church authorities or the missionary to see that proper accommodation is provided for the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the United Church Cross Lake Indian Day School, inspected August 7th, 1933.\n\nThe school is in charge of Miss M. Farris, who is qualified and has her normal training. Miss Farris has been in charge at this point during the past two years.\n\nThe roll calls for thirty pupils with an average attendance of from eighteen to twenty. The Indians spoke well of Miss Farris, and stated she was very kind to their children. I have no doubt that she is quite capable as a teacher.\n\nThe school building is about twenty feet by thirty feet, and built of logs. Some time after its erection, the building was sided with lumber, but has never been painted. I think a log building is much better not sided as one then is always aware of the spots from which the plaster has fallen and repair is easily effected. The siding will now have to be removed, in order to effect any repair that may be necessary.\n\nThe school seats\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe school seats are nicely arranged, and are all in good repair. The appearance of the furniture and class room would indicate that the school is under good management.\n\nBiscuits and soup are supplied as a noon lunch.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

Both teacher and pupils were doing good work, and the pupils' work shows some progress.\n\nThe school building was clean and tidy, considering the condition of the building itself.\n\nThis building is in very poor shape, and requires considerable repairing in a number of ways; siding is required at both top and bottom of the outside walls; corner boards are needed; a new door at the entrance &c;. There is no chimney to the building. The smoke pipe from the stove, which stands in the middle of the floor, goes through the ceiling and thence directly through the roof, and at some time or other, the roof surrounding this pipe has been on fire, and a portion perhaps three feet square has been burned through. This has since been covered with tin.\n\nThe stove is in bad shape, and anew one should be furnished. The present one is simply being held together with wire tied around it, without which the stove would fall apart. It is by no means safe.\n\nI was given to understand, by the resident United Church missionary on this reserve that\n\n- Rev.

K. J. Beaton, B.A.,\nToronto,\nOntario.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton,\n\nI have looked over the school building today and am attaching a list of what in my judgment would be necessary to put the building into a finished state. The building was never finished - not all siding on, no corner boards, window sashings and several other items. I've included all in the list enclosed. What it would cost for labor I cannot state. Mr. Perone is not here at the present.\n\nIn my judgment it would be a wise thing to put a porch on the front as a protection in winter. The door at present opens directly outside and any storms blowing from north, N.East or East strike it directly. These are our coldest quarters for storms. I have compiled a second sheet to cover the porch if required. I've figured all these quite carefully.\n\nI may state the door at present is very badly shot up with light showing through its panels in several places.\n\nAs touching the stucco work. In my opinion that work is not necessary. The siding is in good state since the building is of a quite recent construction - just a year or so before I came here five years ago. It would not be wise to remove it to stucco nor would I think it be wise to go to expense of lathing and stuccoing over it.\n\nI feel these other repairs made would place the school in as good condition as one could expect in this country.\n\nThe stove mentioned would indeed be a good thing but when the beans or soup etc., is prepared here they get on nicely with the drink. If, however, a suitable stove were placed in the school it would relieve Mrs. Shoup of considerable work which does not really belong to her work or responsibility.\n\nAll of this is respectfully submitted. I might add that to be properly painted would both add appearance and durability of the school.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(sgd.) W. W. Shoup,\n\nCopied - JGA.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nApril 10th,\n1935.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Indian Day School,\nCross Lake\n\nAs promised in conversation with you the last time I was in Ottawa, I am herewith enclosing copy of a report of the condition of the Day School at Cross Lake, obtained from Rev. W. W. Shoup, our missionary there. You will notice that the problem of finishing the building is not as serious as I anticipated. I had thought that perhaps it might be necessary to stucco it, as was done in the case of the Hudson's Bay Company post and some of the other buildings which are the same type of construction.\n\nI understand that Mr. Lazenby, the Indian Agent at Norway House, has recently paid a visit to Cross Lake and you may have a report from him in regard to the condition of this building.\n\nI think the provision of a stove for the preparation of the hot lunch at noon is a very urgent matter. The mission house is three-quarters of a mile or more from the school and the present system of preparing the lunch there and carrying it that distance in the wintertime cannot be regarded as satisfactory. You may want to ask Mr. Lazenby for a report on this matter. If so, there is plenty of time, as the first boat from Selkirk will not likely leave until about the end of May.\n\nThanking you for your attention to this matter,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, April 15, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the repairs required to the Cross Lake United Church Indian Day School and enclosing a communication which you received from Reverend W. W. Shoup, together with list of materials required.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that Mr. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent at Norway House, has been asked to forward, at an early date, a report giving full particulars regarding the ordering and shipping of the building material, etc. He has been requested, also, to report concerning the supplying of a stove. When his reply is received, the matter of authorizing the repairs will be given immediate attention. It will be necessary, no doubt, to purchase and forward the material from Winnipeg.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, April 15, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 21st ultimo and the Department's reply thereto of the 6th instant, regarding the repairs required to the building at the Cross Lake United Church Indian Day School, I have now to inform you that the authorities of the United Church of Canada have forwarded copy of a report on the condition of the school building, obtained from Rev. W. W. Shoup, their missionary at that point. Attached to the report was an itemized list of the building materials required, and I enclose copy, for your information. I enclose, also, copy of Mr. Shoup's report on the work he would recommend.\n\nI would request that you check over the list of materials and give detailed information as to the various items required, so that the order for supplying the materials can be placed in Winnipeg.\n\nYou will note Mr. Shoup requests that a porch be erected on the front of the building, as a protection in winter, and that he states a stove is required. You should give full particulars regarding the type of stove that would be satisfactory, and request that the same be purchased locally, or whether same should be forwarded from Winnipeg. In the latter event, the Department will request Mr. Inspector Hamilton to arrange the purchase and shipping of the materials. I would request, also, that you give full shipping directions from Winnipeg to Cross Lake and state how it is proposed to carry out the labour in connection with the repairs. Could it be done by Indian labour, under the supervision of the missionary?\n\nIt is doubtful if there will be any funds to paint the building, but you might forward a list, showing in detail the paint, oil and other materials required for this purpose, with an estimate of the cost. This list should give sufficient detail to enable the purchase to be made in Winnipeg, if it is decided that funds can be provided to carry out the painting.\n\nI should be pleased to have your early reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

All the materials on the attached list, which is bracketed in red can be obtained at Cross Lake at from $45.00 to $50.00 per thousand feet. The balance will need to be purchased in Winnipeg and shipped out.\n\nThe Selkirk Navigation Company's tug makes but two trips per year to Whiskeyjack Portage, one in the early spring at the opening of navigation, and the other just before the close of navigation; about the 1st September. I am forwarding a copy of the attached list of materials to Mr Inspector Hamilton at Winnipeg, with a letter of explanation, so that if the Department approves of the purchase of the materials, it will facilitate matters if the Department were to send him a night letter asking him to purchase and ship these materials for the Cross Lake U.C. Day School, in order that the shipment may be made without delay, to arrive at Warren's Landing in time for the tug's final trip to Whiskeyjack Portage in about three week's time.\n\nThe labour in connection with these repairs can be done by local labour under the supervision of the Rev. W.W. Shoup, the resident missionary. Albert Sinclair (the newly elected Chief of the band), I am informed by Mr Shoup is capable of undertaking the carpenter work, provided he is free from his forestry duties, and the building of the chimney can be done by A. Feroni, who is the only\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\nthe only man in the north country who does this type of work. If Albert Sinclair is unable to undertake the carpenter work, Mr Peroni could do that too if necessary.\n\nI have included in the list of materials, sufficient paint to give the building two coats outside, ad sufficient Flat Wall Paint for the beaver board walls inside. The inside walls are very much in need of a coat of paint to brighten the room up, as they are very dirty.\n\nThe goods, if purchased, should be shipped to:\n\nRev: W.W.Shoup\nIndian Reserve\nCross Lake, Manitoba\nc/o Selkirk Navigation Company\nVia Whiskeyjack Portage.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

If the purchase is made, please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. These accounts, you should forward to Mr. Lazenby, with the request that, when the materials are received, he certify the account and send to the Department for payment.

Three stores at Norway House quote from $10.50 to $11.05 per case, to which would have to be added freight to Cross Lake at $1.50 per 100 lbs. The Hudson's Bay Company right at Cross Lake quotes $11.04 per case, which is the cheapest of them all.\n\nI therefore beg to requisition for authority to purchase 3 cases of Condensed Milk from the Hudson's Bay Company at Cross Lake, at a cost of $11.04 per case, for the above school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

A. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nOctober 19th, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: School Equipment, Cross Lake\n\nI am informed by the teacher at the Cross Lake Indian Day School that for two years in succession she has been asking for new desks through the Indian Agent, and the request has been ignored, while in the meantime the other denominational school at Cross Lake has received a complete new set of desks, and the Anglican school at Norway House has been similarly treated.\n\nI do not know whether these are facts or not, but I think the Department should bear in mind that, contrary to our expectations, Miss Shop has made a great success of the school at Cross Lake and has surprised all of us who were responsible for her appointment. She has from ten to fifteen children using empty hard-teak biscuit boxes for both seats and desks. I wish you would take this matter up with Mr. Lazenby and that, if possible, the estimates for next year include an amount sufficient to provide some new equipment for the Cross Lake school.\n\nThe situation at Cross Lake is quite different from most of the other places in the North, as the people do not travel so far afield in the wintertime and an increasing number of them in recent years have been leaving their families at home when they go out to their trap-lines.\n\nThanking you for your attention to this matter,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, October 24, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, the Department has no record of having received a request from the teacher of the Cross Lake United Church Indian Day School for new desks.\n\nThe Indian Agent is being written, with a view to ascertaining how many desks are required, and favourable consideration will be given to supplying them as soon as navigation opens next year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, October 24, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, in which he points out the necessity for supplying new desks to the Cross Lake United Church Indian Day School.\n\nPlease let me know the number and size of the desks required at this school, and arrangements will be made to supply these when navigation opens next Spring.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nRef: 13-A\n\nNorway House, Man:\n13th November 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No; 123-2-5 of the 24th October, having reference to desks that are needed at the Cross Lake United Church Indian Day School.\n\nIn the Requisition for materials required for this school which was forwarded to the Department under date of 26th June last, six small desks were included, but were not supplied.\n\nAs small desks were asked for, I should judge that they would be required for pupils ranging in age from 7 to 9 years, and would recommend that the following be purchased:-\n\n6 - Desks, No; 205, Page 12. Christie's latest Catalogue No; 43. Priced at $8.30 each.\n\nIf arrangements are made to have the desks shipped out from Winnipeg on the first boat after the opening of navigation next spring, they should be addressed as follows:-\n\nRev: W.W. Shoup\nUnited Church Mission\nCross Lake. Manitoba.\no/o Salkirk Navigation Company\nvia Whiskeyjack Portage\n\nShipped via Whiskeyjack as above, by the Navigation Company's tug, the freight costs would be very much less than if they were to be freighted to Cross Lake from Norway House by canoe.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nRef: 13-A\n\nNorway House, Man:\n9th November 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that I have received a letter from Rev. W.W. Shoup, the resident missionary at the Cross Lake Reserve, asking payment of $2.00 for his time and materials used in the making of a narrow table and a bench, for use of some of the pupils at the Cross Lake United Church Day School, where his daughter is teacher. Six new desks were requisitioned for, for this school, but these were not supplied, hence the making of the above mentioned table and bench.\n\nWill you please advise me if I may forward voucher to the Department for this expense? The amount may be paid from the funds I have on hand here for schools, if the Department approves. I would suggest that a certified account showing details of materials and labour be furnished, provided payment is approved.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\nRef: 19-A\n\nNorway House, Man:\n16th November 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to requisition for authority to purchase the following supplies for the Cross Lake United Church Indian Day School:\n\n50 - Bars Soap\n2 - Corn Brooms\n\nThese can be purchased locally, either here at Norway House, or at Cross Lake, for a sum amounting to approximately $5.00. The Hudson's Bay Company at Norway House quote a price of $3.46, but if the goods were purchased here, another dollar or so would have to be paid to get them to Cross Lake. The Cross Lake price, I should imagine, would be $4.50 to $5.00. Owing to there being no mail service yet in operation, I have been unable to get definite quotations from the Cross Lake stores. If the purchase is authorized, payment can be made from the school funds I have on hand.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nOttawa, December 5, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th ultimo, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery to the Cross Lake United Church Indian Day School of 50 bars soap and 2 brooms.\n\nRegarding your letter of the 9th ultimo, the Department approves payment of $2 to Rev. W. W. Shoup for making a narrow table and bench for the use of the pupils at the Cross Lake U. C. School.\n\nRegarding the desks mentioned in your letter of the 13th ultimo, please communicate with the Department about the first of April, next.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nP. G.

No; 205. Page 12. Christie's Catalogue No; 43. Priced at $8.30 each.\n\nIf these desks are purchased, they should be addressed as follows:\n\nRev: W.W.Shoup\nUnited Church Mission\nCross Lake, Manitoba\nc/o Selkirk Navigation Company\nVia Whiskeyjack Portage.\n\nShipment should be made in time to catch the first boat from Winnipeg, which will probably leave about the last week in May next.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa; Ont.;\n\nP.G.Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 9th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, you may place an order with the Christie School Supply Company in Brandon, Manitoba, for six (6) desks for the Cross Lake United Church Indian Day School. You should give the firm complete shipping instructions and advise them the date on which the first boat will leave Winnipeg.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. G. Lasenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nCross Lake, Man.\nMarch 16, 1937.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby,\nNorway Harbour,\nMan.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing the requisition for the Cross Lake Day School for the next year. Besides the articles listed therein there are some others needed for the school lunch and the work attendant to it. These are as follows:\n\nCocoa \u2014 30 lbs.\nMilk \u2014 4 cases (sweetened condensed)\n(48 tins to a case)\nBeans \u2014 250 lbs.\nBacon \u2014 30 lbs.\nTowelling \u2014 12 yds. at least.\nBrooms \u2014 as supplied other years.\nSoap \u2014 25 lbs.\n(Eskimo Biscuits \u2014 35 boxes.)\nSupplied from Agency. Will not be able to supply this quantity this year. Estimated for.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6231, file 508-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIn regard to several items on the requisition which were asked for last year and were not sent I wish to say:\n\nThe \"Highroads to Rdg. Primers\" are the primers authorized for Manitoba schools and lead up to the work in the Grade I Highroads to Rdg. text.\n\nThe \"Highroads to Rdg.\" work books and \"My Literature Books\" follow the readers with daily exercises in reading seatwork. For two years I have supplied every child in the school with a work book paid for by myself because these are such a great help to the child in gaining comprehension in reading and in enlarging his knowledge of the English language. I feel they should be supplied by the Department and not at the teacher's own expense.\n\nThe newsprint is a cheap paper to be used on the hectograph for various children's seatwork exercises.\n\nThere have been no exercise books for writing practice in this school for the past two years. I have ordered\nPrimary Ruled Exercise Books for Grade VII and Freehand Copy Books for Grade III\u2014Bailey Writing Books supplied by the Ideal Letter Cards are used almost every day in Beginners' seatwork and the free stock in the school have been here for six years that I know so they are badly depleted and outworn.\n\nI have ordered transparent tape to repair several torn text books. Last year the doctor advised me to order two items for the health and cleanliness of the school. These were:\n\nElb (insect killer) for the children's hair and Kleenex to be used in school since there are few handkerchiefs and these are needed so continuously all year.\n\nFor the same matter of health I have asked for a metal Water Container for the school which will have a cover over the drinking water and a tap from which to draw the water, thus doing away with the unhealthy dipper and dirty pail now in use.\n\nThese items I believe are really needed in the school and fort.\nthe reason I have stressed them here.\n\nI have asked for 35 boxes of biscuit because this year there were scarcely half enough biscuits sent here. In past years there have always been more biscuits than were needed. In 1875-36 the attendance increased because of the noon lunch when school closed in June there was only one box of biscuits left over. The old boxes of mouse eaten, years old, biscuits had all been used to supplement the new boxes.\n\nThis year the biscuits are already all gone. According to the attendance in 1886-31 thirty-five boxes of biscuits are needed to give each child two biscuits per day as they have always received. The aggregate attendance was 35185, the biscuits averaging 200 per box.\n\nWill you kindly forward the enclosed copy of this letter with the requisition for this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nConstance M. Sharp.\nNorway House, Man:\n30th March 1937.\n\nRef: 19-A\n\nAPR 8 1937\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith Requisition for School Materials required for the Cross Lake United Church Indian Day School, with a copy of a letter written in connection therewith by Miss Constance Shoup, the teacher, which she has asked me to forward to you with the requisition.\n\nWith reference to Biscuits for this school, I may say that Miss Shoup wrote asking for a further supply last fall, as the supply sent was exhausted. Six Hundred pounds of biscuits was included in the Estimates for this school for the coming fiscal year, as before, but apparently the attendance has increased until this quantity is not sufficient, to allow two biscuits a day to each pupil as she has been doing. The total quantity Estimated for for this year, will not permit the allowance of 35 boxes to this school unless other schools go short. As the pupils of this school get bacon, beans and cocoa in addition to the biscuits, I should judge that one biscuit should be sufficient, per pupil, instead of two. Pupils at the Rossville, Island Lake, and God's Lake schools do not get bacon, beans and cocoa as the pupils of this school do.\n\nShipment of this requisition should be addressed to:-\n\nRev: W.W. Shoup\nUnited Church Mission\nCross Lake, Manitoba\nc/o Selkirk Navigation Company\nWinnipeg, Man;\nVia Whiskeyjack Portage\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

C. Indian Day School, you may purchase 12 yards towelling; 2 brooms and 25 bars of soap.\n\nRegarding certain books requested by the teacher, these are not supplied by the Department but we are substituting others which we consider suitable.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of the quantity of cocoa, condensed milk, beans and bacon that you consider absolutely necessary for midday meal purposes at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Stevens, United Church Mission, Cross Lake, Man.\n\nThese goods have been out of our possession now for about seven months, and we think you will agree that the margin of profit in the grocery business, will not permit any wholesaler to carry accounts for this length of time without suffering a direct loss on the transaction.\n\nWe realise your difficult position in that up to the time of your last letter you had not received any word from Mr. Stevens. At the same time we think that, in all fairness, our account should be paid, since it is through no fault of ours that delay has been caused in your communication with the North country.\n\nThe goods were shipped in accordance with your instructions and doubtless reached their destination, otherwise we would have heard something about it, and under these circumstances we shall appreciate it if you will be good enough to send us a remittance for $58.33, in payment for this very much overdue invoice.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE GODVILLE COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nper. [Signature]\n\nHKS/L.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 25, 1941.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant with reference to your account of $68.33 covering the cost of goods shipped to the Cross Lake U.C. Indian Day School. I regret the delay in paying this account but a cheque could not be issued until a certified account had been received from the teacher, Mr. Stevens. The account only reached us within the last week and in forwarding it Mr. Stevens explained that the delay was due, in a large part, to uncertain mail facilities. A cheque in payment of the account has already been issued and I hope has reached you by this time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOffice of the Indian Agent,\nNorway House Manitoba,\n1st October 1942.\n\nMrs. John Leowen,\nCross Lake Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th September handed me last night by Mrs. Frank Meadows.\n\nI received the requisition sent in by Mr. Harry Meadows for materials for repairing the school, but this was much too large for me to authorize without Departmental sanction, and it was too late to put the requisition through Ottawa, and get the materials to Cross Lake, even had they been eventually authorized. I have however, authority to have two suitable outdoor toilets built at your school, and I should be glad if you would see that this is done. The necessary number might probably be procured from the saw mill at the R.C.A. Mission, and the mails at the H.B. Co. The cost must be kept to the absolute minimum. Accounts for the materials for these toilets should be rendered to this office in three copies certified by yourself.\n\nI note that you say the payment of treaty at the school left the building in a disgracefully dirty condition. The building was certainly not in a condition such as you describe the last time I saw it. However please have the inside cleaned and scrubbed, and paid for through the H.B. Co., in the usual way, concerning which Mr. Shalmers will advise you if you ask him. If I can get a man to take them, I will send you two sacks of cement, with which it should be possible to repair the cracks in the chimney. It should be possible to get someone on the reserve to the necessary labor re the toilets and the chimney, under your supervision, and I should be glad if you would do this.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) P.G. Lazenby.\nUnited Church Mission,\nCross Lake Manitoba,\nSeptember 28, 1942.\n\nMrs. F.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI arrived at Cross Lake on Sept. 24 to take over the teaching duties at the United Church Indian Day School. I will commence teaching on Oct. 1 as directed.\n\nI was very disappointed in the school. Much cleaning and repairing are necessary before the school will be ready for use. I have seen the Catholic Mission school and I think there is too great a difference in the appearance of the two buildings for both being supported by the government. From my experience I have noticed that school children take a pride in attending a school which is as good or better than their neighbors and the teacher can expect good results only when the conditions under which he works are favorable.\n\nThe payment of Treaty money in the school during August left the building in a disgracefully dirty condition.\n\nI believe Mr. Meadows has informed you of the condition of the school and that you had him forward a requisition for the required repair material but to date none has arrived. He has told me that you are interested in improving the condition of the building so I trust that you will see to it that I am given the opportunity to make my school presentable and conducive to good work on the part of the children. I regret that my first letter to you is one of complaint but if you have seen the school you will know that complaint is justified. Looking forward to a pleasant association with you, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) John E. Leowen.\nCross Lake Manitoba,\nMarch 26, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is to report that the Indian Boys School operated by this mission was completely destroyed by fire on Wednesday March 24th. The entire contents were also destroyed. The fire originated in a defective chimney.\n\nI took up the matter of the defective chimney and the condition of the entire school with the Indian Agent as long ago as last August when he paid treaty in the building but nothing was done about it. The cement chimney was cracked so badly that creosote had run out of the cracks and seeped through the ceiling and gone all over the teacher's desk and floor. The Agent complained of this but did not go upstairs to inspect the chimney. I pointed out to him that the whole building was in very poor condition and that if things were left until the teacher arrived it would be too late to have anything done. He agreed that this was true and asked me to go over the building and note what was needed and forward a requisition to him. This was done and I personally gave him the requisition on August 21, 1942. I am enclosing the duplicate of this requisition; you will note that the need for a new chimney is pointed out as the old one was cracked and falling apart.\n\nAs no repair material arrived and no letter was received from the Agent by the time the teacher arrived he wrote the Agent on Sept. 28, 1942, pointing out the very bad condition of the building and the need for repairs. A copy of his letter is enclosed. A copy of the Indian Agent's reply is also enclosed. You will note that he had done nothing whatever about the requisition he had had me make out, because he considered it large. He had not even forwarded it to Ottawa for consideration. I should like to point out that it would have been possible to get the material in to Cross Lake as late as six weeks after the requisition was filed with him. Even if it was not the proper time for requisition to go forward to Ottawa it strikes me that a defective chimney is a serious enough matter to be dealt with at any time, it has certainly proved so. The cement which he mentioned that he might send never did arrive and the chimney was never repaired.\nMy predecessor in this mission, Mr. F.W. Stevens complained of the school's condition and the condition of the chimney to the Agent at the time of the treaty payment in 1941 so that certainly did not lack knowledge of it.\n\nI am making this report and forwarding the enclosures in order that you might have full knowledge of the situation it is apparent to me as I believe it will be to you that the Indian Agent's neglect has cost the Department a building which, while it was not good, would with a little repair have served as a school for many years to come.\n\nThe teacher Mrs. Loewen is at present carrying on in a building belonging to this mission.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.Meadows\nREQUISITION FOR REPAIR MATERIAL FOR CROSS LAKE UNITED CHURCH DAY SCHOOL.\n\n1 new chimney (5 feet brick), present cement block cracked and falling apart.\n\n2 iron pipes\n\n\u00bd 2\" elbows.\n\n1 heater guard, 3-sided made of 36\" wide sheet metal, 18 feet of this material will be required.\n\n3 sheets beaver board 4' X 6'\n\n100 feet of 36\" burlap and 300 feet of panel stripping.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. H. Meadows, B.A.,\nUnited Church Missionary,\nCross Lake, Manitoba.\n\nCOPY SENT TO INSPECTOR HAMILTON\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, April 14, 1943.\n\nMr. P. G. Lasenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nYou notified the Department, in a telegram dated March 27, that the United Church Indian Day School at Cross Lake had been, with its contents, totally destroyed by fire.\n\nWe are now in receipt of a letter dated March 26, 1943, signed by Harry Meadows, United Church Missionary at Cross Lake, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"I took up the matter of the defective chimney and the condition of the entire school with the Indian agent as long ago as last August, when he paid treaty in the building, but nothing was done about it. The cement chimney was cracked so badly that creosote had run out of the cracks and soaked through the ceiling and gone all over the teacher's desk and floor. The agent complained of this but did not go up stairs to inspect the chimney. I pointed out to him that the whole building was in very poor condition and that if things were left until the teacher arrived it would be too late to have anything done. He agreed that this was true and asked me to go over the building and note what was needed and forward a requisition to him. This was done and I personally gave him the requisition on August 21, 1942. I am enclosing the duplicate of this requisition. You will note that the need for a new chimney is pointed out as the old one was cracked and falling apart.\n\n\"As no repair material arrived and no letter was received from the agent by the time the teacher arrived, he wrote the agent on September 25, 1942, pointing out the very bad condition of the building and the need for repairs. A copy of his letter is enclosed. A copy of the Indian agent's reply is also enclosed. You will note that he had done nothing whatever about the requisition he had me make out, because he considered it large. He had not even forwarded it to Ottawa for consideration. I should like\n\nCOPY SENT TO INSPECTOR HAMILTON\nto point out that it would have been possible to get the material in to Cross Lake as late as 6 weeks after the requisition was filed with him. Even if it was not the proper time for a requisition to go forward to Ottawa, it strikes me that a defective chimney is a serious enough matter to be dealt with at any time. It has certainly proved so.\"\n\nWe should like to receive from you immediately any comments you may care to make in respect to Mr. Meadows' statement. We are anxious to know if the requisition to which he refers was sent forward to the Department. There is nothing on file here to indicate that it reached this Branch. If it was not submitted, we should like an explanation as to why you did not consider it necessary to send forward this requisition for supplies and why you did not deem it necessary to have the chimney, which appeared to be in a dilapidated condition at the time of your visit, repaired at once.\n\nA requisition for certain supplies necessary at the Cross Lake United Church School, dated March 5, 1943, reached the Department on April 6. It was exceedingly difficult for the officials here, immediately following the receipt of this requisition, to decide whether these supplies had been requested for the school now destroyed by fire or for the temporary mission building now in use. In order that there might be no delay, Inspector Hamilton was authorized, on April 7, to purchase the materials and to have them shipped immediately following the opening of navigation on Lake Winnipeg.\n\nTo neglect to bring to the attention of the Department certain fire hazards that may exist at Indian day schools or other government-owned buildings is a very serious matter at any time. Your alleged failure in this case has resulted in the destruction of the Cross Lake School, at a time when it is exceedingly difficult to secure the funds necessary for the maintenance and operation of our schools and when it is impossible to secure either the funds or the materials required for replacement. You will be expected to submit, at the earliest possible date, a full and complete explanation in respect to this matter.

We should be glad if you would give consideration to the matter of paying us some rent for the use of this building. I do not know what it is nor how much it is worth, but I should be glad if you would ask Mr. Lazenby to let you know what he thinks is a fair amount to pay for this.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:MLT\nOttawa, May 4, 1943.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D., Associate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions, United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West, Toronto 2, Ont.\n\nRe: Rent of Mission Building,\nCross Lake, Man.\n\nIn response to the suggestion contained in your letter of the 30th ultimo, I am today communicating with Indian Agent Lasenby with respect to the amount that might be allowed for the use of the mission building at Cross Lake, now occupied as a classroom. Just as soon as a reply is received from the agent, I shall be glad to communicate with you again.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, May 4, 1943.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba,\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received by this Branch from the Reverend Dr. Dorey. It would be appreciated if you could let us have a statement indicating the amount that might be allowed for the use of the mission building at Cross Lake, now used as an Indian day school.\n\nEnc.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nI beg to confirm my radiogram of the 26th March addressed to the Department, and reading as follows:\n\nRECEIVED RADIOGRAM FROM TEACHER UNITED CHURCH DAY SCHOOL AT CROSS LAKE ADVISING THAT SCHOOL BUILDING AND CONTENTS DESTROYED BY FIRE ON TUESDAY MORNING STOP CARRYING ON AS BEST HE CAN FOR PRESENT IN BUILDING LOANED BY CHURCH STOP WILL WRITE WHEN RECEIVE FULLER REPORT.\n\nSince dispatching the above radiogram, the teacher himself has visited the office, and advised me that on the 24th March, the last stick of wood he put in the stove was put in at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and the fire occurred at about 9.30 p.m. On finding that the school soon after the fire broke out, he went in and looked in the stove, but there was only a stub a double handful of glowing coals in the back of the stove. The building took fire in the roof near the chimney, which apparently has been cracked for some time. The chimney was built of concrete. There was no way of saving either the building or the contents.\n\nThe teacher secured the loan of a small building belonging to the United Church, in which to carry on the school, and purchased a quantity of rough lumber from the R.O. Residential School with which to make up some tables and seats. The Residential School also supplied him with a few books such as readers and arithmetic, and also sent him some scribblers, readers and pencils which I obtained from the Residential School at Norway House. He lacks a blackboard however, but succeeded to get a very small one about two feet by three feet, from the Hudson's Bay Company at Cross Lake, and although he now has he hopes to be able to carry on fairly well for the balance of the school term. The teacher stated that he did not keep all his school materials in the school building, but just what he required for immediate use, and so a small quantity was thus available from the school's own stores.\n\nWith the exception of the desks, which were fastened to the floor, I believe, the total loss is not by any means great. The building was a very old one, of log construction. There was no teacher's desk, a rickety little table being used in place of one. There was a small cupboard, home made, of rough boards, and the blackboard, which was also much the worse for wear. The school bell, which hung in the porch over the door was chopped off and saved from the fire by the teacher.\n\nThe teacher states that he cannot understand how\n\np.t.o.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6231, file 508-5, part 3)\nthe fire got started at that time of night, there being such a very small quantity of hot coals in the stove, and no wood having been put in for over six hours before.\n\nI should be glad to be advised if there is any possibility of building and equipping a new school to replace the one burned, during the coming summer, of a size large enough to accommodate 30 pupils. If so, preparations should be commenced as soon as possible.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI would refer to your letter of April 7th, listing requirements for the Cross Lake U.C. Day School, and your letter of April 14th to Mr. Lazenby regarding the destruction of the School by fire.\n\nFollowing receipt of your letter of April 7th quotations were asked for the list of food and wool and the orders placed. However, we were awaiting more specific information from Mr. Lazenby regarding one or two of the hardware items and had not ordered that list of material. On April 29th Mr. Lazenby wired us as follows:\n\n\"Requisition for materials for repair of Cross Lake United Church Day School including five foot chimney not now required.\"\n\nWe will, therefore, take no action regarding the list of hardware. I trust it is in order to have the cocoa, beans, rice, salt pork, condensed milk and wool shipped on the opening of navigation.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa,\nMay 10, 1943.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIn reply to your communication of the 7th instant, please proceed to have the cocoa, beans, rice, salt pork, condensed milk and wool shipped as soon as possible to the Cross Lake U.C. Day School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, May 22, 1943.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nRe: Destruction of Cross Lake U. C. Indian Day School\n\nI desire to refer to departmental AIR MAIL letter to you dated April 14, 1943, in which we sought additional information with respect to the destruction of the above-noted building.\n\nI may state that we have had recently, two enquiries from the office of the Minister with respect to the fire at the Cross Lake Indian Day School. It is of the utmost importance, therefore, that we should have a full and complete report from you in regard to this matter, at the earliest possible date.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNorway House, Man:\n26th April 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept' of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of The Director's letter No; 123-2-5 of the 14th instant, regarding the burning down of the Cross Lake U.C. Indian Day School, and quoting therein certain extracts from a letter addressed to the Department by Mr Harry Meadows, the United Church Missionary at Cross Lake, concerning the same subject.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that on August 5th last, the day I completed treaty payment at Cross Lake, I looked over the building, and, contrary to the statement made by Mr Meadows in his letter, I went upstairs to see the chimney while the Agency Clerk was busy balancing collections made, with the various traders' accounts. I noted that the cement chimney was cracked, and that some creosote had leaked through the ceiling into the school room below. In his letter, Mr Meadows states that \"...creosote had run out of the cracks and soaked through the ceiling and gone all over the teacher's desk and floor.\" This statement would seem calculated to give the impression that a teacher's desk had been destroyed in the fire, and that a very large amount of creosote had leaked into the schoolroom. The fact is, that the teacher had no desk, but used a small homemade table, and as for the creosote, there was a small spot on this table, and a spot on the floor beside it probably about a foot square. This particular point has no special value, excepting that it indicates exaggeration, and Mr Meadows' desire to put as bad a complexion as possible on matters.\n\nIn talking over with Mr Meadows the matter of doing some repair work at the school, I asked him to figure out what repairs he thought were necessary, and suggested to him that the inside of the school could do with some painting, and requested him to make out a list of what might be required, with a minimum of expense. My own opinion was that the building being in very poor condition, it was not worth spending very much money on, and I expected to receive from Mr Meadows a small list of things that I could have purchased direct from\n\n- Winnipeg -\nWinnipeg, without having to send a requisition through Ottawa, and encounter that much delay. After I received the requisition, and saw how large it was, I took the first opportunity of asking the Captain of the Selkirk Navigation Co's tug how many more trips he was going to make to Whiskeyjack, and he advised me that he was going that same week, and the week following, if I remember correctly. This would preclude the possibility of shipping the materials on the requisition to Whiskeyjack on the tug, as there would not be time to forward the requisition to Ottawa get the materials purchased and shipped in time. I therefore decided to try to send some cement to Cross Lake with which to repair the chimney, if I could find anyone going there by canoe, and withhold the requisition until this spring and send it in with all the other school requisitions, then have the whole job of repairing the school done during this summer holidays.\n\nMr Meadows forwarded with his letter to Ottawa, a copy of the teacher's letter to me of September 28th, and a copy of my reply thereto. From the copy of my reply, it will be noted in the last paragraph that I mentioned that I was intending to send the cement for repairing the chimney if an opportunity presented. I am unable to say now, whether or not the cement was sent, as no record of it would be kept, the cement being some that was left over from some other jobs at the agency. However, the teacher, Mr John Loewen, was at Norway House during the Christmas holidays, about December 29th or 30th, and came to see me at the office. In talking about the school, he mentioned that they had 'got the chimney patched up, and it was not too bad now'. He also remarked that sometimes smoke leaked through the stove pipe joints, but not as bad as before.\n\nIn his letter, Mr Meadows states that \"...it would have been possible to get the material in to Cross Lake as late as 6 weeks after the requisition was filled with him.\" I suppose that by this, he means that freeze-up did not occur until that time, but that does not mean that transportation by water to Cross Lake was available, or possible, as late as that, as it certainly was not.\n\nIf the chimney was still 'defective', as Mr Meadows states, after it had been patched up as I was advised by the teacher, then one would think that some extra care might have been taken in the putting on of fires, and seeing that no fire was left in the stove when school closed in the afternoons. As it was, there was still fire in the stove at 9.30 p.m., six and a half hours after the last previous time wood had been put in, as I mentioned in my letter to the Department of April 14th, so that there was evidently a very large fire put in at 3 p.m. and there must have been still a large fire in at 4 p.m. when...\nscholars and teacher left the building for the night. In contrast to this, I may say that at the Norway House Public School, where the chimney is not defective, the teacher sees that all the fire is raked out of the stove before leaving the building at 4 p.m.\n\nWith reference to the requisition recently forwarded to the Department for the Cross Lake U.C. School, I beg to say that the materials asked for on Page 3, for \"Repairs for the School\" will not now be required, but I expect the materials on Pages 1 and 2 will be required. With reference to the materials on Page 3, I beg to say that on April 15th I received a letter from Mr Inspector Hamilton advising that he had been instructed to purchase some supplies for the Cross Lake U.C. School, among which was the item, 1 - Chimney, (5t brick), and Mr Hamilton asked me to advise him what was required for this item. I replied to Mr Hamilton's letter on the same day, advising him that the bricks for the chimney would not now be required, as the school building had been destroyed by fire on March 24th. From this it is probable that Mr Hamilton would conclude that the rest of the materials would also not be required. However, I will wire Mr Hamilton as soon as it is possible to reach the radio station, and advise him. I may say that The Director's letter, to which this is a reply, arrived on the last mail plane before break-up, and the ice has not been safe to travel on since that time. It will possibly be three or four more weeks before this letter leaves Norway House, which will account for the delay in receiving it at Ottawa.\n\nF.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 10, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nRe: Destruction United Church Indian Day School, Cross Lake, Manitoba.\n\nI am sending forward herewith correspondence relating to the destruction of the above-noted building. The subject matter of this correspondence, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nMr. Lazenby, in his letter dated April 26, submits a lengthy explanation of his failure to take the action necessary to repair the chimney at the school. This explanation, however, in my judgment, is faulty in a number of particulars. For example, it would appear that it was his intention to send forward cement for the repair of the chimney, but in his letter you will note he states:\n\n\"I am unable to say now whether or not the cement was sent, as no record of it would be kept, the cement being some that was left over from some other jobs at the agency.\"\n\nIn view of the acute fire hazard that existed at this school at the time of the agent's visit, it is exceedingly difficult to understand why he did not assume personal responsibility for sending on the supplies and materials necessary for this work.\n\nThe officials of this Branch have had a feeling for a couple of years that Mr. Lazenby has neither the health nor the physical stamina necessary to administer the affairs of the Norway House Agency. The care of government property at Indian day and residential schools, teachers' residences and agency buildings, generally, is the responsibility of the agent. It should not be...\nnecessary for a school teacher to remind him from time to time that a fire hazard exists at any particular building.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, I am disposed to think that consideration should be given to the desirability of transferring Mr. Lasenby to another agency or to a position where the duties and responsibilities would be less exacting.\n\nEncl.\n\nActing Director.\n| DATE   | ITEMS                        | REF. | CHARGES | CREDITS | BALANCE |\n|--------|------------------------------|------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 1943   | Balance Forward              |      |         |         | -50     |\n|        | Paul Rosalie Ross            |      |         |         |         |\n|        | Janitor work (March)         |      |         |         |         |\n|        | Rosalie Ross                 |      |         |         |         |\n\n| DATE   | ITEMS                        | REF. | CHARGES | CREDITS | BALANCE |\n|--------|------------------------------|------|---------|---------|---------|\n|        | Balance Forward              |      |         |         | 150     |\n|        | Rent (Feb 22)                |      |         |         |         |\n|        | One dollar 50\u00a2               |      |         |         |         |\n|        | Janitor work Feb 1-22        |      |         |         |         |\n|        | Isobel Sinclair              |      |         |         |         |\n\nIndian Affairs.

You said that it was not possible to get an appropriation this year to build a new school. Something must be done about providing a building. You know the peculiar situation on this Reserve and I do not need to say that we cannot allow the school to lapse.\n\nMr. Meadows says that it might be possible to remodel or refit a large warehouse on the property, which is a log building and in very good condition, to serve as a school for the duration of the war, for something like $500, apart, of course, from the desks. Would you kindly look into this matter and see whether it is possible to get a grant of $500 to be expended on this? Cross Lake is not so far from Norway House that the Indian Agent could not keep his eye on the expenditure of this money. I think the matter should be attended to right away. The freeze-up will soon be here, even though it does not feel very much like it today.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:HC\nCross Lake H.C.

Indian Day School. We will provide an amount between $300.00 and $500.00 to make necessary repairs, on the understanding that Mr. Meadows will supervise the work. If he does any actual work himself for which you consider he should be allowed pay, we would be willing to reimburse him out of this amount, provided his work is done between now and the end of August. We would not be able to pay him after the end of August, due to the fact that the schools are supposed to re-open on the first of September and he would be drawing salary as teacher from that date. We will also arrange to order the desks. If immediate funds are necessary I could arrange to have some money sent to Indian Agent Lazenby and Mr. Meadows could get in touch with him as the money was required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

You had better have the cheque made payable to the order of Mr. Harry Meadows. He reports that the carpenter and he will have the building ready for finishing with wallboard by the end of the week.\n\nNothing was said about the payment of rent for the use of the building, and I wonder whether you thought that the $300.00 that you had invested in it would cover this. You might let me know what you think.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MLT\nOttawa, September 24, 1943.\n\nRe: Cross Lake Day School.\n\nDear Doctor Dorsey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 20th instant, in which you ask for payment of $300.00 for certain repairs and alterations that have been made to the temporary school building at Cross Lake.\n\nI am particularly anxious that a cheque for this amount should reach Mr. Meadows prior to the close of navigation. It is my understanding that the last boat this year may leave Winnipeg on or about October 4.\n\nI have this morning discussed this matter very fully with Mr. McCutcheon, Chief Treasury Officer. He informs me that it will not be possible to make a payment of this kind until we have a statement from Mr. Meadows, signed by him and the Indian agent, giving in detail the amount of money spent on the purchase of material, hours of labour, etc. If we had this statement, no difficulty would be experienced in sending forward the cheque.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be possible for you to send forward a cheque to Mr. Meadows, from church funds, on the understanding that he be asked to secure this statement of the work accomplished and forward it to us. We could then reimburse you for the amount paid by you. I must state, however, that immediately following the close of navigation there will be only two mails in to Norway House during the winter season and probably none between the close of navigation and Christmas. With these facts in your possession, you can turn the matter over in\n\nReverend George Dorsey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto Ont.\n\np.t.o.\nyour mind and do whatever you deem best, in view of all the circumstances.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nI desire to refer to official letter of August 9th, in which was inclosed a letter from the Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions for the United Church, with reference to the Cross Lake United Church Indian Day School.\n\nI understand this work is nearing completion and you should assist Mr. Meadows to forward accounts in the manner required by this branch.\n\nIf Mr. Meadows has had to buy materials for these repairs and he has paid for them, he should supply you with receipted accounts, which you should put on voucher forms.\n\nRegarding the labour, he should prepare a statement showing the names of the persons who were employed, the rate per hour or per day and the exact dates on which they were working. If the men have been paid by Mr. Meadows they should receipt amounts opposite their names, in order that a refund may be paid to Mr. Meadows. If they have not been paid you should forward a statement showing the names, and cheques will be forwarded to you. It would be appreciated if you would give this your immediate attention.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSept. 25, 1943\n\nThe Department of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Cross Lake School\n\nI have your letter of Sept. 24th. We are sending a cheque to Mr. Meadows and also telling him what you require. As soon as he has sent the details, you can have the cheque made out to us. I am sure that he will need the money right away and on the other hand, I can see that the position taken by Mr. McCutcheon is reasonable, so we will cooperate together in this way.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD/EB\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6231, file 508-5, part 3)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to forward herewith voucher #348 in favour of the Hudson's Bay Company, Winnipeg, amounting to Forty-one Dollars and five cents ($41.05) covering labour, materials, equipment and janitor work for the new Cross Lake U.C. School building, and including $5.00 for labour painting the Department warehouse.\n\nIn connection with the expenditures for the new school building, I would refer to Mr. Philip Phelan's letter #125-2-5, dated September 24th last. I have sent some labour forms to Mr. H. Meadows requesting that he have these completed and returned to this office, attached to the respective invoices. I have since received word from Mr Meadows, from which I quote the following:\n\n\"It was impossible for me to use the labour sheets you sent, as the labour had long since been finished and the men who did it gone to the bush. I have however kept all accounts in the manner agreed upon with Mr Hoey and Dr. Dorey when I made my proposition with them, last June. I was directed to forward them to the Department via your office when complete. Everything is completed now, and I am only awaiting a receipt from Brown & Rutherford, before I can forward the complete account.\"\n\nIt will be noted that the attached account apart from the janitor work is certified by Mr Meadows, and Mr. H.J. Gerbrandt, but there are no receipts attached signed by those who received payment for labour.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nUNITED CHURCH MISSION\nCROSS LAKE, Man.\n\nJanuary 9, 1944.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith complete statements of all accounts in connection with the alterations made to our large warehouse in fitting it up as a school for the Indian Affairs Branch. All accounts are in triplicate and have been kept in the manner directed. I trust that you will find them in order. I regret that there has been such a long delay in sending the account forward but I have only just received the last receipts from our Church office. When the account is approved would you have the Indian Affairs Branch forward a cheque for the total amount which is $315.81 to the Toronto office of the United Church of Canada.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. Meadows\nNorway House, Man.\nJanuary 19, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to forward herewith voucher #391 in favour of the United Church of Canada, Toronto, amounting to $315.81 covering labour and materials for re-modelling a building belonging to the United Church at Cross Lake, for use as an Indian Day School.\n\nOn receipt of Mr Phelan's letter #123-2-5 of September 24th, I wrote to Mr Meadows quoting the last two paragraphs of Mr Phelan's letter, and sending him a supply of labour forms with instructions as to how they should be made out and receipted by the Indian labourers. Mr Meadows was at Norway House shortly afterwards and explained that he could not get the labour forms signed, as the Indians concerned had left for their winter camps.\n\nA copy of the letter written by Mr Meadows when forwarding the accounts, is attached to the voucher.\n\nP. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI attach account amounting to $315.81, covering the cost of materials and labour for repairs to a building to serve as the Cross Lake U.C. Day School.\n\nThe Cross Lake U.C. Indian Day School was destroyed by fire on March 24. In August, 1943, Reverend Doctor George Dorsey, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, advised the Department that there was a large warehouse which could be remodelled to serve as a school for the duration of the war. We immediately approved an expenditure of approximately $300.00 in order to carry out the necessary work. As the season was advancing and it was necessary to have this building available as close to September 1 as possible, the United Church authorities were authorized to go ahead. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order covering the attached voucher. The coding is as follows: 508-76-10-691.\n\nR.A.

In August, 1943, Reverend Doctor George Dorey, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, advised the Department that there was a large warehouse which could be remodelled to serve as a school for the duration of the war. We immediately approved an expenditure of approximately $300.00 in order to carry out the necessary work. As the season was advancing and it was necessary to have this building available as close to September 1 as possible, the United Church authorities were authorized to go ahead.

Day school on Purchase Orders #20176 and #20177. Instructions on these Purchase Orders were to ship the desks direct to Mr H. Meadows teacher U.C. Indian Day School, Cross Lake, Man. and to send four copies of the invoices direct to Mr Meadows.\n\nI may say that twenty desks were purchased for this school, from the Globe Furniture Limited of Waterloo, Ontario, by Purchase Order #19751. These desks were shipped to me, and were sent from here to Cross Lake. The account for these desks was forwarded to the Department with covering voucher #274 dated October 11th, 1943.\n\nI am writing Mr H Meadows, to ask him if he received those school desks covered by purchase orders #20176 and #20177.\n\nP. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nIMPORTANT\u2014Caution Notice\nPLEASE READ CAREFULLY\n\nSchool Desks\n\nACCEPTANCE OF SHIPMENT AND BREAKAGE\n\nThe goods covered by the attached invoice were receipted for by the Railroad Company as having been received by them in good condition and properly packed. Before accepting the shipment from the Railroad Company it is your duty to assure yourself that all articles enumerated on the bill of lading are included in the shipment and in good condition. To protect yourself against loss or damage in transit, check the shipment carefully with your bill of lading, noting the number of crates or packages and their contents. Any parts broken by the Railroad Company will be deducted free of charge by us on the following conditions only:\n\nFirst\u2014The consignee must not give the Railroad Company a clear receipt for the complete shipment if there is any shortage, breakage or damage of any kind. In the event there is such shortage, or if any part of the shipment is damaged, the consignee must return a receipt for the goods if the railroad agent will make a notation on the freight bill indicating the amount of the shortage or the extent and the nature of the damage. This freight bill must be mailed to us.\n\nIf the breakage or damage is concealed and not discovered until the goods are unpacked, notify the Agent of the Railroad Company by letter or telephone to call immediately and examine the shipment. The carrier is equally responsible for \"Concealed Damage\" as for visible damage and when notified as suggested it places the burden of proof upon the carrier. When you have given the Railroad Company notice in the manner suggested, mail us your bill of lading and paid freight bill.\n\nSecond\u2014When there is shortage, breakage or damage in an express shipment, request your Express Agent to furnish you receipt showing the condition in which the shipment was delivered to you.\n\nThird\u2014When you report shortage or breakage to us, enumerate fully and describe clearly the parts you desire replaced. In ordering standards for School Desks specify size and whether right or left, which is always determined as you sit at the desk. It is well to supplement your order by mentioning the pattern mark you will find on the piece. If several styles of desks, be sure to state the style for which the parts are desired, particularly if wooden parts are being ordered. Care in making your order clear and complete will permit us to give you immediate service.\n\nFourth\u2014All claims for shortage, breakage or damage must be made within Thirty Days and you must provide us with the necessary papers to enable us to file claim against the Railroad or Express Company, as explained in Paragraphs No. 1 and No. 2. Otherwise claim will not be allowed.\n\nFifth\u2014We are not responsible for parts broken through carelessness of drayman hauling the goods or your workmen in assembling and installing.\n\nSTORAGE\n\nThe desks manufactured under this contract were constructed from thoroughly air seasoned and properly kiln-dried material and packed in perfect condition when shipment left our factory. This does not mean that parts will remain perfect regardless of local atmospheric conditions. Under no condition store this furniture even temporarily in a damp cellar or basement nor in a partly completed structure where building material, such as plaster, calcimine, paint, etc., may be thrown about the crates. Store in a dry, well ventilated room of normal uniform temperature. The crates containing woods should rest on their ends and all crates and boxes be elevated above floor a few inches to allow free air circulation under and around them.\n\nCLEANING AND POLISHING\n\nDo not attempt to clean or polish the woodwork with linseed oil, turpentine, undiluted benzine, gasoline, alcohol, or anything of that kind. These materials are varnish solvents which soften the varnish and spoil the finish; nor do we recommend any one of the various furniture polishes on the market. The following is a very good cleaner and polisher, the constituents of which can usually be obtained in any paint or drug store for a few cents:\n\nRubbing Compound:\n9 parts Shellac Thinner Oil.\n1 part Benzine.\n\nMix thoroughly before using.\n\nMoisten a rag with this solution, apply sparingly to the surface and immediately rub dry with a clean dry cloth. Cheese cloth is recommended. The most effective result is obtained through the rubbing, not through excessive use of the solution.\n\nN. B.\u2014We maintain a SERVICE DEPARTMENT for the purpose of giving our customers all possible information and rendering any service to insure the proper installation and care of our products. If you have any difficulty in the installation and desire further information, your request will receive immediate attention.

A. Hoey,\nSup't. Welfare and Training Service,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nYour letter of 29th ult. has just reached me. In order that you might know that the matter is receiving attention and that you may have some of the information desired; I have today wired a brief reply.\n\nThe question of the type of school required here is not easily decided. If the Department has in mind the conventional school for instruction in the conventional school program there is no difficulty. However, some Department officials have given me the impression that the Department intends extending its educational program along other lines. If this is the case future needs should be kept in mind when deciding the type of school to be erected.\n\nI believe a school could be of great use here in the matter of adult education. There is real need for instruction in the canning and preserving of meat and vegetables. Cross Lake is a wonderful place for gardening and much can be done along these lines as the people are ready for it. I have accomplished some things in this direction through the mission. A school with an adequate basement and equipped with a cooking range would be ideal. A school of the type of Berens River (Manitoba) United Church Indian Day school would serve the purpose. The basement could also be used as a dining hall where the noon lunches could be served. Such a school could become a real community centre and do much more than instruct in the \"three 'R's'\". Cross Lake people not only need such a community centre but have advanced to the point where they realize their need.\n\nA teacher's residence would be almost a necessary part of such a school plant, but with the materials available in this country it could be erected at no great expense. At the price at which we can get lumber there is no need for running into great expense in building.\nOn March 4th I wrote stating that in my opinion it would be a mistake to build the school on the site of the former one and suggesting that I make a survey to ascertain the best location of a school. Actually I have almost completed this survey and have only to transfer the information to maps make the situation clear to the Department. My survey clearly shows me that one school, no matter what its type may be, cannot adequately serve the needs of this reserve. If you can probably surmise this reserve has a school-age population of approximately 200. The settlement stretches for about five miles along the shores of the river and lake. This means that the children to be served by a day school, and they are in the majority, will have very long walks in winter and long boat trips in summer if there is only one Day School. The result is that they will not (and do not) attend.\n\nIf the Department has a conventional one-room school in mind it would appear to me to be the best plan to split the appropriation and build two such schools. I know that I could build two such schools for $2,500 certainly not more than $3,000. If this is done I would suggest that one school be built on the old site and the other for the children living in the central part of the reserve, and this would also satisfy the Indians who seem to think that the school should always be where it always was.\n\nThe second school should be built in the 'Sa-ki-to-wah' community which is the northernly part of the reserve and which has a very large child population. There is a good site in this community and I believe I could get the Indians to agree to having a school built there quite readily.\n\nThe children from the southerly end of the reserve could be cared for without the erection of a third school if day-classes could be arranged for at St. Joseph's Residential School.\n\nNow as to materials available locally, St. Joseph's School operates a sawmill and supplies the community with lumber at very reasonable rates, they are:\n\n| Lumber Type       | Price per M. |\n|-------------------|--------------|\n| Rough lumber      | $30.00       |\n| Dressed lumber    | $40.00       |\n\nI called on the Principal of St. Joseph's today to see if his mill would be capable of supplying lumber in the quantity required for a building such as a school house. He stated that it could easily be done aside from flooring. The mill turns out flooring but it is spruce which is not suitable. However, he declared if he still had the lumber necessary to operate the mill full time this summer, he could not state definitely that he would able to supply the lumber. In any case it would require a year to dry and would not be fit for use this summer.\n\nThis means that if the school is to be built this summer, material (aside from logs for beams and a small quantity of seasoned lumber available here), most-of-the-meteskah will have to be procured outside and the cost greatly increased.\n\nWith regard to labor, you do not state whether the Department intends sending a carpenter or carpenters in to do the job. From your letter I get the impression that you wish to know whether or not this building could be erected with local labor under my supervision as the job was done last summer. This could be done, but it would be better to get at least one qualified carpenter on the job. I have had a good deal of experience but do not consider myself a professional builder at all. I can get labor and one or two fairly good Indian carpenters with whom I could do the job if necessary. I should\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\n\nI know your wishes before the middle of April as these men are planning to leave the Reserve for work outside as soon as summer comes. However if I am able to offer them work here at home they will be glad to stay.\n\nI myself am planning to leave here this summer, if however you wish me to stay to look after this work I shall be pleased to co-operate with you. My successor will not be here during July when the work should be under way and it will of course take him some time to orient himself after his arrival, even then he may not be able to undertake such a job.\n\nWe should have this whole matter settled by the middle of April as our mail service will then be interrupted by break-up, after that communication would have to be by telegram.\n\nI realize that your time must be fully occupied with matters of greater importance than the subject of this letter, and that you must have little time for such lengthy reports as this, but I have wanted to give you a complete picture of the situation here so that the Department will be in a better position to determine what will best meet its educational needs. I will do my utmost to see that the appropriation is not only spent for a school but invested in such a way as to bring the greatest dividends in an educated and improved community, I am.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.

As requested in your letter of the 4th instant, I enclose blueprint of the reserve on which you can indicate the population areas and possible sites for a school. I have noted your suggestion that instead of one school two be erected. It has occurred to me that possibly the best solution would be to build one new school at a convenient site and, for a further period of time, continue to use the present school. It scarcely seems necessary to add that any site suggested should be agreeable to the Cross Lake Band.\n\nI agree that a building similar to the one at Berens River should serve the purpose at Cross Lake. Such a building would provide the facilities which you mention are needed. I am also inclined to feel that the lumber should be bought this year and it could then have a year to dry and the building could be erected in the summer of 1945. Please speak to the Principal of the St. Joseph's School again with a view to ascertaining definitely if he can supply the amount of lumber that would be required.\n\nI am not certain from your letter if you are only leaving Cross Lake for a holiday or\n\nRev. H.A. Meadows,\nUnited Church Mission,\nCross Lake, Man.\nwhether you are leaving it permanently. If the latter, I should appreciate your advising the name of your successor as soon as you have information on this point.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSup'te of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nYour letter of the 28th ultimo is hand. Since the blueprint enclosed covers only about one-quarter of the Cross Lake Reserve I am having a complete map made and will forward it with the data you require at the earliest.\n\nI believe that erecting one new school and continuing to use the present one is the logical way of meeting the need at the present time.\n\nThe lumber required should be cut this year as you suggest. I will see the Principal of St. Joseph's school again as soon as he returns. He is at present away from the settlement.\n\nI am leaving Cross Lake permanently at the end of June. My successor is to be the Rev. Ian J. Harvey, who was missionary for two years on the Oxford House reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. Ainger Meadows\nApril 14th, 1944.\n\nMrs. R. A. Hoey,\nSup't. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested in your letter of March 28 I have again interviewed the Principal of St. Joseph's School re. the possibility of his saw-mill supplying lumber necessary for a new United Church Day School. Lumber to be sawn during the coming summer.\n\nThe Principal states that it is impossible for him say whether he will be able to supply the lumber unless he knows the dimensions and quantities of lumber required. He doubts that he would be able to supply all the lumber required as they have only enough logs cut each winter to meet their own requirements and to cover any orders already placed with them. As we did not place an order he did not have enough logs cut to make lumber enough to build a school. However, if you supply me with the dimensions of the school, the amounts and dimensions of the lumber required he believes that it is quite possible that he will be able to fill a good deal of the order.\n\nIf I can be of any further service to you in this matter of the new school do not hesitate to write me; I am.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

Meadows, the United Church Missionary on the reserve, and I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter from him dated April 14. I also enclose copy of the plan of the reserve and Mr. Meadows' suggestions in connection with our school policy on the reserve.\n\nWe have given this matter some consideration and, as you will note from Mr. Meadows' letter, he has been endeavouring to arrange with the Principal of the Cross Lake Residential School to cut the necessary lumber. It is our thought that if we secured the lumber and other materials this year the school could be erected in the summer of 1945.\n\nI should appreciate receiving your comments, both on Mr. Meadows' letter and his suggestions regarding location of the school or schools on the reserve. When replying you should return the enclosed plan and also Mr. Meadows' suggestions, as this is the only copy we have.\n\nThere is another difficulty in this matter; namely, that Mr. Meadows is being transferred and has either left Cross Lake or will leave that reserve within the next month or so.

Letter 123-2-5, dated April 27th.\n\nI have read carefully your letter, together with the one from Mr. H. Meadows. His proposals appear reasonable; but as he is leaving the reserve I think the matter should receive further investigation.\n\nThe schools should benefit as many Indian children as possible and I would therefore recommend that Mr. Lazenby be instructed to discuss the matter thoroughly with the Indians at the Treaty payment. He should then submit a full report with definite recommendations.\n\nI am returning the plan and Mr. Meadows' letter as requested.\n\nA.G.

As he was resident on the reserve and was familiar with conditions, we communicated with Reverend H.A. Meadows, the United Church Missionary. For your information I enclose a copy of our letter of March 28 to Mr. Meadows and also copies of his replies dated April 8 and April 14. We understand that Mr. Meadows has left Cross Lake and will not be returning to that reserve.\n\nWe have also communicated with Inspector Hamilton and it is now felt that you should give this matter some further consideration in order to make certain that we can proceed with the erection of the school in the summer of 1945.\n\nThe following information is required:\n\n1. Do you agree with the location of the school or schools on the reserve as suggested by Mr. Meadows? For this purpose we are forwarding you the enclosed plan and would appreciate it if you would return same when you are replying to this letter.\n\n2. Is there a possibility of obtaining the necessary lumber from the Cross Lake Residential School? You will note from Mr. Meadows' letter\nthat the Principal of the Cross Lake School thought he might be able to supply the lumber, if he knew the dimensions of what was required. Possibly you could obtain someone in the neighbourhood who would be able to supply this information.\n\nR.A.

In the meantime, I should like, if possible, to have a blueprint showing the size and type of building, and a bill of materials, so that I can discuss the matter of lumber supply with the Principal of the R.C.Residential School at Cross Lake while I am there. With regard to the matter of supplying the lumber locally, I might say that in my opinion, the necessary logs should have been taken out during last winter or early spring and sawn into the required sizes this summer, and left to season for at least one year, and I believe that one year in this locality, is not sufficient to properly season green lumber.\n\nIn your letter to Mr Meadows, of March 28th last you state that you...\"agree that a building similar to the one\n\"at Beren's River should serve the purpose at Cross Lake.\" I should like to be advised as to what the Beren's River school is like.\n\nI understand that Mr Meadows is leaving Cross Lake about July 28th, and will not be there at treaty time. He is being succeeded as missionary by Rev: Ian J Harvey, who was U.C.Missionary at Oxford House reserve for two years, and whom I know well. Mr Harvey will possibly be at Cross Lake at treaty time, and if he is, I will discuss the new school with him.\n\nWith regard to the sketch map, and Mr Meadows' recommendation of a site for the proposed new school, it occurs to me that if the school were built on the site recommended, it would likely be necessary to provide a teacherage also, as, if I remember correctly, there would be no place anywhere near the school where a teacher might live and board. However, this aspect of the matter can remain in abeyance until the Indians can be consulted as to the most satisfactory site. I would like to retain the sketch map pending my visit to Cross Lake, and will return it with my report at that time.\n\nE.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs.

If this area is reduced in size, the features of the terrain become less distinguishable, namely Cross Lake and its many water courses, the islands, and the marshes.\n\nIt is evident from the map that though Cross Lake Reserve is large all settlement is concentrated along the banks of a number of Cross Lake streams. The majority of the Indians are considered semi-nomadic and are scattered in little groups making settlement almost impossible.\n\nOn the map the areas of settlement are divided into groups A-D, C-D, E-F, G-H. These areas of settlement are divided by the topography of the terrains, lakes, channels, or swamps between them.\n\nThe population of A to B has a population of children under 12 years of age of 50. All children attend school at the present time. However, the school is overcrowded and the school building is in poor condition.\n\nThe population of C to D has a population of children under 12 years of age of 40. The school was destroyed by fire last fall.\n\nThe population of E to F has a population of children under 12 years of age of 30. The school is overcrowded and the school building is in poor condition.\n\nThe population of G to H has a population of children under 12 years of age of 20. The school is overcrowded and the school building is in poor condition.\n\nIf the new school is built at the point indicated it will serve the children living in the area of E-F and if the present school is continued to be used it will serve the children living in the area of G-H.\n\nAs soon as possible I should recommend that a school be built in the C-D section and that the school be constructed so that the children do not have to cross a water course to get to school. When the school is completed it should serve all the children in the section E-F. I would recommend that this school be built first.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to refer to my letter to the Department dated 21st August 1944, regarding the proposed erection of a new United Church Indian Day School at the Cross Lake Reserve, this agency.\n\nIn the final paragraph of this letter mention was made of the fact that both Mr J.E. Morris and I were of the opinion that a teacherage should be provided for this new school. I should be glad to be advised if this matter has been given consideration, and if so, what decision if any, has been made in this regard.\n\nFrom Mr R.A. Hoey's letter of March 28th 1944, addressed to Mr H.A. Meadows, Cross Lake, Man: I quote as follows: \"It has occurred to me that possibly the best solution would be to build one new school at a convenient site and, for a further period of time, continue to use the present school.\" If this idea is carried out, it will be necessary to consider the necessary furnishings for the new school, such as desks, blackboards, cupboards, teacher's desk and chair, etc;\n\nWhen the materials, as set out in the list attached to my letter to the Department, dated 14th July 1944, is ordered from Winnipeg, I would request that shipment be directed to Rev: L.J. Harvey, United Church Mission, Cross Lake, Manitoba, via Whiskeyjack Portage, per Salkiik Navigation Co:\n\nAs requested in Mr Hoey's letter of June 23rd, I am returning herewith the map prepared by Mr Meadows.\n\nP.G.

They feel it does not go far enough and their children cannot qualify for teachers, office help or to in any way compete with the white people. They feel the young people cannot always remain on the reserve, and looking to the future the Government should make it possible for the children to get advanced education or vocational training to fit them for different occupations. They are short of public school accommodation. Certainly another school is needed and I would refer to Mr. Lazonby's letter concerning the location dated November 28th, 1944, in reply to Departmental letter dated June 23rd, 1944, file 123-2-5.\n\nA.G.

Indian Day School for the balance of the current academic year.\n\nIn view of the payment of Family Allowances it is reasonable to suppose that the children obtain better food at home and consequently there should not be the same necessity for serving an extensive midday lunch. With this in mind, we feel the amount mentioned should be adequate for the balance of the current academic year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nAttention: Mr Bernard F.

In his letter he states that vegetables have been donated by the parents. I therefore recommend that he be allowed $15 per month for the purchase of supplies of food and what pots, pans, and cups are necessary, the same as was allowed for the R.C. Day School at Jack River.\n\nI also enclose a requisition for school material. It is requested that these supplies be sent direct to the teacher and not via Norway House.\n\nI visited this school last week and the attendance was good. There were 37 present the day I visited it. The building is only adequate to accommodate 20 pupils but there will be as many as 50 attending during the coming winter.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 3 October 1946.\n\nMr. E.B.

Day School\n\nThe present school at Cross Lake is an old log warehouse with a 7 ft ceiling and poor lighting. It is about 22' square and the last several times I have seen it, it has been jammed full of children and you could cut the atmosphere with a knife. There are sufficient children of the Protestant faith at Cross Lake of school age to warrant the construction of 2 new day schools.\n\nIn the 1947-48 estimates, I have estimated for 1 new school and teacherage and it is requested that the construction of these 2 buildings be undertaken this summer. The building material can be shipped in by boat from Winnipeg.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 25th, 1947.\n\nMr. E.B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba,\n\nWe have your letter of the 11th inst., with reference to conditions at the Cross Lake United Church Indian Day School.\n\nIn the appropriation for the year 1947-48, provision was made for funds for the erection of a new school. We will communicate with you later regarding this.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNorway House, Manitoba,\n2 April 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nYou will find enclosed herewith requisition for supplies for the building of:\n\n1.

(RG 10, Volume 6231, file 508-5, part 4)\nWhile in Cross Lake on the 13th inst I spent the best part of a day choosing a suitable site which would accommodate the most children. I succeeded in locating a site which is both pleasing and suitable and which would serve about half the children of this community. It is known as the Sagittawuk settlement.\n\nFather Trudeau pointed out to me that this site would serve an equal or possibly greater number of R.C. children, 17 of whom are at present with his consent attending the U.C. Day School now in operation. He made the suggestion that instead of building a 1 room school on the selected site that a 2 room school be built, 1 room for the U.C. and the other room for the R.C. children. This would require the construction of 2 teacherages. He informed me that it is the intention of his church to employ a lay teacher in their school and not a sister of any order. This proposition has its merits and is worthy of consideration. If this should be approved, it would mean an alteration in my building plans.\n\nTwo more day schools, 1 U.C. and 1 R.C. will eventually have to be built on the other side of the lake to accommodate the balance of the children and a similar establishment would take care of the situation there when such buildings are authorized by the Branch. Please let me know if the Branch is prepared to consider and authorize the a/m plan. As far as I can see I will be unable to do any building at Cross Lake until August after the treaty payments have been completed.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 9th, 1947.\n\nMr. E.B.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMarshall Wells Ltd.,\nMarket St.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nPP/MGD\nWhile in Cross Lake paying treaty I engaged the services of Mr Earl Adams of the Pas as carpenter to build the U.C. Day School and Teacherage. He is at present working for the Manitoba Government erecting a house for their Game Guardian. He is being paid at the rate of $1.25 per hour and board. I told him that we would pay him at the same rate. This is the same rate which is also being paid to Hudson's Bay Co carpenters in this area and I do not see how we can do otherwise than pay the same rate if we expect to get a carpenter. The lumber and shingles I will supply locally.\n\nMr Adams will be ready to go to work in about 2 weeks time. Work has already started on this project under the supervision of Mr Adams for which he is making no charge such as clearing the ground, hauling of gravel and rocks, and excavating for the basements.\n\nI am borrowing money from the Medical Account to pay current expenses. I therefore request an Accountable Advance of $4000.00 to pay for labor. As stated before Mr Adams will be ready to go to work in about 2 weeks time and to date the following supplies have not arrived:\n\n1. 300 bags cement\n2. Materials for bldg 2 chimneys 30' & 26' high respectively and the 1 for the school being double flue.\n3. 16 pieces 2\" round iron as listed in my requisition of Mar 29 1947\n4. 24 rolls roofing paper\n5. 22 rolls tarpaper & nails as per requisition referred to above\n\nThese supplies are most urgently needed, otherwise I will be unable to proceed with the project. In any event I very much doubt if these buildings can be erected within the amount provided of $8000.00. I assure you that I will endeavour to keep expenses within this limit. It would be appreciated if you would inform me as to whether it is O.K. with regard to the hiring of Mr Adams. Other labor will range from 30 to 80 cents per hour according to the nature of the work.\n\nI trust that every effort will be made to forward the necessary supplies listed above. I might mention at this time also that the cement for the Jack River C of Z Teacherage has not arrived. The basement has been excavated and we are unable to proceed further.\n\nE.B.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nAttention: Mr Bernard F Neary\n\nRe your letter August 19 inst file 123-5-5(W.T.), this letter is headed Oxford House Indian Day School - Furnaces for New Day School. There seems to be some confusion here as no furnaces have been ordered for the Oxford House Indian Day School. I take it that the letter refers to the 2 pipeless furnaces ordered for the new U.C. School and teacherage at Cross Lake. These furnaces have been received in good order and the Purchase Order 20377 was receipted and was forwarded to Ottawa 26th August 1947.\n\nI would like to state in closing that I was in Cross Lake this week and inspected the work on the 2 buildings. Both basements are dug and the cement being poured for the basement wall. Mr Adams the foreman has things well in hand and informed me that he thinks he will have the buildings completed by freeze-up. All the material needed is there with the exception of 2500 bricks, 4 bags of lime and some tarpaper. The tarpaper I can now obtain locally and pending the arrival of the brick I am borrowing 2000 from the veteran S.K. Settee, who states that he will not be needing his until next spring.\n\nE.B.

Day School\nSept. 9th., 1947\n\nDear Ronnie,\n\nAs you know, our school is very small. It has only got 33 seats in it. That is not enough for us to have a seat for every child that comes to our school. We are sorry that that is the way things are and we hope that the government will soon have the new school finished so that there will be enough room for every child that wants to come to school. But right now things are so bad that we are not going to be able to give your children very good schooling. So this is what we are going to have to do.\n\nStarting tomorrow, only children of parents that go to our church will be able to come to our day school. There are 33 of these children who have their names on our school list. That is just the number we have seats for and that is all we can take. So will you please not let your child come tomorrow? I know it will be hard for you to have to send them all the way to the Catholic day school; but I hope you will see why we are doing this. We must look after our own children first. That is the only reason. I will be glad to see you about this if you want to come to see me about it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6231, file 508-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nColonel Neary visited Cross Lake U.C. Indian Day School 13 Sept '47.\n\nThe temporarily used classroom is off the reserve near the Rev. Ian Harvey's house as explained in his attached letter to an Indian there is room for only 33 pupils. Thirteen R.C. pupils have to be dealt with.\n\nAt my suggestion the Agent has ordered some work to be done on the lean-to to make it less airy in winter.\n\nThe school is otherwise quite a respectable installation. Dimensions 22' x 26'.\n\nLacking a specially dispatched teacher as yet. Mrs. Jean Harvey, B.A., a qualified, experienced teacher was sworn in as mistress pro tem.\n\nBulletins checked. Complete course of studies has been obtained. Register correct. Supply situation good. One shipment of books must be further investigated.\n\nThe bridge in photo #2 permits traffic over the slough to the settlement beyond (Cox #500) the creek at Sagitowak where U.C. school is now under construction.\n\nRev. Father Trudeau who accompanied the inspection party claims there is a need for similar facilities for Roman Catholics at Sagitowak. The Agent agrees. Investigation shows that the terrain and unpredictable squalls on the water preclude the children of this settlement from attending a day school anywhere else on the reserve.\n\nNeeded in the Cross Lake Area:\nDay schools for each church at Sagitowak for each also across the river from Residential School. In the Catholic Church a third classroom at a point to be agreed upon.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Beaverboard required on this list is necessary for the teacherage and about 40% of the Gyproc supplies was so badly damaged on arrival that it is unusable. It is also heavy and too brittle to withstand repeated handling, which materials have to undergo to be imported into this country and I advise against any further use of Gyproc.\n\nMr E Adams the foreman is going to his home in The Pas over the Freeze-up period but will return to Cross Lake to finish these 2 buildings on approximately November 15th, according to the season.\n\nI visited and inspected these buildings last week and spent 2 days with Mr Adams. The outside work on both buildings is completed, and he has made a very fine job of them. Mr Adams suggests that he be allowed to purchase these materials in the Pas and bring them back with him when he returns. I think that this would be a good arrangement. I informed Mr Adams that I would have to obtain your permission for him to do so. Will please advise me by wire if this is permissible. If not, please inform me via the purchasing agent-Ottawa the necessity of having all these items at Wabowden by November 15.

We co-operated to the best of our ability and shipped the order from our factory in Cowansville, in a carload to our Branch in Winnipeg on December 24-1947.\n\nWe have copy of Freight Bill from our Winnipeg Branch, showing that these desks left Winnipeg by Canadian National, prepaid, L.o.l freight, on January 3-1948, - the billing being made to Mr. E.B. Goodman, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man. via Wabowden, Man. The shipment comprised 18 cartons of desks, one Teacher's Desk, one Chair and one carton of hardware. We sincerely hope this shipment has arrived at destination before this late date, and we cannot understand why there was so much delay in transit. We are writing our Winnipeg Branch today, to have them trace it, and if there are any further developments we will advise you as soon as we receive the information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVILAS FURNITURE COMPANY LIMITED\n\nProduction Manager.\n\nHDH-W.\n| Cat | Description          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-----|----------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n|     | 6 Sax Pebble Lime    | @ .75 each |           | 4.50  |\n\nIndian Affairs.

In part he wrote as follows:\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Harvey share the teaching load and are doing a very fine job indeed. Both go much beyond what is ordinarily expected of a teacher by attempting to give what is learned in school some practical application in the community. The community has learned to work together as shown by the fact that the school was built by the people of the district as a community project. (provincial school). The leadership given by the Harvey's is of the very best type since it shows the people how to help themselves. They are very properly trying to develop this in the school and the community at the same time. There is considerable evidence that their work is succeeding\".\n\nWe fail to interpret the remark which he makes about the school building and also as to its being called a \"Provincial School\".

Indian Day School and Teachers Residence which was built last year at Cross Lake.\n\nI was to Cross Lake this past Sunday and went over this building with Mr Frank Hughes, A/Superintendent and Mr Earl Adams, the carpenter who built same and Eavestrough is urgently needed for this building or the foundation will be ruined. This past week we have had several heavy rains and the earth around this building has caved in completely.\n\nWhen Mr Adams went to Cross Lake late in May to build the Sagittawuk R.C. Combined School & Teacherage he examined the a/m school and on his own had a second coat of paint put on the exterior of this building, also the Teacherage. The cost of same was $75.00. The interior of both School & Teacherage requires a second coat of paint at an estimated cost of approximately $75.00. This second coat of paint was not applied at time building was complete due to arrival of a teacher to take up residence.\n\nI request an Accountable Advance of $200.00 to cover painting already done plus painting of interior and installation of Eavestrough. May this request receive favourable consideration.\n\nQ.P.

Mr. Dumas has performed his outside services to my satisfaction. I think a change of teachers would be advisable, and would recommend that the request of the Rev. Father be complied with.\n\nI am, Sir, Your obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) S.R. Marlatt.\nInsptr.

The Teacher, M. Dumas, neglects his duties teaching no school part of the time and leaving the reserve whenever it pleases him.\n\nBesides that, he has, living with him, a son whose conduct and morals are a bad example to the Indians.\n\nFor all these reasons, in the interests of the Indians of Nbb and Flow Lake Reserve, I consider it my duty to ask you to have the present teacher dismissed and another one appointed, at the earliest possible time.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) C.A. Comeau, Ptr.\nO.M.I.\n\nThe Hon. Commissioner\nof Indian Affairs,\nWinnipeg.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing copy of a letter from Mr. Rutherford, M.P., asking to be informed of the facts in regard to the dismissal of Mr. Dumas, teacher of the Red and Flow Lake School, I enclose copies of three letters which give the principal facts in the case.\n\nI may add, however, that I have lately received an urgent appeal from Mr. Dumas to have the time of the cancellation of his appointment as teacher of said school extended till the 30th of September next. This I have acceded to. As this extension is all that he asked Mr. Rutherford to obtain for him, I hope that this concession will end the matter, as I have reason to know that in the best interests of the school it is far from desirable that he should be continued as teacher beyond the very reasonable time now allowed him to make other provision for himself.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nreserve whenever it suited his convenience.

I know I have been officially withheld from inspecting Catholic day schools; and I fancy that it may fairly, therefore, be inferred that I have nothing whatever to do with them. However, it seems best, in the interest of Education, not to lose time by returning the papers to the Agent, who seems in the dark as to what appertains to him to do in the premises; and therefore I venture to send the papers direct to you for action.\n\nPlease advise me if I have, in this instance, taken the right course.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.

The information sent to the Department did not show whether Mr. Guillas had taken the necessary steps to become a naturalized British citizen and if he has not his appointment to this position could not be considered.

As a matter of fact the Indians at this point show very little interest in their school as the average attendance for the June Quarter was only two (2).

Her age will be about 31 and of Catholic Faith. In reference to the position of teacher for the Ebb and Flow Reserve, I have received today a letter from the Chief of Ebb and Flow, stating that there was one J.A. Breland of St. Rose Du Lac who was wanting the position as teacher at Ebb and Flow. Some little time ago I wrote Father Chagnon, Principal of Sandy Bay School, if he could recommend this man Breland, and his answer was that he did not know him.\n\nI am writing Mr. Breland today as to his qualifications, and on receipt will advise the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSt Rose du Lac\nJan. 23rd 1915\n\nMrs Logan\nPortage la Prairie Man\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received your letter of 19th inst. and in reply I beg to state that I have had no experience in teaching but have received a good education in French and English.

I reported this matter to Mr. Inspector Jackson, who advised me to consult The Rev. Chagnon teacher at Sandy Bay.\n\nI received a letter today from the Rev. Chagnon advising me that this man Beauchamp should get a term in jail as an example to the other Indians.\n\nThis man Beauchamp is No. 65 of the Elb and Flow Band and he reports that Miss Adams was away and not attending to her work.\n\nI think The Rev. Chagnon is a little strong in his advice; it looks to me as a sort of family row and I think a strong letter from the Department would settle matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, December 16, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant stating that sometime ago Miss Adams, teacher of the Red and Flow Day School, reported to you that while she was away one Beauchamp broke the lock on the door where she kept the rations and supplied some of the Indians with them and that you received a letter from Rev.

Miss Adams has left the Reserve and Beauchamp was also away, and the Chief and the other Indians all take the side of Beauchamp and say that Miss Adams is to blame for all the trouble, as far as I can find out, it is a question of taking Miss Adams word against Beauchamp, and the rest of the Band, which I consider would be poor evidence to commit Beauchamp on.\n\nThe only way I see to get evidence is to engage someone to go up there as the Indians will not give me any information against Beauchamp. Miss Adams is sick at the present time, and wants to have her sister take her place until she recovers from her illness, but what I can find out about this Band, that it is no place for any girl to be, but what they require is to have a teacher there who has will power enough to resist the demands made by the Indians. I find at several Reserves, that the teachers have been in the habit of lending these supplies to the Indians, at times and there is no doubt in my mind, that Miss Adams allowed Beauchamp to take these supplies and he did not return them when asked to do so.\nJules Andr\u00e9 P.C., Manitoba\nFebruary 10th, 1916\n\nD.M.

According to Miss Adams Beauchamp has failed to return the provisions, although he promised to do so, and in your report you say that the Chief informed you that Beauchamp had put them back. You should ascertain whether this is the case or not, as the provisions taken by Beauchamp must be returned or he will be proceeded against. Miss Adams states that although she has brought this matter to your attention you have taken no action to have the goods restored.\n\nMiss Adams also states that she is at present absent from the school through illness and has asked to have her sister appointed as substitute.

I have known Miss Sauve since the time she was pursuing her studies at the St Norbert High School.

When she left school she was allowed to teach in a public school on an elementary certificate. The time she was allowed to teach on such certificate was short but during that short period she gave a very good account of herself.

You should state what repairs, if any, are needed to the building, and also whether, if Miss Davis is appointed, she would be able to secure living quarters on the reserve.

Before making the purchase, however, you should obtain competitive prices for the stove, pipes and glass and purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. While a suitable stove should be obtained it should be purchased as cheaply as possible. You should arrange to have this stove delivered and set up and the repairs made to the windows. You may also arrange to have the door repaired. When the above articles have been purchased and the repairs completed you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred and a copy should be attached showing the prices obtained by you from the firms asked to quote a price on the stove, pipes and glass, together with the quotations received.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher can arrange for living quarters a few yards from the school building.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Laura J. Davis as teacher and she may begin duties as soon as the school is ready and the stove has been set up. The Department will allow her a salary at the rate of $50.00 per annum, together with expenses at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the period it is customary to teachers in Indian day schools. You will be good enough to inform Miss Davis of her appointment, as well as Rev. Father Gauthier, who made a recommendation for her appointment, and inform the Department of the date upon which she begins duties.\n\nIf any school supplies are required by her in the way of stationery, books, etc., she should prepare a requisition and forward it through your office, when the supplies considered necessary will be sent from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The building is a log one, and has a shingled roof. At the time I visited the school it was locked up for the period of the summer vacation, and the teacher had gone on holiday. There should be no difficulty experienced in maintaining a regular attendance at the school as the Indians all live in its vicinity.\nSir.\u2014\nI beg to report that Miss Laura J. Davis, teacher of the Ebb and Flow Indian Day School is leaving the last of this month. This girl is not very satisfactory, and I do not get very good reports about her up on the Reserve.\n\nI would recommend that Mrs. John Campbell, (nee Laura Shannon) be appointed teacher in the place of Miss Davis. I was unable to get in touch with Mrs. Campbell, but I was informed by the Rev. Father Chagnon, Principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Boarding School, that Mrs. Campbell would take this school.\n\nShe taught this school some ten years ago, and was satisfactory, and the Rev. Father Chagnon recommends her for the position. I have had no time to get applications or recommendations as I want a teacher there by the first of March, as once the school is closed it is hard to get the children started again.\n\nLaura Shannon taught this school from January 1909 to June 1913.\n\nOn receipt of this letter kindly inform me by wire if I may appoint Mrs Campbell teacher of the Ebb and Flow School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Asst.

I would be very pleased were he to receive this position.\n\nWith reference to the Waterhen Indian Day School it seems strange to me that it is not opened.

The Public School Inspector states that there was no progress and that the teacher was not at all successful, and the Rev. Father Perrault, O.M.I., the local missionary, when forwarding Mr. Inglott's resignation, states that he cannot recommend him to the position of teacher at any other Indian day school.\n\nI have noted that you could not engage the services of Mrs. J. Campbell, of whose appointment the Department approved in official communication of the 28th of February, last. I should be pleased if you, in conjunction with His Grace the Archbishop of Winnipeg, would continue your efforts to secure a properly qualified teacher for the Ebb & Flow Indian Day School.

The Public School Inspector stated that no progress was being made and that he was not at all successful. Rev. Father Perreault, O.M.I., the local missionary, when forwarding Mr. Inglett's resignation, stated that he could not recommend him to the position of teacher at any other Indian day school.\n\nOur Agent, Mr. Ogletree, Portage la Prairie, was informed accordingly and requested to act in conjunction with Your Grace in an effort to secure a properly qualified teacher for the Ebb & Flow Indian Day School.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

May I ask you to reconsider your decision in this matter?\n\nFather Perrault is a most estimable gentleman, but his report in this matter is not to be too seriously entertained. I know both men and I know Mr. Ingloott much better than Father Perrault knows him. Despite the unfavorable report, I am convinced that Mr. Ingloott is a capable and reliable teacher. Have you heard anything of the relations between Father Perrault and the teacher who succeeded Mr. Ingloott on the Pelly Agency?\n\nAs you are aware, it is difficult to secure teachers for these Reserves and I shall make no recommendation until I hear from you.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\nOttawa, May 30, 1923.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 18th instant, in which you ask more favourable consideration relative to the application of Mr. Joseph Ingloott for the position of teacher at the Hbb & Flow Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that the Department has received not only the Rev. Father Perrault's criticism but also unfavourable comments from our own officers in the field, and I regret that I cannot give a favourable reply to Mr. Ingloott's request. The Department is bending every energy towards better teachers in the day schools, and parliamentary appropriation has been increased in order that we could offer salaries that compare very well with those paid to public school instructors.\n\nI shall be grateful if Your Grace can aid us in our effort to secure a satisfactory teacher for the Hbb & Flow Indian Day School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Rev. Alfred A. Sinnett, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Winnipeg,\n353 St. Mary's Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI enquired from your Agent at Portage la Prairie as to the salaries paid the teachers in the Indian Schools, and he gave me the following information:\n\n1. The salary paid the teacher at Ebb and Flow was $450.00 per annum.\n2. Mr. Ingliott received $500.00 per annum at the Waterhen School.\n3. Miss Godon received $600.00 per annum at the Roseau River School.\n\nMoreover, the teachers of Ebb and Flow and Waterhen lived over the school and Miss Godon lived with a nearby settler.\n\nAre these the salaries paid? If so, it is quite useless to look for any competent person for the positions. Living on an Indian Reserve, with no white people to associate with and no mail or means of transportation, has certain disadvantages and, if the salary is not attractive, it is idle to expect anyone but left-overs and dubs to accept the position. Besides I know the school houses at Ebb and Flow and Waterhen and I had the privilege of examining the quarters reserved for the teacher, and I have no hesitation in saying that they are absolutely unfit for human habitation.\n\nI was so pleased to read in your letter of May 30th: \"The Department is bending every energy towards better teachers in the day schools, and parliamentary appropriation has been increased in order that we...\"\n\"could offer salaries that compare very well with those paid to public school instructors\". I feel confident, therefore, that the salaries to be paid the teachers at the schools mentioned above have been sensibly augmented.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\nAugust 20th, 1923.\n\nMost Rev. Sir:\n\nI have received Your Grace's letter of the 10th instant, with general reference to salaries at Indian day schools in Manitoba.\n\nIn reply I am pleased to state that, in the case of the Ebb & Flow Indian Day School, the Department will allow a salary of $800 for the ten teaching months, supplemented by any bonus provided by law, in the event of a properly qualified teacher being appointed.\n\nI have had some correspondence with Mr. Agent Oletteau relative to the re-opening of the Waterhen River Indian Day School, and this cause may be opened with Mrs. Martin Bratcher as teacher. Her qualifications are not good, but, in view of the difficulty of finding an incumbent for this school, she will be given a trial. In her case, a salary of $600, plus bonus, will be allowed.\n\nI should be pleased if Your Grace would continue your efforts to secure a satisfactory teacher for the Ebb & Flow Indian Day School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

If you will refer to earlier correspondence, you will note that in official communication of this file number, of the 20th ultimo, the Department agreed to allow a salary of $800 for the 10 teaching months, supplemented by any bonus provided by law, in the event of a properly qualified teacher being appointed. In Your Grace's communication of the 7th instant you state that Miss Gorman has fair qualifications; and, after examination of our files, I find that she cannot be considered as possessing certificates the equal of a second class professional standing. This is the reason that a salary of $700 plus bonus was allowed.\n\nIf you consider that Miss Gorman should receive a salary of $800, because of any promises made by Your Grace, I shall be pleased to make arrangements for the increase.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nI do recall very distinctly telling Miss Gorman that her salary would be $600. Her qualifications are indeed only fair, but still they are qualifications and not always found in the teachers of Indian Schools. I would be glad were she to receive the sum of $600. What is very necessary in these schools is to strive to have thoroughly qualified teachers. If I can be of any help, I shall only be too glad to do what I can.\n\nMay I ask if Mrs. Bretzner is to be appointed to Waterhen Day School? For this year it does not seem possible to secure anyone better qualified, and I should appreciate her appointment.\n\nThanking you for your kind consideration of my various requests,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n+ Alfred A.

There are 25 children on the roll, with an average attendance of 20. Miss Mary Gorman is the teacher there, but at the time of the treaty payments she was absent, being sick in the General Hospital, in Winnipeg, but the school was being carried on by her sister, Miss Billy Gorman, who stays with her. From what I saw of the children's work I would say that the school work seemed to be progressing very favorably. I, however, cannot say very much about it, as the regular teacher was absent, and her sister is, of course, hardly capable of carrying on the work. However, the arrangements for the time being were quite satisfactory. Miss Billy Gorman made a request that the Department should give them the same treatment as is afforded the teacher at Dog Creek, where an assistant is supplied, and paid at the rate of $40.00 a month. Miss Billy Gorman stays with her sister at Ebb and Flow all the time and, no doubt, does some of the work, and she thinks she is entitled to some remuneration. I have no recommendation to make in the matter whatever, and simply promised her that I would bring it to the attention of the Department.\n\nFrom the foregoing report you will note that, as a whole, the school situation on the various reserves in the Manitowapah Agency is fairly satisfactory, and a great change to what it was a few years ago, in fact is the most satisfactory it has ever been. When I was first around this Agency as Inspector, the schools at Dog Creek, Lake St. Martin, Little Saskatchewan and Fairford were simply a joke. They were not trying to teach the children, in fact the school teachers who were there at that time could not teach anyone and they were not even making an attempt, so you will see that a really great change has taken place.\nin the last few years, as regards the Day Schools on Lake Manitoba, and especially in the four schools above mentioned. This has been brought about by encouraging the teachers who have been in charge, and the Department has certainly been good in supplying the necessary equipment and improving the living conditions, and for this expenditure we have certainly received value. To bring this about has been difficult at times, as the late Agent fought with the school teachers and discouraged them in every way, but in spite of this the work has made splendid progress, and I am pleased to say that Inspector Plewis, who lives in Eriksdale, and has charge of the Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin school district, is very highly pleased with our schools and takes a great interest in them, which, no doubt, is of great assistance and value to the teachers.\n\nAt Birch River, where, as I have mentioned in my general report, part of the Shoal River Band live, I believe there are about fifteen children of school age.\n\nI may say that in going around the different reserves I found Mr. Waite very much interested in the schools, and I feel satisfied that he will work with the teachers and assist them in every way, and we should look for even better results in the future.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Miss Boychuk is very anxious to secure her certificate, and to do so she will have to attend the summer school in the month of July, she should teach July on the reserve to obtain the required 200 teaching days.

It is not necessary that she teach during July in order to put in the full 200 teaching days.

She advised me that the boy was kept in the school and did her chores and I was convinced at that time that there was no misconduct, and I advised Miss Boychuk to continue her duties. I have since been advised by the Indians that Miss Boychuk has married the half-breed boy, and I would recommend that her resignation be accepted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

He defended his action and from what he told me I could not blame him in the slightest for what occurred. I answered his letter in detail and here is an extract from his reply:\n\nHouse of Commons, Canada, Ottawa, March 30, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Taggart:\n\nAcknowledging receipt of your interesting letter of the 26th instant, in further reference to the Ebb and Flow Indian School, and what I now believe to be, the unfair removal of yourself.\n\n.............. and if you will drop me a line .... and let me know where I can meet you in Winnipeg, I will make every effort to meet your convenience, and looking forward with much interest to seeing you, and with kind regards, I remain, Yours very truly,\n\nW. J. WARD, M.P.\n\nWhen Mr. Ward met me in Winnipeg he had called upon Mr. Waite, Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie. As many things he said to me were in confidence, I am not free to say much. I can say, however, that Mr. Ward was fully convinced that a grave injustice had been done to me and expressed his sincere regrets at his part in the matter.\n\nSince leaving the Ebb and Flow Indian School I have not been able to obtain any other employment. The fact that I was dismissed is itself against me and eight years' experience as a missionary teacher is not deemed of much value by commercial employers.\n\nMy dismissal has resulted in my utter destitution and I have been forced on to the relief rolls. I don't belong there and have done nothing to deserve this.\n\nI respectfully request that the Department consider my case, and if I cannot be reinstated to my former position that I be given some other employment in the Government service.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.)

Taggart from the Ebb and Flow Indian Day School, Reedy Creek, Manitoba - Portage la Prairie Agency.\n\n1. I was dismissed from the above mentioned school following representations made to the Department by W. J. WARD, Esq., M.P., of Dauphin. Mr. Ward acted upon complaints originating from the district of Ste. Rose du Lac, Man. The reason underlying these complaints was not, as represented, lack of interest on my part in the welfare of the Indians, but rather the manner in which I fought for improvement in the treatment of the half-breeds. In the winter of 1936-37 conditions were so bad that it was necessary to place almost the whole Reserve on rations. The half-breeds were in just as great need. On account of the urgency of cases it was necessary to use radio as the means of communication with the Provincial Government. Ebb and Flow being twenty miles from the railroad and with only two mails per week correspondence would have been too slow, as families were in grievous want. My persistence was represented by certain persons in the Manitoba Civil Service and there is no doubt that this influenced Mr. McCarthy, M.L.A., in persuading Mr. Ward that I should be removed. The charges made against me were without foundation. Had I not been interested in Indian welfare I would not have jeopardized my position thus, and I had been warned.\n\nHere follow specimens of radiograms which caused the trouble:\n(The following message was sent over my amateur station on a Saturday when I could not reach a Government office)\n\nMarch 6th p.m. (1937)\n\nTo Officer Commanding Royal Canadian Mounted Police Winnipeg.\n\nMrs. Louis Houle, widow, with girl of fifteen and boys of ten and four utterly destitute and in need of immediate supplies of food stop Mrs. Houle states received no relief money since Jan. third and was refused widows' allowance on ground of receiving relief stop I have found only about three pounds of brock in her house positively no other food and she is short of fuel stop girl sick stop two of sons away and do not support mother stop if possible please secure authorization to storekeeper to issue five dollars emergency supplies in which case instruct as to whom bill is to be charged stop Mrs. Houle lives just south of Ebb and Flow Indian Reserve stop I have issued some food from my personal supplies and medicine stop please take this matter up at once.\n\nSigned A.

Taggart, Teacher, dismissed from Ebb and Flow Indian Day School, Reedy Creek, Man.\n\nI have for acknowledgment Mr. Pratt's memorandum of November 19 and also copy of a memorandum received by the Minister from Mr. A. G. Taggart, 596 Sargent Avenue, Winnipeg, Man., attached thereto.\n\nThe records indicate that Mr. A. G. Taggart was employed by the Department as teacher at the Ebb and Flow Indian Day School during the period September 8, 1929, to June 30, 1937.\n\nA petition, asking for the removal of the teacher, signed by a number of Indians, was received at the Department on March 8, 1937. This petition was submitted to Mr. S. J. Waite, Indian Agent, who was instructed to make a thorough investigation and report to the Department. Mr. Waite, in his report dated March 8, 1937, expressed the view that Mr. Taggart's work in the classroom was satisfactory. It was the Agent's opinion that a certain amount of dissatisfaction existed with respect to Mr. Taggart's work as dispenser of medicine. In view of the Agent's report, it was not considered advisable at that time to remove him from the school.\n\nIn a letter dated May 6, 1937, Mr. W. J. Ward, M.P., Dauphin, Manitoba, intimated that \"I am convinced from information that I have received that the petition...\"\nis not the result of any outside agitation but quite spontaneous on the part of the Indians themselves. In fact I have heard many complaints regarding Mr. Taggart's report on the Ebb and Flow School was sent forward to Mr. Ward at that time. Mr. Ward was informed that, in view of the agent's report and recommendation, it was not the intention of the Department to remove Mr. Taggart from the Ebb and Flow School.\n\nMr. Dane MacCarthy, Ste. Rose du Lac, Man., in a letter dated June 10, 1937, stated that a feeling of dissatisfaction with the work of the teacher of the Ebb and Flow School had existed on the reserve for a considerable period of time and that the matter had been brought to his attention two years previously. He expressed the view that Mr. Taggart should be removed from the school. A copy of Mr. MacCarthy's letter was sent forward to Mr. Waite by the Department, in a communication dated June 15, 1937. Mr. Waite was asked to again visit the Ebb and Flow School and to again report to the Department on the work of the teacher. On June 14, Mr. Ward again wrote to the Department. In that letter he stated: \"I feel sure that I would not be receiving the number of letters I have from white residents living in the vicinity of the reserve, asking for the removal of Mr. Taggart, if there were not good and sufficient reasons why he should be removed\".\n\nThe Indian agent's second report to the Department is dated August 2, 1937. In this report he states: \"During treaty payments I held a meeting of the Indians and Mr. Taggart's position was discussed by the Indians in the teacher's presence. The chief complaints were the issuing of drugs, visiting the sick, the time he spent at his radio set and the issuing of rations. There was no specific complaint regarding Mr. Taggart's teaching ability\". The agent concludes: \"My personal opinion is that Mr. Taggart should be removed for his own good. He admitted living on bread and tea for some months. He is in receipt of a good salary from the\n\nDepartment\nDepartment and this poor living condition is unnecessary and points to one obvious fact, that this man is 'bushed' and, if allowed to stay, will drop to the level of the Indians themselves.\n\nImmediately following receipt of the agent's second report, Mr. Taggart's case was very carefully and sympathetically reviewed by the officials. Mr. Taggart had been nominated for the position by Archbishop Sinnott, of Winnipeg. In view of this fact, a letter dated August 6, 1937, containing a summary of the agent's report, was sent to the Archbishop. The Archbishop, in his reply dated August 12, 1937, stated: \"I am in receipt of your letter with reference to the teacher of the Ebb and Flow Indian Day School. I have to go north to Churchill and Chesterfield Inlet and will be away until the end of August. On my return I shall find a teacher whom I will recommend to you to replace Mr. Taggart. I hope the delay will not cause any inconvenience\". The Archbishop later, in a letter dated August 27, 1937, nominated Mrs. Hilda Mary Adam for the vacant position. Mrs. Adam has a permanent second class teacher's certificate, valid in the province of Manitoba. Mrs. Adam was appointed on the understanding that the appointment was a temporary one and that her work would be carefully reviewed at the end of the year. Mrs. Adam's work at the school appears to be satisfactory.\n\nIt would appear that, for some reason, not explained in the correspondence, Mr. Taggart became interested in the half-breed population in the district and in the relief allowances granted these half-breeds by the Provincial Government. This action on his part appears to have brought him into direct conflict with the local member and later with the federal member for the district. In addition to this, Mr. Taggart aroused a great deal of criticism because of his tendency to operate his radio set, during school hours. His justification for this was that -\nwas that his house, attached to the school, was a stopping place for people visiting the reserve and that the radio was operated for their enjoyment.\n\nA careful study of this case convinces one, however, that this teacher was, in the language of the Agent, actually 'bushed', that he had aroused the ill will and antagonism of the Indians and had ceased to be an uplifting influence on the reserve, either as a teacher or as a citizen.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\n538 Dominion Public Building\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nDec. 13th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to submit the following report on the Indian Day School, Ebb & Flow Reserve, Portage Agency, which I inspected Dec. 5th, 1940.\n\nThe teacher in charge is Mrs. Adam, who holds a second class permanent certificate. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| Beginners | 4 |\n| Grade 1 | 9 |\n| \" 2 | 3 |\n| \" 3 | 2 |\n| \" 4 | 2 |\n| \" 5 | 1 |\n\na total of 21.\n\nThe average attendance is quite good, ranging around 18. The children are making fair progress, and I consider Mrs. Adam a capable teacher. She appears to understand Indian children and presents the work in a bright, cheerful manner. The children write well and the exercise books were neatly kept and showed careful work.\n\nThe children were clean and fairly well clothed. However, in the real severe weather no doubt lack of real warm clothing affects the attendance somewhat.\n\nThe living quarters for the teacher consists of two small rooms on the rear of the school, which accommodation I consider inadequate. One room is used as kitchen, dining-room and dispensary, and the other is the bedroom and storeroom. In the 1940-41 estimates the Agent inserted the amount of $692.00 covering the cost of two additional rooms and paint for the entire building. I am quite aware the list is too high, however, considering the funds are available I would suggest the material be purchased before March 31st and provision made for the labor to be carried out next summer. I would further point out that the building presents a very neglected appearance. The siding is dried and warped and the original paint has entirely disappeared. Regardless of the action is taken concerning immediate living accommodation, at least paint should be provided for the present building. If this were purchased and on hand it might be possible with Indian labor to do the painting before March 31st, which labor would not involve any great expense.\n\nI trust this recommendation will be given favorable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

She is a qualified teacher and takes a keen interest in all her pupils. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 8      |\n| 2     | 12     |\n| 3     | 3      |\n| 4     | 1      |\n|       | 24     |\n\nThe attendance has been very good during September and October and I found twenty-two present. The children were fairly well dressed and clean in appearance. I consider they are making fair progress.\n\nThe school room is dark and gloomy and should be re-decorated. The floor also is in need of painting.\n\nThe old maps are badly worn and very dirty. A new map of Canada and one of the Province of Manitoba are needed. A new teacher's desk should be provided as the one in use is very old and badly racked - parts are missing altogether.\n\nThe exterior of the buildings has been painted and presents a fine appearance. The yard has also been fenced and the same was clean and tidy.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, August 22nd, 1944,\n\nMy dear Archbishop Sinnott:\n\nAs you, no doubt, are aware, Mrs. Hilda Adam has given up duties as teacher of the Ebb & Flow Indian Day School. I understand that Mr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man., has communicated with you in connection with the nomination of a teacher for the academic year 1944-45.\n\nThe services of Mr. Norbert Bellavance are available.

No further payment of salary should be made to him after that date.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nMr. Philip PHELAN  \nChief, Welfare & Training  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs,  \nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. Leon TROTTIER, teacher at the day school of \"EBB and FLOW\", informing me that he has received a salary of $10.00 less than his predecessor, Mr. Norbert Bellavance.\n\nTherefore, he receives $100 per month, instead of $110; but he receives over and above this a bonus of $17.00 a month, and will later receive his share of $50.00 allocated to the distribution of medicines.\n\nCould there perhaps be some mistake? Would it be because he has no teaching certificate? Mr. Trottier does not insist unduly, but he would like to know the reason for this, and I myself, would also like to know, so that I may understand clearly what terms I am to offer to the new teacher, - as Mr. Trottier is leaving to continue his studies at the University of Manitoba next September.\n\nI thank you very much, Mr. Phelan, and remain,\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProvincial.\nOttawa, June 19, 1945.\n\nDear Father Lavigne:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the salary paid to Mr. Leon Trottier as teacher of the Ebb and Flow School.\n\nOur records show that the basic salary paid to Mr. Bellevance was $100.00 a month and the same amount was paid to Mr. Trottier. In addition the latter received a bonus. Under the circumstances, I cannot understand why he made the statement to you that he had been paid $10.00 a month less than his predecessor. Possibly there was some difference in their income tax.\n\nWhen endeavouring to engage a teacher, you may offer a salary of $100.00 a month, plus bonus of 17%.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nVery Rev.

From Item 7, Form T.D.1, those in that state are advised not to file this form.\n\nIn reality, I have not dependents to claim as in those forms. But from another side, I have others to whom I owe great obligations. I am greatly obliged to those who has pushed me school for so many years. Now that I don't need to be helped much more, I have to help my father who has a large family of dependents and who depends from a land which has gone into deep debt instead of yielding good crops these last years. If somebody doesn't help him, I do not know how he will manage to live from nothing and having to pay at the same time store bills, fuel bills, lumberyard bills and a mortgage of a few thousands dollars on his land.\nThere are expenses in store for a new cellar under the house and a new barn.\n\nBesides I have to reserve something for a career next year. Here food is pretty dear and it costs quite much for travelling. So this is why I have chosen the job that pays the most. It is to block the greatest number of holes possible. It is not because it is very interesting to live alone, in a dreary far-away country.\n\nI slept returning money for my living expenses and future indebtedness.

In fact, I cannot see where any arrangements were made for this purpose although drugs have been shipped to the Ebb and Flow Reserve in his care. Previous teachers have been paid at the rate of $50.00 a year which was apparently for dispensing drugs and issuing rations. We are quite willing to pay him for this service. If any arrangements have been made I think that Indian Agent Waite should take the initiative and forward vouchers. Certainly if we do not get any vouchers or word we have no way of paying him. It might be advisable to pay him by splitting the $50.00 between Welfare and Medical for distributing rations.

I have found a young girl who is a very good seamstress, who has taken a complete course in dressmaking, and who is willing to go to Ebb and Flow to teach the women of that place how to sew, and even how to cook.\n\nWould you accept this plan, and would you pay a salary to this girl?\n\nI think this project would be very profitable to the Indians of Ebb and Flow who are good people and really deserve to be helped.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I refer to Lake Manitoba Day School, where two Sisters are employed. Sister Marguerita is employed as teacher at $90.00 per teaching month and Sister Vergilia as assistant teacher at $45.00 per month. Sister Vergilia acts as a Field Matron, housekeeper and dispenser.\n\nI beg to suggest that an assistant teacher be employed at Ebb and Flow Day School at a rate of $25.00 per month, plus $50.00 per year for the issuing of rations and the dispensing of drugs. I would also suggest that she be Assistant Registrar, Dept. of Vital Statistics. She would receive .25\u00a2 for each registration of birth, marriage and death. This work is undertaken, at present, by a storekeeper who resides approximately ten miles from the reserve. The assistant teacher's duties would be to visit the sick on the reserve, act as housekeeper for the teacher and do regular janitor services.\n\nJ.

That request was made to Mr. Neary, who offered him only $150. That salary was insufficient. Sewing and household lessons should be given to Ebb and Flow women and girls. I received no reply, but I believe it would be convenient to try that small experience. Miss Jeannine Dupas is sufficiently qualified for that purpose. I submit that matter to you once again.\n\nM.

From previous information, Miss Denise Rocan gave up duties on the 31st of May and consequently should refund an amount of $47.50 ($50.00 less $2.50 placed in the Retirement Fund Account), the total of the payments made to her for June and September.\n\nPlease let me know the exact dates on which both of the above mentioned teachers gave up duties.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 126-4-1 (W.T.), August 11, 1947.\n\nMrs. Pelletier, wife of the teacher of the Ebb and Flow Day School has made application for a position as teacher of Domestic Science at the mentioned school. Her husband is teacher and his wife expected a salary of $40.00 per month for teaching Domestic Science or for housekeeping for her husband. Last year a single teacher was on this reserve and a housekeeper was also employed, more as a companion than otherwise. I believe Mrs. Pelletier could be used to better advantage as a Field Matron than as a Domestic Teacher, although both positions could be combined. Before her marriage she was housekeeper for Nurse MacCarthy and has had some experience in attending the sick. Mr. Pelletier feels that the job is not paying him enough money and that his wife should be allowed to take the position vacated by Miss Denis Rocan last June. His present salary is $100.00 per month, plus $6.40 paid as issuer of medicine and rations.\n\nIt is my understanding that Mrs. Pelletier has no experience as a Domestic Science teacher.\n\nI would be pleased to be advised in this matter.\n\nJ.

It seems that women from the reserve take part in the sewing.\n\nThe agent in his November report mentioned that Mrs. Pelletier wanted this work, but \"has no qualifications.\" She was receiving some pay as medicine-dispenser and ration-issuer.\n\nMr. Pelletier's annual salary is \u00a3120. Inspector Marcoux says he is doing good work, is earnest, but \"will need some encouragement.\"\n\nMiss Juni Rocan (no certificate) was paid \u00a3180.

You will recall also that we paid Miss Denise Roan a small salary only to provide the necessary companionship for her sister. It is not our policy to pay teachers' wives as housekeepers.

They are not to be shown as discharged.\n\nOur teachers were given an increase in salary before other Civil Servants two years ago. In other words, our salary adjustment of 1 September, 1948, was actually equivalent to the cost-of-living adjustment received by other Civil Servants in October, 1948.\n\nIf you will refer to the June issue of the Bulletin, you will find that a revised salary schedule is anticipated by 1 September, 1949.\n\nIf you will refer to our salary schedule, you will also find that the Department pays good salaries to teachers but expects them to be qualified. This is in accordance with the recommendation of the Indian Affairs Committee that teachers in our Indian Day Schools should be certificated. You will find that your attendance at normal school next year will result in a very marked increase in your salary.\nHaving taught in an Indian Day School much more isolated than that in which you are now located, you can rest assured I fully appreciate your difficulties.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nSir,\n\nThe drilled well at the Ebb and Flow Day School requires cleaning out. I have had a well-driller inspect the well, and he has submitted a price of $50.00 for cleaning, provided he can get at the work at once. Although the well is not absolutely necessary, and not used by the Day School, the Indians use it for the watering of their stock during the winter months as it handier than watering at the Ebb and Flow lake. The water for the school is taken from a dug well under the kitchen. This gives a sufficient supply for that purpose. The Indians have no funds to have the drilled well cleaned at their own expense, and if left the well will be useless.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nYour file: 52-20\n\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, November 15, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 10th, you may expend an amount not exceeding $50.00 in cleaning the well at the Ebb and Flow Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nW.A.

E 40, amounting to $0.50 only in favour of A.G. Taggart, teacher, Ebb & Flow Indian Day School at Reedy Creek P.O., Manitoba, for payment for cartage on school supplies.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 126-4-4 dated April 12th, 1934.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the Ebb and Flow Day School, and also bring to your attention the condition of the walls and ceiling, which are very dirty. This school was built in the year 1927 and nothing has been done to the walls since. I am asking for a price on the cleaning and kalsomining of the walls and ceiling, and as soon as this is received a further report will be forwarded. An amount of $60.00 was placed in Estimates 1934-35 for this purpose. The seats are in a shaky state and I have also asked for an estimate to fix same. I have also asked for a price for the building of a teacher's toilet, this was not asked for in this year's estimates, but an amount for fencing was asked for and if the amount asked for for the fencing is approved, I believe a toilet could be built in addition to the fence. A further report will be forwarded in connection with this matter.\n\nI also beg to advise that there are no scales on this reserve for the issuing of rations. These were not asked for in last year's estimates, although they have been asked for in previous Estimates. It is difficult to issue rations without a scale and leads to a certain amount of misunderstanding between the teacher, who is the issuer and the Indians.\n\nI believe it could be arranged with the church authorities to fence the school and church on a 50-50 basis, as both buildings are close together and one enclosure would do for both.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose requisition for school material received from Mr. A.G. Taggart, Teacher, Ebb and Flow Lake Day School, in which he asks for kalsomine for the renovating of the school room, which is badly needed, also repairs on school desks, and the erecting of a plate around the chimney. This matter was taken up with the Department in my report of May 31st, File No. 10.\n\nThe approximate cost of material for the renovating of the school room is as follows:\n- Kalsomine 6 - 5 lb packages $3.60\n- Sizing $.60\n- Labour $13.00 Total $16.60\n\nThe cost of freighting will be extra.\n\nThe material and cost of building a toilet for the teacher:\n- Materials $20.00\n- Labour $3.00 Total $23.00\n\nStove bolts are required for repairing the desks about 10 dozen being required of assorted sizes. The labour will cost $3.00.\n\nThe iron plate around the stove pipe next to the chimney is very necessary and will cost in the neighbourhood of $7.00, including material and labour of fitting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 16, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, I beg to say that you may have the classroom of the Ebb & Flow Indian Day School kalsomined, at a cost of approximately $16.60.\n\nYou may also have a new toilet erected for the teacher, at a cost of $23.00.\n\nThe desks may be repaired, and an iron plate placed around the stove pipe, next to the chimney. All costs should be kept as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.
