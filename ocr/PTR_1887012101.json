H. Macdonald, Esq., was unanimously nominated by the Liberal party, and was elected to the House of Commons for the Prince Albert constituency, held this seat seven years ago for the Liberal party. We hope now that a gentleman has been nominated who has given proof of his abilities in the future of the country by investing his money in the territory, and who has always contributed liberally towards any public or private enterprise. We believe that the settlers will be glad to give him their unanimous support. Meetings will be held in every different settlement between now and election day in order to give the settlers an opportunity to make known their wants, and at which Mr. Macdonald will express his views on the question of the day.\n\nTHE NEW COUNCIL.\nIf the new Council will only pursue the policy foreshadowed by His Worship Mayor Macintosh at the first meeting we will have a Council of real thinkers. A good fire engine is much needed, not only as a protection against fire, but as a means of bringing the cost of living down to the lowest possible figure. At present the rate is so high that it is impossible for many of our citizens to maintain paying the rates asked. The proposition to place a ferry on the river to encourage trade and commerce should meet with the approval of everyone who takes an interest in the prosperity of the town. There can be no better trade being done by our merchants with the north at present, and by the simple expedient of providing a ferry to transport the trade can be developed. Besides there is good land to the north, and abundant water; timber, and other resources why a ferry could not be built over the river is because a summer resort for our citizens is needed. They can build a cabin by the river, where they can shelter from the storms, where they can lose sight of the world, and where they can see the shade of the pines that abound on the north side of the river. A rifle range is also much needed.\n\nAs for the necessity of railway communication, there can be no difference of opinion between those who are interested, for he who has, to the extent to which a railway should be assisted by the Town and District. We do believe in the importance of having a large town, besides the existence of such a large town and railway communication for this point should be an important factor in any company such as the M. N. W. to make connection with this place as soon as possible. The honest citizen of Prince Albert cannot afford under difficulties, and we do need to mortgage ourselves to secure railway communication, but as we have said before, if the experiences of some eastern towns may be taken as a guide. However, the question is still open for discussion. More than this, the M. N. W. are bound by their charter and by an agreement with the Government to make the town of Prince Albert their terminus. Prince Albert should not need to beg for railway communication.\n\nThe Agricultural Society is certainly entitled to assist in the encouragement of farming and stock raising, our prosperity chiefly depends. Grounds should be provided and suitable buildings constructed for which purpose the district has subscribed and in aid of which a liberal grant should be made by the Government.\n\nWe are very pleased to note that His Excellency the Governor General has appointed to elect representatives to the Dominion. This is a boon to the people of the Territory, who have been denied the privilege of by sending a solid delegation of four to Ottawa to urge on the government. But while there is no doubt, there is a dearth of men of action, whose motives we will not question, to elect representatives to the Dominion. This being the case, we may be allowed to give the reason why we think the present Government should not be supported by the people of the Northwest.\n\nTo commence, we ask: Would we be justified in supporting a government that elect representatives to the Commons, who had the Mackenzie Government removed from office? We would not, because it must be perfectly plain that the Mackenzie Government had reasons for the legislation they adopted and persisted to carry out with regard to the (P.R.), the Territorial Act, which have been advanced and advanced as they are today. To the Hon. K. without doubt, in whole, or mostly, for the repeal demanded by the Territorial Act, he must admit that while the Hon. M.C. Cameron\u2014now cheerfully give him credit for his actions\u2014drove the Liberals into opposition, the seat of the Liberal party held, and one of them\u2014Hon. David Miller, and Hon. Mr. Laird particularly, as \u201cNo.\u2014D. R.\u201d\u2014was very outspoken in his opposition to the government proposal.\n\nAnother reason why we should support the present Government in the fact that the Territorial Act was repealed almost wholly granted to the Territories and the Dominion Parliament, as an indication of the Government\u2019s desire to hold the election of the Territories as a Province. We should, therefore, send a strong delegation to Ottawa to support the present Government in carrying on this measure, as we have little to expect from a Liberal Government under this administration.\n\nAnother boon we have to thank the Government for is the Terminus for the railroad, which was started operation in the last of this month. Under this Act regulation has been simplified, and legal expenses, which may be necessary, in course, may not be very satisfactory to the high professional, but it is essentially the duty of the citizens of Prince Albert should, therefore, show our appreciation of this great blessing by supporting the present government.\n\nAnother point we should not lose sight of is, that if a fire-truck, or one similar in its kind, were purchased, it would be nothing short of a menace to power, there is a danger, a very great one, that it might be thrown about, from duty, or at a much higher rate of fire than at present, to the injury of local interests. We do not deny to those who live in the Territories that they have huge pastures for the benefit of American cattle kings. Farmers and stockmen have been in the habit of buying this matter, and cannot cast their ballots too solemnly and unanimously against Liberals in order to overthrow the existing government.\n\nNow there is the last issue, which we shall not attempt to decide in this article, but we have heard the sound of the responsibilities and hardships of developing this country brought up by the Liberals, but it seems to us that those who have nothing to offer, should not be called upon to bear the burdens of the responsibilities and hardships of developing this country. We do not believe in the Government, we believe in the Opposition, and we believe that the Government should be made up of those who have nothing to offer, and who would not be able to bear the burdens of the responsibilities and hardships of developing this country. We do not believe in the Government, we believe in the Opposition, and we believe that the Government should be made up of those who have nothing to offer, and who would not be able to bear the burdens of the responsibilities and hardships of developing this country.\n\nGENERAL NOTES.\n\nJ.

Alphonsus Pich\u00e9an, who has been appointed Bishop of Saskatchewan, was born at St. John's, New Foundland, in 1844, and was educated in that city by the Reverend English Dominican Fathers at St. Augustine College, Canterbury, Eng. On completing his college course he proceeded to Canada, where he was ordained a deacon, having been sent by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel to the mission of St. John's. He came to the limits of the province there in September, 1869\u2014eighteen years ago. He was ordained in Winnipeg, December 25th, 1870, and was incumbent of St. James, resigning on October 1st, 1881, since which time he has been secretary to the bishop. In the spring of 1883 he was appointed archdeacon. He has always taken a leading part in the provincial Councils, of which he has been a member from its formation in 1874. He is an able and eloquent preacher, and always able to command the attention of his hearers. He has always been deeply interested in educational matters, and a great worker in the cause of religion. He was appointed superintendent from 1871 to 1883, when he resigned, in order to be able to devote the whole of his time to the work of Archdeacon. He is still the bishop, and still represents the Board of Education on the council of the University, and members of the Board of Education of the University. In 1881 he was sent by the Board of Education to visit the educational institutions of the province, in order to inspect the system of secondary education and training of teachers, and the development of the schools. He expects here, to make a full report of his observations then made. It will be sometime before His Lordship Bishop Pich\u00e9an will arrive in Prince Albert.\n\nTOWN COUNCIL.\n\nThe first meeting of the Second Council of the Town of Prince Albert took place in the Council Chamber on Monday evening last.\n\nPresent\u2014Mayor Macdonald, and Councillors Bain, Stewart, Agnew and Macdonald.\n\nEach member handed in his oath of office, and his declaration and undertaking.\n\nHis Worship the Mayor, previous to the commencement of the year's business, made a short address to the members, and expressed the hope that all their deliberations would be conducted in a friendly spirit.\n\nHe then referred to matters that he thought it would be well for the present Council to consider. He first referred to the question of the fire engine, the fire engine, with sufficient hose and other necessary appliances. He next alluded to the question of the bridge over the river, and expressed it as his belief that it would be in the interests of the town, to a large extent, to have a bridge across the river. He also referred to the railway connection and expressed it as his conviction that it would be well if such arrangements could not be made by which the M. N. W. Railway, the only road practicable, likely to come into this town, could be induced to take up this line of business. He also believed that the Agricultural Society should be encouraged to do everything possible towards the advancement of the town.\n\nLastly, he referred to the P. A. C. band, and believed it would be well in some way to assist them. At present, however, these are important matters to be thought of, and which he recommended to their careful consideration.\n\nCoun. Bain gave notice that at the next meeting he would introduce a by-law calling for the election of Treasurers, Assessors, Collectors, Auditor, Receiver, Postmaster and Constables.\n\nMoved by Coun. Bain, seconded by Coun. Stewart, that J. J. A. Still be Clerk of the Council, and Coun. Bain.\n\nOn motion of Coun. Stewart and Agnew the Council adjourned to meet on Monday next, at 7.30.\n\nThe Count de Grey, of Grey's Valley, was married by the Rev. Mr. Murray, on Wednesday last, to Miss Mary Murray, of Grey's Valley. Nearly all the material correspondence alike the foregoing from the Winnipeg Mission of the Grey's Valley, Mr. Murray's half sister, Louise, and who make many friends there, we assure they will join with us in wishing her a very happy life with every happiness.\n\nCONVENTION.\n\nThe Liberal Conservative Delegates Conventionally Nominate D. H. Macdonald.\n\nAt two o'clock this afternoon delegates from the various Liberal Conservative associations throughout the Province assembled at Mr. Macdonald's residence at the corner of Main Street and Gwynne's store, for the purpose of nominating a candidate to contest Saskatchewan in the interests of the Liberal Conservative party.\n\nThe following gentlemen were present: Mr. Cameron, Forks of Road; Henry Hargrave, Colville; Mr. Murray, Grey's Valley; Mr. James Henry, McDougall settlement; R. Boweater, Pickham; W. Murray, Red River; Mr. L. L. Meckes, Long Settlement; Mr. A. McVea, Neverside; and St. Catharines; Hugh A. Gray, T. A. Anderson, F. N. Gordon, Donaldson, W. R. Grant, Prince Albert.\n\nOn motion Mr. R. Boweater took the chair, and Mr. Cameron acted as Secretary.\n\nDr. Bain, President of the Prince Albert Association, explained the object of the convention, and spoke highly of the Lawrence Clarke, O. E. Higgins, M. N. W. C., and Thom. McKay, K. C., who had been elected to sit as Members of the Prince Albert Association, to whom these gentlemen declined to accept the nomination, but consented to attend the convention.\n\nThe delegates then referred to the work done in their several districts, and the general sentiment of the people of Saskatchewan, as to the desire to see a new government, and that the people would be willing to use every legitimate means in their power to secure the election of the first representatives of the people.\n\nOn this point being put to the meeting it was unanimously carried.\n\nDr. Bain then moved, seconded by W. R. Boweater, that Mr. D. H. Macdonald be a delegation to wait upon and invite Mr. Macdonald into the committee, and when the nomination signed for all the delegates present, was read aloud, to which proposal he gave the following written reply:\n\nTo the Conservative Delegates in Convention\u2014\n\nGentlemen.\u2014In replying to your request that I should contest the District of Saskatchewan in the Conservative interest at the coming election for the Dominion Parliament, I feel deeply the honor you have done me, and while accepting the nomination, I am simultaneously offered me, I pledge myself, should I be elected, to work to the best of my ability for the prosperity of the Province of Saskatchewan, in which you have so much interest as I have.\n\nI am, gentlemen,\n\nYours, respectfully,\n\nD. H. Macdonald.\n\nMr. Macdonald then retired into the hall, on entering which he was enthusiastically received by the delegates.\n\nHe briefly addressed the convention, thanking them for their vote of confidence, repeating the promises he had made him in selecting him as their standard bearer, and expressing it as his determination to do his best for the party.\n\nThe convention then adjourned, after choral for the Queen, Sir John, and Mr. Macdonald.\n\nNotice.\n\nAll parties having claims against us will please send them in at once, and all parties indebted to us will settle their accounts at once, as we wish our books closed.\n\nBalance of stock at hand under cost for cash.\n\nMISS MACK & CO.\n\nFirst Door East Telegraph Office.\n\nRUSSELL & DAVIS.\n\nWHOLESALE & RETAIL\n\nButchers.\n\nBeef, Pork, Mutton, Sausages, Bacon, Ham, and Game in Season.\n\nBranch Stalls\u2014Qu'Appelle Station, Fort Qu'Appelle, and Prince Albert.\n\nRUSSELL & DAVIS.\n\nBROWN'S BRICK STORE.\n\nJ.
