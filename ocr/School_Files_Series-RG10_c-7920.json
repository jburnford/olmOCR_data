I am a qualified teacher with experience but I'm a married woman. My husband is a war veteran and is unable to secure employment. He suffers from the effects but draws only $15 monthly pension and we cannot make a go of it. Therefore, hearing there was to be a vacancy on the reserve I decided to apply for it.\n\nI remember Mr. Hughes has kindly offered to recommend me. I also\nrefer you to Mr. George Andrews, Principal, Mississauga, Ont., and to Rev. Father E.E. Langan, our parish priest here, for references of my character, and to the Separate School Board, Mississauga, for references of my ability as a teacher.\n\nIn anticipation of an early and favourable reply,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Mrs.) Anna La Rue.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 12th, 36-5-1, I beg to state that on receipt of same I immediately wrote to Miss Kelly.

There is a feeling here that the present salary schedule is rather high, with the result that members of Parliament are simply inundated with requests for positions at our schools. The salaries paid at present appear to be higher than the salaries paid at public schools for similar work. You may inform Miss Kelly, therefore, that the Department is not prepared to increase her salary at this time.\n\nI am anxious to know if you have sent forward a requisition for the bed to which this teacher refers in her communication. If this request has not been sent forward to the Department, you might purchase a suitable bed for this school, from a firm on the approved list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

It is also noted that Mrs. Osborne holds a Province of Ontario third-class certificate.\n\nIn the case of a school where English is the language of instruction the only third-class certificate that is recognized is one that was obtained several years ago and was later validated by regulation of the Department of Education at Toronto. I understand that there are few of these and a teacher holding one of them would have great difficulty in obtaining a position in either a public or separate school in the Province of Ontario.\n\nFor many years past only first-class and second-class certificates have been awarded and at the present time those attending normal schools are required to have a first-class certificate.\n\nIt is certain that in view of recent changes in the curriculum for the Province of Ontario a teacher holding a third-class certificate of the type mentioned above would not be as capable of instructing the pupils as a teacher who has passed through normal school within recent years and holds a second-class certificate or, preferably, a first-class certificate.\nThe former teacher of the Sagamook School, Miss Kelly, held a first-class certificate and according to the Inspector's reports did very good work. Under these circumstances I believe that it would not be in the best interests of the Indian pupils attending this school to appoint any other teacher than one possessing a first-class certificate and I feel that it should be possible to secure such a teacher.\n\nBefore taking any action regarding the appointment of Mrs. Osborne I thought it advisable to bring the above to your attention. I should appreciate receiving further instructions regarding the teaching services at this school for the coming academic year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Bethune's memorandum of July 24 in which he states that Mrs. Osborne has been recommended for the position of teacher at the Sagamook School.

The teacher is Miss E. Burke, First Class Certificate, twenty-nine years' Indian experience and five years' Provincial experience. This building is quite satisfactory; it was built in 1935. There is a full basement with a satisfactory furnace. There are five windows on one side of the room and one on the other. It is lined with V Joint on the lower part of the wall and beaver board on the upper.\n\nThe basement is also well lighted and could quite easily be used for manual training and Domestic Science. These children are bright and eager. Their attendance is very good and there are some thirty-eight children enrolled. Miss Burke is a strict disciplinarian and drives the children a lot but they like her and are eager to show what they can do. The condition of the class is good. In Arithmetic the children are fairly good and are exceptionally good in spelling. They read and speak out well. There is an organ in the classroom and the children are very fond of singing.\n\nThe teacher's quarters are at the back of the school and are small. However, an extra room has been added and when this is completed, can be used for an extra bedroom. There is a housekeeper with Miss Burke.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1.

We have checked your average attendance for the March quarter and for the month of April, and are quite prepared to provide for a second teacher.\n\nThe big problem will be that of providing the extra room which can be used as a classroom. We have already written to Mr. Indian Superintendent Laurence with regard to the work on your living quarters. I am writing to him again concerning your suggestion for using the basement as an extra classroom. It is very likely that you will be hearing further from him with regard to this recommendation.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRaymond F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMiss S.

This will increase the registration to sixty. I need not go into detail re the difficulty of handling such a large number. Two problems, however, stand out prominently:\n\n1st. The larger boys, for want of attention and variety in their work, grow disgusted and wish to give school up entirely;\n\n2nd. The little ones, not getting sufficient attention, form habits of idleness etc. which remain with them and, as progress is naturally slow where English is not understood, these juniors who should pass into second year at least at the end of two years, remain primers, or at best, firsts. They in turn will be beyond their grade age in a few years and become restless and disinterested in the work.\n\nOn May 12th I discussed this question with Agent Laurence and Inspector Greening. They both agreed that a second teacher was essential if any real progress was to be made.\n\nIf the work on our living apartments can be completed as I outlined for Mr. Laurence, we will have an extra room which can be used as a bedroom in case of necessity. This would permit a third person to live in the teachorage.\n\nThere is question of opening a class in the basement. This, I think, would be as good an arrangement as any we can\nMr. Bernard Neary, Supt.\n\nThe question of having water in the house seems to present difficulty. I might tell you that since December our pump has been out of order and we have been carrying water from a spring quite a distance from the school. Everyone has been using this pump and, naturally, it gets out of order. If the water were in the house this difficulty would be overcome. Permission was given to buy a new pump and also for repairs on the old one, but men were scarce from the reserve trapping and we had not one who understood the work; consequently the new pump reclined peacefully in the basement till about a week ago. The men are installing it today.\n\nRegarding the second classroom, no doubt you will hear from Mr. Laurence and Mr. Greening. I know this matter will meet with your kind co-operation and help.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSadie Buckle\nJune 3, 1948.\n\nSagamook Indian Day School\n\nMr. R.P.G.

For the month of April it averaged 39.87. Therefore, we are quite prepared to pay for a second teacher at this school. The big problem will be the provision of a second classroom.\n\nWe have already written to you with regard to the expenditure of $4.95 in making alterations and repairs to the teacher's living quarters. Do you think that the use of the basement as a classroom is a feasible suggestion or would you prefer the use of the council hall, as I discussed with you last winter?\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\"\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nBAKANOOK INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nThis is to advise that the work is under way on the Spanish River Council Hall so that it will be ready for use as a Junior Classroom when the school opens this fall.\n\nAs stoveswood will be required for this building, I ordered 20 cords of wood to be cut by the Indians. This will be used to heat the Junior classroom as well as the cabin that the teacher will use as sleeping quarters. I trust this action meets with your approval.\n\nIt will be necessary to have someone light the fire in this hall each morning. I have spoken to an aged Indian who lives close to the School who would be willing to look after the fires for $15.00 per month. If this request is granted he could also look after the furnace in the main school, (that is to fire up each morning). Miss Burke, the teacher at this school, now finds it hard to fire this furnace as it is a wood furnace which takes heavy blocks of wood and is quite a strain on her.\n\nKindly advise me regarding this matter at your convenience.\n\nR.

In any event, no funds have been provided.\n\nAcl.\n\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\n25th March, 1949.\n\nMiss Sadie Burke,\nTeacher,\nSagamook Indian Day School,\nMassey, Ontario.\n\nDear Miss Burke:\n\nI have received your letter of the 5th ultimo in connection with the installation of a telephone line on the reserve.\n\nAs you know, the installation of a telephone line is not exactly the duty of the Indian Education Division, and consequently, I discussed the contents of your letter with the officials who are in charge of the general administration of reserves. They have made extensive enquiries and have ascertained that it would cost at least $2,000.00 to provide a telephone line, and as we would not count on any customers who would pay their share of the maintenance cost, the Departmental officials cannot see that they would be justified in incurring the expenditure. As you are aware, similar conditions exist on other reserves.\n\nIt is a further fact that no funds have been provided in the current year's appropriation nor in next year's appropriation for the provision of a telephone line on the reserve. I realize that a telephone would be a great convenience at certain times, but as you will note from this letter, there does not appear to be much possibility of securing one in the immediate future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nChief, Education Division\nDear Gertrude:\n\nI was surprised to receive your letter of the 9th May, and to find you saying that \"As yet I have not yet secured a position,\" because I am pretty well certain that the Indian Affairs Branch has one reserved for you.\n\nThere are many more people that you might think who are watching your progress with much interest and high hopes. Among them are Colonel Henry, the Superintendent of Indian Education, and myself. We are all anxious to see Indian young people given as good an start as they are prepared to make for themselves, and every success not only makes us feel proud but also makes another such success so much the more likely.\n\nAnd so it is for that reason that the Indian School people at Ottawa thought it might be a good plan if, where possible, promising young teachers be sent to a two-room (or larger) school where they could be under the care and guidance of an older experienced teacher, and thus serve a term of \"apprenticeship,\" although they are FULL RANK teachers and paid and treated as such.\n\nBesides a number of letters, Colonel Henry and I have had two conversations about what would be best for you, one in Ottawa in February, and one in Toronto at Easter, so that you can see we have been thinking a good deal about you, which is why I was surprised to hear that you were still worrying about a position.\n\nColonel Henry asked me for my advice, and I suggested that you go offered the school at Sagamook, just south of Massay. I don't know just how far it is, but I have heard of the school from Massay and back again so that it can sit by very far. You will have the junior room, with not more than nine or ten One and Two pupils (possibly more from the town), and very likely since we want to give you every chance to get along. The Principal is Miss Sadie Burke, whom you may remember as she was once Principal at Wikwemikong, when that school was giving work as high as Grades Nine and Ten, and when I was passing pupils from the school on recommendation while I was making many pupils from Provincial Schools write the examinations.\n\nMiss Burke has had years and years of experience in Indian schools, and should be able to help you a great deal. Besides when you will be able to live in the school residence.\n\nHere are a good many reasons why you would be better off NOT to accept a position in a Residential School. If I could have a talk with you I could tell you more, but it would make this letter too long. One thing is that if you go to parish, you won't be in my inspectorate, so that I won't be able to help you along, although, of course, some other inspector would do as well.\nI certainly hope that you take this position at Sagamook, because I gave a good deal of thought to finding you a good school, and would have chosen the same school for you, for the first year, even if you had been my own daughter.\n\nIf you would like to take the school, you should write at once to:\n\nLieut.-Col. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nTell him that I have written to you about a school with the Indian Affairs Branch, and add that you would take the Sagamook school if it were vacant.\n\nYou needn't write a long letter, because Colonel Neary knows all about you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nMiss Gertrude Pitawanakwat,\nSt. Mary's Academy,\nKarth Bay, Ontario.\n\nCOPY FOR COLONEL NEARY\n\nWITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF\n\nP.S. I think it would be a splendid idea if you could get around the schools at Wikramkong. If you get around them all you would see how different peoples do different things, and could determine for yourself what is the best way for Indian school children. Try to put in as much time as you can at Murray Hill and Bunnah, because that is the kind of school you will most likely be teaching in. But you will have to ask Colonel Neary to give you permission and to make the necessary arrangements for you to visit the schools.\nSt. Mary's Academy,\nNorth Bay, Ontario,\nMay 7, 1949.\n\nMr. W. J. Greening,\n288 Harrington Ave.,\nPort Arthur,\nOntario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am one of the Indian girls attending the North Bay Normal School. Our school closes on the third of June.\n\nSince the elementary schools will be open for most of June, I should like your permission to visit the schools in my district in June. I especially would like to see the new Murray Hill school which opened just after the holidays. By helping the teachers and observing in their classrooms, I would gain a great deal in that way.\n\nAs yet I have not secured a position for the next school year. I hope to teach at the girls' residential...\nschool in Spanish. There I would have time to prepare my lessons and to study for a Permanent Certificate.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGertrude Patawankiat\nMay 19, 1949.\n\nMr. C.H. Johnston,\nSupt., Indian Agency, Manitouining, Ont.\n\nYou will recall my writing to you concerning the posting of Miss Gertrude Pitman to the new classroom to be erected at the Spanish River School. I wrote you about this on April 11 and have yet to receive a reply, so I presume that you have no objection to our plans.\n\nThis girl will be through with her work at the North Bay Normal School on the 3rd of June and the necessary instructions are being issued to the teachers at the Hanush and Murray Hill Schools for her to visit them during the month of June.\n\nBernard J. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMiss Gertrude Pitawanakwat,\nSt. Mary's Academy,\nNorth Bay, Ontario.\n\nDear Gertrude:\n\nMr. Johnson has forwarded to me your letter of May 9 in which you advise that you would prefer to go to the Spanish Residential School to teach next year. I would like to hear from you immediately as to whether you have been able to arrange for an appointment to the teaching staff there.\n\nThe only reason we had in recommending Sagamook School for you was to ensure that you had a teaching position next year. Please write to me at once and let me know your plans either concerning the Spanish Residential School or concerning the Sagamook Day School.\n\nYour starting salary at Sagamook would be $144.00 a month if you obtain a Second Class Teaching Certificate or $150.00 a month if you obtain a First Class Certificate. You would have to buy your own food and do your own housework at the day school.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard E. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSAIAMOOK INDIAN DAY SCHOOL,\n(Sault Ste.

I know Miss McNeill has had very good success with the work she might find work in the Jr. Normal. More about it soon as I hear from Miss Robichaud. I shall let you know.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n[Signature]\n\nJuly 23, 1945\nOTTAWA, July 20, 1949\n\nMiss B.

Henry\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nCharge Indian Affairs\nMinistry and Resources\n\n[Stamp]\nDear Mr. Murray,\n\nI'm sure you have heard from Miss Robins and by now I spoke to her over the phone a few days ago but she seemed to have cleared up from the other school. She said she might not be able to leave Segawook during the winter and I was sorry but did not think it wise to urge her because my time was so taken up after and before school hours with the sick and medicine dispensing. So far nothing of birth certificates and children's allowance papers that I could not spare much time helping her with her work. But I think she will find second division rather easy.\n\nI have been told that Miss Robins would not be suitable for Segawook.\nIn view, farmers and fishers, but\nthere was only rain except some\nIndian girl who took only two years\nat Pembroke.\n\nI was out at Sagamok today to\nlook after some debts and other affairs\nthat accrued, and we could find under\nshelter. The place looked forlorn.\nNearly all the natives have left for\na while. The men are levelling the\nground for the new school and one\nwould see nothing but piles of sand,\nfor both church and school.\n\nTrusting we may succeed in\nfinding a suitable pedagogue.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nIndian Burke.\nAugust 27th, 1949\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nYou will please find enclosed application form for salary revision, duly completed and signed by Miss Sadie Burke, teacher at the Sagamook R.C.

Neary  \nSupt., Indian Education  \nWelfare & Training Div.  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines & Resources  \nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI have not heard whether Miss McNulty has accepted the Junior Room in Sagamok. Will you kindly let me know?\n\nIn case she has not, I am recommending Miss Eileen Donnelly for the position. Miss Donnelly graduated with honours from Eganville High School this year, with a first class non-professional certificate for Ontario. She comes from \"Teaching Stock\" and is highly recommended by those who know her intimately as being a girl of principle and honor. She is about twenty years.\n\nI have asked Miss Donnelly to send in her application for the Junior Room. If the position is already filled, you would have her name on the list for some other school.\n\nMrs. Osborne from Mountain Road School told me she would exchange her school for the Junior Room in Sagamok, as she would be near her sister, Mrs. Kelly, in Spanish.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nConfidential:\nI think I would prefer Miss McNulty if the position is still vacant.\n\nS.S.\nOTTAWA, September 3, 1949.\n\nMiss B. Burke,\nGirls' Residential School,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nCan you accommodate Miss MacNulty present teacherage until new school completed? Stop suggest she live in new teacherage when school completed as only one bedroom will be provided.\n\nBernard F.

Carisse,\nActing Private Secretary to the\nMinister of National Revenue,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Miss Carisse:\n\nI have had the Education Officials of the Indian Affairs Branch check the circumstances concerned in the resignation of Miss Herbert MacNulty as mentioned in your letter of August 25.\n\nMiss MacNulty has had some seventeen years of experience in our Indian Day Schools. In September 1948 she was appointed teacher at the Cornwall Island First Indian Day School near Cornwall, Ontario. On October 11, 1948, she wrote advising that she would not be able to resume her duties at Cornwall Island East after we had granted her a week's sick leave. She advised that her doctor was not sure when her allergic condition could clear up and possibly would recur due to the climate on Cornwall Island. Miss MacNulty suffers from hay fever, and the school is in a pollen area. I have attached a copy of a letter sent by the Superintendent of Education to her at that time. On December 6 she wrote to express her concern about her job, and she was offered a position in the Fort Frances Agency or another school in the Fort Arthur agency. Both of these positions she declined to accept because of illness in her family.\n\nThe Department of Education has gone to considerable difficulty in placing Miss MacNulty in an Ontario school this year. She did not wish to accept a school too far from her home in Montreal. It has been difficult to locate a suitable school because our teachers are as long as leaving our services but due to higher salaries, accommodation and improved conditions, are remaining in our service.\nHowever, Miss MacNulty has been placed as the second teacher at the Jacksmock Indian Day School near Nansay, Ontario. The Superintendent of Education has discussed this appointment with her by telephone. We feel confident she will be satisfied especially when the new school, now under construction, is completed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

She took ill there and had to leave to undergo treatment, for which the Indian Agent allowed her one week's leave. She eventually was replaced and was given one week's salary instead of the usual month's salary which, I understand, all teachers receive in such instances.\n\nAt Christmas 1948, Mr. Neary, the Superintendent of Indian Education offered Miss MacNulty one of two isolated schools in the Port Arthur area, which she had to decline on account of illness in the family.\n\nIn the meantime, she received a letter from Mr. Fee with two months' retirement fund and indicating that due to a break in her service he was obliged to return this money.\n\nMiss MacNulty states that any break in her service were always due to illness. She still has the cheque uncashed, as she wishes to leave the fund intact until she can again resume teaching. However, she has so far not been offered any appointment for the coming year and I wish to enquire whether there is anything in the way of a position in store for her.\n\nHonourable C. W. G. Gibson,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA - Canada.\nWould you be good enough to have the matter investigated and inform me of its present status.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(sgd) James J.

In the case of new teachers, the Department pays for the September quarter the proportion which the number of days taught during that quarter bears to the total number of teaching days in the school year. There are 200 teaching days and, as the return showed that the school was open for 17 days, you were paid 17/200 of your yearly salary of $600.00, or $51.00.\n\nIf you continue in charge of this school you will be paid at the end of the December quarter, one-quarter of your yearly salary and the same amount at the end of the March quarter. When your June quarter return is received all previous returns will be checked and, if it is found that you have taught the full 200 days, you will then be paid the balance of your yearly salary.\n\nThe bonus due you for the month of September will be paid with the December quarter bonus.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

He further says that it would be very hard to make a good job of repairing the old building and he considers that they should have another. The funds to the credit of this Band amount to over $7000.00 and it would cost at least $1000.00 to put up a new building. If they can stand the expense it would be well to give them a new schoolhouse.

General,\n\nThree tenders have been received for the erection of the school-house on the Thessalon Indian reserve, Ont., amounting respectively to $1,364., $1,525., and $1,600. These tenders were received closed. The Agent appears to have acted in accordance with instructions contained in a letter to him of the 12th instant.\n\nWe usually ask the Agent to open the tenders, and to recommend which tender should be accepted, at the same time reporting his reasons for making the said recommendation. I have no knowledge the three persons making the tenders above referred to. We have, therefore, to ask a further report from the Indian Agent.\n\nThe lowest tender, that of James Sandie for $1364., is rather high for a good locality, but considering that Thessalon is more or less inaccessible, I think his tender may be accepted, provided the Agent reports that he is a fit and proper person.\n\nIt is desirable that the school-house should be built before the winter commences. In order that no time may be lost, I beg to recommend that an Order in Council be immediately applied for authorizing the expenditure of $1,400. in the erection of the said school-house.\n\nChief Surveyor.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Surveyor.\nIndian Office\nSheraton\n30th August 1905\n\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 29th inst. and numbered 151723/5.\n\nI beg leave to say that James Sandie is a first-class carpenter and capable of doing the work, but he might want a little assistance as the work progresses. He would like to be able to clear a little money if work reported on by Inspector of this can be done.

We would be glad if they were such a nuisance in a school-room.\n\nTo have good ventilation the windows should be lowered from the top. The plan does not allow for this; I thought best to mention it.\n\nAs some of the children live over a mile from school and very few Indians have clocks I could not well get along without a bell. We have a good bell but there will be no belfry on the new school unless you will kindly have one built.\n\nI do not know if you intend building a wood-shed. We need one badly.\n\nShould you, however, not be able to grant all the above requests, I trust that you will arrange all satisfactorily.\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to enclose a letter written by the teacher at Sahgamot suggesting some changes in the plan of the school house at that place upon my last visit to Sahgamot.

At every rainstorm the water is pouring in through the outside of the window-frames, wetting and spoiling the plastered walls.

If the Rev. Father Desautel's statements are correct, it is evident that there is some fault in the construction of the building and the contractor should be called upon to make it good. This should be attended to at once before the cold weather sets in and before damage is done to the plastering by the water.\n\nOn June 28, last, you were asked for certain information as to the Chief's address, in order that the desks required for this school might be shipped to him. You will be good enough to advise the Department at once as to where these desks should be shipped so that they may be sent.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSamuel Hagan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nOttawa, November 19, 1906.\n\nRev.

S. G. of I. A.\nI am surprised at Mr. Jas. Sandie was given the contract to build the Saganock school, after the bad work he has done here on our school. He left the Church unfinished, sheathed it inside with very bad lumber full of cracks, loose nails and holes; he put matched boarding on end or perpendicularly for the inside walls, before putting the floor, and thus left a hole in the floor along the wall at every point of the matched-boards. He left out a great part of the quarter-round, put no half-round nosing in front of the step of the sanctuary, made a hole in the wall between the sanctuary and the vestry over the altar for a stove-pipe, and when told that it was not on the plan, he did not fill the hole properly, but simply nailed two unsightly boards over the hole left out two crosses on the Church, which the plan called for, put nothing in the belfry to prevent the rain water from running through the roof. When Mr. Clinton came to paint the Church he remarked that it was half finished; he hesitated to paint the roof, saying that the loose shingles moved under the brush, many being held in place only by one nail. Mr. Clinton had to put sine in places to cover under the shingles to cover open joints.\n\nRegards,\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nJoseph Bissillon, Sr.\nOttawa, March 18, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nOn December 29, last, you were written to in reference to a complaint received by the Department as to the quality of the work done by the contractor on the new Sagamook day school.

You will be good enough to advise the Department at once as to what action, if any, was taken by you.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D.

The doors also need fixing, as quite a lot of cold came from them. Outside buildings are in poor condition.\n\nIf the Government would allow some print, about 50 yards, it would be practice for the girls in sewing, affording at the same time clothing for them.\n\nL.

Wainscoting allow wind to come through.\n\nThe whole teacher's section should be fixed to make it warm and keep out the wind. Window sashes and doors need refitting. Baseboard coming apart. The whole building absolutely needs refinishing.\n\nInterior of classroom plastering off in places.\n\nInterior of teacher's apartment should be redecorated for the sake of teacher living here.\n\nA new stove should be placed in the kitchen. Present one is all warped on the top. New kitchen stove pipes needed, present ones are all a mass of rust.\n\nMy general impression is that plastering is needed in classroom and teacher's apartment downstairs at least and that the walls be redecorated.\n\nSomething should be done with windows, doors and baseboard to keep out the wind. Teacher's rooms are very cold and hard to heat. Stove in kitchen replaced and new pipes in place of rusted ones.\n\nJ. M. Bennet,\nInsp.\nOttawa, June 1, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Sagamook Indian Day School, states that certain repairs are required to the school and teacher's residence to make it comfortable during the winter months. He reports that the wind enters in several places, making it difficult to keep the building warm. In the classroom the wind enters around the windows and wall-scotchtin; and in the teacher's section the window sashes and doors need refitting and the baseboard is badly apart. The Inspector further states that the interior of the classroom requires to be plastered in different places; that the interior of the teacher's apartment should be redecorated and a new stove, complete with pipes, should be placed in the kitchen.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish a report regarding the repairs that are needed to both the classroom and the teacher's residence and state the approximate cost of having both places in good condition. Also state how you would advise having the work carried out and estimate the cost of replacing the kitchen stove and pipes. This matter should receive your prompt attention in order that, if it is decided to have any repairs undertaken, the work can be done during the coming summer holidays. I may add that the question of repairs to this school was drawn to your attention in official letter of May 6th, last. In view of the Inspector's and Teacher's reports on the condition of the buildings, it will be necessary to have certain repairs made before next fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

W. Stone\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Sagamook Indian Day School, May 14, 1925.\n\n(A) Rooms should be decorated or morewood.\n\n(B) Teacher has painted the floor in kitchen.\n\n(C) Outbuildings need cleaning badly. These toilets are being used by some Indian people living there and they have made them most dirty. The teacher cannot do anything. The trouble is also due to the fact that there is a wire fence around the school itself but the woodshed and toilets are outside this fence on open land. The wood too has been disappearing. I would suggest that the fence be extended to enclose all. Also that immediate cleaning of toilets be attended to and that locks be placed on these doors.\n\nThe stove here is of an old type and will burn every baking put in. This teacher can only get in supplies about three times every term. You can see then how important a good stove is to a teacher. There seems a tendency to put in any old type on the part of some agents.\n\nThree pipes needed to be replaced in teacher's bedroom. They smoke. Broom needed. Axe handle needed.\n\nJ. M.

Three pipes needed in teacher's bedroom.\n5. Broom required.\n6. Axe handle required.\n\nWith reference to the cleaning of the teacher's rooms, please state whether you would recommend that this work be done. If so, you should report the amount of work required and the approximate cost.\n\nRegarding the outbuildings, the inspector states that these toilets are being used by the Indian people and that the trouble is due to the fact that there is a wire fence around the school itself but the woodshed and toilet are outside this fence. The wood has been disappearing. The fence should be extended to enclose the toilets and woodshed and locks should be placed on the doors. Please arrange to have these toilets thoroughly cleaned and placed in a good sanitary condition. You should purchase locks and have them installed on the doors. The keys should be in the teacher's possession. Please state what it would cost to have the fence extended around these two outbuildings.\n\nRegarding the stove for the teacher's use, please state whether you would recommend that a new one be supplied. If so, you should consult the teacher as to the type of stove needed and inform the Department as to its approximate cost. You may purchase any extra stove pipe required, also one broom and one axe handle.\n\nYou should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure which you are authorized to make.

The teacher would write to him when she needs something. The chief should be forbidden to have anything to do with the teacher if he has some grudge against her he would tell the missionary, who will see to it. As for the fuel, he should not be paid before he has finished to split it, for the use of the cooking. It is quite a burden for the teacher to go 2 or 3 times a week to ask for fuel principally from such a man.\n\nMr Bisson meets the chief nearly every day, at Massey, so he could tell him what to do and the teacher would let him know whether the chief does it or not.\n\nAs for Mr Rothera he is too kind....\n\nMiss Sloan tells me that she does not think of coming back next year. I don't think she is to be blamed after two years of such an exile and of so many hardships.\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\nApril 29th, 1927\n\nMr. Ferguson,\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe the school of Sagamook\u2014While at Sagamook Miss Laura Sloan, teacher, came to pay me a visit and in tears she told me how hard it was to stay there. And the cause of the difficulties is the chief. The teacher is enslaved by him, everywhere even in her class. She should be absolutely independent of him, a poor Indian who cannot sign his name. Till now the teacher depends on him, or to fix the school or to split the wood necessary for cooking, etc. He is paid for that, but as it bothers him to be asked, not doing as he should do, he gets angry and gets rid of the teacher quick and so the poor girl is obliged to split her wood as she had to do for two months last fall and frequently at other times.\n\nIf he is told something by his adopted girl, she being scolded for her misbehaviour, he goes himself or he sends his simpleton son John, to scold the teacher. That John told the girl not to accept any punishment from the teacher, because she is not the chief. At last she got the girl out the school, after much trouble.\n\nThe chief is supposed to put the storm windows, though asked repeatedly he neglected to put one, that was the cause of the teacher freezing all the winter, and also one pane of 30x18.\nOttawa, May 3, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is informed that the teacher of the Sagamook Indian Day School has been having difficulty with Chief Louis Solomon, regarding the splitting of the wood necessary for cooking and in connection with other work to which he should attend. It is stated that the teacher has been obliged to split her own wood, which she did for two months last fall and frequently at other times. We are informed that the Chief neglected to put on one of the storm windows, although asked repeatedly by the teacher to do so, also that one pane of glass is required. It is stated, further, that the Chief and his son, John, have interfered with the work in the classroom.\n\nThe account which you submitted, for work done at the school by John Solomon in putting 30 cords of wood into the woodshed and taking down the storm windows, will not be paid until the Department hears from you as to whether Solomon is faithfully performing these services.\n\nI may say the Department expects that an agent will see that the Indians or others do not interfere with the teacher's activities in the classroom and that, when the work of supplying and splitting wood is given, it will be properly done. It has been suggested that, in future, Constable Rossaw perform the work that has been carried out by Chief Solomon and that, if this arrangement were made, there would be no cause for complaint.\n\nI have to request that you will enquire personally into the above matters and furnish the Department with a full report, stating whether Chief Solomon attends promptly to any duties which the teacher requires in the taking off and putting on double windows and the supplying of necessary wood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. F.

In February the wood had to be dried around the stove. There might be enough lumber in the old school to build a wood shed, if it is the right kind of lumber. The wood shed should be attached to back of school so that it might be entered from school. As it is, it is sometimes impossible to enter shed on a windy day, as it is.\nOttawa, April 29, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe teacher of the Sagamook Indian Day School, in her annual report for the last fiscal year, states that a new woodshed is required, as the present one fills with snow every winter. She suggests that the new woodshed be attached to the rear of the school building, so that it might be entered from the school. Please furnish a report on this matter. If you recommend that a new shed be erected, you should give full particulars as to the size, the material required and the cost of same.

I was unable to study the situation on the ground.\n\nThe present location of the school is not suitable; some of the pupils have to walk four miles over bad roads during the winter months; regular attendance can not be expected under these conditions. The School is of lath and plaster construction on a stone foundation and owing to the nature of the ground over which it will be necessary to move it, considerable injury to the building is likely to result. However, the Agent will go over the matter too carefully with a local man who is an expert mover of houses and get the benefit of his advice, and will then submit a report and recommendation for your further consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThomas McCookin,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nIn regard to moving the school at Sagamok, Spanish River Reserve, we desire to make a proposal about this matter and have located a man who will undertake to move the school to a suitable site, which will be better for the children, for $50.\n\nAt present the location is bad, being on Sagamok Point, where there are only two families, but this the children have to walk five or six miles in winter. If moved, the school away from the point, placing it in a suitable spot, the children from Huron Bay could go to school without any hardship, and the place would be nearer being away from the lake.\n\nKindly advise what will be done, the winter time is the best time. When spring comes, as it can be handled better then than in colder weather.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nOttawa, January 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, regarding the moving of the school building at Sagamook from its present position to a site more convenient to meet the requirements as regards attendance of the Indian children and giving an estimate of the cost of same.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department understands the present combined school and teacher's living quarters are on a stone foundation and the building is of lath and plaster construction and that it would be necessary to move it approximately two miles, and that, owing to the nature of the ground, considerable injury to the building would likely result. Please state whether you have selected a suitable site and whether it would not be necessary to have a new foundation prepared before the building is moved. You should also state whether it would be necessary to purchase the land required for school purposes and whether you could locate a site on level ground, having good drainage, with adequate playground facilities. I may say that there are no funds available in our appropriation for the current fiscal year to pay for the cost of removing this building, but before the matter could be considered, full particulars would have to be given regarding the new site as mentioned above. If any considerable damage would result in moving the building it might be better to dispose of this old building and erect a new combined school and teacher's residence on the new site. You should state your views regarding this phase of the matter. In the meantime, until full particulars are received regarding the new site, the best means regarding the removal of the present building or the erection of a new building, and the providing of funds for the purpose, the present arrangements for carrying on school activity at this point will have to be continued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

There are about 20 children attending, they have not had a chance to go to school owing to the distance, if the school is changed to the new site they could all attend and would not have more than 2 miles to go at the furthest, to some time think it would be an advantage if the old school was pulled down and built elsewhere to obtain this will forward some Departmental instructions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent's Office\n\nJune 2, 1920\nOttawa, June 6, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, relative to the removal of the school building at Sagamook to a site more convenient to meet the requirements as regards attendance of Indian children. It is noted you recommend that the present old building be pulled down and the material therein used in the reconstruction of a new building on a central site.\n\nI regret that there are no funds available in our appropriation for the present fiscal year to provide the cost of having this work carried out. A note has been made for next year's estimates, when an effort will be made to obtain the funds required for the purpose.\n\nIn the meantime, you might forward an estimate of the cost of taking down the old school and rebuilding it on the new site. You should also give definite information as to the site on which you would recommend a new building be erected, stating the area of the land needed for the purpose and whether it would be necessary to purchase same or if it could be obtained from the Band without charge for school purposes. Particulars, stating the location of the new site, should also be given. In the meantime and until funds can be provided for the moving of the present old building, the work at this school will have to be carried on under the present arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

There are about 20 children attending the school, and the distance would be about 2 miles.\n\nThe Board would be pleased to hear from you regarding the possibility of constructing a school building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, August 25th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, recommending that the Department purchase the public school building from the Spanish River Lumber Co., at Cutler, Ont., for the sum of $300, the lumber and other material in which could be used in the erection of a combined school and teacher's residence at Serpent River Reserve and a school building at Samcook on the Spanish River Reserve. In reply I beg to say that our funds this present fiscal year are limited. Could you arrange with the Spanish River Lumber Co. to obtain the public school building, payment for same could be made next April when funds for the next fiscal year are available. If so, arrangements could be made early next spring to have this building taken down and the lumber used in the erection of the schools above mentioned. It is thought that the present arrangements for carrying on the work at both these schools could be continued until the new buildings can be erected.\n\nRelative to the repairs required at the Serpent River School, I would refer you to our letter of the 15th instant. You may arrange to have the minor repairs absolutely necessary carried out. Only the work necessary to make this building comfortable during the coming winter should be performed at the present time.\n\nPlease take up with the Spanish River Lumber Co. the matter of obtaining the public school building, payment for same to be deferred until next April, and advise the Department whether or not they will comply with this arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. F. Bothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\nI enclose one drawing showing where is that school and where it should be to be central. As for me it is completely against me, because my church will be at three miles farther, but the public good first. Now both the church and the school are together.\n\nI would be very much obliged if the Department takes step immediately, so that a teacher could be able to begin teaching next January. The house should be torn down, as it is very large and the road is very hilly; it must go at least 100 ft higher than now.\n\nConstable Bisson would take the contract I think, to carry away.\n\nIf torn down, I think that there will be enough good lumber to make the new building as this house is much too large as it is now.\n\nIf the Department judge it proper, there will be enough time to make the solid foundations in cement as the weather is warm yet.\n\nThanking you in advance, for this great favour.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nC. B\u00e9langer, B.J.\n\nPerhaps some one could be delegated from Ottawa to come and see the situation, and study the opportunity of this change.\n\nTo change at the Chief's would be to place it at 1 mile only farther. At the fork 3\u00bd miles.\nDear sir,\n\nI just came from my mission of Sagamog, on the Spanish River reserve, and to my great sorrow, I found the school close. A reserve where there are so many children without school. I understand that the school could not go on, with the attendance that took place since few years. The reason is that the house is not at all central on the contrary, it is at the last limit of the reserve, where there is nobody.\n\nSince one year they spoke about having it changed, but nothing happened, because the chief wants it to be at his door, without mind for the good of the reserve. At his house none, as by the past of those who are on the main road would go, and so in one year there will not be one child in the school as it is now.\n\nIf the chief is opposed to the change at the fork of the road (main), is the Department who is so anxious to have the children educated, to yield and to abandon this reserve? All but few are anxious to have the change at the fork, and all for the change are new or young couples, who will furnished children for the future.\nOttawa, September 23, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, relative to the closing of the Sagamook Indian Day School, and requesting that steps be taken to have the old school building taken down and removed to a new site more central to meet the requirements of the Indian children, and the school re-opened early in January, next.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that our funds for the present fiscal year are limited, and it will not be possible until next Spring to arrange for the building of a new school on a central site. Mr. C. F. Rothera, Indian Agent, Thessalon, Ont., in August, last, recommended that the Department purchase the public school building from the Spanish River Company, builder, and use the lumber and other material therein in the erection of a combined school and teacher's residence on the Spanish River Reserve and a new school building at Sagamook, the Spanish River Reserve. He stated there was sufficient material in this public school building for the purpose, and he was requested to endeavour to arrange with the above Company for the purchase of the building. If he is able to secure this building, steps will be taken early next Spring to have it taken down and the lumber used in the erection of the schools above mentioned.\n\nThe sketch which you enclosed showing the location of the present school and where you would recommend the new school be erected has been noted. Before the new school building at Sagamook is erected next Spring, every consideration will be given to seeing that it is built on a site central to meet the needs of the children on the Reserve. In the meantime, I regret that it will not be possible to arrange to carry on the teaching work at Sagamook.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Shane Belanger, S.J.,\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nOttawa, December 29th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to refer to previous correspondence regarding the proposal to erect a new classroom at Sagamook some time next summer. The Department now wishes to have a pencil sketch showing the localities of Toulouse Bay and Sagamook, the roads leading therefrom, the location of the various Indian homes indicating the number of children of school age and those under school age and, also, your recommendation as to the site of the school. The sketch should be to scale as far as possible and the mileage indicated. You might also let me know if a teacher's residence should be attached.\n\nSeparate School Inspector Greening has recently visited the Department and discussed this proposal and you might defer your reply to this letter until after he has had an opportunity of discussing the question with you. I may add that the recommendation of Rev. Father Belanger, S.J., is already on file and it will not be necessary for you to make any special visit to him before making your recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Since three years it is closed, with the promise of transportation in a more central place. There are 23 children of age to go if changed, but now where it is there is nobody.\n\nI ask you about this change now, because the Indians have nothing to do, and would be pleased to work to gain a little money to buy their clothing. They could this Fall tear the old school down, and during the winter transport the lumber as they have only sleds and no wagons. If so transported, next Spring it could be rebuilt to be used next September, at a very small cost.\n\nIf we wait for the end of the depression, when will it be? And during that time these children grow older.\n\nThe poor Indians need to have clothes and as they have no work, they cannot afford to buy any. This little work, would be a charity to them, at the same time it would be useful to them.\n\nMr. Cole's son Charles that Mr. Fury knows well, could see to the work of taking down the present building.\n\nThanking you in advance for all the best favours.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ. Pelanger, S.J.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nDecember 3rd, 1932.\n\nMEMORANDUM-\n\nThe Sagamook Indian Day School has been closed for about three years, owing to the fact that the school is not properly located.\n\nA proposal has now been submitted to the Department that the building be torn down during the present winter and the lumber transported to the new site where it would be available for building next year. When you next visit this reserve, the Department would appreciate if you would make some inquiries and ascertain if a responsible party could be secured to supervise this proposed work; also what it would cost to have the work done.\n\nIn the event of it going ahead, the Department would require definite assurance that someone would be responsible for seeing that none of the lumber is stolen when it is removed to the proposed new site of the school.\n\nOur funds are so limited this year that it will not be possible to decide whether or not this work will proceed until your report has been received. I would, therefore, request that, while your inquiries should be thorough, no definite intimation should be given to the Indians that the Department intends to do this work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. O. Wilson\nMerry, Dec 10th, 1932\n\nH.J. Bury Esq., Dept of Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to our conversation regarding dismantling of Sagamore School and removal of Material to new site at the big hill settlement. I understand it is the wish of the Department to dismantle the school with as little breakdown and waste as possible, and to deliver the material salvaged at the said site and price it in such a manner as to withstand weather conditions until construction is undertaken next spring. I would be prepared to do this job without delay this winter by hiring Indians only, for the sum of three hundred dollars. I enclose to this form you favorably.\n\nI am very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Russell Cole\nWith reference to your memo regarding the dismantling of the old Sagamok school house and rebuilding at a new and more suitable site, I located the new site as indicated in the sketch attached, and in company with Chief Frank Gegewatch and Mr. Russell Cole marked the place where the material, if moved this winter, will have to be placed so as to be convenient for construction work next spring.\n\nI discussed tentative arrangements with Mr. Cole and the Indian Chief, and pointed out that the Department was prepared to give the matter of immediate dismantling and removal consideration, provided a satisfactory plan was arrived at.\n\nMr. Cole has addressed a communication to me which is attached, stating that he is prepared to undertake this job by hiring Indians only, for the sum of $300, and I would suggest that if funds are available, the work be undertaken forthwith as it will give the Indians some much needed employment.\n\nMr. Cole resides across the Spanish river immediately opposite the reserve and is persona grata with the Indians besides being reliable and trustworthy in every way. Several of the interested Indians are ready to work and the chief and two or three others have small teams which they would use to transport the material. The soil is about 5 miles and the material together with the furniture of the old school should be ample to build a suitable school on the new site, with very little additional expense, other than labor, provided the dismantling is carefully done.\n\nI would recommend that the Department give the matter favorable consideration.\nwould move down towards the River, once a school was built there.\n\nThe land from the mountain down to the River is much more adapted to farming etc., and the inclination of the Indian now is to get closer to town, i.e., Massey, which is about four miles from Mr. Cole's.\n\nIf a school was built on the other side of the mountain, it would be impossible to expect the Indians from this side to send their children there, as it would be too far and they would have to climb that mountain twice a day. It would just mean that they wouldn't send their children. So the place I mentioned, namely, about three miles and a half from the River would be a fine spot. There is plenty of water there etc.\n\nWhile I was on the Reserve this last time, I had delegation after delegation of Indians to see me about the school. On one occasion I proposed to them, rather I asked them if they would be willing to put up the four walls and roof of a school, at the place mentioned, if the Department would do the rest. After a lot of talk they all decided that they would be willing to put up a log school house, i.e., the four walls and roof, provided the Department would finish it etc. So you see how anxious they are to have a school.\n\nI think I have given you all the details and I feel sure that you and the other members of the Department will realize the great need of a school there. The children are growing up wild, without any scholarly or religious training. The Missionary myself new, who can only spend about three days a month there, can do very little.\n\nIt is my sincerest hope that we will have a school there for next September, or before if possible.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon,\n\nI am sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev. T.J. Dwyer, S.J.)\nIndian Missionary\nIndian Residential School\nSpanish, Ont.\nNov. 21/34\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI have been transferred from Wikwemikong to Spanish, to take charge of the Indian Missions on this end, namely Sagamok, Spanish River, Oak Bay, Renabutch, Spragg, Mississaging and Les Sable.\n\nI have been here since the 1st of October and have been around all the missions twice already.\n\nI just returned last night from Sagamok. I spent five days there, visiting them all, including those along the Spanish River, and really Mr. Phelan, they are in a deplorable state for want of a school, so I am appealing to the Department of Indian affairs to have something done in their behalf.\n\nI understand there was some trouble there a couple of years ago about the location of the school but that can be overcome now, by having a school about three miles and a half from the River on the Sagamok road. Some of the Indians are moving down toward the River from the Sagamok end, and others have told me that they would move there too, if a school was built there. They are just beginning to start to farm now, so it looks as if they are going to settle down.\n\nThere are about fifteen Catholic families within five miles of the River, with about forty children in all. There would be about twenty ready for school next September. They are nearly all young married Indians there and their families are increasing rapidly. In a few years time there will be thirty or forty children for that school.\n\nThere is a Protestant Anglican school on the River bank, across from Mr. Cole's farm. Of course as you know the Catholics are not allowed to send their children there without a dispensation from the Catholic Bishop, which he will not grant.\n\nAs soon as the Indians in that locality heard that I was appointed to Sagamok, some of them began sending their children to the Protestant school. Of course I had to forbid them under pain of refusing them the Sacraments and Catholic Burial. Some of them said that the Indian Agent told them to send their children there. I don't know if this is true or not, but I would like you to tell the Agent that the Catholic children are not allowed to go to that Protestant school.\n\nAlong the road from the River to what used to be Sagamok village there is a mountain of rock, about a mile and a half wide. There are quite a few Indian families scattered thru the Reserve beyond this mountain. They are anxious to have a school over there too, and they are willing to have the school now about three miles and a half from the River, with the hope that as time goes on, their numbers will increase, so that they could get a little school somewhere in that part of the Reserve.

At the present time, we are preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1935-36 and we are making a note of the advisability of providing school facilities at this point. I am not aware what amount will be voted by Parliament for the erection of new buildings and, consequently, I am unable, at the present time, to give any definite promise that a school to replace Sagamook will be provided next year.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. T. J. Dwyer, S.

Might say that the site was chosen and was told by the Department that it would not be possible at that time to build a new school.\n\nKindly advise if there will be any hopes of one being erected this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\nTotal age, young children\n\nFrank Hegewisch 1\nAlice Bryan 5\nGrace Johnson 3\nJohn Thomas 3\nJohn Lee 2\nSimon Johnson 2\nLucy Johnson 2\nJohn Doe 1\nMary Johnson 2\nAngus Johnson 2\nFrances Johnson 1\nJohn James 1\n\nTotal 32 10\n\nYour Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPetition\n\nMasonry Creek\nHannah Bird River\nMay 21/35\n\nFr.

It will be necessary to provide classroom accommodation for 30 children and also to provide living accommodation for the teacher. Outside toilets will also have to be provided - one for boys and one for girls.\n\nThe old school building is to be torn down, and there would be a quantity of lumber which would be useful in the erection of the new building.

Maintain proper ventilation.\n\nMINEHEAD INC.\nManufacturers of Fireplaces and Stoves\nCanada at Mgr. de Roth, Alberta\n\nAND SOLD BY\nDomestic Coal value is usually determined by the quality of the coal itself, but the degree of hardness, heat-giving properties, storage and handling facilities also play their part.\n\n**YOU CAN KNOW**\n\nThe Alberta Government is committed to KNOW which of its own coal fields produced the best coal to ship to Ontario. In 1928 it appointed a special committee to test and recommend Alberta coals for sale in the Province of Ontario. After careful examination, the committee reported: \"We recommend for shipment to Ontario, coals from the COALSPUR district and the Lethbridge area.\"\n\nOther districts were suggested under certain conditions where similar qualities were not important.\n\n**MINEHEAD INFERNO** comes from one of the deepest mines in the COALSPUR district, at the foot of the Rockies. West of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The coal is guaranteed to burn clean by the Alberta Board of Agriculture, and bears a special stamp of approval for shipment to Ontario.\n\n**MINEHEAD INFERNO** pleases because:\n\nIt is **HEAT**\u2014not just fire and smoke.\n\nIt will store without shrinking.\n\nIt will burn without smoking.\n\nIt is **ALMOST SMOKELESS**, and almost **SMOKELESS**.\n\n**MINEHEAD INFERNO** is economical because it gives the most heat per dollar. After all, it is **HEAT** you look for in your heating system, and the coal that gives you the best value is what counts.\n\nIn addition to saving dollars, MINEHEAD INFERNO saves time and work because it already contains the proper amount of ash requiring little attention either in cold or mild weather. There is practically no sifting of ashes, all coal being consumed.\n\n**MINEHEAD INFERNO** coal is prepared by the most modern equipment, in sizes which will suit any type of furnace. This coal can be used satisfactorily in any type of furnace, heater or range.\n\nThe purchasing power of Canadian people can only be maintained by the employment of Canadian labor and Canadian capital (money to pay wages out of Canada each year to pay for coal not mined in Canada. This money spent in Canada will create a great stimulus to employment, in the mines, on the railroads and in manufacturing plants now gaining the markets of other countries.\n\nCanadians should burn Canadian coal to the fullest possible extent, and by so doing create employment and prosperity. The careful dealer will buy MINEHEAD INFERNO, a distinct recommendation from Alberta, for chimney use which will bring repeat orders.\n\nThe following are recommended:\n\nBlower\u2014Suitable for blower use\n\nStove\u2014For cook stoves and ranges\n\nDomestic Lamp\u2014For furnace, heaters and fireplace\n\n**MINEHEAD INFERNO** will reduce your labor, increase your comfort and reduce your costs.\nOttawa, January 11, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. P. Phelan, of the Schools Branch, intends to visit the Spanish Residential School on the 20th instant. The following day, January 21st, he will inspect the new Sagamook Indian Day School.

She appeared to be very much interested in her work. Twenty-six (26) children were present on the date of my visit, and the school register showed that this number had attended since the opening. It is expected that about fourteen (14) more children will attend as soon as weather conditions improve.\n\nThis school is well situated, and the majority of the children live a comparatively short distance from the school.\n\nThe building was erected by day labour, under a foreman, according to plans supplied the Agent by our Architect. It is one of the finest day schools that I have ever seen, and I feel that the Indian Agent deserves credit for the manner in which he has supervised the work. The building is 50' x 22', with a fine classroom; also living room, kitchen and bedroom for the teacher. There is a cement basement under the school. The posts in the basement are also made of cement. This basement is about 7' high and has ample room for storing wood.\n\nApproximately two acres around the school was cleared, stumped and levelled. As a result, there will be plenty of room for playgrounds and, in addition, it reduces the fire hazard, as there is no bush near the school.\n\nThe only desks in the school are 9 double desks, seating 18 children, which were used in the old school. Twenty-two new single desks are required, and I would recommend that these be ordered as soon as possible.\n\nOwing to the supervision of the Agent, the furniture for the teacher's residence used in the old building had been carefully stored and has been removed to the new school. As a result, no further equipment in this regard is required at the present time.\n\nWater is obtained from a spring near the school, and two new toilets were erected.\n\nThe total cost of this school is as follows:\n\n| Building material | \u00a32,683.89 |\n|-------------------|-----------|\n| Labour            | \u00a32,158.55 |\n| **Total**         | \u00a34,842.44 |\n\nThe above figure includes the installation of a furnace, which heats the whole building, also the cost of clearing the two acres of land.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, I feel that we have received splendid value for the money expended.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, February 5th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn his return to the Department, Mr. Phelan reported regarding the new Sagamock Indian Day School. The Department is pleased to learn that we have a very satisfactory new school at this point.\n\nIn view of recent instructions to curtail expenditures as far as possible between now and the end of the fiscal year, it is regretted that we cannot supply the new desks at the present time. However, arrangements will be made to order the desks for this school early in April.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. MacKenzie,\nSecretary\n\nC. F.

You will note a red \"X\" marked opposite certain names on pages 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 and 15 of the labour return. In each case that is marked, a different person has signed the paylist from the one whose name appears on the left hand side of the return.\n\nIt will be necessary either to have the person who did the work sign the paylist or forward orders from the person who did the work to the person who signed the paylist, authorizing the latter to accept payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

During the cold weather they need something hot at noon. If the teacher does not supply a lunch, it means that they have nothing to eat. The teacher also finds that giving a hot lunch improves the attendance of those who live at a distance.\n\nMiss Muldoon has written me stating that the $2.00 she was allowed is now used up, and as hot lunches are necessary for about six weeks more, she will require about $4.00 to finish the term.\n\nKindly advise if she can be allowed this amount.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.P.G.

Two of our teachers, as you know, have to be accommodated in this small room\u2014not big enough to divide.\n\nThere is, however, a good shed attached to the building. If this could be finished for a kitchen with cement foundation, one of the rooms downstairs could be used as a bedroom. I really cannot understand how two of our teachers slept, or pretended to, in that small space. Will you please consider this request favorably, having this work commenced as soon as possible.\n\nAnother request. Would the Department give us a sewing machine with all the equipment that goes along with the \"Singer\" machine? I should be glad to commence sewing lessons as early as possible in the term.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp: Department of Mines & Resources]\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nSeptember 3, 1947.\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nMiss Sadie Burke, Teacher, Sagamook Indian Day School,\nMassey, Ontario.\n\nPurpose for which required\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 1        | Ordinary sewing machine. |\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

Lawrence,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nGalt Ste., Marie, Ontario.\n\nWe have received a letter from Miss Burke regarding the need for a second teacher at this school. Her letter, in part, reads as follows:\n\n\"May I draw your attention again to the need of a second teacher in our school.\n\n\"In a recent survey I have found out that about sixteen pupils will enter school for the first time in September. This will increase the registration to sixty. I need not go into detail re the difficulty of handling such a large number. Two problems, however, stand out prominently:\n\n\"1st, The larger boys, for want of attention and variety in their work, grow disgusted and wish to give school up entirely;\n\n\"2nd, The little ones, not getting sufficient attention, form habits of idleness, etc., which remain with them and, consequently, are naturally slow where English is not understood; these juniors who should pass into second year at least at the end of two years, remain primers, or at best, firsts. They in turn will be beyond their grade age in a few years and become restless and disinterested in the work.\"\n\"On May 12th I discussed this question with Agent Lawrence and Inspector Creasing. They both agreed that a second teacher was essential if any real progress was to be made.\n\n\"If the work on our living quarters can be completed as I outlined for Mr. Lawrence, we will have an extra room which can be used as a bedroom in case of necessity. This would permit a third person to live in the teachers' house.\n\n\"There is question of opening a class in the basement. This, I think, would be as good an arrangement as any we can foresee, at present.\"\n\nOur records here show that for the March quarter the attendance at this school averaged 40. For the month of April it averaged 39.47. Therefore, we are quite prepared to pay for a second teacher at this school. The big problem will be the provision of a second classroom.\n\nSo have already written to you with regard to the expenditure of $495 in making alterations and repairs to the teacher's living quarters. Do you think that the use of the basement as a classroom is a feasible suggestion or would you prefer the use of the council hall, as I discussed with you last winter?\n\nHerbert F. Murray,\nSuperintendent of Education.\"\nDear Mr. Lawrence,\n\nI have another teacher for daywork who would be willing to teach even in the basement. She has 12th grade finished\u2014has no certification and some teaching experience. She is trying to get enough money for normal.\n\nHowever, the basement seems hardly feasible. Reasons against: too little for wood\u2014nothing extra for furniture and supplies and too much expense involved to obtaining enough light or eliminating dampness. This ultimately the living conditions would be unsatisfactory.\n\nThe best solution seems to be to let the hall be fixed up for education.\nand I could give up my Latin\nfor two quarters if she could\nwork with the teachers.\nLet me know what you\nthink so I can tell the girl what\nto expect.\n\nE. M. Hey J.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nJune 2, 1948.\n\nI am enclosing letter received from Rev. J. A. Mokey, S.J., Parish Priest, of the Spanish River Indian Reserve regarding another teacher for the Spanish River ... C. Indian School, and in which he states that his cabin could be used for living quarters. He also states that he does not think the basement would be suitable as a classroom and thinks the best solution would be to fix up the Indian Hall.\n\nI think myself that the Hall would perhaps make the best temporary quarters for the small children. It would take at least $495.00 to put the Hall in shape for the winter, as at present it is only a shell.\n\nYou cannot get anyone to go on this reserve and make a bid on small jobs such as this, so if the Department is interested in putting this extra classroom under way by next fall, I would appreciate it if an accountable advance could be forwarded this office as soon as possible for $350.00 for labour to put this hall in shape for next fall.\n\nKindly advise me regarding this matter at your convenience so that I can notify Father Mokey regarding the teacher.\n\nP.

We would appreciate having the desks at your very earliest convenience also the books etc.\n\nI think the hall will be reasonably comfortable.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSadie Burke\n| Date   | Article                                                                 | Amount |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| June 12| Rope                                                                    | $1.00  |\n|        | Nails                                                                   | $1.40  |\n|        | 3 latches                                                               | $10.75 |\n|        | 1/2\" Squares Hell Brick siding                                         | $2.00  |\n|        | Weather strip                                                          | $10.40 |\n|        | 10 ft 1-1/8\" Pipe                                                      | $1.40  |\n|        | 1el 1/8\" Elbow 60\u00a2 1 nipple 4\u00a2 2 nuts 50\u00a2                               | $3.70  |\n|        | 1 Check Valve 50\u00a2 Cutting & threading pipe 20\u00a2                          | $4.75  |\n|        | 7 1/2 ft 1-1/8\" Pipe 3.4\u00a2 Nails 60\u00a2 Elbow 90\u00a2                           | $1.10  |\n|        | 1-45\u00b0 elbow 60\u00a2 1 coupling 80\u00a2                                          | $1.00  |\n|        | Cutting & threading 6x times                                            | $0.50  |\n|        | 1 Pump                                                                  | $0.25  |\n|        | 1el 1/8 length stove pipe                                               |        |\n\nTotal: $53.34\n\nSigned: [Signature]\n\nN.

Matters,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\nNorth Bay, Ontario.\n\nRe: Spanish River R.C. Indian Day School\n\nFurther to my recent letter concerning the general building programme in your Superintendency, I would like to make a further suggestion concerning the building of the above school.\n\nAs you are aware, we are at the present time renting the Council Hall for use as a second classroom. Mr. Laurence, when on his holidays in Ottawa recently, discussed this situation with me and we agreed that a standard one-room school without basement (Plan No. 838) would be quite satisfactory for this part of the reserve. I would suggest that it be built close to the present building and arrangements be made to purchase additional land for a playground area.\n\nIt would seem that we can proceed to advertise for a contractor for the erection of this building without any further delay. If so, the only delay would seem to be concerning the water supply. As there is already an adequate well at the present school, I would not imagine this will present too much difficulty.\n\nBernard X.

If it is at all possible to do this then the school could be turned completely around so that the residence would face East and the wall of windows would face South.\n\nIf this is not possible then could the school be oriented to face East or West and move closer to the west fence. It would be preferable to have the wall of windows face East.\n\nIn the meantime, we are proceeding to have the advertisement published as recommended by you. It will probably be two weeks before it appears so that the question of the site can be settled by then.\n\nBernard F.

By turning the school around as you suggested both classrooms would be looking into each other and I thought that this might distract the pupils' attention.\n\nThe wall of windows could be made to face East, but Father Mokey, S.J., the local Parish Priest, and myself discussed the matter and both of us were of the opinion that for appearance sake it would be better to have both schools facing the same direction rather than one at right angles to the other. There is no reason for not having the school face East.\n\nYou will note that the North-east corner of the property is marked \"low ground\". I believe that it would be advisable before building the new school to fill this portion in with gravel so that it could be used as a playground. Two or three hundred yards of gravel would be sufficient to do this.\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSault Ste.

The reason for this is that by doing so, the new school will not block the view from the present school and sufficient light will be provided for the pupils.\n\nConcerning having the north east corner of the playground filled, I estimate that it will require approximately 300 yards of fill and would cost $1.50 per yard, making a total cost of $450.00.

Standard Paving Limited,\n   Toronto, Ontario ................. $12,633.00\n   (This tender is for a quonset type building.)\n\nThis building will be Plan 886, and as you are aware, an identical school was advertised for at Northwest Bay in the Fort Frances Agency. The lowest tender was $8,500, and I feel that the site is more inaccessible than the Saramook site.\n\nTherefore, I do not feel that I can recommend to you the acceptance of either of these tenders.

Emile Marier, Esq.,\n   Naseby, Ontario ............. $15,000.00\n\n2. Standard Paving Limited,\n   Toronto, Ontario .............. $12,633.00\n   (This tender is for a quonset type building.)\n\nAs you are aware, these tenders were for filling Plan 685. I feel that both these tenders are high. For an identical building advertised for the Northwest Bay Reserve in the Fort Frances Agency, the lowest and the acceptable tender was just $8,500.00. Yet, this site is as inaccessible, if not more so, than Sagamok.\n\nI have discussed this matter at some length with the Director, and it is felt that we might have to reconsider our plan of constructing this school. Would it be feasible to accept a straight labour contract for the erection of this building with all materials purchased as previously by the Departmental Purchasing Agent? You, of course, have had some experience with Mr. Marier and will have your own views concerning this recommendation. However, I do feel, as indicated above, that both these prices are high and that we could not fairly recommend them to the Minister's\nOffice for approval. I will be out of my office for the week of June 13 to 18, but if you wish to call me by long distance on June 20, I would be glad to further discuss this matter with you.\n\nBernard F.

Bethune,\nActing Secretary.\nOttawa, June 21, 1940.\n\n[Signature]\n\nWe have received a request from Mr. Bateman dated June 16 concerning the tender submitted by Mr. E. Varley of Massey, Ontario, for the construction of this building.\n\nTenders were advertised for the erection of this school, and two only were received:\n\n1. Emile Varley, Esq.,\n   Massey, Ontario ........ $15,000.00\n\n2. Standard Irving Limited,\n   Toronto, Ontario .......... $12,633.00\n   (This tender is for a quonset type building.)\n\nThe building plan was No. 868, and we feel that both these tenders are high for this particular type of school. We recently advertised for tenders for a similar building at Northwest Bay in the Fort Frances Agency. The lowest tender was $8,500.00, and yet this site is more isolated than the school.\n\nThe Superintendent of Education would therefore not recommend the acceptance of either of these tenders. A confidential letter was written to Mr. Indian Superintendent Laurance with the suggestion that he approach Mr. Varley concerning the erection of this building on a straight labour contract with\nall materials purchased through the Departmental Purchasing Agent. Mr. Marier erected a school for us at Serpent River on a similar basis last year.\n\nMr. Indian Superintendent Laurence is submitting a report on his meeting with Mr. Marier, following which a further memorandum will be submitted to you.\n\nDirector.\n\nEPM/AM\nLansley, Ont.,\nJune 18/49.\n\nMr. H.P.C. Laurence,\nIndian Agency,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe - School to be built at Sagamock, I would take it on the same plan as the school we built at Cutler. That is, I would supervise the work, but will have to ask a higher price. Would consider $1,500.00 Off this I would supply transportation to work and will also work myself at no extra charge.\n\nWould also take it on salary at foreman's wages, but on this plan I would not supply transportation.\n\nI would also suggest that if it doesn't make any difference with you, I could order material and have all bills sent to you. The reason for this is that Hill-Clark-Francia carry a full supply of building material in Kapapola and would deliver by truck according as we needed. This, however, is only a suggestion and has no importance in regard to the contract.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nEmile Marier.\nCOPY\n\nMassey, Ont.,\nMay 2nd, 1949.\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\nThis is to certify that I have known Mr. Emile Marier as a contractor of various types of buildings, and have found his work very satisfactory and painstaking and have no hesitation in recommending his work to the public.\n\nMr. Marier is also a very reliable citizen of the town of Massey.\n\nMassey Liberal Association,\n[signature] McDonald, President.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nSegamook Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 10th, 1949, file 454-5 (E), I am enclosing letter received from Emile Larier, Esq., Lassay, Ontario, stating that he will supervise the building of the school for $1,500.00. For this amount he would supervise, work himself, and also supply transportation to and from Lassay.\n\nR. P. J. Laurence,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSault Ste.

Marie Superintendent, Federal Electoral District of Algoma East.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Act, we advertised for tenders for the erection of this school. Two bids were received and were as follows:\n\n1. Mills Marier, Massey, Ontario .......... $15,000.00\n2. Standard Paving Limited, Toronto, Ont. 12,633.00\n   (This tender is for a quaint type building).\n\nAs you are aware, these tenders were for building plan 662. We feel that both these tenders are high. For an identical building advertised for the Northwest Bay Reserve, in the Fort Frances Agency, the lowest and the acceptable tender was just $4,300.00. Yet, this site is an inaccessible, if not more so, than Sagamook.\n\nIn view of these two tenders being higher than anticipated, it was decided to reconsider our plan of constructing this school. A letter was written to Mr. Indian Superintendent Lawrence requesting that he approach Mr. Marier concerning the\nerection of this building on a labour basis, with all materials purchased through the Departmental Purchasing Agent. Mr. Marier erected a school for us at Serpent River on a similar basis last year.\n\nPlease find attached a letter from Mr. Marier indicating that he will supervise the construction of this school for $1,500.00. He will supply transportation for himself and will also do carpentry work.\n\nI have also attached a letter from the President of the Massey Liberal Association, which was attached to Mr. Marier's tender. Mr. Marier was unable to pay the necessary amount due to it. It is proved that this letter was in lieu of the usual cheque. You will find a report of mine submitted on June 21, in response to a request from Mr. Bethune dated June 16.\n\nIn conclusion, therefore, I would recommend your approval for the erection of this school on a day labour basis with Mr. X. Marier as foreman-carpenter receiving the lump sum of $1,500.00 for his supervision and labour. All materials will be purchased through the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nDirector.\n\nEmil.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nMurray, Ont.\nMay 2nd, 1949.\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nThis is to certify that I have known Mr. Smith Murray as a contractor of various types of buildings, and have found his work very satisfactory and painstaking, and have no hesitation in recommending his work to the public.\n\nMr. Murray is also a very reliable citizen of the town of Murray.\n\nMurray Liberal Association\np.s.

However there is such a difference between his tender and that of Standard Paving Company, and even more between his tender and the cost of the Fort Francis School, that it would seem advisable to have an estimate of the cost prepared on the basis of prices on the bill of materials, and the estimated cost of the labour that would be involved, before authorising Mr. Marier to go ahead under an arrangement that would involve the payment of $1,500 for his services.\n\nThis office should be informed of whatever action is proposed, as the Minister of External Affairs is interested.\n\nW.

The copy I sent the Central Office must have been lost in the mail. Either copy will supply the information asked. I hope the figures are correct. Will you please return both?\n\nIn an earlier letter I asked for a sanitary water closet to be installed in the school. Please use your influence to have this request granted. No one knows the inconvenience of the outdoor toilets except those who have had the\nexperience of being down with flu\nand having the option to say them or\nan unnecessary and disorderly argument\nMore or less I blame the circumstance\nfor the poor condition of health both\nin winter, for I never entirely got rid of the flu\nand the relapse this fall hit me harder than\nanything I have ever felt.

We have had brought to our attention, the T. Eaton Company Fall and Winter Catalogue, Page 587.\n\nIf you get this catalogue, you will note that they provide a diagram of a sanitary water closet for use where a water pressure system is not available. This reads as follows:\n\n\"Practical sanitation for rural homes, summer cottages, etc., where water system is not available. Provides many of the advantages of outdoor convenience - and is almost as smart in appearance. A pail of water poured into bowl daily keeps toilet in condition. Tank does not require cleaning out - bacterial action breaks down sewage. No chemicals needed - no maintenance costs. Outfit includes 1 steel septic tank 30 inches diameter and 40 inches long; 1 vitreous china toilet bowl with seat and cover; 1 drop tube; 1 airflow ventilator; 1 roof safe, 6 lengths (20 ft.) vent pipe; 1 ceiling collar; 2 adjustable elbow; 1 wall tile floor screws, putty, cement, &c. Installation should be made as shown in inset with septic tank below ground and connected to disposal bed. Outlet pipe and drain tile are not included and should be obtained locally.\"\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Apr. | To freight charges paid on one roll of wrapping paper delivered Sault Ste.

A copy has gone on to Mr. Lawrence. We hope you concur.\n\nMr. Neary this has been the most difficult assignment I have ever had, but thanks to being \"hard-up\" I have had the necessary stick-to-it-iveness to go on, although several times I felt beaten.\n\nRegarding the desks, Mr. Neary, we have had no place for individual material\u2014which makes for much confusion.\n\nBesides my school work I have just completed thirty-five visits to Indian homes. In some cases it was just a social call, in others illness and death. I had one fracture case and one of blood poison to the doctor. The Welfare Dept. should make some provision for transporting patients for treatment. The Indians depend altogether too much on the Missionary for this.\n\nHas there a mistake in my salary rating? According to the bulletin I should receive more.\n\nHoping for favorable consideration, I am respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nJunior Room Requisition\n\nBlackboards\nSlates (please) and full length - one side and one end.\nSmall recesses with doors in window-unders, boards, to hold chalk brushes etc.\n\nWindows:\nDraft boards on every second one.\nVentilation arranged at tops.\nShelf all along windows - used for work in Natural Science.\n\nLibrary:\nIn a nice sort of partition between class-room and cloak-room - from each side wall to cloak-room doors recesses with shelves and doors - used for library.\nBulletin board over these on both sides (ten feet or other wall board).\n\nTable:\nLarge strong homemade or class-room used or - supp. reading; sewing manual training, cooking, lunch and craft work.\nChairs bought for same.\n\nCloak-room:\n(1) Provision made for heating and lighting.\n(2) Wash corner.\n(3) Enclosed shelves for sewing, lunch, manual training, supplies - also, rooms and sewing materials.\nKitchen\n\nIf there is space could there be\nof a small built-in cabinet with a work-table\n(1) a built-in breakfast corner\u2014carpenter makes\ntable and two benches (one partition all around)\n(2) a built-in seat to serve as a wood-box (if\nwood is used)?\n\nBed-room\n\n1.

As the season is now well advanced and the ground frozen, the contractor is of the opinion that it would be advisable to leave this matter over until the spring. I recommend that this be done and that these toilets be installed then.\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\nNovember 30th, 1949.\n\nMr. R.P.G.

The second paragraph of your letter intimates that this is possible, but that it will be more difficult to do so in the new school.\n\nIt is not exactly clear from your letter if the toilet could be installed in the old school without digging a cesspool, etc. Please clarify this point, as we are especially anxious to supply the equipment mentioned in the original school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to Mr. Emile Marier,\nAddress Massey, Ontario.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Nov. | To Progress Payment No. 2 for Mr. Emile Marier,                         | $337.50|\n|      | Contractor at the new Sagamook R.C.

Kindly advise me if it will be in order to obtain about three (3) tons of hard coal for the above mentioned stoves. If this was allowed, it would be possible to keep the classroom fire at night during the cold weather, and the classroom would be warm in the morning. However, before getting the coal, it would be necessary to build a coal shed.\n\nTo build a shed, in keeping with the school, I estimate it would cost about $175.00, $95.00 for material and $80.00 for labour.\n\nFour thousand dollars ($4,000.00) was advanced this office for building this school, and there is approximately $550.00 of this amount remaining.\n\nKindly advise if this money could be used for building a coal shed.\n\nP.P.G.

However, I am not in a position to state, at the present time, if the amount necessary for the purpose will be approved by Parliament at the coming session. It will likely be about the middle of April next, before we will be definitely aware whether sufficient funds to erect the building will be available.\n\nIn the meantime, consideration might be given to the selection of a site, in a locality that would be central to meet the requirements of the Indian children who would attend. The site chosen should be level, dry, permit of good drainage and be approximately one acre in extent. No doubt, the Indians would agree to providing a site, without expense, or at least at little cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J.

As the gentlemen were going two or three times a year from your department to visit the place then chosen for the building, they, the Indians and I, were always under the impression that the Department would fulfill his promise. Few days ago a woman wanted to place her child at Spanish and I told that I could not, but to wait for the school. Then only we were told that there would not be any school. Because... there were not enough children.\n\nI enclose the list of the families and of the children and their age, so that the Department sees how many Indians stay in complete ignorance since so many years. Small schools on a reserve of 25, 25 miles long.\n\nThis list will help you to understand the necessity of a school in that part of the reserve. You will remark the age of these children now schoolable, and many young ones are growing to take the place of the too old ones.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.

However, in the past it has been found impossible to secure the funds necessary for the purpose.

Unfortunately it is impossible to have this building put up at the present time as no money is available in the Estimates for this fiscal year. It is not possible to make a promise at the present time that money will be provided next year, but I can assure you that the matter will be considered along with similar requests from other parts of the country when the Estimates for next year are being compiled.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.F.

Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n19-16-1\n\n[signature]\n\nOttawa, October 28, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is considering in the Estimates for 1938-39, provision for a new one-room Day School on the Rabbit Island section of the Manitoulin Unceded Reserve.\n\nIn order that we may have full information, I would appreciate an early reply to the following questions:\n\n(1) The approximate number of children for which provision should be made.\n\n(2) Is the site available, or will it be necessary to purchase a site? In either event, you should state the size of the site you consider necessary and the general condition of the land, viz: whether level or sloping. You should also mention the direction in which you consider the building should face.\n\n(3) Will it be necessary to provide living quarters for the teacher, in connection with the School?\n\n(4) Can drinking water be easily obtained on the site recommended by you?\n\n(5) Would you recommend construction by contract or by day labour?\n\n(6) Do you consider a full basement advisable?\nWith reference to Departmental Letter No.19-16-1 of the 25th of October last, advising me that the Department is considering in the Estimates for 1938-39 provisions for a new one-room Day School on the Rabbit Island section of the Manitoulin Island Unceded Reserve, and have made request for certain information, I have the honour to report that at the present time there are twenty-eight children in this section. Two years ago there were thirty-nine. On account of there not being a school, members of these families moved out to sections where their children would be able to attend school, but as this is an agricultural section the majority of the families will return to their farms as soon as there is a school in existence. It is my opinion that provision should be made for classroom accommodation for at least thirty-six pupils.\n\nA suitable site for a school building has been obtained, and the Quit Claim Deed filed with the Department, which was acknowledged by Official Letter No.19-16-9 of the 24th of September, 1936. This parcel of land contains one acre, is level and free from stone. If the building is erected on this site it should face the easterly direction.\n\nIt will be necessary to provide living quarters for the teacher, in connection with the school, as there is not an Indian home close to the proposed school who could provide suitable accommodation.\n\nDrinking water can be obtained on this site by digging a well to a depth of twelve to fifteen feet.\n\nI consider that a basement under the teacher's living quarters would provide sufficient cellar room to store vegetables and supplies besides there would be ample space to install a distern. I would recommend that the building be heated with wood stoves instead of a furnace.\n\nI would recommend construction by contract, but Indians to be given employment.\n\nA building similar to the Birch Island combined school and teacher's residence in this Agency would be suitable for the Rabbit Island section. A plan of this building is enclosed.\n\nI enc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, November 9, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Waddle,\n\nIn our Appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39 provision is being made for an amount of $6,000.00 to erect a day school with one classroom and with teacher's living quarters attached, on the Rabbit Island Section of the Manitoulin Unceded Reserve, Province of Ontario. I am bringing this matter to your attention now in order that we may have plenty of time to decide on what is required and in this way we should be able to begin construction as soon as weather conditions permit in 1938.\n\nI would appreciate your submitting a sketch plan for our approval. To assist in preparing the plans, I supply the following information:\n\n1. Classroom should accommodate 40 pupils.\n2. A full basement should be provided.\n3. The question of heating has not yet been definitely settled. I am inclined to prefer a wood furnace, but the agent suggests wood stoves. I am writing further to him in this regard.\n4. The teacher's living quarters should form part of the building.\n5. Our Indian Agent recommends construction by contract but Indians to be given employment.\n6. As soon as you forward me the sketch plan, I will submit it to our Agent for his consideration and will then advise you if we desire any changes to be made.\n7.

If any changes are desired, will you return the plan with various notations covering the changes made thereon. Preparation of more detailed plans can then be proceeded with.\n\nYou will note that during the past year there has been an increase of from 20% to 25% in the cost of building material and the Chief Engineer estimates the cost of the proposed building, with hot air heating and wood burning furnace, at $8,000. It is noted that $6,000 has been included in your Estimates for 1938-39.\n\nIn order that the Engineering and Construction Service will have complete information in preparing a design of this building, I am enclosing herewith two copies of a 'Building Data' form and would be very glad if you would have these completed and return one copy for our records.\n\nDirector.\n1946-1\n\nEX'D.\n\nYour file 1066.\n\nOttawa, December 2, 1937.\n\nDear Sirs-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of November 2nd, with reference to the proposed school on the Rabbit Island section of the Manitoulin Island Unceded Reserve.\n\nIt is noted that you suggest that a basement be placed under the teacher's living quarters only and that the building be heated with wood stoves. The Department favours a full basement as this permits of a room for manual training purposes in the basement. In the event of a furnace being installed, should a wood furnace be secured?\n\nPlease let me have full particulars regarding the best method of shipping materials. Will it be necessary to ship materials by train into Little Current and have them transported from that point to the school. If so, you should advise the distance from Little Current to the site of the proposed school and the cost per day of hiring trucks for transport purposes. Would it be possible to deliver the material by boat and, if so, you should state if it would be feasible to engage a boat at Owen Sound or Midland to transport the material. In this event you should state at what point on the island the material would be landed and the approximate distance of this point from the site of the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I have the honour to report that it all depends on where the material is purchased, as to where it should be shipped. If material is purchased at Sudbury or along the line it would be necessary to ship to Little Current by train, and then truck to Rabbit Island a distance of approx. 40 miles. The heavy trucks for transport are rather expensive as the owners charge at the rate of 15 cents per mile. All material could be procured at Owen Sound and shipped by boat to Manitowaning, which is a distance of fifteen miles from the proposed school site. It would not be necessary to engage a boat at Owen Sound to transport the material, as there are two boats weekly from Owen Sound to Manitowaning and would advise this way of shipping.\n\nIn the event of a furnace being installed, it should be a wood furnace.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department, that on examining the old school building at Wikwemikong recently, I find that there is a large quantity of good sound material in this building that could be utilized in the building of the proposed school at Rabbit Island. The old building could be taken down in the spring by Indian labour at a low cost, and the distance to truck the material from Wikwemikong would be only four miles.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nGeorge A.

Supplies which you state in your letter to Mr. Lewis are being shipped from the Stationery Branch in Ottawa have not yet come to hand and I would appreciate it if they could be sent along at an early date.\n\nI would like to point out that no provision has been made for a water supply for this school. Indications are that the attendance will be fairly heavy and water supply is essential. Would you kindly take this matter up in the proper quarters in order that the necessary work may be undertaken and completed as soon as possible. At present I am carrying drinking water from a well at a farm house and which involves a round trip of about one half mile and am getting water for other purposes from a creek near the school. As Mr. Lewis appears to have a great many things to attend to and it may be some time before he has an opportunity to get out here and give the chance to take up the matter of a well with him I thought that the mention of this matter here might speed up the provision of a suitable water supply before the cold weather sets in. From all indications it would appear that a well could be dug and a suitable platform and pump installed at a very reasonable cost.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher.\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the teacher of the Rabbit Island Indian Day School in which she points out that no provision has been made for a water supply. She further advises that from inquiries she has made she considers that a well could be dug at a reasonable cost.\n\nI should appreciate hearing from you in regard to this matter immediately. If the teacher's suggestion is feasible the Department would be prepared to favourably consider authorizing the digging of a well before the cold weather sets in provided that it can be done at a reasonable cost and you consider that there is a likelihood of obtaining water.\n\nThe school desks were ordered from the Vilas Furniture Company, Comancheville, Que., on September 21. They will be shipped to you at Little Current. If the desks have not yet arrived you should communicate with the freight agent at that point and request him to notify you when the desks arrive in order that you can arrange for immediate acceptance of the shipment and place the desks in the school.\n\nThe school supplies will also be forwarded to Little Current addressed to you. These supplies are leaving Ottawa today and as soon as they reach Little Current you should arrange for their delivery to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. J.

It has seating capacity for 31, with 22 pupils on the roll. The classroom is bright and airy. The only criticism I have to offer is the total lack of built-in cupboards or shelves in the classroom and kitchen. A good sized cupboard, with shelves, and padlock, will have to be provided for the classroom supplies. A kitchen cabinet has already been delivered at a cost of $26.00. There is no kitchen sink, a tin basin on an up-ended orange box is the only substitute.\n\nThos.

About $5.00 for labour should cover this.\n\nThe entrance platforms and steps should also be painted and the floors oiled in classroom. This work was authorized last year, but was too wet for the outside work by the time the painters got around to it.\n\nThe furnace pipes also need some repairs, and the teacher asked to have an approach to the two outside toilets. This could be made of lattice work and painted, which would have a good appearance, but personally I do not see that it will serve any useful purpose, and I am unable at present to give a very accurate estimate, as I presume the funds are not available.\n\nThe other work is quite urgent and should not cost over $25.00 for labour. A requisition for the material is enclosed herewith.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nORJ / JH\nOttawa,\nSeptember 11, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Rabbit Island School\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant and to state that you are authorized to proceed with the repairs that appear to be necessary to the above-noted school.

R. Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 14th instant, in which you recommend the purchase of a piano, at an approximate cost of $100.00, for the Rabbit Island Indian Day School.\n\nI cannot remember the purchase of a piano or an organ for an Indian day school at any time, anywhere, since I entered the Department, 7 years ago. I have, however, at the time of my visits to a number of Indian day schools, noticed organs and pianos in use. The pianos, in every case I was informed, were purchased with funds usually collected by the teacher from Christmas concerts, special lectures, etc.\n\nIn view of the fact that no provision has been made in the estimates of this year for the expenditure of an additional $100.00 at the Rabbit Island School, I have been wondering if it would be possible to interest the local people, particularly the Indians, in the purchase of this instrument. We are naturally anxious to do everything humanly possible to satisfy our teachers, but the funds at our disposal during this critical period are very limited. You might write to us again with respect to this matter.\n\nR. A. Rossy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nLittle Current, Ont., August 31st, 1942\n\nL. A.

Her discipline is good and the children are progressing fairly well. However, I get the impression that she has been getting by with a minimum of effort for the last few years. I drew to her attention the need for trying new methods and of maintaining the interest of her students. At the present time her teaching is rather mechanical.\n\nTRACK, RACK AND SCHOOL\n\nThis is a very good building, approximately 10 years old. The teacher's quarters are very good and attached to the school-room in the usual way. There is one bedroom upstairs and a living room and kitchen down stairs. There is no Hydro or running water and the school is rather isolated. It is the most isolated school on Manitoulin, in fact.\n\nThere is a full cement basement with plenty of light. It would be ideal for a manual training instructor. There is a good furnace and the school is warm and comfortable. The classroom is well lighted, with five windows on one side and one on the other.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to Ambrose Corbiere,\nAddress Wikwemikong, Ontario.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| July 17 | 5 hours labour @ 60\u00a2 repairing broken windows and railings at Rabbit Island Indian Day School (Emergency repairs) | $3.00 |\n\n(Allotment No. 516-19-113)\n\nTraining Division\n\nJUL 27 1948\n\nIndian Affairs Div.\n\nI certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

In this connection it is noted that the school was closed from March 31, 1909, to January 1, 1910, a period of nine months, when it was apparently re-opened by Mr. Spence.\n\nThe Department would like to know by whose authority the school was closed and re-opened, as well as the reason for closing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. Wright, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 13th instant,\n\nNo. 259947/1, relative to the Seine River Indian Day School, in reply I beg to state that there are only six families that reside on the reserve near the school, and as they all left the reserve in April last for their spring hunt, and took their families with them, the teacher Peter Spence came home, and as none of these Indians returned to their homes, to remain any length of time until late in the fall, the teacher did not reopen the school until January last.\n\nOwing to their nomadic mode of living, it is difficult to get any regular attendance in these day schools, and it was by my authority that the teacher reopened the school in January last, at the request of the Indians.\n\nMr. Spence, who is a treaty Indian, and belongs to the Little Forks band, has done good work in this school, although he has been badly handicapped by losing one or two quarters during each year he has been teaching there. I have at different times warned these Indians that the Department would probably close their school, if they did not keep up a better attendance.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 22, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in reference to the re-opening of the Seine River school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the explanation that this action was taken on your authority is quite satisfactory to the Department, but in future all such matters should first receive approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. Wright, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nExtract from letter of Indian Agent J. P. Wright of the 27th October, 1910, - original on File 116759/1:\n\n\"CXIII\n\nThe Chief of the Sein River band has just been here and states that they want the school reopened, as those that lived on the reserve were all back for the winter.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. P.

There are four windows 12 x 28 with two panes broken. There are ten desks, lesson cards, copy books and reading books and slates all in good preservation. The chief does not allow the Indians to enter the school and everything is kept locked in the hope that the school may be re-opened at some time. I examined the writing in the copy books and found it good. The chief deplored the fact that the children were running wild without training of any sort.\n\nSgd.

If the Dept. will furnish lumber, shingles, doors and windows, they will build a good sized School House and do the work, they seem to be very anxious to have the children educated, and I would very strongly recommend that the Department take some steps to get them to go to School, as I think that it is a shame to have so many children grow up in ignorance and not be able to either read write or talk English, through our neglect, they have been talking about a School for a number of years, but never demanded one till this year, so I would recommend that the Dept. do something regard to a School for them when there are so many children without any learning at all.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to the establishment of a school for the children of the Seine River Band.\n\nIn reply I have to say that it is regretted we have no funds available at the present time to commence a school at this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

I would suggest that, in preparing your estimates you will give full particulars concerning type and size of building recommended by you.
