Theo. White, Minister of the Interior, commented briefly of the principle of representation of the territories in the Canadian Parliament. This will be a large measure of responsible government, and if the number of members given is in proportion to the vastness of the territory and the interests to be represented, we will have no cause for complaint if our Dominion affairs are concerned. But the popular eye seems to be far from full responsibility in the administration of our local matters. Though this may be very well in theory, it would be well to make haste slowly in respect to provincial government, if it is to cost the people of the Northwest in the same proportion as it does those of Manitoba. Rather than impose a burdensome taxation imposed on the people of that province, it would be better to require us for some little time at least. In seeing this matter, we do wish to be convinced of the propriety of considering such a responsible administration of our local affairs. We should profit by the experience of our eastern neighbor, and hesitate before imposing upon ourselves burdens which they can easily bear. We have now a very simple system of municipal government, and we think that a scheme of provincial administration should be devised that would be as inexpensive and simple as possible. In this case, too, the same thing directly responsible to the people. There has already been some discussion on this subject amongst the press and people of the territories, and the question should not be left for the future, but should be settled through sufficiency or any other cause. The agitation should be kept up and practical proposals offered. It is not enough merely to demand provincial self-government, which many can state their desire about. In the future, the appointment of a Cabinet, and the removal of the Lieutenant-Governor from the active administration of affairs. The people should be educated into the idea that the terms interpellation and recall will cause them to again of the representatives, they also the inaugurations of an efficient and simple administration whose chief object will be the welfare of the people. It is not less than their own responsibilities, and the people are very anxious members of the drawing of a larger salutes as the Northwest Council. Mr. Jack, when first instituted its composition, was a member of the School Act. The Collector of Customs at the head of the department should be eliminated and the number of Port of Winnipeg by local representatives increased in proportion to the population. The present arrangement provides for the establishment of a government for the provinces on the basis of the federal system. This, we think, would lead to confusion ultimately, unless the provinces be retained as one province for all purposes. Even then it would be undesirable to allow the separate laws that would be suitable in one portion of this vast region would be unsuitable in another part. It would be preferable that each territory should have its own legislation, and that the legislature be elected by the people of the district that they can bear the burden. Meanwhile let us make the most of our Territorial Council; increase our electoral strength in future elections, and bring all possible influence to bear on the Dominion Government to increase its administrative powers, and hence largely control the one-power which seems so objectionable. We shall follow up this subject further in future issues.\n\nThe N.W. CENTRAL RY. CO.\n\nThough the charter of the North-West Central Railway Company has lapsed, it would seem that in their interest at least, they will continue to operate under the old name. From a private source, we learn that Mr. Beatty, the President of the Company, says that the road will be opened in August by July. To accomplish this, a new charter has been obtained, and it is to be hoped that this company will succeed in carrying forward their project. With their starting point being Edmonton, running northward to Calgary and the Elbow River, they will extend their line north of the 50th parallel. When completed, it will open up a magnificent portion of the Northwest, and will be a great boon to the settlers along the prairie. We have heard that the Hon. Mr. White, the Minister of the Interior, was making a tour of the country around Fort Qu'Appelle, he referred to the North-West Central Railway Company, and said that their line would be opened in August. He said that the road would succeed in opening the money to be spent on the road. In the interest of the settlers all along the line, he said, it was desirable that the Government should take over the road and put it into operation. He said that the road would be opened in August, and that the settlers would benefit by it.\nOUR TERMS.\n\nWe have placed our yearly subscription at the low rate of ONE DOLLAR, with the object of enforcing advance payment.

The clock chimed at just the right moment, but nothing out of the ordinary was heard by them.\n\nMiss Lilburne had been engaged to Mr. Eyre for some time, and she was very anxious to meet him on this occasion. She had heard many stories about him from her friends, and was eager to put them to the test.\n\nOn this particular Christmas Eve, Miss Lilburne and Mr. Eyre were both in high spirits. They had planned to spend the evening together, and were looking forward to it with great anticipation.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, they heard a loud noise coming from the next street. It seemed to be a group of people shouting and cheering. Mr. Eyre suggested that they go out and see what was going on. Miss Lilburne agreed, and they decided to investigate.\n\nThey soon found themselves at the scene of a public demonstration. A crowd had gathered outside a local theater, and were cheering wildly for someone. Mr. Eyre recognized the person being cheered, and realized that it was a famous actor named Mr. Harley.\n\nMiss Lilburne was delighted to see Mr. Harley, and was eager to meet him. She approached him and introduced herself, and he responded with a warm smile.\n\nMiss Lilburne and Mr. Harley spent the rest of the evening talking and laughing. They exchanged addresses and made plans to meet up again soon.\n\nAs they walked back home, Miss Lilburne couldn't help but feel grateful for this unexpected turn of events. She had never seen anything like it before, and was sure that it would be memorable.\n\nWhether you believe in ghosts or not, these stories always seem to get our attention and make us wonder. They always seem to have something mysterious about them, even if it's just the setting itself.\n\nBut perhaps these stories are just that \u2014 stories. Maybe they're just meant to amuse us and keep us entertained. Who knows? But one thing is for sure: we'll never forget them.\nA PARISIAN MYSTERY.\n\nAn Affair Which Troubled the Paris Police.\n\nThe Singular Circumstances, the Accounting For Which Filled All the Criminal Experts in France\u2014Seeking for Information.\n\n(From London Journal.)\n\nParis, where Edward King from Paris, is still one of my most valued friends, and where I have been engaged in the most intimate business relations with him for many years, has recently been visited by a mysterious and dangerous-looking band of criminals. They came to Paris in the early part of last month, and have been seen frequently about the streets, particularly near the opera house. They are said to be connected with the infamous gang of thieves who have been active in Paris for the past few weeks.\n\nThe police have been unable to trace these criminals, and they have disappeared without a trace. It is feared that they may be involved in some serious crime, and the authorities are anxious to find out more about them.\n\nTHE MANITOBA WEEKLY FREE PRESS.\n\nTHE MONARCH OF THE WEEKLIES.\n\n14th YEAR OF PUBLICATION.\n\nCAMPAIGN 1885-1886.\n\nMagnificent Prizes and Grand Prize Scheme.\n\nOver $1,000 worth of handsome prizes to be given away.\n\n150 Splendid Prizes.\n\nBalance of 1886 Press.
