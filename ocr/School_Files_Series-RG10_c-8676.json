C. Dunfield & Company of Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, together with specifications of a heating plant, which Mr. H. C. Dunfield contends will suitably heat the school and basement. He has given careful and concise information in the letter and the plan and I believe that it should be considered by the Land & Development Services Branch. The quotation of $1480.00 installed seems rather high, but I have had some considerable contact with Mr. H. C. Dunfield in past years and I find that his work when completed is beyond criticism, and that any heating job which he installs will do everything expected of it.\n\nOn the assumption that a suitable tender will be received from Mr. Lindfors for the erection of the building, I would recommend that the tender of H. C. Dunfield be accepted for the heating plant.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Dunfield asks that the enclosed plan and all material relating thereto be returned to him after it has served its purpose, as he has only the one copy.\n\nJ.

These are spring operated and require no electric current and have proved satisfactory in the past.\n\nRegularity and efficiency in the care of firing operations has a most decided effect on the results obtained from hand fired furnaces.\n\nThe price for this complete installation, left ready to fire, would be $1480.00, Fourteen Hundred and Eighty Dollars, providing it can be done while the roads and weather permit.\n\nAfter you have examined the enclosed plan, please return all material to me as soon as possible as I have only one copy.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) H.

The Department does not approve cold air ducts below the basement floor. The drop in temperature will be so great that we fear it will impair the efficiency of the furnace. Besides, there is a danger that rubbish may collect in them.\n\nWe realize that the cold air from the basement will be difficult to install above the floor. We think that this can be done along the wall on the floor. In no case should the cold air from the classrooms pass under the basement floor.\n\nIn addition, the cold air in the classrooms must not draw from below the hot air, but from the other end of the room. This will require a duct along the beam on the ceiling and will require more material and possibly cost slightly more.\nBefore considering Mr. Lidfor's tender, we would like to know if the suggestions that we have made above will increase the amount of the tender.\n\nAs soon as we receive your reply, the matter will be submitted to the Minister for approval.\n\nBernard F.

Sept. 18, 1948.\n\nMr. J. P. B. Ostrander,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th Sept. with a copy of Mr. Neary's letter of the 13th, re heating of the proposed Thunderchild Reserve School.\n\nFor your own information I would like to say that two years ago I installed a heating system in a school of four rooms, 2 upstairs and 2 in the basement.\n\nThe only feasible method of returning the air from the basement rooms to the furnace was through sub floor ducts, which I used. The installation is quite satisfactory.\n\nIn the early days of warm air heating this was general practice, particularly when all supply air was brought in from outside. In the colder climates heating outside air proved expensive, less outside air was introduced and more air from the building was recirculated, still using sub floor returns to a large extent, but as the indoor air recirculated, is almost always from floors above the furnace room, it was found much cheaper to drop the returns alongside of the furnace and enter the casing above the floor level.\n\nA warm air heating system is very feasible and will give good results at efficiencies much below what might be considered par, if the basic factors are kept in balance. For instance heat radiated from the firepot will enter the cold air shoe, if it is too high on the casing, raise the temperature of the return air and lower the efficiency of the circulating system somewhat. This need not be but it could be serious if overdone.\n\nHeat flows through practically all materials where there is a temperature differential between the two sides of the barrier, thus heat is flowing constantly through the basement floor to the ground below, raising its temp. Recent tests in the Research Dept. of the University of Illinois show that for heated basement rooms, the temperature of the ground beneath a concrete floor, laid on the ground, and more than 5 ft. from the outside wall, remains nearly constant and but little colder than the surface temperature of the floor.\n\nUnder the above conditions, sub-floor return ducts would, very probably, maintain more even temperature than would ducts in many other places.\n\nThe only motive force available, in a gravity warm air system,\nto circulate air, is the difference in weight between outgoing and return air. This difference is not great, at best. To obtain the maximum results, resistance to the easy flow of air should be reduced to the minimum. Air will flow more easily through the room area than it will through a duct. Therefore, I use the shortest possible way for both leader pipes and return air ducts.\n\nIn the case in question the return air can be brought from the upper class rooms to the furnace room and dropped down alongside the furnace to enter the casing at floor level.\n\nThe only way in which air can be returned from the basement rooms to the furnace is by a duct on top of the furnace room floor, which would be a constant source of irritation, or by using a sub floor return, which is thoroughly practicable and efficient.\n\nI would like to have a decision on this point also, whether coal or wood is to be the main fuel. Large wood-burning furnaces are in very short supply, particularly those that may be converted from wood burners to coal burners.\n\nRegarding the placement of cold air registers on the opposite side of the room to inlet register\n\nTheoretically this is correct, on the warm air side, circulation effect takes a heating due to the added resistance in length of run and more bends. In fan heating or forced air work this added resistance can be easily estimated and taken care of but in gravity systems you start with a given maximum motive force. It cannot be increased. It can only be conserved.\n\nI find that I have run well into a discourse on a heating, which probably will be of value to me only, in restating for my own benefits, values that I might otherwise lose sight of.\n\nWhat I really started out to say was:\n\n(1) Is coal or wood to be the main fuel?\n(2) Will sub floor return ducts from basement rooms be acceptable?\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) H.

When our Educational Survey Officer visited this reserve in the late spring, he found that the number of children enrolled at the present school or attending residential schools was such that we should build a two-room and not a one-room school, as previously planned.\n\nHe found that the present teacherage was in good condition but that the school building was in need of immediate replacement. Therefore, we have already had approved by the Minister, the sum necessary to build an addition to the present teacherage so that it will accommodate both teachers required.\n\nOur Regional Supervisor for Saskatchewan has now been able to obtain a satisfactory tender for the erection of a two-room school (without teachers' residence). Our experience elsewhere with the building of similar schools has been such that we feel it is indeed a reasonable tender and one which we can recommend for acceptance. You will note that it is submitted by Olof Lidfors of Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, who has also submitted a tender for the erection of a one-room day school and attached residence on the Meadow Lake Reserve. This latter tender is now before the Governor General in Council for consideration. Mr. Ostrander has advised as follows concerning having Mr. Lidfors erect both these schools:\n\n\"I have to say that Mr. Lidfors intends to have both buildings under erection at the same time, if both are...\"\nauthorized, and he will personally supervise the construction of both buildings.\n\n\"Certainly I am anxious to have the Meadow Lake Indian Day School erected first for certain well known reasons, but both buildings require a considerable amount of excavation and concrete work which must be done before severely cold weather, if done at all during the fiscal year.\n\n\"It is my recommendation that this part of the work be completed on both buildings at the earliest possible date, after which I would have Mr. Lidfora proceed with the completion of the Meadow Lake school with as many men as possible until it is ready for occupancy.

Therefore, we have already had approved by the Minister, the sum necessary to build an addition to the present teacherage so that it will accommodate both teachers required.\n\nOur Regional Supervisor for Saskatchewan has now been able to obtain a satisfactory tender for the erection of a two-room school (without teachers' residence). Our experience elsewhere with the building of similar schools has been such that we feel it is indeed a reasonable tender and one which we can recommend for acceptance. You will note that it is submitted by Olof Lidfors of Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, who has also submitted a tender for the erection of a one-room day school and attached residence on the Meadow Lake Reserve. This latter tender is now before the Governor General in Council for consideration. Mr. Ostrander has advised as follows concerning having Mr. Lidfors erect both these schools:\n\n\"I have to say that Mr. Lidfors intends to have both buildings under erection at the same time, if both are...\"\nauthorized, and he will personally supervise the construction of both buildings.\n\n\"Certainly I am anxious to have the Meadow Lake Indian Day School erected first for certain well known reasons, but both buildings require a considerable amount of excavation and concrete work which must be done before severely cold weather, if done at all during the fiscal year.\n\n\"It is my recommendation that this part of the work be completed on both buildings at the earliest possible date, after which I would have Mr. Lidforss proceed with the completion of the Meadow Lake school with as many men as possible until it is ready for occupancy. Completion of the Thunderchild school would proceed after the Meadow Lake school.\"\n\nI would recommend that the attached submission to Council be approved and forwarded for necessary action.\n\nRecommendation forwarded to Council Oct. 1/48 J.M.\n\nActing Director.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa September 29, 1948.\n\nMr. J.F.B.

Halpin.\n\nIn charge.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit a copy of an application for the establishment of a Day School on White Bear's Reserve, Moose Mountain Agency, which speaks for itself, and I beg to recommend that a salary be allowed for the teacher; nothing being provided for this purpose in the Estimates this might either be charged against the General Vote or provision made in the supplementary estimates. As will be seen there will be no expense in connection with the building, not just now at least.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAs Mr. Halpin in his letter hereunder says that the Deputy Minister when recently on White Bear Reserve promised that a school should be opened there, I presume this application might be submitted without comment.\n\nThis matter must stand until it is determined whether the reserve will move to the east.\n\nH.B.

David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOTTAWA, 28th May, 1900\n\nSir,\n\nIt is noticed that Mr Agent Halpin, in his annual report, states that when the Deputy Supt. General visited the White Bear Reserve in the fall of 1898, the Indians asked him for a school and that he promised to do what he could for them.\n\nIn December '98 you transmitted a copy of an application for a day school on White Bear's Reserve made by the Agent, which was exactly similar to the paragraph above referred to on \"Education\", in reply to which you were informed that the matter must stand until it was decided whether the Indians would move to the East.\n\nThe Department would like to be informed as to whether Mr Agent Halpin was informed to the above effect; and if so, why he made these remarks in his report, which was dated in July of the following year.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He called at the office last February when it was ascertained that the chances of a fair attendance would be slim, and the matter was therefore dropped. Rev. Mr. Dobbs, in charge of the interests of the Presbyterian Church at that point, was informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nMr. H.R. Halpin, farmer in charge of the Moose Mountain Agency, in his report to the 30th June last makes the following statement in regard to White Bear's Band, No.70.\n\nEducation.\u2014There are twenty-four children of school age on the reserve, seven of whom are attending the Industrial Schools at Qu'Appelle or Elkhorn.\n\nThe Indians are anxious for a day school on the reserve, and I am of the opinion that it would be a good thing for the children, most of them being too scrofulous to be allowed to enter an Industrial School.\n\nI have struck out the second paragraph as being unsuitable for publication in the annual report. It may, however, deserve attention.\nOttawa, 28th September, 1900.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn reference to that portion of your annual report dealing with education, I beg to inform you that the Indian Commissioner, who was written to on the subject of the proposed establishment of a school on White Bear's Reserve, states that the matter was allowed to drop after consultation with the Rev. Mr. Dobbs, who is in charge of the interests of the Presbyterian Church at that point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nH. R. Halpin, Esq.,\nFarmer in charge,\nCannington Manor,\nAlta.\nSir, I have the honour to ask permission to use a portion of vote 7 for the purpose of buying two soft water tanks and some piping for the roof. The school children have to drink slough water or else go to the mission for drinking water which is soft water caught in tanks. The cost of the tanks would be $8 and the piping fifteen cts. It would be a great convenience to both teacher and scholars.\n\nI Have The Honour To Be\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, 28th April, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a letter of the 13th instant which the Department has received from Agent Cory in which he asks for permission to incur expenditure in the purchase of two sort water tanks etc., for the Indian school in his Agency. When you visit the Agency you should look into the matter and if you consider the expenditure referred necessary you may authorize the same. I may add that the Department has allowed $25.00 for finishing the porch and making sundry repairs to the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nInap.of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nReferring to your letter of 13th April, 1907,\n\nNo. F/14, in which I asked permission to expend a portion of the amount of money for Vote 7, in purchasing two water tanks, and the necessary roof piping for the purpose of having a supply of drinking water for the pupils of white Bear School, I have the honour to again ask if this permission will be granted.\n\nThe estimated cost would be as follows:-\n2 water tanks @ $4.00 each, $8.00 and 80 ft. more or less of roof piping @ 15\u00a2 per foot, $12.00 making a total of $20.00. There is an un-expended balance at the present time of $18.37 in connection with Vote 7.\n\nWith reference to the above, I might say that the Teacher, Miss E. M. Armstrong laid the matter before Mr. Inspector Graham, and received his approval.\n\nTrusting that the permission for the above expenditure will be granted as it is very necessary that there should be a plentiful supply of good drinking water for the children,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nTo,\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExo.\n\nOttawa, 1st April, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th ultimo, I beg to say that the Department approves of an expenditure of $30.00, as therein estimated for, being incurred in making arrangements for a proper supply of drinking water at White Bear Indian School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has decided to increase the salaries of the teachers at the Mistawasis and the White Bear Indian day schools from $300 to $400 per annum as a recognition of their successful services.\n\nThis increase will date from the 1st prox. and the teachers have been notified accordingly.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R.F. MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary Foreign Mission Committee\nof the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nMr. L. D.

Please accept the thanks of our Committee for this action which is much appreciated by us but will be more appreciated by the teachers themselves.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRPM/MBA.\nOttawa, March 23, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the salary of Miss Armstrong, teacher of the White Bear Indian day school has been increased to $400.00 per annum, to take effect from the 1st.\n\nyour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nThomas Cory, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nI have much pleasure in acknowledging the receipt of your letter No. 178701/1.\n\nI appreciate highly your kind expression regarding the standing of the White Bear School. For the monetary recognition of our success, I also thank you.\n\nI am pleased to send you the following report of our school work, and also of work among the Indians on the Reserve.\n\nSteady progress has been made in the school, especially during the last year. All the children of school are on the Reserve, except three, are enrolled. The diseased condition of these three prevents their admission to the school at present. The average daily attendance for the present quarter is 16.37.\n\nOwing to extremely cold weather during the first month of the term the attendance was not very high but since the first of February the average is over 19.\n\nA pleasing feature is the improvement in punctuality, there being now only two or three families from which children come late to school. But even these cases are improving.\n\nIn cleanliness and neatness in appearance also there is a very marked improvement. These facts alone indicate an improvement in the home atmosphere. But in improved deportment and in attention to work, in cheerful obedience and in the happy confidence of even the youngest pupil, we read the place the school holds in the opinion of the parents.\n\nThe school atmosphere is very evidently effecting the home life of the Indians and it is my very earnest desire to the\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nbest of my ability to further the purpose of the Department in placing this school here, that it may be a lasting benefit to the Indian people.\n\nI do not think the present condition of our school is the result of any special method of work. I think it is rather the result of a happy combination of circumstances.\n\nWhen we remember how slowly the Indian mind adopts new ideas, we are not surprised that the very earnest efforts of past years are only now being felt. But that these efforts have helped to bring about our present condition, I am sure.\n\nAgain, we have been provided with a comfortable, commodious school building; we are supplied with all necessary apparatus for carrying on our work comfortably; we have a wise law requiring the Indian parents to place their children under instruction, and we have an Indian Agent who is firm, yet kind and tactful, in carrying out the law.\n\nIn the school room I have simply done the part of a teacher.\n\nThe discipline is good, yet it is maintained with very little effort, when once the relative positions of teacher, pupils and parents are recognized. There is careful attention to detail. Every child is expected to do his best, and only the best is taken, though it may be far below the standard of perfection. The interest of the pupils is readily gained by being interested in whatever interests them, and where the confidence of the children is given, the parents hearts soon follow.\n\nBy choosing lessons within the comprehension of the children, their interest in the school work is maintained and they work with a will. There is nothing more than this.\n\nOf punishments there is nothing more than placing a naughty child in a corner of the room, and letting him feel that he has disgraced himself. Only on two or three occasions in the three years that I have been in charge of this school have I needed to use corporal punishment, and then one clap\nThe Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nwas sufficient. But both parents and children know that discipline will be maintained at any costs.\n\nThere are very few rewards in the way of prizes. Occasionally a small prize is offered for the highest attendance in the quarter, but it is not sufficient to induce a child to come to school if he or his parents wish to go on a visit somewhere. The children are given a cup of tea with their biscuit at noon. It gives the school a homely feeling and may help a little. Then when leaving school in the evening any hungry child may have another biscuit to eat as he runs home.\n\nI have carefully avoided any course which would lead the parents to think that I was receiving benefit by the children being in school and would tolerate any caprice on their part or on the part of their children, rather than lose them. And further, I have put as much responsibility on the parents themselves as possible.\n\nIn the case of an incorrigible girl, I dismissed her from the school. When the father found that her persistent disobedience brought her punishment, he at once undertook disciplining his other children who were in the school. The matter spread among the Indians and there was an awakening as to their duty of teaching their children obedience.\n\nThe parents were then asked to supply firewood free of cost for the school. Only once have I needed to close the school for want of wood. The school was closed three days but I did not reopen until the wood was brought. This winter we went a step farther. The Assiniboine lived so far from the school as to make regular attendance impossible for their children. We suggested that the parents go together, bring logs and build a house near the school-house, and that all the Assiniboine children be placed in charge of an Indian and his wife. They promptly agreed to the proposal and the children have been comfortably in school without any risk of frost-bites.\n\nI think that by placing some responsibility upon the parents in this way, their interest has been aroused, the school has become a very real thing to them and it is slowly but surely...\nThe Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nhelping them upward.\n\nMy work among the Indians on the reserve is chiefly helping to care for the sick. To see that the doctor's directions are carried out. Helping to induce the women to keep their homes and children clean. Visiting the school children in their homes so as to keep in touch with them and their parents.\n\nThere is a discouragingly large amount of work to be done on the Reserve. I can touch only the outside of it. My visits can be made only on Saturdays or after four o'clock on school days.\n\nBut we have been able to accomplish something. There is more willingness to use civilized methods in treating diseases and there are some genuine efforts to keep houses and children clean.\n\nSome of the women are becoming quite clever at making clothes for their children from cast-off clothing of older people, and they very willingly make up clothing that I cut and send to them for the school children.\n\nA very earnest effort is being made to correct old and harmful practices as the marriage of very young girls, practically children; the putting away of one wife and taking another or the taking of two at once and other domestic irregularities. Some success has attended the efforts in these respects. But something more than \"moral suasion\" is necessary. Here again the law is firmly administered and there is very good reason to believe that as the Indian men and women are taught to respect their marriage relations, they will rise in self respect and their homes will improve.\n\nI would like to express to you my gratitude for the help and sympathy I receive in my work from the Agency Staff. In every way possible my little efforts are furthered by Agent, Farmer, Clerk and Doctor. Under these circumstances we may hope for progress in this band of Indians.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 24th., 1909.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your interesting report of the 23rd. of March, dealing with the work of the Day School on White Bear's Indian Reserve.\n\nIt is observed that you have established what might be called a lodging annex to the Day School, and the Department is interested to know how this Division of the work has been conducted during the winter. Would you kindly state the size of the building and what is the sleeping accommodation for the children. Who provided the blankets and bedding, and the necessary food; and if there was any cash outlay for the latter item, what was it and who supplied the funds? Was anything paid to the Indian and his wife who took charge of the children. Were they in residence continuously during the winter, or only during school days? Are any children from this Reserve in attendance at any of the Boarding or Industrial Schools?\n\nThe Department shares your conviction that some responsibility should be thrown upon the parents. At the same time some assistance might be given to make this portion of the work more successful without leaving the Indians to depend too largely upon extraneous aid. You say nothing about your own living accommodation. Where do you reside, and how far from the School?\n\nIn connection with the project for an improved Day School the Department has suggested the appointment of nurses who could make\n\nMiss E.

(RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nhouse-to-house visitations etc. As you state that there is a large amount of work to be done on the Reserve and that you can only touch the outside of it, would it be possible to associate any person with you to advantage; and if so, how could the work be divided, and what would be the nature of the assistance to be given. Would it be possible to have a small garden at the School and could the food at the mid-day meal be rendered more palatable and varied?\n\nYour report has been found very interesting and you may be assured of the sympathy of the Department in making a success of the Day School under your charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 24th April No. 178701 regarding lodging arrangements for the Assiniboine children, and its maintenance, I beg to say:\n\n(1) The building, 18 ft x 15 ft, is of logs, with an earth roof. There are two windows, one of four 12 in. x 14 in. lights, towards the south. The other, of two 12 x 14 lights, is towards the west. There is a good lumber floor, and the building is lime washed within and without.\n\nOne end of the building is occupied by the beds of the children, which are made similar to berths in a steamer. There are three of these, and they are separated from the living room.\nby a cotton curtain run on a stout wire. A bedstead is in the outer room, which is used by the Indian and his wife.\n\nThe berths are supplied with ticks filled with straw, which is renewed when necessary. The ticking was supplied by the Indian Department through the Indian Agent's Corp., as was also the material for the curtains. A blanket for each bed was also loaned from the store-house. The quilts, sheets and pillows, cases and towels were supplied by the mission. The parents supplied feather pillows.\n\nThe living-room is furnished with a good strong table and two strong benches. There is a small cooking-stone (the property of the Indians) and during the winter a box-stove for keeping fire at night was provided by the mission store-house.\n\nThe Indians' parents bring the firewood, and they take the children's clothes to wash on Saturdays.\nThe Indians and his wife, and the children attending the school from this house, get rations from the store house. All the children take the noon meal in the school-house. This meal is either biscuits and tea or biscuits and boiled rice. The biscuits and rice are provided by the Department. The tea and sugar by myself. I also prepare the noon meal. There is nothing paid to the Indian and his wife besides their rations.\n\nThey frequently spend the week end among their friends, leaving Saturday noon and returning Sunday evening. But often they find it convenient to remain at this end of the Reserve for several weeks at a time. The parents of the children come for them Friday afternoons and bring them back on Sunday, when they come for service or on Monday morning.\n\nThere are six children from this Reserve in the Ju'Apple Industrial School, and one at Regina Industrial School.\nSince the removal of the Rev. Mr. Hodges to the charge of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, I have had charge of the Evangelistic work here; and for better convenience in carrying on that work, I moved into the mission house. Up to that time I found a house with the Agent's family and, later, with the Farmer's. The mission house is a comfortable, six-roomed house with mission hall attached.\n\nIt is situated about 100 yards from the school house. There is a comfortable little frame stable and a good sized storehouse. I also cultivate the garden. The children's house is about 50 yards from the mission house.\n\nThe suggestion to appoint an assistant for this work is most kind. I thank you indeed. I feel that if the right person be sent we will be able to overtake all the work, and in a way that will give good results.\nThe work might be divided in this way: One take charge of the school and mission. The other have the care of the homes. This would mean a very practical knowledge of housekeeping\u2014of bread making, cooking, washing, sewing, mending, cutting out garments, knitting; nursing the sick under most unfavorable circumstances. Indeed it seems to me a woman must be made especially to be successful in this work. Since our school has filled up I find it almost impossible for me to give the girls the instruction they need in sewing and knitting, in darnimg & mending their clothes. An assistant could help me out much in these matters.\n\nWe are having this year a small piece of ground broken near the school house for a garden for the children. We thought of allowing the children to take home the produce.\nof their little plot; but under the assistants' care the children could enjoy their vegetables at the noon meal. A bowl of warm vegetable soup at noon with their biscuit would certainly be appreciated, and the fact that they had raised these vegetables themselves would give it just the flavor that they need.\n\nI thank you indeed, for your sympathy in our work here, and I trust that the future may show good results among these people.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

Sir,-\n\nIn view of the favourable reports received in regard to Miss Armstrong, teacher of the White Bear Indian day school, her salary was increased to $400.00, as you were advised in March, last.\n\nTo enable her to continue her good work on the reserve it is considered that it would be well to give her an assistant. The Department knows of no place where a better training for an Indian worker could be had, and it would be glad if your Church would endeavour to secure the services of a capable young woman to act in this capacity. The Department would be willing to pay an initial salary of $300 a year and until other arrangements are made it is thought she might live in the Mission house with Miss Armstrong.\n\nThe experience such an assistant would gain would fit her for advancement in the Indian service at an increased rate of pay.\n\nThe Department would like you to give this matter your serious consideration and advise it of the result.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRev.

I can assure you that the Committee will much appreciate this kind proposal and I shall at once communicate with the Winnipeg office and urge that such assistance shall be as soon as possible provided. Miss Armstrong has had many years of experience in the work and has proved efficient.

(RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter above quoted asking me if I could add anything by way of a supplement to my report on White Bear's Bay school, made in December last.\n\nAt the time of my inspection of the Moose Mountain Agency in August last, Miss Armstrong, the Principal, was away for her holidays, and the school was closed; consequently I was unable to make any report. I was able, however, to learn from the Agent that the attendance was good and that Miss Armstrong was still doing good work; that a number of children from the far end of the reserve, four or five miles distant, were living in a shack in charge of an Indian woman, and attended school regularly all winter. I have no doubt the Agent has reported on this matter.\n\nI note that the Department has under consideration the appointment of an assistant to Miss Armstrong. At the time of my last inspection of this little school I noticed a decided improvement.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nimprovement in the children over the previous inspections, in fact, I firmly believe that Miss Armstrong has done more in the way of advancing the children in the two years that she has been in charge of the school, than was done during all the previous years the school has been in existence, which proves conclusively that she is in the right place and understands Indian work. The greatest obstacles with which this school has to contend are the poor home surroundings of these children and the example of indolence that is always before them. The Indians of the Moose Mountain Agency are, without doubt, the poorest lot of Indians in this Inspectorate. They are lazy and very dirty and there is very little to show that they have been instructed for years. I do not know that I can attribute this state of affairs entirely to the Indians themselves, as the supervision that this Agency has had in the last ten years is not what I would call good. If a vigorous and energetic policy were pursued at this Agency there would be some results, I am sure, for after all, the Indians here are not so different to the Indians of the other reserves throughout the Inspectorate, if they were managed properly.\n\nI am not quite sure of the nature of the services\nthat would be expected from an assistant for Miss Armstrong. If it is to take some of Miss Armstrong's school work so that she would have time to go about and visit the Indians and instruct them in the habits of cleanliness, give them some attention when they are sick, keep an eye on those children who have passed through school, etc. I would strongly advise the appointment of an assistant.\n\nMiss Armstrong has had an assistant in the past, but from what I could see she has been more of a housekeeper in Miss Armstrong's house. This is not the kind of assistance that is required. I do not think it would be advisable for Miss Armstrong to give up the class-room work entirely. She has been successful in this work and should give as much time to it as possible.\n\nThe Department should insist on a change in these Indians' methods of farming living and all depends on proper instruction given by its officers.\n\nIt is my intention after I complete my inspection of the Touchwood Agency (for which point I start next week) to make a visit to all the reserves in this inspectorate and see what has been done in the way of preparing for the winter, what condition the land has been put in for\nfor next year's crop, and have a general look round.

Should such an appointment be made your suggestions as to the arrangement of duties will be borne in mind.\n\nIn event of your making the tour of inspection referred to the Department would be glad if you pay particular attention to the educational conditions on each of the reserves visited and report thereon, making any suggestions and recommendations you may deem expedient. Miss Armstrong's work on the Moose Mountain Reserve shows what may be accomplished by an energetic and self-sacrificing teacher, and it is the desire of the Department not only to offer practical encouragement to those now performing meritorious work, but if possible to extend a system which has proved of such material benefit to the Indians and their children to other reserves where conditions are favourable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAct.

He adds the interesting item that all the children of school age, save one, are in attendance at school; that the Indians themselves built a log boarding house for the children and employed a man and his wife to keep the house and care for the children so as to make attendance possible. This, he adds, is due not only to Miss Armstrong's winsome ways, but also to the understanding that Mr. Corry, the agent, might commit absentees to the Regina jail.\n\nWhat is wholesome and suggests what wise pressure might accomplish.\n\nThere are fifty children on the Reserve under school age so that attendance is likely to continue. Dr. Farquharson visited this and other Reserves and reports interestingly and hopefully.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRPM.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. Mackay that the Western Committee of the Presbyterian Church has at last been successful in securing the services of a trained nurse to assist you in your work on the White Bear Reserve. The question of the division of the work between you is being taken up with Dr. Mackay and in reference to this you will be further advised at a later date.\n\nDr. Mackay in his letter to the Department refers to the fact that the lodging annex for the children who live at some distance from the school is in use, and the Department would like to impress upon you the necessity of care to avoid over-crowding. This has proved one of the most detrimental features in the case of regular boarding schools, and the Department trusts that the building in use on the White Bear reserve provides plenty of accommodation for the number in residence and that every effort is made to keep it thoroughly ventilated.\n\nThe Department would also be glad to know if anything could be done to assist in providing a more varied mid-day meal for the children, and it would be willing to have issued from the Agency store-house a limited supply of soup meat, rice, salt, tea, beans, bacon and biscuits.\n\nThe Department trusts that the appointment of this nurse will relieve you and that you will meet with even a larger measure of success in future in your work on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss E. May Armstrong,\nTeacher,\nWhite Bear Indian Day School,\nCarlyle, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nOn the occasion of my last visit to the Moose Mountain Indian reserve on the 23rd of the present month, I was surprised to learn that Miss Smithson had been appointed to the position of nurse on the reserve to assist Miss Armstrong, the present teacher of the Day school. On making enquiry from both the agent and Miss Armstrong, I learned that neither of them have had any instructions regarding this nurse's duties, other than that the church authorities in Toronto told Miss Armstrong to get someone to assist her on the reserve and that she would be paid a salary of $25.00 per month by the Department. When I heard this I felt sure there must be some mistake, and that the Department had not sanctioned the appointment, that Miss Armstrong's authority to engage a nurse was premature, as I felt that the Agent would have been written to regarding this woman's duties, and also with regard to placing her name on the pay list.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nI knew that the Department had under consideration the appointment of an assistant to Miss Armstrong, as they had written to me for suggestions as to the assistant's duties, and on the 4th of October I wrote at length advising the appointment, but pointed out quite plainly what the duties of an assistant paid by the Department should be, and I took particular care to emphasize the fact that she was to give all her time to the Indians and not to act as housekeeper in Miss Armstrong's home. I am told that since Miss Smithson came she has spent three afternoons a week visiting Indians. My opinion is that she should spend nearly all her time with the Indians. The work is to be done, and to do it requires more than three afternoons a week.\n\nOf course I feel rather reluctant about giving any instructions or advice, as I did not know whether the young woman was there with the Department's authority, however, I did tell her that I had no instructions or advice of her appointment and that anything I did tell her was given as my own views and not official and that her instructions would come from Ottawa. If it should happen that Miss Smithson is there with the Department's knowledge, I think it would be safe to advise her to work out on the lines laid down.\ndown by me, which were as follows:\n\nVisit all the Indians regularly at their homes; see that their houses were whitewashed at least twice during the winter; instruct them almost daily in the way they should keep their houses and premises surrounding them, personally see that all the children attending school take a bath at the school at least once a week, on Saturday or some other other convenient day. She should, when the doctor visits the reserve take instructions regarding the treatment to be given Indians, and see that they are carried out. She should also dispense the medicines used on the reserve and look after them.\n\nThe position is one in which a great deal of good can be done if the instructions are carried out; on the other hand if the duties are not defined and the work not checked up little will be accomplished. The work will at times be discouraging, but if the instructions are followed out results will follow.\n\nThe Department should insist that the nurse's full time be given to Indians. Housekeeping could take up half the time and it is well to start out with a thorough understanding on this point.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp. of Indian Agencies\nOttawa, December 6th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that before the receipt of the same the Department had been notified of the engagement of Miss Smithson as assistant to Miss Armstrong in the Moose Mountain reserve and it approved of the appointment. Instructions with reference to her duties are under consideration and Miss Armstrong will be written to by this mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nOttawa, December 6th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has approved of the appointment of Miss Smithson as assistant to Miss Armstrong in the Moose Mountain reserve and instructions with reference to her duties are being sent to Miss Armstrong direct. A voucher for the salary due Miss Smithson at the rate of $300.00 per annum should be forwarded to the Department in the usual way at the end of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsecretary.\n\nThos. Cory, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nOttawa, December 6th, 1909.\n\nMadam,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 30th ultimo I beg to say that upon reconsideration the Department has decided to communicate direct with you in reference to the duties to be assigned to Miss Smithson, who has been appointed as your assistant.\n\nThe Department desires you to continue the work in the class-room and you may arrange for the assistance of Miss Smithson at certain hours to give instruction in sewing, knitting, etc., and the preparation of the mid-day meal, if necessary.\n\nMiss Smithson's duties will in the main, therefore, consist of personal visitations in the homes of the Indians; the inculcation of habits of thrift, industry and cleanliness; instruction in plain cooking, sewing, washing, the mending and cutting of garments, the treatment of ordinary diseases, etc. She should also attend to the dispensing of medicines, and see to the carrying out of any instructions given by the Doctor for the treatment of Indians under his care. The above duties will take up the greater portion of Miss Smithson's time, and the Department is disposed to leave to you and her the details of arrangements, subject to its approval. You will, therefore, be good enough to advise the Department as to the time you consider should be devoted each day to the work in the school-room, it being understood that the rest of the day will be spent in the exercise of the duties above outlined. It is the wish of the Department\n\nMiss E. May Armstrong,\nTeacher,\nWhite Bear Indian Day School,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nto arrive at an apportionment of work that will be mutually satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to hear from you at an early date, and, in the meantime, the work on the reserve may be proceeded with on the lines indicated above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, February 7th, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of December 6th, last, in reference to the division of duties on the White Bear Reserve between yourself and Miss Smithson, your assistant. The Department would be glad to have a reply from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss E. May Armstrong,\nTeacher,\nWhite Bear Indian Day School,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nThe Secretary of Dept Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of letter No. 17870/1.\n\nIn reference to letter No. 17870/1 of the 6th last I beg to say that we have earnestly endeavoured to carry on the work in the school and on the Reserve along the lines suggested by the Department. Our efforts have been, in some degree, successful.\n\nI have continued the work in the classroom myself except for a day or half day occasionally when business called me away. At such times Miss Smithers\ntook charge of my work, and I have continued visiting the homes of the children, whenever possible, after school hours, and on Saturdays.\n\nMiss Smithson's mornings have been employed in preparing the noon meal for the school children, and for ourselves; in treating cases of sore eyes, and serious sores which came to her for treatment; in dispensing medicine, and in cutting and preparing work to be done by the mothers or the children.\n\nFrom 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. she has taught a class of girls sewing, knitting, mending, darning, and occasionally ironing. The classes go on alternate days.\nSo that only one class is absent from the school room at once.\n\nAfter 2:30 p.m., she is generally free to go on the Reserve.\n\nOn alternate Friday afternoons, after 2:30, she has taken charge of the girls in scrubbing the school room, and one Thursday afternoon in the month has been spent in disinfecting the children's heads, and Friday morning in washing their heads.\n\nI have still kept charge of the washing of towels and pinafores in the school, but now that the school has become so full of children, and there is more to be washed, it is very distracting to be melting ice and snow, and attending the wash tubs while dictating lessons, and I am hoping to pass this duty over to Miss Smithson also.\nThis work could be taken one morning in the week.\n\nSo far the house-to-house work has been done only incidentally. Very often Indians come for treatment or for food and medicine for ailing ones on the reserve. Thus prevent Miss Smithson going out; and again, some days have been too cold for her to drive alone.\n\nMiss Smithson is hampered in having no means of conveyance of her own. She has either to borrow my pony or take a chance drive other work with either Mr. Cory or Mr. Williams, both of whom are very obliging and helpful. My pony is not always available, but I have never hindered her visits by withholding the pony when required.\n\nAgain, no adequate allowance.\nhas been made for Miss Smithson's maintenance. Since Oct 1st to Dec 31st last I have had $18.75 to cover maintenance.\n\nThe Department will pardon me for feeling somewhat dissatisfied.\n\nI have a chore boy at a cost of about $5.00 per month. Part of his duties is waiting on Miss Smithson, and I meet all other expenses in connection with her maintenance, besides having the responsibility of seeing that the purpose for which Miss Smithson was appointed does not fail.\n\nI sincerely thank the Department for their desire to make my work easier, and I hope that such an arrangement may be made that their desire may be realized. At present it is not so.\nI would suggest that a small addition be built to the school house, so as to provide a kitchen, pantry, and bathroom, and that the cellar beneath be fireproof, and large enough to hold the soft water tanks and the vegetables which we hope to raise in the school garden this summer.\n\nIn this way the mid-day meal may be prepared at the school, the girls assisting in the preparation. Lessons can be given in bread making, the washing, ironing, mending; the sewing and knitting, and the disinfecting and bathing\u2014all could be done with much less loss of time than now.\n\nLet Miss Smithson's salary be sufficient to enable her to pay her board and thus be free to give her undivided attention to her work.\nI think in this way she should be able to undertake the work in the house more satisfactorily. This is now being done.\n\nI would again remind the Department that this is an exceedingly difficult part of the work\u2014the results must necessarily be very slow.\n\nThe school is in very fine condition. Our enrollment is twenty-eight and our average attendance per week is sometimes twenty-three. The children are in good health and are very happy. No real effort is now required to get or to keep the children in school.\n\nThe mid-day meal is thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nI would be very glad to have some dried fruit for them. I think a dish of steamed apples or pears once in the week would be very beneficial, since we have so few.\nvegetables. Next year, I hope we will have a good supply of our own raising.\n\nThe children are exceptionally orderly.\n\nI eat my own luncheon in the school-room. The girls, in turn, wash the dishes, and sweep the floor. Then tidy themselves and the younger ones for the afternoon work.\n\nThey are very happy, and the parents who often visit the school seem quite satisfied that their children are doing well.\n\nThere is increasing improvement in the clean and tidy appearance of the children on coming from their homes. They are now begging to be allowed to take their pianoforos home with them so that they may be sure looking very tidy on the way to school.\n\nAnd mothers are now making their garments for their children. The disinfecting of heads is being\nconsidered a disgrace, and they are making some effort to remove it.\n\nI receive one pound of soap per week from the Agency storehouse. This I divide, as I see is required, on Fridays, so that washing of children's clothes may be done on Saturday.\n\nThere is wonderful improvement in the willingness of the parents to have their children receive civilized treatment for sickness. There were two serious eye cases (Accidents) which took weeks of daily treatment. For some days the treatment had to be given hourly. There was no difficulty in getting both children to the mission without their parents. Miss Smithson came out for them in the morning, took them home at night. Both cases are almost well.\n\nOld people come also irregularly and long distances for eye treatment. But both parents and children...\nand children were quite content\nto let us have our way with them.\n\nI feel that the house in which the\nAssiniboine children lodge during\nthe winter, should be improved.\nTwo rooms at least, three would\nbe better, are needed\u2014a living\nroom, and two sleeping rooms.\nA shingle roof also so that\nsoft water may be available\nfor keeping the house clean.\n\nUnder the present circumstances\nthe house is fairly well kept.\n\nI apologize for the delay in\nanswering letter of 12th.\n\nI was endeavouring to give\nthe matter a fair trial before\nreporting results.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.

She sent the Rev. Mr. Demaree, who is the Presbyterian minister who looks after the Church work upon this reserve, to tell me that she was leaving for good; and I understand that her reason for leaving is ill health, and a desire to secure a less strenuous job.\n\nI am forwarding a Voucher for her salary from January, 1st. up to the 18th. of February.

You will remember that Miss Smithson retired and they have now a Miss Lough in a temporary appointment. The Department contributes $300.00 a year towards her support, to which the Committee added $150.00, making her salary $450.00, and she to pay $75.00, or at most $100.00 a year for board. Miss Armstrong's home is the only place at which a nurse can board in the Mission and the understanding of the Synodical Committee in making this arrangement was that the nurse should share in the housework, otherwise it would be necessary for Miss Armstrong to hire help which would make $2.00 a week too small a figure for board. The question that arises is whether the Department desires an agent supported by them to have any work in addition to Reserve work? Dr. Farquharson asks me to find out how the Department views the situation. Personally I do not think it would interfere with the Reserve work that a young woman should take some share in doing housework, whilst at the same time it would not be desirable to have her so burdened in household cares as to interfere with work upon the Reserve. It is one of these little things that arise and clog the wheels.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There would be no objections to Miss Armstrong's assistant taking a share in the necessary housework, but if much of her time were occupied the work for which she was specially appointed might suffer. However there is no reason to suppose that this would be the case, and some division of labor could readily be carried out that would leave both the Assistant and Miss Armstrong sufficient time for their educational and other duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

These were even not forwarded in the usual way with the quarterly school returns, but were forwarded by the Agent on the ordinary voucher forms; payment was consequently made direct whereas it should have been made to the Presbyterian Church, who engaged Miss Innes. There is no doubt that Miss Innes requires a horse and rig in order to visit the different homes on the reserve, but this is a matter that should have been brought up by the Agent and authority should have been received before any expenditure was incurred. The accounts will, however, be paid upon presentation.\n\nYour report upon the Moose Mountain day school has been received and read with interest.

Sir,\n\nAs you are aware in the latter part of the year 1909 authority was given for the engagement of an assistant to Miss Armstrong, teacher of the White Bear day school, Moose Mountain Agency, Saskatchewan, and for sometime a Miss Smithson was engaged in the work. She, however, resigned the position in February, last, and was succeeded by Miss Lough, who resigned on July 25th, last. A successor in the person of Miss Innes was evidently appointed, but of this the Department has had no official notification. The vouchers for her salary for the September and December quarters were forwarded to the Department, but, owing to the fact that no notice of this appointment had been made and furthermore that the vouchers were made out on the regular agency forms, instead of on the school forms, payment was made direct to Miss Innes of the sum of $119.36.\n\nThis confusion would not have arisen had the Department been informed of the appointment of Miss Innes, as it should have been. It is to be hoped that in future no appointments of this kind will be made without the knowledge and sanction of the Department.

She states that Miss Cory, daughter of the Indian Agent is willing to take up the School during her absence and that she has no hesitation in recommending her as a suitable substitute. She has frequently substituted in emergencies and is a good disciplinarian and a favorite with both the children and parents.

I am sorry that we have not as yet got a permanent teacher for the school; but Miss Cory, the daughter of your Agent for these reserves, has kindly undertaken to conduct the school until a permanent teacher is appointed.

He will be expected to give his full time to the work of the school as teacher.

He holds a second class certificate, Grade B, recorded in Certificate Register A. of the Department of Education of Ontario as No. 4560, the same showing that he studied at the Normal School, Ottawa.

I have to ask you, therefore, to be good enough to furnish a limited amount of supplies to supplement the lunches brought by the children from their homes. These supplies may consist of some rice, beans, bacon, biscuits, sugar, tea and beef. These will be obtained from the supplies in the storehouse with the exception of the beans, sugar and the beef.

I have been issuing three rations to the school every week that the school has been open for the last year out of the provisions furnished for the destitute, but my supply of flour has been cut down so much this year that I wont be able to do it now.\n\nI Have The Honour To Be\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, May 3, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo in reference to the issue of supplies for the mid-day meal at the Assiniboine School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on the 18th ultimo you were given full instructions with regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Cory, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the White Bears Indian Day School for the month of February, Original on File 178701-7\n\nI visited this school three times during the month and I found things in what was to me a very unsatisfactory state. When visiting out on the reserve I have on different occasions found children at home who should be in school and when I would start them off to school they would go to other houses and not go to the school and often when they see me coming they will run away and hide. Some of the parents say that it is very hard to get the children to go to the school but I don't think that they try very hard. I dealt with this matter fully in my monthly report.\n\nSgd. Thom. Cory.\nIndian Agent.\nMoose Mountain Agency,\nCarlyle, Sask.,\nMarch 3, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit my report for the month of February, 1913 on matters in connection with this Agency.\n\nXX X X XX\n\nSchool.\n\nNow I have got to make a report on this matter that I do not like to make, but I must report dead against the present condition of affairs and after I have said what I have got to say the department can do what they think is right, this school is steadily going back and the reason is that the present teacher is not liked by the Indians children and outside of his work in the school room makes no effort whatever to hold the school together. In February of 1912 the first month he taught the average was 19 in Feb. of 1913, it was between 8 and 9 a falling off over half and it has been a steady drop since March of 1913 when I to a great extent owing to pressure of other work left matters largely to him on the night of Feb. 26 last the Indians held a meeting to see what had better be done in regard to this matter owing to the changed attitude of the children toward the school, and at that meeting they decided to ask for a change of teacher and they would much prefer a woman.\n\nI know that it is a rather difficult position here owing to the Presbyterian Church having to do with the school and wanting one person to do the work of teacher and Missionary as well; this is a very difficult thing to do successfully and in the present case is a failure. My advice would be for the Department to take the school into its own\nown hands and appoint and run it as a purely Government Institution and then if the church want to keep a Missionary here why all right but even in that case there should be a change. I am very sorry to say things like this but I am more sorry to see our school and the moral condition of our Indians going back and that is what has been going on for the last year.\n\nx x x x x x\n\nThos Cory,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 7, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nFrom reports received from Mr. Cory, Indian Agent at Moose Mountain, it would appear that school matters on the reserve are not as satisfactory as they ought to be.\n\nThe Department would like you to look fully into this matter when you next visit the reserve and report making such recommendations as you may see fit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Some time ago the Department agreed to pay a salary of $50.00 per annum to a Truant Officer, who would not undertake the work except under impossible conditions. I may also say that following your last monthly report the Department wrote to Mr. Inspector Graham, to have him look into the school matters of this reserve at the first opportunity. You will see from this that the Department has not ignored your reports and that your statement as to its attitude is erroneous.\n\nThe Department wishes you to submit at once a report showing the names of the parents who are delinquent in sending their children to school with a statement showing the number of children in each family, the distance they reside from the school and conditions of their homes generally, so that such action as may be deemed advisable may be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

I am not at all satisfied with matters in regard to this school and I think I have said so very plainly with no result and I can only conclude that the Dept. is satisfied and that there is no use for me to say any more about it.\n\nWith all due respect to the Department they must either give me power to enforce the school law and compel the children to attend or change the teacher or shut the School, I have no fault to find with the work of the present teacher in the schoolroom but that is a small part of the work that is needed to be done by a teacher on an Indian reserve if the school is to be a success.\nInformation List - White Bear School\n\n3 Jummi\n6 Sammie\n4 Maymonas\n2 Papa\n1 Shepherd\n7 Nebesier\n4 Shewauk\n2 Lonechild\n1 Etamapier\n\nAll these send their children very irregular to school\n\n3 Pity 6 sq\n2 Alex\n4 McArthur Inc.\n3 Shepskin\n5 John\n1 Mary\n3 Rupert\n1 Pat\n4 McArthur\n1 Daddy Whoopie\n\nThese do not send their children to school\n\nA.M.

We have tried it now for three years and in my opinion it has been a complete failure and there is nothing to show for it outside of the school and that could have been done by the regular teacher.\n\nMiss Innes is a hard working, conscientious woman, a woman who did a very hard, cold work and who put up with very poor accommodation. Ever since the appointment of the present teacher, she has lived in the kitchen of the school, and the bath tub in the bath room has been her bed, and the bath room is only 6ft, 6 in. by 7 ft. 4, rather poor quarters for her to occupy for 18 months.\n\nIn my opinion this will make it absolutely necessary to make a change from a male to a female teacher before the school opens again on the 1st of September.\n\nThe Rev. George Anderson of Manor, who has the oversight of the Indian work here for the Presbyterian Church, has urged as strongly as he possibly can upon the church people of Toronto, who have charge of this work, that a change be made as soon as possible, and he also told them of the big mistake that they made in making this appointment and for the sake of the Indians I would like to see a change made, and I would like to see our school made a public school with a female teacher.\n\nOur school has dropped from being one of the best Indian day schools in the province to a very low place, and as long as there is so much dissatisfaction among the parents and scholars, as there is now it is going to be a hard matter to bring it up again.\n\nSgd.

It is unlikely at the present time that we will engage another field matron, as the teacher can do a certain amount of this kind of work. The salary agreed upon for Miss Porter is $600.00 per annum. You will note that this is a considerable increase, but still it is very reasonable considering her qualifications and I would recommend that the Department assume the responsibility for the full salary, provided Miss Porter will do a certain amount of field matron work in addition to her regular school duties.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant in reference to the qualifications of Miss Porter, who has been engaged to teach at the White Bear Day School, and also the salary agreed upon.\n\nAs you may be aware, the Department previously paid at this school a salary of only $400.00, but in addition to this an allowance of $300.00 was made for field matron work. The latter work has been discontinued and it is hardly probable that, under the circumstances, it will be taken up again. The Department will, however, assume the obligation for the full payment of Miss Porter's salary, viz.- $600.00 per annum, provided she will agree to do a certain amount of field matron work as is done by a great many of our Indian teachers both in the east and west. Miss Porter is being written to accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Andrew S.

J. Porter as teacher of the White Bear Day School at a salary of $600.00 per annum, provided she will agree to do a certain amount of field matron work in addition to the school duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Cory, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nOttawa, September 22, 1913.\n\nMadam,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has approved of your appointment as teacher of the White Bear Day School and also informed the church that it will assume the responsibility for the payment of your full salary, $600.00 per annum, upon condition that you will do a certain amount of field matron work in addition to the regular school duties. I may say that these two duties are combined in many instances by teachers of our Indian schools and with considerable success.\n\nTo attain success as an Indian teacher it is essential to obtain the favour of the parents and in order to do this a certain amount of home visiting is required. Of course it is not expected that you could carry on this work to the same extent as a person devoting her whole time exclusively to these duties, but at the same time you will have opportunity when visiting the parents to do much work along the lines laid down by the Department for field matrons. I am enclosing herewith a copy of a memorandum of instructions prepared for this purpose. The Department will be pleased to have you consider it and to hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss S. J. Porter,\nTeacher,\nWhite Bear Indian Day School,\nOffice of the Indian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSecretary,\n\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFile 178701/1.\n\nI have yours of Sept. 22nd. I note what you say regarding the willingness of your Department to pay the entire salary of $600.00 per annum to Miss Porter. We have already decided not to continue the Field Work under a separate worker, and our arrangement with Miss Porter is that she should do, in addition to the school work, some Field Work as well, and one reason for our engaging here is that she has the ability of doing these two things.\n\nIt seems to me that, as we have already made these arrangements with her, it would be better if you had not written her, nor raised the question with her. We have to be responsible for these engagements, and it is better that correspondence from the Department regarding the duties of these workers should be with us, rather than with them, personally.\nThanking you for the decision regarding the payment of the full salary, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nASG/CMcG.\n\nSUPERINTENDENT of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\nOttawa, October 1, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo in reference to the appointment of Miss Porter as teacher of the White Bear Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the Department appreciates your attitude in regard to the matter, it has been found in the past to be in the interests of the school work that the Department should keep as closely as possible in touch with the teachers on the different reserves and their work. It has proved an encouragement to the teachers and an incentive to better work. The Department, of course, reserves the right to give teachers instructions as to what their duties shall be and in this case the usual course was followed.\n\nThe Department is pleased to know that Miss Porter is so well qualified and trusts that she will meet with a large measure of success in her work on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

Grant,\nSuperintendent of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of October 1st received. I note what you say regarding the instructions being given to workers in the field by the Department. My point is that it would be better that these instructions should go through us, as we are the parties who are engaging these workers, and they ought to be responsible to us. If they are receiving instructions from different sources there is almost bound to be confusion. There are too many corresponding\u2014Presbyteries, Women's Boards, Home Mission Board, and the Government\u2014and it is confusing to the workers.\n\nThanking you for your letter,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nOttawa, October 7, 1913.\n\nRev.

Cory, on the White Bears Indian Day School for the month of November, 1913. Original on File 1787q1-7\n\nI visited the school several times during the month but things are not at all satisfactory.\n\nThos. Cory,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, December 18, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your report on the White Bear Day School for the month of November in which you state that you visited the school several times during the months, but things are not at all satisfactory I beg to say that the Department would like to have a fuller report from you on the work at this school. As the present teacher has only been in charge of this school for a short while there has hardly been time to judge whether she will make a success of it or not. You should assist her in every way in your power.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Cory, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 17, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your report on the White Bear Day School for the month of January, last, I beg to say that the written statement of the Chief and Headmen, referred to therein, did not accompany your report. Kindly forward this to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Cory, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nWinnipeg, 16th February, 1914.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nSupt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Scott,-\n\nMr. Cory of Moose Mountain Reserve tells me that he has great difficulty in keeping the children at school, owing largely to the fact that the school teacher is neglectful of her duties and really incompetent to serve the purpose of teacher in Domestic Science as well as the other necessaries. As you know the school at Moose Mountain has attached to it a kitchen. Since Miss Porter has been there this kitchen has been used altogether as a refuse room and has not been utilized for the purpose for which it has been built. Mr. Cory suggests that an addition be built to the kitchen where a qualified woman teacher hired by the Department and with the authority of the Agent could live, possibly with an Assistant. This Assistant could be utilized during the forenoon of each day to teach the girls attending the school Domestic Science, knitting, darning, cooking, baking, &c., and in the afternoons could spend her time as a sort of matron going\naround from house to house visiting the Indian women and showing them the little niceties of housekeeping. At present the teacher is not in any way under the control of the Agent. She is a lady from Illinois and is an appointee of the Presbyterian church, and her salary comes from the Department who virtually have no control over her. As you are aware this is a concrete case which bears out my opinion with regard to the schools as I have expressed it to you in conversation. We ought to have a policy whereby we would be able to run our own schools regardless of any denomination. Run a state school among the Indians just as we have outside of the Reserves, that is a policy that would meet with the approval of every right thinking person in Canada. We have the expenses now of the schools and supposedly have the responsibility, and at the same time we have not a teacher that we hire or can dismiss for inefficiency. We have simply to put up with whatever the various churches choose to give us in the way of teachers no matter whether they are useful or not. This is a matter that I feel very strongly on as you know and would have liked to personally discuss with you. I will be glad to know if you can give this case favorable consideration and change the conditions there for Mr. Cory assures me the utility of the school is not what it should be by any means. If a house were attached as suggested by him to the end of the kitchen the present kitchen would serve for both the house and the school.\n\nYours with regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The only privilege that the church has is to nominate teachers; the Department approves of the appointments and keeps full control. We have power to dismiss these teachers and on occasions have done so; of course we take this action through the church who nominated them and after stating facts have asked them to nominate a new teacher. On no instances where good grounds have been shown have the churches made any objection. For example Miss Porter's predecessor was removed at the request of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGlen Campbell, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Complaints have been made by the Agent who alleges that the present teacher is not efficient. Miss Porter is a qualified teacher who was highly recommended. She took up her duties after the holidays last year. In addition to the regular school work she is supposed to do some field matron work occasionally and for the combined duties the salary paid by the Department is $600.00 per annum.\n\nI would like you to visit this school & Agency and report at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

The meals are never cooked in the Kitchen, and the stove is never used.\n\nThe school children are not taught to behave themselves, or to keep clean.\n\nThe girls are not taught housework, cooking or sewing.\n\nThe teacher never visits Indians on the Reserve.\n\nThe School is never cleaned.\n\nSigned by\n\nChief Jimmy Big Stone\nHeadman Conley Kakoway\nHeadman Shepherd\n\nWitness Adeline Davis\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of February 24th, 1914.\n\nNo. 78701/7\n\nI have the honour to attach the report of the chief and headmen asked for in that letter.\n\nI Have The Honour To Be\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Ont\nOttawa, March 4, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo enclosing a complaint signed by the Chief and headmen of the Moose Mountain Band in regard to the unsatisfactory manner in which their school is being conducted by Miss Porter, the teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Graham has been instructed to visit this reserve and inquire into these matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I called at the school 13 times during the month and at no time did I see things as I would liked to have seen them. If a teacher allows children to come strolling in at any time between half past ten and one o'clock they are going to do it and if they are allowed to come to school dirty and ragged and with feathers sticking to their hair they are going to do that also. I am not satisfied with the way school matters are going here at all but with my other work I cannot give any more time of my time to the school than I am doing.\n\nThos.

Now, unless matters are in a very unsatisfactory condition, it might be better to let her finish her term, and I am corresponding with her, in the light of her letter, advising her not to take any such drastic measures as she suggests in regard to the Indian Agent, but I feel that, as soon as possible, we ought to release her, and try to secure someone else for the work. The difficulty of getting satisfactory workers, and keeping them, after we get them, in the work, is most distressing.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nApril 18th, 1914.\n\nDear Dr. Grant,\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant with further reference to Miss Porter, teacher of the White Bear school. If the Agent did what Miss Porter alleges in ordering her to resign, he was exceeding his authority. I have however, just received a confidential report from Mr. Inspector Graham who recently visited this school and found things in a most disgraceful condition, so much so, that I consider Miss Porter should be released at once as the school would be even better closed than kept open under existing circumstances.

I am now writing her on the strength of your last letter, that she must withdraw at the end of this term. You can count on our making the new arrangements at the earliest possible date. I may say that this educational work is a great nuisance because of the difficulty to get qualified teachers at the salaries we are offering, to go to remote places to do this kind of work. If there is too much interference on the part of your inspectors, we will have to hand this whole thing over to you, and let you handle it yourselves. We are just as anxious that the results should be satisfactory as the Government is, but we cannot do the impossible, and we think that we are giving just as good service as you could give under the circumstances, and for\nless money.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have not been absent from my seat a single day during the year. The day I was required to be present I got up to pray at the 8 o'clock service June 17th, being made up the following Saturday. The attendance continued very good until the end, and the school of regularly attending children have made real progress in their literary and industrial work.\n\nI assured the Agent that the wood for the coming year should be cut and allowed to dry out during the summer, and it had been done. So a good supply of wood is ready for the coming year. Also the building arrangements are in good shape, good draughts.\nIn the school store, and pupils will arrive.\n\nWhen I came there was no trouble,\ncould not make a fire until I had the\npupils taken down, cleaned out.\n\nThere was not a stick of wood\ncut, or any building material.\n\nNot all do I have the school.\nThe interior of the school is left clean & in\nperfect order at close of school June 30th\na good school garden planted by myself\nand the pupils.\n\nThe Mission buildings are in\ngood shape inside & out, a supply of wood\nwhile stock is ready for next year, every\nfoot of tillable ground is planted.\nThere is a 2 acre field of fine oats,\na large garden of potatoes, peas beans\nlettuce, cress, corns and other garden stuff\nalso flowers and vines. The place looks well.\n\nI have done my work faithfully in the\nsight of God, and have nothing to\ngive you any cause for regret.\n\nThank you for your unwavering kindness\nfrom first to last. I am sorry to part from you.\nHowever, aside from that and the splendid home furnished by our Church here, there has been no pleasant features whatever here for me. The Indians are steeped in Paganism, Romanism and ignorance. Not one Christian Indian on the Reserve.\n\nThe Sabbath is constantly desecrated by the farm instructors who is completely under the thumb of the Agent. The Agent is not a friend of our Church, and unless he can dominate the missionary-teachers & have them other also in the clique, he works against them. Or should I am telling you the plain truth and do so because I am true to our Church & plan I sent in my resignation three months ago, to the Government at Ottawa, to take effect at the close of this year, August 31, 1914. I now repeat it and hereby state that I resign my position as Teacher Three M School, Sask., to take effect August 31, 1914. In the meantime will help things in excellent shape, and be prepared to go.\n\nWishing you sincerely for all your goodness to me,\n\nFaithfully yours, Sarah Porter.\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. McLean;-\n\nI am enclosing a letter which I have just received from Miss Porter, whom, at your request, through your Agent, I have withdrawn from the work. If what she says be true, then it seems that you ought to look after your own Agent and see that he is removed, if he is not discharging his duties properly. There is going to be an upheaval some day in all this Indian work, unless things are conducted locally on some lines different from those at present.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

After five years experience of Mrs Fernie as Miss Armstrong I can most emphatically endorse her ability and success as a teacher, but what I want to impress upon the Department is this that she should have an assistant one who is smart tidy capable and willing who can teach the girls domestic science and help in many other ways in the school and on the reserve, and this assistant should have proper sleeping accommodation provided for her in connection with the school kitchen so that she could keep on fires in the kitchen and keep the frost out of the cellar and water pipes this would cost but very little and could easily be done before the school opens on the 1st of September.

Original on 176701/7.\n\nThe school opened after the holidays on Sept. 14th and there has been a big improvement in both the work done and the attendance but there is one thing very sure and that is that if the work is to be done properly the teacher will have to have help in the school, it is utterly impossible for one woman to teach a school of from 25 to 30 children and teach the girls domestic science as well, to say nothing about preparing a meal for the children at mid day the teacher cannot leave the class room to teach the girls domestic science in the kitchen or to prepare meals so it will be necessary to provide her with help or drop that part of the programme altogether which would be a great pity to have to do and I sincerely hope that the Department can see their way clear to furnishing help for we have a very good teacher and it would be a very great pity to have her handicapped in her work.\nOttawa, October 15, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the White Bear Day School for the month of September in which you state that, owing to the large attendance at this school, the teacher is unable to spare the time to prepare a mid-day meal and teach domestic science I beg to say that when calling the Department's attention to this matter you should have stated on what terms an assistant could be secured for Mrs. Fernie, the teacher.

I find that Dr. Somerville has written you only in regard to deficits for the quarter ending September 1914. There was also a deficit for the quarter ending September 1913. This was in connection with the White Bear School. Rev. A. M. McKay was in charge for two months of the quarter, perhaps for a few days longer. Then Miss Porter took his place. I do not know the nature of the report that she sent to you, but Dr. Somerville states that he only received $63.00 Government grant for the quarter. I understand that this came made in Miss Porter's favour. From this you will see that there is still a deficit for the quarter ending September 1913 of $87.00.\n\nMr. McKay complained to us sometime ago about this, and we have paid him out of our Home Mission Fund.

She will come on the understanding that she will help the teacher in the school at whatever there is to do for five days in the week for $240.00 a year the rest of her time to be her own to make what arrangement she can for her board and lodging.

Cory Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn the matter of Mrs Boddy being permanently appointed, to the position of Assistant in the School, and Field Matron on the Reserve, I would say, that the appointment would not be in the best interests of the work.\n\nFrom what I have observed, so far, Mrs Boddy's unreasonable fear of disease contracting disease from the Indians, together with her want of tact in dealing with them, quite unfit her for Field Matron work.\n\nAmong the school children she is often extremely impatient, and her utter want of self-control, at times, has already made matters very unpleasant, and has decidedly lessened her in the confidence and respect of the children.\n\nShe is decidedly lacking in ability to keep order, and, hence, I have an added burden, instead of help. She has on several occasions, been quite unwilling to carry out my instructions in connection with her work, and much of the instruction given the girls in domestic economy has been done under protest from her.\n\nConsidering Mrs Boddy's nervous temperament, considering I do not think we need expect any improvement, at her age, in her attitude towards the work.\n\nI am Yours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose a report just received from Mrs. Fernie the teacher of the White Bear day school in regard to Mrs. Boddy the assistant teacher and field matron. I myself do not think that it would be advisable to continue Mrs Boddy in her present position, so far she has not attempted to do any field matron work and I am afraid that her work among the children in the school is not of the best.\n\nI Have The Honour To Be\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont\nOttawa, May 3, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo enclosing a report from Mrs. Fernie, teacher of the White Bear Day School, in regard to the manner in which Mrs. Boddy, assistant teacher and field matron performs her work.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the unsatisfactory report received, Mrs. Boddy's services may be dispensed with at the end of this month, and you will be good enough to inform her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Some of the Assiniboine children have to travel between 3 and 4 miles to reach the school or get no schooling as the school is right down at the east end of the reserve and the majority of the children are west of the school. When the school was built it seems to have been built more with an eye to the church's convenience that the pupils as it is only a few rods from the mission and the mission house. The Indians offer to move the school free of cost to the Department and place it in the new site in good shape and condition. It is all lumber no lath and plaster about it and should not be very difficult to move.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont\n\nSir\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, September 22nd, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, in which you forward a request from the White Bear Indians to have their school moved to a new site.\n\nBefore considering this request, the Department would like you to state definitely if you would recommend a change in the site. You neglected to make any remarks on the request in your letter.\n\nKindly state, also, if the proposed change would inconvenience the teacher in securing living accommodation.\n\nYou should, also, furnish full particulars in regard to the number of families who would benefit by this change and also, the number of families, who would possibly be placed farther from the school, than they are at present.\n\nThe Department will expect you to give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I beg to say that I did not recommend it because I did not approve of it being done as it would entail an immense amount of work that the Indians are not in a position to do properly. The situation is this there are five children living east of the school about one mile the rest of the children live from one mile to four west of the school eleven of them live outside of the three mile limit from the school and they are all young children. Now what I would recommend is that an Indian living in the southwest corner of the inhabited part of the reserve be hired to bring the children living west of the school and take them home again at night this would entail a drive of eight miles morning and night but would assure the attendance of all children well enough to come which would be a big item, as you know the winters here are sometimes so severe that it is impossible for young children to walk any distance with safety and if you have to trust to the parents to fetch a and take them you get a very irregular attendance which does not give either the teacher or children a fair show. I would suggest that an Indian be paid each 75\u00a2 a trip for conveying to and from the school day which would be $1.50 a day.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. C. Anderson, Convener of Arcola Presbytery, was read, asking that the salary of Mrs. Fernie be increased to $800 per year, to enable her to secure domestic help in her own home, or that the Government be urged to appoint a field matron to co-operate with the teacher.\n\nIt was agreed to ask the Government to increase Mrs. Fernie's salary to $800.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a Minute passed at the recent meeting of our Board of Home Missions and Social Service, asking for an increase of salary for Mrs. Fernie. The Presbytery of Arcola have gone into the situation pretty fully and we had before our meeting a report from the Convener.\n\nIt appears that some years ago this mission was under the care of the Foreign Mission department, a grant of $300 per year was made towards the salary of a field matron. This person was appointed by the Church, the appointment being confirmed by the Government. Her duties were to teach domestic science to the girls of the school, care for the sick on the Reserve, and do all possible to teach the women in their homes to be clean and to cook simple meals properly. The Women's Missionary Society supplemented her salary $150 making a total of $450 per year. Since the resignation of the field matron, Miss Innis in 1913, no successor was appointed until the spring of 1916 when the Government set aside $240 per year with room at the agency and rations from the storehouse. This field matron was married in April 1916. There has been none since then.\nD. C. S.\n\nIn the judgment of Presbytery, Mrs. Fernie has at present too much to do. Two courses were suggested. - First, to appoint another field matron, or allow Mrs. Fernie $200 extra, that she might get domestic help for her own home. This would leave her free to give her hours after school to the work that was formerly being done by the field matron. Our Board has decided that it would be better and cheaper to allow Mrs. Fernie $200, making her salary $800 per year, and that she be given the privilege of securing help for her own home.\n\nI trust the recommendation of our Board may find the approval of the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nApril 15, 1917.\n\nDear Mr. Edmison,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant enclosing a minute of the meeting of the Board of Home Missions and Social Service of your Church with reference to the request of the Arcola Presbytery that the salary of Mrs. Fernie, teacher of the White Bear school, be increased to $800.00 a year, or that a field matron be appointed to co-operate with her.\n\nI have looked over the attendance record of this school for the past year, and find the average attendance to have been less than eleven. It will thus be seen that so far as the school work is concerned, there could be no possible reason for providing assistance for Mrs. Fernie. I regret to have to state that the reports that I have received on Mrs. Fernie's work are not altogether favourable. I think it better, therefore, that she should confine herself to the class-room work, including the teaching of Domestic Science to the girls at the school.\n\nRev. J.H. Edmison,\nSecretary of the Board of Home Missions and Social Service,\n434 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nfor the present. One person could hardly do justice to both phases of the work, and I think it preferable to have Mrs. Fernie devote all her energy to the school work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n**REPORT of Provisions used at White Bear Day School on White Bear Reserve, for Month ended May 31st 1917**\n\nAggregate Attendance: 256\n\nMeals Served: 256\n\n| Item       | On hand 1st of May | Received during Month | Used during Month | On hand at end of Month | REMARKS |\n|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------|\n| FLOUR      | 4 lbs.             | 2 lbs.                | 2 lbs.           |                         |         |\n| BACON      |                    |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| BEEF       | 0                  | 0                     | 0                |                         |         |\n| TEA        | 1/2 lb.            | 2 lbs.                | 2 lbs.           | 1/2 lb.                 |         |\n| RICE       | 0                  | 53 lbs.               | 5 lbs.           | 48 lbs.                 |         |\n| SOAP       | 2 lbs.             | 0                     | 2 lbs.           |                         |         |\n| SUGAR      | 0                  | 0                     | 0                |                         |         |\n| SALT       | 3 lbs.             | 0                     | 2 1/2 lbs.       | 1/2 lb.                 |         |\n| POTATOES   | 4 Bushes           | 0                     | 4 Bushes         |                         |         |\n| BISCUITS   | 3 lbs.             |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| BEANS      | 0                  | 0                     | 0                |                         |         |\n| OATMEAL    | 0                  | 0                     | 0                |                         |         |\n| PEAS       | 0                  | 0                     | 0                |                         |         |\n\nCertified Correct,\n\nE.M.A. Fernie\n\nTeacher, or Field Matron.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMoose Mountain,\nCarlyle, Sask.\n25th, October, 1917.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nSir,\n\nYour letter, No 178701_1, dated October, 12th, 1917, has been received and in reply would be to say,\n\nIt is not unusual in schools to find some pupils who are clever in almost every line, while others have not the like mental capacity.\n\nWe have, in our school, several children whom I consider sub-normal; and, on the day of Agent Cory's last visit, these were all present, while the clever children were absent.\n\nNumber work was the subject for the hour, and we were introducing number in the abstract. While these dull children\u2014who are quite young\u2014were quite able to deal with concrete numbers, they seemed quite unable to grasp the ideas in the abstract.\n\nI have been giving special attention to this subject this month, and, I think, the children are making as much progress as possible. The bright ones are going ahead quite fast.\n\nOne of the older girls does not seem to be able to distinguish between the sounds of letters and words which are similar in sound, hence, her spelling\u2014except as she can remember the place of the word in the list\u2014is very poor. Her reading, also, is poor, because of poor enunciation; but in Domestic Science, she is up-to-the-average.\n\nAnother little fellow, who had been one of our brightest pupils, has learned to smoke, with the inevitable result.\nOne regrets more than I do the poor showing my school seems to have made before the Inspector, and the Agent. On the occasion of Inspector Graham's last visit, in March 10th, 1916, the day was such that I had to keep the children indoors. The Inspector came near four o'clock. We were all exceedingly tired, but I thought, at the time, that some of the pupils gave intelligent answers to the questions asked.\n\nI am well aware that the pupils have not been getting the drill in number-work needed to give them the confidence which prevents diffidence. The reason for this is found in the conditions under which our school is carried on. The children get a dinner at the school. I have no assistant. The girls who were trained under Miss Innis have left school, and the younger girls are inexperienced. I tried to teach them to prepare the noon-meal, and was thus obliged to be out of the class-room quite often. The pupils were left to do seat-work alone. While seat-work has a place in school management, unsupervised seat-work, if largely used, leads to idle, and often vicious, habits. This I tried to bring to the notice of the Department in my Annual Report, and also in the Quarterly Reports.\n\nAnother serious handicap in our work is the want of soft water. For almost two years there has been no water supply. In summer, the children were sent almost a quarter of a mile to carry water for cooking purposes, and often returned with only half a pail. For cleaning purposes, both Teacher and pupils carried water from sloughs. In winter snow and ice had to be melted. As this melting had to be done in the class-room, the school was constantly disturbed.\n\nThough the Indian mothers are doing very well in keeping their children clean and tidy, yet there are often matters needing attention, which the parents do not realize. For instance, the Teacher has frequently to cut the boys' hair and this must be done in the class-room. There are\nsore eyes to bathe, and sores to dress, and all this takes the teacher's time from the strictly class-room work.\n\nThe garden was made by the older children, under the Teacher's direction, while the little ones were again left at seat-work.\n\nAnother difficulty faces us now. There is only one boy in school over twelve years of age, and because of a tubercular neck, he is not able to cut much wood. Even now, the boys lose time from their lessons getting wood, but they will be quite unable to cut enough to keep the class-room warm during the winter, not to speak of wood for the kitchen stove.\n\nI have already drawn the attention of the Agent, the Chief, and Indian parents, to the matter, but, so far, without success.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.M.A. Ferrie,\nTeacher,\nWhite Bear\nOttawa, November 7, 1917.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo in regard to the progress made by the children attending the White Bear Day School and stating that a serious handicap in the work is the want of soft water and that the boys will be quite unable to cut enough wood to keep the class-room warm during the winter, not to speak of wood for the kitchen stove.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your remarks in reference to the progress of the pupils are satisfactory and it is hoped that when the Agent or Inspector next visits your school the pupils will make a better showing.\n\nMr. Agent Cory is being written to in connection with obtaining a supply of water for the school.\n\nIn reference to the cutting of the wood, I beg to say that the Department has decided to make you an allowance of $25.00 per annum as caretaker of this school, the same to be paid quarterly. You will be expected to look after the sweeping and cleaning of the school, etc., and you should hire an Indian to cut the wood required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMrs. E. M. A. Fernie,\nTeacher,\nWhite Bear Indian School,\nCarlyle, Sask.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of November 7, 1917 No 178701/1 about the water supply for the White Bear school. In regard to the lack of soft water this matter has been brought to the attention of the Department several times with no result, and in regard to the drinking water unless the Department is prepared to spend a very considerable sum in digging a well there is not much chance in improving matters. When I went to school in Ontario we carried our drinking water considerably over a quarter of a mile and if we got back with a half a pail of water there was something doing that we were vitally interested in. The only way to supply the school with soft water is to build a frost proof cistern and the drinking water can be supplied by hauling to the school in a barrel which has its drawbacks. I have been paying an Indian to cut and haul ice for that school for several winters now out of my own pocket to try and make things workable but of course it maybe not satisfactory. It will cost anywhere from one hundred to five hundred dollars to dig a well that will give a good supply of water and I do not know of a public school around this part of the country that has a good supply of drinking water in their own grounds.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Ont\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fernie, who is at present teacher of the Moose Mountain School, Sask., intimating that, because of ill health, she will not be able to continue in the work. Our Convener of Arcola Presbytery visited the Reserve recently, and secured the permission of your Agent to close the school until the end of the year. Mrs. Fernie has suggested that she be left as Principal of the School, and that an assistant be secured. This does not meet with our approval. We feel that it would be better to secure a new Principal. Mrs. Fernie, as she has opportunity, will be willing to help in the domestic science work, and I anticipate that our W.M.S. will continue to her the small salary she is now receiving from the Church. It is very essential that we secure a new teacher for that school at once, as there are 33 children on the Reserve that should be attending school. We will be glad to know if you will approve of our securing a new teacher for Moose Mountain School. Kindly let\nus know the remuneration that we may offer. It is not likely that we can secure a qualified teacher for less than $75.00 per month.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H.E.-A.V.\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, December 13, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant informing the Department that you have had word from Mrs. J. Fernie, teacher of the Moose Mountain School, that, because of ill health, she will not be able to continue in the work and asking if the Department will approve of your securing anew teacher for this school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would like you to take the necessary steps to secure a suitable teacher to take charge of this school after the Christmas holidays. To a fully qualified and experienced teacher the Department will be prepared to pay a salary of $75.00 a month for the ten teaching months.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be successful in securing a teacher for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

In her place Miss Morrice has been appointed. Mrs. Fernie is continuing the domestic science work and our Women's Missionary Society is paying her a small remuneration, I think $200 or $300, and she is practically doing the work of a field matron on the Reserve.

McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. McLean -\n\nI have your of Feb. 8th re Mrs. Fernie's position at Moose Mountain. Apparently you have misinterpreted my letter of Feb. 5th. I am sorry if I did not make myself clear.\n\nWe had not thought of asking the Department to pay any portion of Mrs. Fernie's salary. Our Women's Missionary Society is willing to give her $200 in lieu of the work she is doing in domestic science and as field matron at the school, and our Board will probably increase her husband's salary. Our request was that she might have official recognition from the Government and be privileged to receive supplies from the Government storehouse. Apparently it is a rule of the Department that these stores shall be given only to people who have the approval of the Government. I presume all that is necessary would be that the Department authorize Mr. Cory to give supplies to Mrs. Fernie.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 18th, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to say that the Department has been requested by the Missionary Board of the Presbyterian Church to authorize the issue by you of food supplies to Mrs. Fernie, the wife of the Missionary at White Bear's Reserve in order that she may furnish meals for the children of White Bear's school as she did when she was teacher of that school. As Miss Lillian Morris is now the teacher of the said school, the Department wishes an expression of your opinion as to whether it would be advisable to allow Mrs. Fernie to take charge in the manner proposed with respect to the preparation of meals for the children. Possibly it would be in the best interests of the school to have Miss Morris look after this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nTheo. Cory Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of Feb. 18th. No 175/01-1 in regard to supplying Mrs Fernie with food to make the mid day meal for the White Bear school children. I beg to say that I understood from Doctor Strang that the Presbyterian church had entered into an agreement with Mrs Fernie to prepare the meal teach domestic science and do some field work on the reserve at no extra cost to the Indian Department. In the first place I do not think that a better qualified person than Mrs Fernie could possibly be found to do this work, and in the second place Miss Morrice could not do this kind of work as she only has one hand that she can use and there is no big girls who attend the school regularly now that she could oversee. I myself think that it would be a good plan to issue the food to Mrs Fernie and allow her to do the work outlined by Doctor Strang.\n\nI Have The Honour To Be\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Ont\nOttawa, March 5th., 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 25th ultimo, and previous correspondence, relative to arrangements for the issue and preparation of food on behalf of pupils of White Bear's School, I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation in this matter, necessary food for the pupils may be issued to Mrs. Fernie upon the understanding that she will prepare the same for the children without cost to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

My own opinion is this that if the Presbyterian Church cannot secure a young married man one whose wife can help him in the work and who will get out among the Indians and get after them both as a preacher and teacher it would be better to send the children to a residential school.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, November 20, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing the resignation of Miss Lillie Morrise, teacher of the White Bear Indian Day School, to take effect at the close of the present year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Presbyterian Church authorities, under whose auspices this school is conducted, are taking up the matter of securing a suitable teacher to succeed Miss Morrise, and they will no doubt nominate a properly qualified teacher for the position, to begin duties after the present teacher leaves.\n\nThe resignation of Miss Morrise is accepted.

McLean,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nI received yours of Mar. 23rd in which you ask us to find another teacher for White Bear (Moose Mountain) Indian Day school. I am glad to say we have been able to secure Rev. G. A. Hackney who is a man of splendid gifts. He was our minister for a time at Canora, Sask., but has been teaching, I understand for the past year. Kindly let us know if you will approve of his appointment and if you will give a salary of $900. We will have him do a little missionary work on the Reserve and will probably augment his salary by another $900. He will, of course, do far better work than any of the women we could send in there. He is a thoroughly reliable and capable man. We have a mission house there which he could occupy. I am sure this will be much more satisfactory than having these young girls go in for a few months.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Edmison, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church, states that he has been able to secure Rev. G. A. Hackney as teacher of the White Bear (Moose Mountain) Indian Day School and asks to be informed as to whether the Department will provide a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum. Mr. Hackney has been previously employed as a minister and has had teaching experience and Mr. Edmison states that he is a thoroughly reliable and capable man and considers that he would be much more satisfactory than a young girl.\n\nThe former teacher, Miss Morrice, was paid $750.00 per annum and bonus. There was an enrolment of 17 pupils, with an average attendance of 12 during the past year.\n\nMr. Edmison was informed in January, last, when he nominated Miss Walker for the position, that the Department would pay a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum for two hundred teaching days. Miss Walker held a second class professional teacher's certificate, with Normal training, and had spent one year upon first class non-professional work.\n\nI shall be pleased to be advised as to whether the appointment of Rev. G. A. Hackney should be approved, and, if so, whether a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum will be granted, as requested by Rev. Mr. Edmison.\nOttawa, April 12, 1920.\n\nRev.

Hackney as teacher of the White Bear (Moose Mountain) Indian Day School and request to be informed as to what salary will be paid him.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Hackney and will allow him a combined salary and bonus at the rate of $900.00 per annum. Should the bonus not be continued, the Department will guarantee that his salary will remain at $900.00. It is noted that the Presbyterian Church will augment his salary in consideration of the missionary work he will do on the reserve.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state the qualifications and experience which he possesses.\n\nMr. Agent Cory and Mr. Commissioner Graham will be informed of his appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Should the bonus at any time be discontinued, the Department has guaranteed that Mr. Hackney's salary will be paid at the rate of $900.00. Mr. Edmison states that he is a thoroughly reliable and capable man and that they have a mission house on the reserve which he can occupy.

His statement of his qualifications is as follows:\n\n\"I taught for four years in Ontario on the Old Model school Third Class certificate, the fourth year being on a permit granted by the Department of Education. Two years ago I was granted by the Dept. of Education of Saskatchewan a provisional Third Class certificate and a year later, in view of the success of my work, I was granted an interim Second Class certificate which I can make permanent by a short course of reading and the writing of a thesis. This I intend to complete. As to my academic standing, I am an honor graduate in Classics of 1901 of the University of Toronto.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\nIndian Affairs.

As this has not yet come to hand I have been wondering if any report which was placed in the hands of Mr. Corey, Indian Agent on Oct 1st, has come astray and the Government are withholding my salary on this account.\n\nIf this has not been forwarded and there is any good reason for the delay would you be good enough to let me know as soon as possible need of the money.\n\nI would like also to say in this letter that early last spring we purchased readers for use in the school and although Mr. Corey wrote a second time about these they have not come and there is no word of them. We need these badly in order to promote better scholarship.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG. A. MacKee.\nOttawa, November 4, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to your salary as teacher of the White Bear Indian Day School for the quarter ending September 30th, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your salary for this quarter has not yet been paid, as the quarterly return showing the attendance, days taught, etc., has not been received. As you state you forwarded your return to the Agent you should take this matter up with him. As soon as the return is received payment of salary and bonus due will be made. I may say that, as this school is conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church, all cheques in payment of salary are sent to the Treasurer, while cheques for bonus are sent you direct.\n\nWith reference to the readers asked for in your requisition of April 29th, last, I beg to say that these were ordered from the Government Stationery Office, and, as the Department received no further information regarding the matter, it supposed that all supplies asked for by this requisition were received. The attention of the Stationery Office is being drawn to this requisition and they will be requested, if they have not already done so, to forward the readers asked for as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Since it has not yet come to hand I fear that my School report placed in the hands of Mr. Corey, Indian Agent on Oct. 1st, has not reached Ottawa and that the Government are withholding the salary on that account.\n\nWould you be good enough to let me know if there is any good reason for this delay in the forwarding of the money as I need it urgently.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) G.A.

Hackney, teacher of the White Bear Indian Day School, regarding his salary for the quarter ending September 30th, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a communication was received from Mr. Hackney regarding this matter and he was informed that the reason no payment of salary had been made was that the quarterly return, showing the attendance and days taught for the above named quarter, had not been received. He was also informed that as soon as the return reached the Department payment of the salary and bonus due would be made.

Original on 178701-7.\n\nI visited this school on the afternoon of the 25th, and as far as reading, writing and spelling are concerned, they are doing alright, but the girls are not being taught anything in the way of domestic science and calisthenics are not being taught at all.\n\nThe Department spent $800.00 in fixing up a kitchen and bathroom and the whole thing is not being made use of at all. With only a male teacher to do the work, a lot of it is bound to be neglected.\n\nIf the Department does not think that it would be advisable to give the teacher a female assistant, I would advise the Department to send every child that is fit to go, away to a boarding school.\n\nThos. Cory,\nAgent\nOttawa, March 11, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the White Bear's Indian Day School for the month of February, last.\n\nIn reference to the teaching of Domestic science I beg to say that, as the teacher is a single man, having been nominated by the Presbyterian Church authorities, he is not qualified to give this instruction, and, at the present time, the Department is not prepared to pay the salary and expenses involved in securing the services of a female assistant.\n\nWith reference to the teaching of calisthenics, it is expected that the teacher will see that regular instruction is given to the pupils in physical exercises. A copy of Calisthenics and Games prescribed for use in all Indian schools is being sent you, under separate cover, which you will be good enough to give to the teacher for his guidance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Some of the larger boys will come for a few days and then stay home for a whole week and the teacher never reports to me that they are not coming to school.\n\nI am going to warn them that if they do not attend at least fairly regular that they will be sent to some residential school. I think myself that a residential school is the proper place for them if they are going to learn anything worth while.\n\nThos. Cory\n\nAgt.\nOTTAWA, February 10th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nIt is noted from your report on the White Bear's Indian day school for the month of January, last, that the attendance is very irregular, especially among the larger boys. It is also noted that you have issued a warning to them that unless their attendance is more regular they will be placed in residential schools.\n\nIt is hoped that, as a result of your warning, there will be a more regular attendance. If not, you should inform the Department of the names and ages of the pupils who persistently remain away from school. The names and religion of the parents should also be forwarded. The Department will then be in a position to decide as to the advisability of having them sent to residential schools of the denominations to which they belong.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Mr. Commissioner Graham, in a covering letter accompanying the nurse's report, has suggested that the school be closed and the children of school age assigned to residential schools.\n\nI am requesting a full report on school matters at this time, and in this connection would refer you to official letter of this file number, dated the 10th ultimo.\n\nUpon receipt of your answering communication, the Department will be in a position to make a decision as to what should be done in connection with the education of the Moose Mountain Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

It is noted that there is an appalling number of illegitimate children and your suggestion is that the school be closed and that all of school age be assigned to boarding schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that in Mr. Agent Cory's report of the 8th instant, on the White Bear Indian Day School, he drew the Department's attention to the irregular attendance on the part of some of the older boys. He, however, intimated that a general warning has been given to the parents and he is hopeful of a better attendance at the day school.\n\nThe Department has written to Mr. Agent Cory, to the effect that if there is no improvement in school conditions, he should furnish us with the names and ages of the pupils who persistently remain away from school. The Department will then be in a position to decide as to the advisability of having them sent to residential schools. I am writing to the agent again, asking him to keep a close check on school matters at this time and, if the conditions warrant it, the White Bear school on the Moose Mountain reserve will have to be closed and the children of school age sent to boarding schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

A meeting was held of the Indian Council and all parties interested, and it was unanimously agreed that every effort be put forth to increase the attendance and ensure greater regularity. Already since the attendance has more than doubled and 6 more are expected to begin after Easter.\n\nI confidently expect that our seating capacity will be taxed when school is resumed after the holidays.\n\nDuring the past 6 months the work has been\nMost disheartening to me owing to the non-attendance of several who should have been in school and the irregularity of others and I had come to the conclusion that the closing of the school was the only wise course. However, by present appearance, it would seem to be advisable to give the Indians a chance for the balance of the present term to prove the sincerity of their good conduct and actions. I think Mr. Muriel will bear me out in the assertion that those in attendance have been making good progress.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just been met by a deputation of Indians from the White Bear Reserve who seem to be in a great way about their school at this reserve. They are afraid that same is going to be closed on account of the attendance during the past winter being very small.\n\nNow as I am somewhat interested in the Indians and have often times consulted with them in some of their little troubles, they have asked me to write to your dept. giving their side of the trouble.\n\nThey state that the reason that the attendance was so small the past winter was on account of sickness of the children and the stormy weather during Feb., which was a very bad month for storms in this district.\n\nThey do not want their school closed as there are a lot of children there who need the education. They have asked me to state that if the school is not to be closed that they will see that the attendance is kept up to standard both in winter and summer.\n\nI do not know that this letter will bear any weight with your Dept., but do hope that your Dept. can see their way clear to keep this school open. I am writing this letter as a favor to the Indians and hope to hear from you at your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJustice of the Peace\nCarlyle.\nOttawa, April 25, 1922.\n\nDear Chief:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the petition of yourself and other Indians of the White Bear band, dated the 6th instant, regarding the irregular attendance at the White Bear Indian Day School, and asking that this school be continued.\n\nIn view of the promise made by yourself and the Indian parents who have signed this petition that, if this school is continued, all the children of school age will attend regularly in future, it has been decided to allow it to remain in operation. We are informing Mr. Agent Cory accordingly, also the teacher.\n\nThe continuance of this school rests entirely in the hands of the Indian parents. It will be maintained as long as a regular attendance of Indian children is kept up; but, if the children of the band do not take advantage of the facilities offered, and the attendance falls off, we will have no option but to close the school. In that case, the children will have to be placed in residential schools of the faith to which they belong. We confidently expect that you will use your influence to see that the Indian children attend regularly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nChief Jimmie Big Stone,\nMoose Mountain Agency,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nOttawa, April 25, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:-\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the attendance of the Indian children at the White Bear Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that the parents have agreed to make every effort to increase and maintain the attendance, if the school is continued. A petition has been received from the Indians of the band, in which they, also, promise to see that the children of school age attend regularly.\n\nIn view of the promises made by the Indians, the Department has decided to allow this school to remain in operation - its continuance to depend entirely upon the attendance that is maintained. We are today writing Chief Jimmy Big Stone, informing him that, if the Indians desire to have the school continued, it rests entirely with them to see that their children attend, otherwise we will have no option but to close it and place the children in residential schools. It is hoped that the Indians now see the advantage of continuing the school and that there will be no future trouble as regards irregular attendance.\n\nWe are informing both Mr. Agent Gerber and Mr. Commissioner Graham of our decision to allow this school to remain in operation, as long as there is a sufficient number of Indian children in attendance to warrant the expenditure incurred in keeping it open. You may inform the Indians that its continuance rests entirely in their own hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. G. A. Hackney,\nTeacher, White Bear Indian Day School,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nOttawa, April 25, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the White Bear Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say, in view of the reports that have recently been received as to the intention of the Indians to see that their children attend regularly if this school is maintained, we have decided to continue its operation for a further period. We are informing the Chief and Indians, however, that the continuance of the school rests entirely in their own hands, and if they allow the attendance to drop off to such a point that it would not warrant the expense involved in keeping the school open, we will have no other recourse but to close it and place the children in residential schools of the faith to which the parents belong.\n\nIt is hoped that the action taken and the intention previously expressed to the Indians that this school will be closed has awakened them to the value of the facilities provided for the education of their children and that in future there will be no complaints as to the attendance.\n\nI have to thank you for the interest you have taken on behalf of the Indians in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. F. Cornell, Esq.,\nJustice of the Peace,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nOttawa, April 26, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer again to official letter to you of the 28th of March, last, regarding the school conditions and attendance at the White Bear Indian Day School.\n\nReports have recently been received from the teacher, the Chief and a number of Indians, also from Mr. R. F. Cornell, Justice of the Peace, Carlyle, Sask., all advising the continuation of the school in operation. The Indians have promised to see that a regular attendance is maintained.\n\nWe have therefore decided to keep the school open as long as the attendance warrants our doing so. The Indians have been informed that the continuance of this school rests entirely in their own hands and unless they see that a regular attendance is maintained, we will have no option but to close the school and place the children in residential schools.\n\nWe have informed both Mr. Agent Cory and the teacher of our decision. In their petition, the Indians definitely promised to see that the attendance is kept up to standard both in winter and summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, April 26, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has recently received a petition from Chief Jimmy Big Stone and a number of the other Indians on the White Bear reserve, as well as from the teacher and Mr. R. F. Cornell, Justice of the Peace, Carlyle, Sask., regarding the closing of the school on that reserve.\n\nThese two gentlemen, in their letters, state that the Indians have approached them with a view to their taking up with the Department the question of continuing the school. The Indians themselves in their petition have promised to see that a regular attendance of the Indian children of school age is maintained, if the school is kept open.\n\nIn view of these reports, it seems advisable to the Department to give this school another chance, and it is, therefore, to remain in operation as long as the attendance warrants its continuance. It is hoped that the recent action taken in this matter has shown the Indians the value of the facilities provided for the education of their children.\n\nWe are informing the Chief that the continuation of the school rests entirely in the hands of the Indian parents, and if a regular attendance is not maintained, we will have no option but to close the school and place the children in residential schools. We have also written the teacher accordingly and are informing Mr. Commissioner Graham of our decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nThos. Cory, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nMoose Mountain Agency,\nCarlyle, Sask.\n\nJune 15th, 1923\n\nReport on the above Agency for June, 1923\n\nVisited the school, found a very average attendance. On the whole do not think the day school a big success in preparing the children for the future. They spend about five hours a day in school and often stay away for weeks at a stretch, the parents not exerting themselves in sending them to school. And then when they are at home they are living under such filthy conditions that all the school work other than the little bit of English is wasted and parents on this Reserve are not much good in teaching their children clean habits. Consider the children going to school here, if they were in boarding school for several years and taught to be clean one would find a great improvement in the coming generation on this Reserve. As it is, the home influence to be dirty is too strong for a day school. About fourteen children is the average attendance here with the weather is good. The roll call is about 24.\n\nANNIE M. LeDREW, R.N.\nTravelling Nurse\nOttawa, August 18, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you, relative to the advisability of continuing the White Bear Indian Day School during the coming academic year.

In regard to closing the day school on the reserve. First I must tell you that this letter did not reach me until the 25th of August, and at a very busy time. I would give the Indian parents one more chance to make good on their promises, and if they fall down on them again I would most assuredly close the school, and send the children of school age to the residential schools. There will be about twenty White Bear children in the different boarding and industrial schools this winter, leaving 20 for the day school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir;\n\nObedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCarlyle, Sask.\n\nSept 8th 23\n\nThe Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere was handed to me recently from your Department a letter to the local agent Mr. D. Cory re the matter of closing the White Bear Day School at the end of the Academic year. It was stated in this letter that a similar communication was being sent to myself. I have not as yet received any letter from you re this matter and, as an interested party, am anxious to know the Government's intentions.\n\nI have just completed the first week of the fall term with an average attendance of 15. The prospects are good for a successful fall term as there is an evident enthusiasm on the part of the parents etc about the prospect of having the children back again.\n\nI believe that letters have come forward\nfrom the Indians with a plea for the retention of the school.\n\nI have consulted with Mr. Corp as to the advisability of your proposal and we are afraid that at the present with the Indians in a rather ugly mood such a step might have serious consequences.\n\nAs you are aware, a considerable part of the crop on the reserve from last year was not threshed till this spring and some of it was burned as useless.\n\nThis, coupled with other things, has not improved the Indians' temper.\n\nBesides this we feel that with their present apparent determination to do better in the matter of attendance good work can be done.\n\nIf it seems wise to you to have me carry on please let me know at an early date that I may secure necessary supplies for our work.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is a day school being conducted, with a good teacher in charge, and it is hoped that you and the Indian parents will see that the children of school age attend this school regularly each day it is in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChief Jimmy,\nMoose Mountain Reserve,\nCarlyle P.O., Sask.\nOct. 2, 1923.\n\nTo the Secretary General of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Bldgs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Indians including the Chief and Council of the White Bear Reserve, Moose Mountain, Sask., have forwarded a Petition to the Department for the purpose of obtaining new regulations in connection with the education of their children and to have a school established at the White Bear Reserve with Teachers, so that their children can go to school on the Reserve instead of having their children sent away from their home at an early age to school at Round Lake, File Hills, or Qu'Appelle. The Indians who have signed the Petition have requested me to write a letter to the Department in furtherance of their interest in having a school established with competent Teachers who can conduct the School with proper discipline for the older boys and girls on the Reserve and who can give the necessary instruction so that the Parents may have their children at home with them on the Reserve. This fall a number of the Indians on the Reserve were strongly opposed to their boys being sent away to one of the schools mentioned above. In some cases they stated their boys were Seventeen years of age, and they wanted them to remain home to work until the threshing was done, and in some cases the Parents were too old to work, and had no other help, and so they wished them to remain at home instead of being sent away to a school off the Reserve at the commencement of the school term. I have given attention to a number of matters during the past twenty years at this point of interest to the Indians, and have rendered them such services; to assist them at any time I was able to\ndo so, but I have always made it clear to them that I could not in no cases advise or direct them in connection with any matters within the Jurisdiction of Mr. Cory at the Indian Agent on the White Bear Reserve. This is a matter however of Policy, and is one I think should be taken up by the Department in the interest of these Indians. A number of cases have come before me this fall unsought for in connection with the Indians, and they feel very badly about having their children sent away to school off the Reserve, and they wish to keep their children with them, in some cases they related that some of their children who had been sent away to school died there. They do not attach any blame to the authorities for such accidents, but they say they want to keep their children at home and have them educated on the Reserve. I can understand the difficulty in the way of this will be to get a Teacher who can enforce the proper discipline over the older Boys and girls in a school on the Reserve, and also to educate the parents to the necessity of keeping their children at School, if they are educated at a school on their own Reserve. I feel satisfied that it would remove a source of considerable discontent of a number of the Indians on the White Bear Reserve if a School could be established on this Reserve where the children of the Indians could be educated, as the Parents have a dread of sending their children away from home to attend School, and they seem to have a very strong natural love for their children and wish to keep them at home, and at the same time, they say they are anxious to have their children educated, and they wish the authorities to look into this matter and see if some solution cannot be made to establish a school on the Reserve where\ntheir children can attend and receive the necessary education and discipline. On behalf of the Petitioners I wish to add that I believe this is that/a matter of such importance the Department should give early and the necessary consideration to, in the interests of the Indians on this Reserve, and their children, and if possible to find some solution whereby the difficulty mentioned can be overcome, as it is a difficulty that will arise at the commencement of each school term unless some way can be found to establish a school on this Reserve where the children can be educated. In conference with these Indians all I could say to them is that I will be pleased to write the Department a letter explaining their position as far as I could and requesting the Department to kindly look into this matter and if possible grant them such relief as the Department deems best and can grant them. I thank you in anticipation of an acknowledgment at your earliest convenience, and oblige.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW.H.Williams,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-1, part 1)\nOttawa, Oct. 16, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Williams:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, in which you support the petition the Department has received from certain members of the Indian band on the Moose Mountain Indian Reserve. As you are no doubt aware, the Department, in conjunction with the Presbyterian Church, conduct the White Bear Indian Day School on this reserve, and further, we offer those children, who are eligible, opportunities for a residential school education at the nearest suitable boarding and industrial schools.\n\nOur petitioners urge the erection, on their reserve, of a residential school; but the number of pupils available for such an institution is far too small for the Department to give favourable consideration. Even if funds were available for small residential schools with a pupilage of 25 or 30, it would not be economical or wise to try to conduct schools of this size.\n\nI am grateful for the interest you have taken in the welfare of the youth of our wards.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nH. H. Williams, Esq., B. A.,\nBarrister,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nOct. 22, 1925.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Bldgs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Your File 113-1-1\n\nI have your letter of the 16th inst., herein explaining the way in which the Department regards the matter of effecting a residential School on the Moose Mountain Indian Reserve on account of the small number of Pupils available, and I quite well understand that the Department could not come to any other conclusion, but what the parents of the Indian children on this Reserve so strongly object to is to having their young children compelled to go to school and to be sent away a long distance to Indian Schools on other Reserves, so that they are unable to see them without making a long trip, and in some cases a number of children of these Indians have died while away at School, and so they feel very badly to have to send their children away, and they believe that they could be all taught in the present school on the Reserve by enlarging same and procuring another teacher or teachers and enlarging the school which would not be a very great expense. And moreover, there is a lot in the contention these Indians in their Petition when they say that their boys who have attained to the age of Sixteen or Seventeen years should not be taken away from them and compelled to go to School on other Reserves while their parents require them at home during the fall term to help\nthem complete their harvest and do their threshing. You have not mentioned this fact in your letter that the Indian Agent has authority to compel these children to go to school and to send them away to schools on other Reserves without the consent of the parents. I mention these matters so that you may have the facts fairly before you and am of opinion that something should be done in the interest of both the parents and children on this Reserve to remove this feeling of unrest and dissatisfaction caused by having their children sent away to School in the manner above mentioned. I thank you in anticipation of a further acknowledgment, and oblige.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.H. Williams\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-1, part 1)\nOttawa, Oct. 29, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Williams:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with further reference to the complaints of certain members of the Indian Band on the Moose Mountain Indian Reserve. I have noted that some parents object to sending their children away to residential schools.\n\nIn reply I wish to inform you that the Indian Act provides for the compulsory attendance of Indian children at the nearest available school of the type considered most suitable; and the Department must not allow the complaints of parents to interfere with the training of the children. We are trying to provide a good academic and vocational education at Indian residential schools, and, when accommodation can be found for a pupil, I believe nothing should interfere with his opportunity to become a useful member of his community.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Mr. Hackney states that, if consent is given to the closing of the school for the two weeks mentioned, he could arrange to open for the fall term on or about August 15th.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Hackney that this matter is being left in your hands to decide. If you consider that it would be in no way detrimental to the best interests of the school work, you may grant him leave at the time desired by him, and arrange, if such leave is granted, that he re-open school after the summer holidays in sufficient time to make up for the period lost in June. Kindly inform the Department as to the action taken, and, if leave is granted him, the dates between which it is taken, also the date on which the school will re-open after the summer holidays in order to make up for the time lost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Scott, Deputy Supt. General of your Department in October last with reference to a Petition which had been forwarded by Certain Members of the Indian Band on the Moose Mountain Indian Reserve for the erection of a Residential School on the Reserve of the Petitioners. The Department could not consider the erection of such a school owing to the fact that there would be a very small number, possibly twenty-five or thirty available for such a school. I wish you to please let me know what are the regulations of the Department with reference to school attendance of the Boys and girls at the Residential Schools consisting of Boarding and Industrial Schools. From time to time a number of Indians here at this time of year object to their children being sent away to these Residential Schools, chiefly on the ground however that they have already been sent to these Schools for in some cases three years or more, and that some of these children are as much as Seventeen years of age and over. I have no Knowledge of the regulations of the Department as to the compulsory attendance of the children of these Indians at such schools, or whether there is any age limit for such attendance. These Indians always make the claim that they require their children at home to work in cases where the father and mother are old, and have no other children, and they also claim that they should not be compelled...\nto attend these schools and sent away from home to Residential Schools for a longer period than three years, or after attaining to the age of Sixteen or Seventeen years. I wish you would kindly forward me shortly the regulations of the Department with reference to such attendance at the Residential Schools, so that I can readily give the Indians the benefit of same, and greatly oblige. I have no doubt that the Agent here simply follows the Regulations, in fact, I am sure he does, so, but you will oblige me by letting me have a copy of same for my convenience. I thank you in anticipation of a prompt acknowledgement, adding any information you can that will assist me herein.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.H. Williams\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-1, part 1)\nOttawa, Sept. 4, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Williams:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the regulations governing the education of Indian children. There is being forwarded to you, under separate cover, a copy of the Indian Act and I wish to refer you to Sections 9 and 10.\n\nYou will note that the Statute provides for the compulsory education of Indian children between the ages of 7 and 15 years. Every effort is made to have the children remain in school until they are 18. You will understand that this is in the best interests of the boys and girls themselves. At the residential schools both academic and vocational training is offered. The atmosphere is that of a Christian home and I consider it of vital importance that the children remain until they are 18 years of age.\n\nI am sure that you will use your influence among the parents on the reserve to assist the Department's programme which, I trust, will result in useful members of the future Indian communities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. H. Williams, Esq., B. A.,\nBarrister,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nWHITE LAKE INDIAN SCHOOL\n\nI visited this school on October 29th. The Reverend G. A. Hackney, B.A., is in charge as teacher. He has a second class interim certificate for Saskatchewan.\n\nBuildings:\n\nI found the school in a very clean and tidy condition. It has been newly painted this summer. Some inexpensive repairs are required to the foundation. It was pointed out to me that the soft water tank under the kitchen required repairs. It is a plank tank with a galvanized iron lining. It is almost impossible to prevent this class of tank from leaking, and in any event it would be a waste of money to endeavour to keep this tank in shape as the building is only inhabited during the daytime. It would freeze up at night and no tank could be kept in proper repair under those conditions. I cannot see, under present conditions, that this tank is required during the winter months. They can carry sufficient water for drinking and washing purposes, and in the summer possibly a small galvanized iron tank to catch rain water would be useful.\n\nThe kitchen is not being used. Midday meal is prepared by Mrs. Hackney in her own home, which is quite close to the school. I pointed out to the principal and the Agent how they could repair the foundation without calling in the services of a stone mason. A couple of sacks of cement is all that would be required, and the Farmer or some handy man could do the work.\n\nEnrolment:\n\nThere are 19 pupils on the roll, 14 boys and 5 girls. The average attendance for the last quarter was 14.5 and during the month of October the average attendance was 14. There were 10 boys and 5 girls present on the day of my visit. I found them fairly well clad and fairly clean. The pupils were examined in reading and spelling. I found that the junior boys spoke up very well. Those in the senior grades did not speak very distinctly. Mr. Hackney impressed me as being an earnest and capable teacher. It is, however, very difficult to obtain satisfactory progress in a school such as this, situated on a reserve where the home conditions are so unprogressive. Some of the pupils are very tardy in the mornings. I think that possibly if the Agent would take the matter of attendance in hand, this condition might be improved. I pointed out to him that we cannot expect a teacher to be in his classroom during school hours and at the same time out on the reserve chasing delinquent pupils.\nOttawa, November 28th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, in a report on his inspection of the White Bear Indian Day School, draws attention to the attendance. In this connection he states that it is very difficult for the teacher to make satisfactory progress as the pupils are very tardy in the mornings.\n\nIt is considered that if you would take the matter of attendance in hand this condition might be improved. You should inform the Indian parents that it is expected they will see that their children arrive at the school in time in the mornings and that they attend regularly each day school is in operation. It cannot be expected that the teacher will leave the classroom in order to be out on the reserve to round up delinquent pupils.

I wrote to the Agent to ascertain for what reason this action was taken and he forwards a letter received from Dr. C.H. Stapleford, that acting in his dual capacity as Department Health Officer and as Health Officer for the Rural Municipality of Moose Mountain, he closed the school as the wife of the teacher had an attack of Influenza, and he did not think it wise for the teacher or his children to attend school while Influenza existed in their home.\n\nI placed myself in communication with the Department of Public Health here who concur in my opinion that the action in closing the school was unnecessary, and Dr. C.H.

The grades for the Indian children range from I to IV. The work examined was fair. The reading, I considered, showed a marked improvement since my last inspection. The children appeared fairly clean.\n\nThe classroom was tidy and clean, except the washbasins and bench on which the basins are kept for use. I noticed these children did not wash before lunch and in mentioning it to Mr. Kerr, he said it would take too much time. I explained that I considered this part of the school training. These children need training in hygiene, perhaps more than anything else, and are receiving practically none.\n\nThe soup for the noon-day meal is made by Mrs. Kerr in her home and brought over and served to the children, along with biscuits. The dishes are then returned and attended to by Mrs. Kerr.\n\nI might add this school is provided with a nice kitchen supplied with a stove and table. Two rooms adjoin it, one is supplied with a large white sink for dishwashing and also a pump for soft water. The other\nDepartment as these rooms are only used for storage and are not even kept clean and tidy.\n\nThe discipline was good, and the children appeared interested in their work. Eleven were present the day I inspected the school. In looking back over the register, I found the attendance to average about 13. Colds and sickness of various kinds appeared to be the cause for lack of attendance.\n\nThe school has received some repairs since my last visit. The windows were closed on the children's right and all the light now comes in over their left shoulder. This repair work has not yet been painted.\n\nThe fence about the school is in a disgraceful condition. Many of the posts have rotted off and the wire is badly bent and twisted. This fence should be re-built and the yard enlarged. At present the school is only fenced on two sides, the remaining two have no protection and the windows are liable to be broken at any time by stray horses. If new material were used it would require about 40 cedar posts and 40 rods of wire. By using some of the old wire, 30 rods of new wire would be sufficient.\n\nThe garden ground appeared rather lumpy and Mr. Kerr claims it is infested with twitch grass. I think this ground should be seeded next year to grass and used as a play ground. A new garden plot could be secured at the rear of the school. The ground should be broken and made ready this year. The garden would also be included within the new portion fenced.\n\nThe school is in need of painting, both inside and out. I believe the roof is also in need of\nsome new shingles, and the chimney needs some repair work. I might say the school presented a rather neglected appearance, and I would be glad if the above improvements could be carried out.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nsome new shingles, and the chimney needs some repair work. I might say the school presented a rather neglected appearance, and I would be glad if the above improvements could be carried out.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the White Bear Indian Day School, which was visited by Mr. Hamilton on May 23rd.\n\nI would draw your attention to what the Inspector says regarding the children not washing before the noonday meal. It seems to me that this is nothing more or less than straight neglect, and I think the Teacher should be severely criticised. There is no reason why these children should not wash before having their meal. No doubt they come to school in a dirty condition, and if the Principal knew his business he would insist on their having a proper wash once a day.\n\nYou will note what the Inspector says regarding the condition in which he found the fence. In this connection I may say that the Teacher has plenty of time on his hands, and there are lots of willow pickets that can be had close at hand with which to repair this fence, and still we find the fence in this disgraceful condition. These people expect the Department to make every move that is made in the way of upkeep, and I believe if a doorknob fell off they would call upon the Department to have it fixed.\n\n-I would-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI would also draw your attention to what is said regarding the garden. Surely with all the land that is available around the school this condition should not exist. It really looks to me as though things were being allowed to go from bad to worse.\n\nThe Inspector states that the school is in need of painting, but I hesitate to recommend that it be painted while it is under such management.\n\nI have instructed the Agent to have Mr. Kerr fix the fence himself, and also to arrange to get a garden plot broken. I do not think it is our business to do this.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, June 26, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his recent visit to the White Bear Indian Day School. I have to request that you will draw to the attention of the teacher the following remarks of the Inspector:\n\nHe states that while the classroom was tidy and clean, the wash basins and the bench upon which they are kept were not in a cleanly condition; further, that the teacher did not have the children wash before lunch. The teacher should insist upon cleanliness of person among the pupils, and, as there are facilities provided for the purpose, he should see that the children wash up before partaking of lunch.\n\nHe further states that the soup for the noonday meal is made by Mrs. Kerr in her home, brought over and served to the children and the dishes are then returned and attended to by Mrs. Kerr. This school is provided with a kitchen and supplied with a stove and table. Two rooms adjoin it, one of which is supplied with a large white sink for dish-washing and a pump for soft water, and the other is equipped with a good enamel bath and looking glass. These rooms are only used for storage and are not even kept clean and tidy\u2014all of which is wasted effort. The teacher should be instructed to see that these rooms are kept clean and tidy, and it is not understood why the preparation of the midday lunch could not be carried out in the room for that purpose. You should draw this matter to the attention of the teacher and have him carry out the above requirements of the Department.\n\nThe Inspector states, further, that the fence about the school is in a disgraceful condition, as many of the posts have rotted off, and the wire is badly bent and twisted. We understand that you have been instructed by Mr. Commissioner Graham to have the teacher, himself, fix the fence and arrange to have a garden plot broken.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you regarding the above requirements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We are requesting Mr. Agent Stephenson to take up with the teacher the various matters mentioned by the Inspector as requiring attention.\n\nWe have noted what the Inspector says regarding the condition of the fence, also that you have instructed the agent to have the teacher, himself, fix the fence. Should any fencing material be required, such as wire, posts, etc., you may arrange to supply same.\n\nRegarding the painting; the repairs to the roof and the chimney, if you consider that this work should be carried out before the cold weather next fall, I shall be pleased to have your recommendation, together with an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your No. 113-1-1 of the 26th ultimo with reference to the situation at the White Bear Indian Day School, and note that you are communicating with the Indian Agent concerning various matters mentioned by Inspector A.G. Hamilton.\n\nIn regard to the question of painting and repairs, this work can be carried out later on in the year when the building programme at the Agency is under way, as there will be a painter there and whatever work of this nature may be required at the school can then be more economically done.\n\nYou have made no reference to the teacher, himself, who is the main cause of the conditions that exist at the school, which I consider are a result of his poor management. I think Mr. Kerr should be at least warned that the Department require and expect better results from him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCarlyle, Sask.\nJuly 8th 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 113-1-1 of June 26th relative to some of the conditions at the Day School in this Agency and I am taking the matters up with Mr Kerr as instructed. In connection with the preparation of the noon-day lunch I beg to refer you to my report for the month of November last and to your letter 113-1-5 of December 30th on this subject. I conveyed to Mr Kerr the instructions of the Department which were contained in that letter but apparently he has chosen to ignore them. Mr Kerr evidently believes that his duties consist merely of imparting instruction in the classroom from 9 a.m. to noon and from 1.30 p.m. to 4 p.m., he would even go to the house at recess instead of keeping an eye on the children during that period.\n\nWith reference to the garden at the school I sent the Agency man and team to plow this in the spring and sent an Indian to disc it. The children put in the seeds and have been hoeing and weeding under Mr Kerr's supervision during certain afternoons. I am of the opinion that with constant cultivation the present plot can be brought into better condition.\n\nI have requested Mr Kerr to repair the fence around the school and garden, and will advise you when the work has been carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.W.

I am firmly of the opinion that much better results could be obtained with the Indian children by employing a teacher whose interests would be teaching only, and who would be solely under the control of the Indian Department and separate from Church work.\n\nField Matrons' fort being established for 1929.

To do this I have to secure permission from your department, I believe. I hereby respectfully request your department to grant such permission.\n\nThis method of raising money for mission purposes has the approval of our church.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. B.

Kerr, Missionary on the White Bear Indian reserve, for permission to sell to the Indians of this reserve some of the clothing forwarded to him by the church for distribution among these Indians.\n\nAs I understand it this clothing is donated by societies or associations connected with the church for free distribution and not for sale. Mr. Kerr states that he would only make sales to able-bodied Indians who would be able to pay. It seems to me, however, that this practice might not only lend itself to abuse but might result, as it did in one other instance in which your church was interested in the Portage la Prairie agency, in complaints from the Indians themselves.\n\nI thought I should have your views before replying to Mr. Kerr.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nThe United Church of Canada\nMissions to Canadian Indians\n\nREV.

C.B. Kerr BA, the Missionary Teacher at White Bear near Carlyle, Sask., asking permission of the Department to sell certain articles of clothing to the able bodied men. I trust the Department will grant his request for the following reasons.\n\nThe Woman's Missionary Society of our Church has a Department which prepares and forwards bales of clothing to the Indian Missions. Our practice is to seek the sick, the aged and the school children fitting them with suitable garments. To make a small charge to cover the tendency to pauperize them. Any monies collected are credited as subscription to Missionary funds or spent in providing good reading for the people. In this way the people secure good clothing at a very moderate price and at the same time they are encouraged to take part in the upkeep of the Mission. In this\n\nIndian Affairs.

I understand that the Rev. Mr. Barnet, who is Superintendent of Indian Missions for the United Church of Canada, has already written in regard to this matter.\n\nThe method suggested by the Rev. C. B. Kerr, I believe, has been the practice for many years. During the time that I was Superintendent of Missions in Saskatchewan I feel quite sure that this was the usual custom among missionaries.\n\nI realize the difficulties in dealing with matters such as these, but I quite agree with Mr. Kerr that perhaps too much has been done in the way of pauperising the Indians by the Church.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCGY/WAN\nNovember 3rd, 1928.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThis is to advise you that the Department has granted Rev. C. B.

In the past in other districts it has given rise to friction and I hope that there will be no cause for complaint so far as the White Bear reserve is concerned.

INDIAN AGENT STEPHENSON,\nFOR THE MONTH OF MAY, 1929, ON THE WHITE BEAR'S\nINDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 113-1-7.\n\nThe present teacher, Rev. C.B. Kerr, is leaving\nthis reserve at the end of June and new arrangements\nhave been made for teaching and mission work here. I\nam informed that Miss Anderson of Manor has been\nappointed as teacher and that Miss Ferguson has been\nappointed as a deaconess. The Department is, however,\ndoubtless familiar with the new arrangements so that\nit is unnecessary for me to go further into them in\nthis report. Conditions at the school have been rather\nunsatisfactory for the past month owing, probably, to\nMr. Kerr's anxiety as to his future.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR A. G. HAMILTON,\nREGINA, SASK., on WHITE BEAR INDIAN DAY SCHOOL,\nReport dated June 15, 1929, forwarded through\nCommissioner Graham's Office.\n\nOriginal on 113-1-5.\n\nMr. C. B. Kerr, the teacher, who has been\nin charge for the past two years, will be leaving at the\nend of the present term, and I understand that a lady is\nbeing appointed by the Church to work with Miss Ferguson,\na Deaconess, who is also appointed by the Church. I\nhave no doubt that this change will be an improvement\nas I found it very difficult for Mr. Kerr to adapt\nhimself to the teaching of Indian children. No doubt,\nif this change is made, some repair work will be\nneeded to the kitchen in connection with the school.\nAs pointed out in previous reports, this kitchen has\nnever been used since Mr. Kerr was placed in charge,\nand the children receive no instruction in the\npreparation of meals or in the washing of dishes. No\ndoubt the new teacher and deaconess will wish to carry\nout this line of work and this will necessitate a\ncertain amount of repair work.\n\nOn 11-113\nMiss Ferguson has been\nappointed field worker.\nOttawa, June 25, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to official letter of October 11th and to Rev. Mr. Barner's reply of December 5th, last, with reference to the White Bear Indian Day School.

STEPHENSON, FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, 1930,\nON THE WHITE BEAR INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 115-1-7.\n\nI have discussed with the teacher the advisability of shortening the summer vacation by at least two weeks and adding two weeks to the Christmas holidays, for the reason that a much better attendance can be obtained during the summer than is possible during the cold weather and, usually, stormy weather in January. The teacher agrees to this arrangements if the Department will sanction it.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Agent Stephenson's report on the White Bear Indian Day School for the month of May, and would draw your attention to his remarks regarding holidays. Personally I think the children should have the full time allotted to them during the summer months. I think that a Teacher in an Indian Day School requires all the holidays she can get during the summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 306-11 of the 13th instant, enclosing Mr. Agent Stevenson's report for the month of May on the White Bear Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to the Agent's remarks regarding holidays, I have to say that the Department is not disposed to make any change in the regular holiday period at this school. The teacher will find the Department's regulations regarding holidays printed on the back of the daily register, and these should be complied with in all respects. I shall be pleased if you will advise the Agent accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

This family lives at a distance of about 4\u00bd miles from the school and contains another boy of school age. Owing to the difficulty experienced in securing the regular attendance of the children of this family at the pay School I have suggested to the father that he place the two boys in the Brandon School as soon as it is open and to this he has consented.\n\nThe other pupils in the pay School have made good progress with the exception of Archie Akachuck\u2014this boy is very slow to learn and has made little progress during the last three years.\n\nMiss Anderson has notified me that she has received an intimation from the W.M.S. of the United Church that they wish to place a missionary-teacher at this school who will assist the deaconess in work on the reserve out of school hours and also be company for the latter at week ends and during holidays.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the White Bear Indian Day School inspected January 23rd, 1931.\n\nThe roll calls for twenty-four pupils and I found fourteen girls and six boys present. The grades range as follows:\n\nGrade 1 - 16\n\" 11 - 4\n\" 111 - 4\n\nThe attendance all through January has been excellent, and would average about twenty.\n\nSince my last inspection Miss Williams has been appointed as teacher and is doing excellent work. The children speak out well, something they could never do before. They appeared well along in their grades, and I believe are interested in their work.\n\nThe kitchen and dining-room at the rear of the school is now being used and Miss Williams instructs the girls in the preparation of the noon-day lunch and in the washing and cleaning up of the dishes, a training which is of untold value to these Indians. I noted that each child had a towel and tooth brush and these are used each day. At noon every child is made to wash and comb their hair, and I must say the children looked the best I have ever seen them.\n\nThe boys split the wood necessary for the range in the kitchen and are taught to do a number of other chores.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nchores which arise in connection with a school such as this.\n\nThe noon lunch consists of soup made from meat and vegetables and biscuits. Rice is sometimes cooked in the place of soup and this is served with milk.\n\nThe school is in good repair, and the class room was neat and tidy.\n\nAs stated above, a great improvement has been made here and undoubtedly Miss Williams is well qualified for the position.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sir:\n\nThe Department has received, through the office of Mr. Commissioner Graham, Regina, a report made by Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his recent inspection of the White Bear Indian Day School in the Moose Mountain Agency. In his report, the Inspector states as follows:\n\n\"Since my last inspection Miss Williams has been appointed as teacher and is doing excellent work. --- Great improvement has been made here and, undoubtedly, Miss Williams is well qualified for the position.\"\n\nThe Department has received no intimation of the appointment of Miss Williams. In official letter dated July 24, 1930, the Department approved of the appointment of Miss Ruth Nelson as teacher of this school, and we understand she began duties when the school reopened after the summer holidays, about September 2, last. I should be pleased to have, at an early date, full particulars regarding the appointment of Miss Williams, as well as her Christian name, qualifications and the date she began duties.\n\nI would respectfully request that, in future, the Department be informed before a change in teacher takes place in any school conducted under the auspices of the United Church, and that, when nominating a new teacher, particulars be given regarding name, qualifications, experience, etc.\n\nWhen we have the information asked for regarding the appointment of Miss Williams, consideration will then be given as to the salary that can be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Is there a possibility that the Inspector has made a mistake in the name? Miss Ruth Nelson was appointed to this School by our Woman's Missionary Society last September and as the letter from Ottawa states, her qualifications and appointment were approved by the Department of Indian Affairs. To the best of our knowledge she is still there. We have looked up in our files and find a letter from her dated Dec. 5th, in which she states that she is enjoying the work and finding that the children are advancing in their studies. We feel we can be reasonably safe in stating that she is still the teacher at White Bear Indian School. However, we will communicate with our Sec. Treasurer at Moose Mt. today on the matter.\n\nI hope this information may be of assistance to you in replying to the Department.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(signed) Loretta Spotton,\nExecutive Mission Secretary.\n\nLS:C.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File No. 113-1-1.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nRe White Bear Indian Day School.\n\nIn the absence of Mr. Beaton, to whom your letter of February 4th is addressed, I communicated with the Woman's Missionary Society and enclose a copy of their reply, from which you will note that they are not aware of any change in teacher having been made at the White Bear School. It is unlikely that any change could have occurred without their knowledge and approval. You will note that they are communicating with their Secretary-Treasurer at Moose Mountain, and if any information throwing further light on the matter is received, I shall be glad to write you again.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nMLT.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, February 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nIn a report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his inspection of the White Bear Indian Day School, dated the 26th ultimo, which you forwarded under cover of your No. 308-11 of the 29th ultimo, he states: \"Since my last inspection, Miss Williams has been appointed as teacher and is doing excellent work.\"\n\nThe Department has no knowledge of a change in teacher at this school. As you were informed in official letter of July 24, 1930, approval was granted for the appointment of Miss Ruth Nelson. We took up with the authorities of the United Church the matter of the appointment of a new teacher, and the Secretary of the Woman's Missionary Society, in her reply, states she is rather surprised to learn of the appointment of Miss Williams to the White Bear Indian School and enquires if there is a possibility that the Inspector has made a mistake in the name. She states that, to the best of her knowledge, Miss Ruth Nelson is still there. I should be pleased to hear from you as to whether there has been a change in teacher or whether Mr. Inspector Hamilton was in error in the name of the teacher, as stated in his report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to Department letter No. 113-1-1 of the 9th instant, I have to state that Mr. Inspector Hamilton is evidently in error in referring to the teacher at the White Bear Indian Day School as Miss Williams. He is at present out on an inspection trip and I cannot confirm this, but the Indian Agent in his report on the school for November refers to the teacher there as Miss L. R. Nelson and there is nothing on file here showing that a change has been made since then.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to previous correspondence regarding the teacher at the White Bear Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that Miss Ruth Nelson is still performing teaching duties at this school. Mr. Inspector Hamilton, in a report on his inspection of this school, was in error in referring to the teacher as Miss Williams. I regret any inconvenience caused the Women's Missionary Society and yourself owing to the mistake in the name of the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nIf a social hour is arranged to follow the W.M.S. meeting a feast of good things is provided, so that the tables are spread most lavishly, showing how much time and thought was spent beforehand in planning.\n\nGod bless the women, who are as the King David's men on the banks of the brook Eoror. Rejoice, ye faithful ones, for \"as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff; they shall part alike.\"\n\nWith the Indian Children\n\nMiss Ruth Nelson, formerly of Kolakreela, Alla, writes this letter regarding her new experiences at the Moose Mountain School, Carlyle, Sask.: I found the children here so different even from the British Columbia Indians, but I now see quite a change in their \"responsiveness.\" At noon I imagine I am back in a School Home, as we serve a hot lunch and have a washing up of dishes and children in our \"annex.\" The department provides yarn, so, after work is done, the girls knit, and I now have most of the boys at it, too, the gramophone provides music, so we have quite an enjoyable half-hour. The children here have so few pleasures compared with those in boarding schools, or even on the British Columbia Reserves. The houses, too, are vastly different, the majority only one room. I believe the Department of Indian Affairs and also the Church consider this one of the most backward. Twenty years ago a deaconess and teacher did splendid work here. The folks in Carlyle have noticed a great improvement since the W.M.S. took over the work in 1929, and Miss Ferguson sees progress in the care of the homes and children. At present there are more attending school than before, as far back as I can find records. About sixteen are at boarding schools, most of them now at Brandon. Dr. Doyle paid us a visit in December, and I hope to see the new school there some time.\n\nThe life here is so very different from Kitamaat and Port Simpson\u2014seems much more isolated here in many ways, although the town is only ten miles away. Sometimes I am seven weeks without going in, but the agent brings the mail out quite frequently. They tell me that in summer there are many visitors, the summer resort at the lake is leased from the reserve, and is quite a large and flourishing one, well populated, as the lake is the only large one in quite a distance. The reserve, I believe, comprises over thirty thousand acres, but has many swamps and bush, so that the arable land is not quite enough for the two hundred and fifty Indians. I do miss the green trees in winter\u2014we had to camouflage a birch tree at Christmas time\u2014but it served the purpose very nicely.\n\nA GROUP OF MOOSE MOUNTAIN CHILDREN\nInspector Hamilton's Report on White Bear Indian Day School, Moose Mountain Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the White Bear Indian Day School, inspected on September 17th, 1931.\n\nThe school is in charge of Miss R. Nelson, who has had several years teaching experience with Indian pupils. Two years ago these children were very shy and backward and only in a few cases could they be induced to speak above a whisper. A vast change has been wrought in this respect and the children have obtained confidence in themselves and can be distinctly heard across the room when reading or speaking any oral work.\n\nThe roll calls for 21 pupils, 11 girls and 10 boys. I found 17 present.\n\nThe grades are arranged as follows:\n\n- Grade 1 - 14\n- Grade 2 - 2\n- Grade 3 - 4\n- Grade 4 - 1\n\nI found the room clean, well aired and tidy. The floors had all been oiled and were in good condition. The windows were screened and the screen door on and in good repair. The class-room was almost free of flies.\n\nThe children were clean and well dressed. In all cases their hair had been neatly combed.\n\n- The kitchen at -\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe kitchen at the rear of the school was clean. The children are provided with individual cups, toothbrushes and towels, all of which were neatly arranged in the washroom and labelled with the pupils' names.\n\nSince my last visit the foundation under this portion of the school has been repaired by a cement wall. The eavestroughing has also been put in good condition and outside windows provided. This room should now be much warmer and more comfortable both for the teacher and pupils.\n\nA noon lunch is prepared by the pupils, supervised by Miss Nelson, and the girls are receiving a splendid training, which should be of great help to them at home.\n\nAll the pupils have been taught to knit and already they have mitts ready for winter use and in some cases socks and stockings have also been made.\n\nThe garden this year was a failure as it had been planted on poor land and lacked moisture badly. It is hoped that another year a better success will be made of this work.\n\nThe attendance during the first part of the month was somewhat irregular, as many of the children were away with their parents while they were putting up hay. However, they are home now and during the past week the attendance averaged 19.\n\nThe walls and ceiling of the class room are somewhat smoked and dull and another year will need to be repainted.\n\nAs stated above, Miss Nelson is doing excellent work and this is now one of the best managed day schools I am privileged to visit.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

There are five children, two being school age.\n\nTheir mother was a squaw. She left her husband some time ago, and went to live on another reserve with an Indian apparently. Their children's father is not a British subject either. I was informed. He is alone with these children as the home is in such a deplorable condition he cannot hire a housekeeper.\n\nThe other children at school are continually getting Bedlamine from them. It is impossible to clean up the two children going to school on account of the home conditions. It makes it very hard for both these children and all other school children.\n\nThis family live beside the Indian Reserve. They live one and one half miles from Indian school across country as the road allowance is not open. They are closer to the Indian School also.\nThey only attend school when the attendance officer compels them to.\n\nWould it be possible for these children to attend the school on the Indian Reserve? The school board would appreciate your advice.\n\nI wrote the Department of Education about the above. They referred me to you.\n\nYours truly,\nMrs. J. H. Crawford,\nActing Teacher School 779.\nOttawa, May 11, 1932.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, regarding the case of a family residing at Kevers, two children of which are attending public school at that place. It is noted you request, for the reasons stated in your letter, that permission be granted for them to attend the Indian Day School near where they reside.\n\nThe Department understands, from your letter, that the father of these children is not an Indian, and, as the children take the status of the father, they are therefore not wards of this Department, but are half-breeds. I would point out that this Department is not responsible for providing education facilities for half-breed children and I therefore regret that we will be unable to make any arrangement for them to attend the Indian School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. J. F. Brayford,\nR. R. No. 1,\nManor, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have to inform the Department that Miss L.R. Nelson\u2014the teacher at White Bear's Day School\u2014is in poor health and appears to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown and, in consequence, should at once be relieved of her duties.\n\nAn incident occurred on Sunday night last in my presence at the mission house here which, after placing the matter before the United Church minister in Carlyle and discussing it with him, I felt obliged to report to the W.M.S. headquarters in Toronto.\n\nThe circumstances regarding the incident are as follow\u2014\n\nOn Sunday night January 11th I was present at the mission house by invitation to partake of the evening meal with Miss Nelson, Miss Carnegie, and Mr. and Mrs. Bush\u2014the two latter being of the Agency staff here. My wife is away in Edmonton Alta., undergoing hospital treatment under Dr. J.H. Conroy and a specialist who operated on her whilst we resided at the Edmonton City Agency. At the time I arrived at the mission Miss Carnegie was working in the kitchen preparing dinner. Miss Nelson was upstairs in her room, and Mrs. Bush was in the sitting-room from which she had a partial view of the kitchen. Mr. Bush had not yet arrived.\n\nI was sitting near the kitchen table carrying on conversation with Miss Carnegie as she worked when Miss Nelson came downstairs and into the kitchen with her hat and coat on. She sat down at the opposite side of the table from me and commenced to put her overshoes on. I should explain before going any further that both Miss Nelson and Miss Carnegie had been suffering with colds and hoarseness for a few days, in fact Miss Nelson was unable to conduct the day school on Thursday and Friday of last week and I had to close it.\n\nTo resume my narrative\u2014Miss Carnegie asked Miss Nelson where she was going and received a reply to the effect that she was going to make a fire as the children would be cold\u2014apparently referring to making a fire in the day school to take the chill off in readiness for Monday morning. Miss Carnegie told Miss Nelson she was not fit to go out on such an errand and I intervened and offered to go and make the fire in the school if it was necessary. Miss Nelson thereupon put her arms on the table and laid her head on them, looking up two or three times to make rambling remarks about making the fire &c., and then suddenly without warning, stooped to the floor, picked up one of her overshoes and deliberately threw it across the room at Miss Carnegie, who had taken a seat near the kitchen range. The overshoe struck Miss Carnegie on the left shoulder and to say that Miss Carnegie and I were surprised is to put it mildly, in fact I may say that I was astounded, as I had previously had no idea that Miss Nelson could be guilty of such an act. After throwing the shoe Miss Nelson again dropped her head to her arms on the table and made other rambling remarks about wanting a taxi to take her to the station, and that she would miss her train if the taxi did not come soon &c. Finally Miss Carnegie persuaded Miss Nelson to retire again to her room.\n\ncontd.\n(her room) and accompanied her, and so far as I know there were no more unpleasant incidents that night.\n\nSubsequently I asked Miss Carnegie if she knew of any cause for Miss Nelson's action and she informed me that she believed that Miss Nelson was vexed with her because she had not held the Sunday School in proper form that afternoon when asked to do so by Miss Nelson, but as it was a cold and stormy day only four boys turned up and as Miss Carnegie was hoarse with a bad cold she did not consider it advisable to carry on the school, but she had made the fire in the chapel and made the other usual preparations and when only four Indians arrived she left them to warm and amuse themselves whilst she prepared the light lunch which it customary to provide after the Sunday afternoon service.\n\nI have since been informed by Mrs Bush that she was present in the mission house on one occasion when Miss Nelson slapped Miss Ferguson (the former deaconess) across the face because Miss Ferguson would not do something in the way Miss Nelson wanted it, and on another occasion when Miss Nelson screamed in a hysterical manner because she could not have her own way.\n\nI have received complaints from Indian parents that Miss Nelson has on occasion abused their children but, used as I am to the parents making all kinds of excuses in order to keep their children away from school, I took very little notice of these complaints, beyond mentioning them to Miss Nelson and being assured by her that there was no truth in them, until the incident which I witnessed on Sunday night caused me to believe that the parents' complaints might have some foundation.\n\nThe foregoing is virtually a copy of the report which I forwarded to Mrs Anson Spotton of the W.M.S. at Toronto and I trust my action was the correct one.\n\nAs it will doubtless be necessary to appoint another teacher to carry on the duties at the school I felt it incumbent on me to bring the matter to the attention of the Department as Mrs Spotton will also be compelled to place the matter before the Department.\n\nMiss Nelson and Miss Carnegie reside together at the mission house and Miss Carnegie is apprehensive that Miss Nelson may commit some act of a more serious nature if her condition becomes worse. Miss Nelson is carrying on the school at present and I have not mentioned Sunday night's incident to her.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Stephenson, Indian Agent, Carlyle, Sask., in which he states that Miss Ruth Nelson, teacher of the White Bear Indian Day School, is in poor health and appears to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown and that, as a consequence, she should at once be relieved of her duties. He relates an incident that occurred in his presence, which shows Miss Nelson's state of mind. He also states that, after placing the matter before the United Church minister in Carlyle and discussing it with him, he felt obliged to report to Mrs. Anson Spotton of the W.M.S., Toronto.\n\nI would request that you take this matter up with the proper officer of the W.M.S., who will, no doubt, have a full report from Mr. Agent Stephenson. It is considered that, owing to Miss Nelson's condition, she should be relieved of her duties at the White Bear School and the services of a qualified teacher engaged. After discussing the matter with the officer of the W.M.S., I should be pleased to have a report stating the action, if any, which the W.M.S. proposes to take in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

When we are advised by the Church authorities as to the action they desire to take regarding a successor, you will be advised. In the meantime, and until the necessary arrangements have been made, it is hoped that the work at this school can be carried on. If, however, it is necessary that Miss Nelson be relieved of her duties, the school will have to remain closed until such time as the services of another teacher have been obtained.\n\nYour action in reporting this matter to the authorities of the W.M.S., Toronto, is approved.

Mr. Sendall also wrote us, and with this information to hand, for our Executive meeting yesterday, we granted Miss Nelson furlough from February 1st. It was really overdue, and would have been granted within a few months.\n\nMr. Sendall stated that he could secure a teacher immediately, Miss Florence McDonald, as substitute until June 30th, and that she would be acceptable to the inspector and the Department. We, therefore, authorized her engagement yesterday, from February 1st to June 30th, and hope to appoint a missionary teacher beginning with the full term.\n\n\"I hope that the Department will feel that our action meets the situation, and will appreciate your assistance in advising them in respect to it.\"\n\nI trust the Department will approve the action of our Woman's Missionary Society with regard to this whole matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

The action taken by the W.M.S. in regard to this matter is approved. Miss McDonald is to carry on the work as substitute teacher for the balance of the present school year. She will be allowed salary at the same rate as was paid Miss Nelson, viz., $90 per teaching month, less 10 percent.\n\nThe local Indian Agent is being informed of the arrangements made by the W.M.S. and requested to give Miss McDonald any assistance he can in her work. It is noted that the change in the teaching services will take effect as from the first instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J.

The Department is approving of the appointment of Miss McDonald as substitute for the balance of the present school year, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month, less 10 percent. I would request that you give Miss McDonald any assistance you can in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. W.

MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nENG.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI am advised by Miss E. Carnegie R.M., the nurse at the United Church mission here, that a Miss Mary Blair has been recommended to the Department by the United Church as teacher for White Bear's Bay School for the term commencing September lst next, and that Miss Blair has stated, in a letter to Miss Carnegie, that she has had a conversation with Mr. Sutherland\u2014the head of the Indian Dept., at Ottawa\u2014in which he informed her that the school here would not open until Sept 5th, that being the day after Labor Day. From information printed on the school register I gather that the term should commence on Sept. 1st, and that no change from that date shall be made without the sanction of the Department unless Sept. 1st happens to be Labor Day. Miss Blair accordingly wishes to delay her arrival here until the last possible moment before school opens and that is hardly desirable as the teacher should be here at least a day or two before the school opens in order to become familiar with some of the conditions under which she will work. Furthermore Miss Carnegie will have been alone at the mission during the whole of the months of July and August and wishes to leave on her vacation on Sept. 1st.\n\nI do not wish to question the policy of the Department in the operation of the schools but I really fail to see why it is necessary to bring in a teacher from Ottawa to take charge of this school when there are dozens of teachers (fully qualified) in Saskatchewan who would be glad to have the opportunity of taking it. I understand that Miss Blair is what is known as a missionary-teacher and I would say in this connection that the missionary part of the matter might as well be forgotten for all the good the Presbyterian and United Church missionaries have done here in the last thirty-five or forty years. Practically all the young men and women of the reserve, who are now from 20 to 35 years of age, who passed through this school have reverted to Indian beliefs, excepting those of Catholic parentage.\n\nAgain\u2014 the children of Catholic parents are compelled to either attend this day school or go to Catholic boarding schools and this seems hardly fair. A non-denominational teacher appointed by, and answerable only to, the Indian Department would be more suitable for this school, and could at present, I am sure, be obtained for a much lower salary than the $81 per month which the Department has been paying, as I know teachers in this district who are asking $40 to $50 per month for the coming term.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.W.

It was one of the matters discussed on the occasion of my recent visit to Ottawa. I intended on my return to write an official letter in regard to the matter but apparently it was overlooked. I am sorry if either Miss Blair or the Department have been inconvenienced by this oversight.\n\nMiss Blair holds a first-class professional certificate for the Province of Ontario, being a graduate of the Ottawa Normal School. She has had several years' experience in Ontario and in Alberta, and has had one year's special training in Social Science at the United Church Training School in Toronto.

The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year. The qualifications and experience which she possesses have been noted. It is hoped that she will meet with every success in the work.

Miss Blair visited the Department and was informed that the Indian day schools would not re-open until after Labour Day. I regret that you were not informed of her appointment. She was nominated for the position by the authorities of the United Church of Canada, under whose auspices this school is conducted.\n\nMiss Blair holds a first class professional certificate for the province of Ontario.

(RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-1, part 2).\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Allen;\u2014\n\nI may be out of order in writing to you personally, but a matter has come up in connection with the operation of White Bear's Day School in which the question of the more economical financing is concerned, and which, in my opinion, may affect not only this school but also other Indian day schools. A new teacher is in charge of this school at the commencement of the term on Sept. 1st, and Miss Blair of Ottawa has been appointed after being recommended by the United Church, and her salary is to be at the rate of $80 per month less 10% or $81 per month.\n\nThe grades taught in this school rarely go beyond four and a teacher with a first class certificate is not necessary. An efficient teacher with late normal school training could be secured in this district at not more than $50 per month and so effect a saving in salary of $31 per month. I have an application on file from a Saskatchewan teacher holding first class certificate who asks $70 per month and even that is $11 less than Miss Blair is to receive.\n\nI wrote the Department on this matter on August 8th and received a reply under reference 113-1-1 of August 16th to the effect that Miss Blair had been appointed and would receive the salary as stated.\n\nIf the Department is anxious to economise I do not see why it is necessary to pay $81 per month for a teacher when one just as good can be obtained for $50, and if a missionary-teacher is considered necessary I fail to see why the Department should pay for Church missionary work.\n\nThese Indians are a poverty stricken lot and it is far more necessary to provide for their material needs than for their spiritual needs at the present time and in this connection I would refer to my letters of April 26th and August 11th and Departmental 112-1-5 of May 2nd regarding provision for the noon meals at this school, and to point out that the amount which could be saved in one month on the teacher's salary would be sufficient to provide beef for soup for the pupils for six months.\n\nI do not wish to create friction between the Department and myself, but the educational system under which these Indian Day schools are operated, under the auspices of one Church or another, is antiquated and should be reorganized. I will leave it to your discretion to take any or no action in this matter as you think fit but felt that having met you personally I could write you on a matter where finances are concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

W.

The missionary was not in the employ of the Department but as Miss Wardle, the missionary nurse, is an employee, she is debarred by the Indian Act from selling any of these goods to the Indians and you may advise her accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Ostrander,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nI am in receipt of a copy of a letter written by you to Miss Wardle, our Missionary Nurse at Moose Mountain, informing her that since she is now an employee of the Department of Indian Affairs, she is debarred by the Indian Act from selling goods to the Indians. I presume that the \"selling goods to the Indians\" refers to the custom which prevails on all our mission fields of charging the Indians a modest sum for the quilts and clothing provided for these reserves in the bales sent out annually by our Woman's Missionary Society.\n\nI wish to say that I do not think the Indian Act is properly interpreted in Miss Wardle's case. She is not on the Civil Service list and is not an employee of the Department of Indian Affairs in the ordinary sense. It is true that the Department gives a grant towards her salary and that we agreed when she was appointed that she would be at the disposal of the Director of Medical Services for certain extra activities in connection with the treatment of trachoma on other reserves and such other public health work as he wished to assign to her from time to time, but she is in fact a missionary of the United Church and the small grant made by the Department to the work that she is doing does not begin to cover what it costs the Church to keep her at Moose Mountain.\n\nMay I suggest that you would be well advised to write Dr. E.L. Stone, asking him for information as to whether or not I have given a correct statement of the situation.\n\nThanking you for all the assistance that you give our missionaries in your agency, and with very kind personal regards,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Kenneth J. Reaton.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith copy of a letter which I have received from Mr. Kenneth J. Beaton in connection with the sale of clothing on the White Bear's Reserve.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to my letter of the 12th December last, and Department letter No. 113-1-1 of the 18th of the same month, the contents of which were passed on to Miss Wardle for her future guidance.\n\nI think the action of the Department in the matter was fully justified. On the White Bear's Reserve, and in the district surrounding that reserve, there is very little cash in circulation and I am sure that the people who donate the clothing which the W.M.S. are handling would not look favourably upon the sale of this clothing if they knew the financial circumstances of those who are being asked to pay for it.\n\nMay I point out that I am inclined to disagree with the second paragraph of Mr. Beaton's letter wherein he suggests that the Department has not been very generous in the grant which is allowed for Miss Wardle's services. I do not wish to cast any reflections on the services which Miss Wardle is now rendering the Indians of that reserve. Since she has been given to understand, more clearly, what services are expected of her, I would say that her work is very satisfactory. However, I think that, in allowing the W.M.S. $50.00 a month for her services, together with $1.00 per week for the use of one of the rooms at the Mission for the treatment of trachoma, the Department has been very generous.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDoctor McGill\n\nThere has been a small disagreement between Mr. Ostrander, who has lately taken the Moose Mountain Reserve into his Agency, and Miss Wardle, the nurse or social worker maintained by the United Church at this Reserve and to whose salary we contribute $50.00 per month. Mr. Ostrander took exception to her selling to the Indians supplies of clothing, and so forth, furnished from church sources for distribution at the Reserve. The matter was discussed by Reverend Kenneth J. Beaton on his last visit here, and he pointed out that for many years past it has been the custom of the Missionary Society of his church to make nominal charges for such supplies to Indians who could afford to pay. The supplies in question, of course, are mostly used clothing donated by church members all over the country. The church point of view is that it is undesirable to give supplies to anyone who can afford to make a small payment for them.\n\nOn December 12th Mr. Ostrander submitted this matter to the Department in a letter which you will see on this file, and in reply was informed that as Miss Wardle is an employee she is debarred by the Indian Act from selling these goods to the Indians.\n\nI have no particular opinion on the matter, but I wish to point out that this custom is very widespread and has not usually, I think, been thought upon as an infraction to the Act. The Act makes no distinction between missionary workers employed by the Department and those who are not. It seems to be aimed at missionaries and Departmental employees engaged in regular trading operations.\nMr. Beaton submitted the matter to me and I agreed to have it settled, but I did not know at that time that Mr. Ostrander had been instructed. Apparently it has a wider application than this one Reserve, and in dealing with Mr. Beaton as the headquarters officer of his church, it seems to me we can scarcely make a ruling for one place only without enforcing it everywhere. I shall be pleased to have your direction.\n\nE. L. Stone, M.B.,\nDirector of Medical Services\n\nMP.\nMarch 23rd, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Beston,\n\nThe Director of Medical Services has brought to my attention the problem which you discussed with him on your last visit here of sale to Indians at the Moose Mountain Reserve, Saskatchewan, of clothing donated through the Board of Home Missions of your Church. Unknown to Doctor Stone, the Indian Agent, Mr. J.P.B. Ostrander, had consulted the Department in this matter in the month of December, last, and had been informed that Miss Wardle, as an employee of the Department, was debarred by the Indian Act from selling these goods to the Indians.\n\nThe Indian Act is specific in this matter. It states as follows:\n\n\"No official or employee connected with the inside or outside service of the Department, and no missionary in the employ of any religious denomination, or otherwise employed in mission work among Indians, and no school teacher on an Indian reserve, shall, without the special license in writing of the Superintendent General, trade with any Indian, or sell to him directly or indirectly, any goods or supplies, cattle or other animals.\"\n\nI am informed that the custom of collecting from Indians who are able to pay for the supplies in question in this case has prevailed for many years, and I do not think that the prohibition in the Indian Act was aimed at it. My opinion is that it was designed rather to prevent systematic trading operations on the part of Departmental employees and missionaries. The problem, however, has been presented in\n\nReverend Kenneth J. Beston,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street, W.,\nToronto 2., Ontario.\nsuch a way to require a ruling, and the only ruling the Department can give is that the provisions of the Indian Act must be interpreted exactly and that Miss Wardle is not entitled to sell goods of any kind to the Indians. Should the same problem arise elsewhere the same ruling would apply.\n\nYou will observe that the Act makes provision for a special license to be issued in writing by the Superintendent General. The custom of the Department in this matter is to issue a permit only for a specific individual transaction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHarold W. McGill, M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMarch 23rd, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 1, of March 15th, you will find enclosed a copy of a letter which has now been written to the Reverend Kenneth J. Beaton, in connection with the sale of mission supplies to the Indians of the Moose Mountain Reserve. I find that a ruling was issued on December 16th, 1933, in the Department's letter 113-1-1, addressed to you. It seems advisable to qualify that letter somewhat by referring to Section 44 of the Indian Act, which you may read for yourself and which states plainly that no missionary or school teacher may sell goods to Indians whether he or she is employed by the Department or not. This, of course, supports your point of view still more strongly than the Department's former ruling did.\n\nIn fairness to all concerned it should be pointed out that the custom of selling these supplies to Indians who are able to pay has prevailed for many years, and that Miss Wardle was acting in accordance with the wishes and probably the instructions of her Church authorities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHarold W. McGill, M.D.,\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Saskatchewan.\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nH. W. McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nRe: Interpretation of Indian Act\n\nI did not reply immediately to your letter of March 23rd, because I wanted to go very carefully into this whole situation. I discover that the problem raised in your communication is not a new one, but that even as far back as twenty years ago it was a matter of discussion between the Board of Home Missions of the Methodist Church and the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThis is the second time in the five years that I have been in this office that the same Agent has raised the problem and attempted to get a ruling from the Department unfavorable to the missionary. On a previous occasion, he tried to get a ruling against Rev. R. J. Ross, the Principal of the Round Lake Residential School, on just as trivial and unimportant grounds as the issue which he raises now.\n\nI do not believe that the clause in the Indian Act quoted in your letter ever was intended to be interpreted as indicated. Very careful calculation reveals the fact that the women of the United Church, through their organizations, send on to the fifty Indian Missions for which we are responsible bales of new and used clothing to a value considerably in excess of $10,000 annually. In every case, the practice which is followed is to care for the women and the old people first in the distribution of quilts, underwear and other garments. Able-bodied Indians are expected to pay a small sum for the clothing which they receive. This helps somewhat to get away from the extreme paternalism of previous missionary administration. An Indian who pays $1.50 to $2.00 for a perfectly good suit of clothes is certainly not being seriously discriminated against. The money which is received from these sales is expended in the purchase of milk and other things not included in indigent rations as they are provided by the Department. There are always sick people and delicate infants who give the missionary on the average Reserve a good deal of concern.\n\nSo far as I have been able to think the problem through up to the present, if your letter of March 23rd is the final word of the Department on the question, there are three courses of action open to the Mission Boards:-\n(1) To cease sending these bales entirely and place the responsibility for the clothing needs of the women and children on the Department, where it rightfully belongs.\n\n(2) To take a trial case before a judge and get an official interpretation of the Act. I have been accustomed to consult Hon. N. W. Rowell, K.C., in regard to matters affecting our Indian administration, but he has been absent at the Privy Council and I have not had opportunity to raise this question with him as yet.\n\n(3) To agitate for an amendment to the Indian Act, through our friends in the House of Commons, which will make perfectly clear our position in regard to this matter.\n\nThe Reserve at Moose Mountain is of course a comparatively small one but the amazing speed with which news travels from tribe to tribe in Western Canada will probably assure the knowledge of this ruling of the Department being the common property of every Indian Chief before next Fall.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa on Thursday and will be glad to talk with you further about this whole problem.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, November 2, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nDuring the visit, last summer, of the Deputy Superintendent General to the Moose Mountain agency, his attention was drawn to the need of providing additional day school facilities for the Indian children. It was suggested that another day school be opened, for the benefit of those children residing at too great a distance to attend the present White Bear Indian Day School.\n\nI would request that you report, at your early convenience, giving full particulars as to the number of children of school age available and the distance they reside from the White Bear Day School. You should state definitely the most central location on the reserve for establishing a new day school. The number of children of each denomination who would be available should also be stated. I shall be pleased to have as complete information as possible, together with your recommendation, as to the present need for another school.\n\nI understand that there are a number of Indian children from this agency enrolled at residential schools. Should a new day school be provided, do you consider that this would affect the enrollment at residential schools which the children from this agency attend?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 113-1-1 of the 2nd instant in connection with the suggested erection of a day school at the White Bear Indian Reserve.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware the building which is at present being used as a day school is very old and hardly worth spending a great deal of money on and will accommodate less than one half of the available pupils from that Reserve.\n\nIf the Department seriously considers the erection of a day school at that point would it not be advisable to erect a two room day school sufficiently large to accommodate from 70 to 75 pupils.\n\nOn the rolls of the day school at present there are 29 pupils, a further 9 pupils are now of age to attend school and 12 more will be old enough by the time a new school could be erected. There are 12 R.C. children of this Reserve attending Residential Schools, 11 at the Qu'Appelle School and 1 at the Cowessess I.R.School and 3 Protestant children attending the Brandon School.\n\nThe three schools mentioned are well able to fill their quota without taking any children from White Bear Reserve and I am sure that if a 2 room undenominational school were in operation the children would be receiving useful education at a much lower per capita cost.\n\nThe available children of school age by the beginning of next term after allowing for five possible discharges would be 60 of which about one half are members of the R.C. Church and the other half members of the United Church and while I do not wish the Department to feel that any favoritism is shown in the day school for members of either church under the present arrangement I believe that a day school operated strictly under Departmental Supervision with the teachers responsible only to the Department would be more satisfactory to all.\n\nIf the Department decides to erect a 2 room day school it should be erected at a point approximately one mile directly west of the present day school then the greatest distance that a child would have to travel to school would be 3 miles and I believe that the operation of one 2 roomed day school together with a small outlay for transportation during bad weather would be more economical than the operation of two small schools which would be perhaps 3 miles apart.\n\nThere is another point which deserves some consideration viz:- the fact that the present day school is operated more or less under the auspices of the United Church and as the two denominations are evenly divided I presume that a second day school would be expected by the R.C. authorities to be run under their auspices, then the question immediately arises in connection with transportation of R.C. children from the east side of the reserve to the west and vice versa. A 2 roomed school operated strictly by the Department would overcome this difficulty.\n\nAs I have no idea what the views of the Department are in this matter I am pointing out the circumstances as I view them and I shall be glad to furnish any further information which might be of assistance.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Ostrander mentions in his letter that the question of providing a second day school at the west end of this reserve (White Bear Reserve, Moose Mountain Agency) has been suggested. In this connection I am inclined to favour his idea of providing a two roomed school sufficiently large to accommodate the pupilage available at a point which would be central. The Indian homes are fairly well segregated near the south boundary and approximately half way across the reserve from east to west. By changing the location of the school, it would be possible to have approximately eighty per cent of the children residing within one mile and very few at a greater distance than one and one half miles from the site he proposes. There would be the further advantage of having a good water supply. There is no water available at the site of the present building. There are at present sixty children of school age on the reserve and indications are that as time goes on this number will be substantially increased. The idea of having a two roomed school would permit of having a small teacher-age to accommodate both teachers and it would be a separate unit from the Mission, which would remove the objection to a great extent on the part of the Roman Catholic parents to sending their children to the day school.\nOttawa, December 11, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th ultimo, reporting on the school facilities required to provide for the Indian children on the White Bears Indian Reserve. In this connection it is noted that you consider if a two-roomed day school was erected, in a central locality, it would serve the purpose and be more economical than the operation of two small day schools, some distance apart.\n\nAs there are two denominations on the reserve with, approximately, an equal number of children, it adds to the difficulty. Consideration is being given to providing funds for the purpose of erecting a two-roomed school building, with teachers' living quarters, to be conducted as an undenominational school, under the sole control of the Department. At present, I am not aware, however, whether this will be approved for inclusion in our Estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nOttawa, December 11, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that part of your letter of the 28th ultimo regarding the report of Mr. Agent Ostrander on the White Bears Reserve, Moose Mountain Agency, concerning the need of providing a second day school at the west end of the reserve.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, instead of operating two small schools, it is considered that it would be more economical to erect a new two-roomed school, with accommodation for approximately 70 to 75 pupils and teachers' living quarters, on a central site - the school to be conducted as undenominational, under the sole control of the Department. Consideration is being given to the matter in the preparation of our Estimates for the coming fiscal year. However, I am unable to advise whether funds for the purpose will be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzies,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nCopy of letter sent to Mr. Inspector Murison 13/11/34.\n\nCrooked Lake Agency,\nBroadview, Sask..\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with Departmental letter 11-113 of the 9th instant copy of which they inform me they have sent to you with regard to the appointment of a nurse at the White Bears Reserve by the United Church of Canada. As you are probably aware the Department has been paying $50.00 per month to the United Church of Canada for the nursing services of Miss E. Wardle, R.N. who has recently resigned. I am not sure that the services of Miss Wardle were worth $50.00 per month to the Department partly because I do not consider she was the right type for the work and her health was never good. Her resignation is the result of poor health.\n\nI might say in this connection that I was recently asked for a recommendation in connection with the proposed erection of a new day school on that reserve. I believe that the intention of the Department was to erect a second day school at a point some distance west of the present school and keep the two schools in operation but I recommended the erection of only 2 rooms day school at a point approximately one mile west of the present school with a capacity of 70 pupils there being 60 pupils available at the present time. This would divide up the distance necessarily travelled by the children more evenly and I believe the operation of one 2 roomed day school would be more economical than two one roomed day schools, particularly in view of the fact that the day school now in use is quite an old building and would have to be replaced before very long.\n\nAs the two roomed day school would be used about equally by Indians belonging to the R.C. denomination and United Church I recommended that it be operated strictly under Departmental supervision and non denominational. Sufficient time has not yet elapsed for me to have received a reply to my letter to Ottawa on the subject.\n\nAs you are aware the services of two good school teachers can be procured at a cost of less than $90.00 per month each, which is the rate that the Department pay to the present school teacher who thinks that she is expected to do some missionary work which I take it, is not a matter of concern to the Department.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander.\nIndian Agent.\nCrooked Lake Agency,\nBroadview, Sask., June 24th, 1935.\n\nI may say that I wrote to Mr. Inspector Murison on November 13th 1934 with regard to the appointment of a nurse at the White Bear Reserve and I presume he reported to the Department but have heard nothing definite on the matter.\n\nAs I consider the two matters are closely related I am enclosing a copy of the letter referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 4, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your letter of the 24th ultimo regarding the erection of a new two-roomed day school building on the White Bear Reserve and enclosing copy of a communication which you sent Mr. Inspector Murison.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, while funds for the purpose were provided in the Estimates for the current fiscal year, the Department has decided to defer, for the time being, the erection of the building. There have been certain protests, from the religious denominations interested, that an undenominational school be conducted on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMR. WILLIAMS\n\nMinister's Office\n\nJuly 20, 1935\n\nThe Minister has a letter from Saskatchewan with reference to the construction of a school on the White Bear Indian Reserve. I believe provision has been made for this work in the Estimates for 1935-36 but the Department does not propose to have the building erected this year. A suggestion has been made that the money which would be available for the school building should be utilized for the erection of a residence for the Indian Agent for the Crooked Lakes Agency.\n\nThe Minister would like to have a report on this matter.\n\nGeorge Buskard\nPrivate Secretary.\nJuly 26, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 20th instant, with reference to utilizing the funds - $8,000.00 - which were provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education, to erect a two-roomed school building on White Bear's Reserve, towards the cost of providing a residence for Mr. J. P. B. Ostrander, Indian Agent, Crooked Lakes Agency, Broadview, Sask.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer to my memorandum of the 18th instant, relative to utilizing approximately $5,000 in the erection of a new school building on the Maniwaki Reserve (No. 18, Electoral District of Wright), Que.\n\nIf the Minister decides that a new school is to be erected at Maniwaki, there would not be a sufficient amount available to erect a residence for the Indian Agent in the Crooked Lakes Agency. However, if he should decide that the residence should be erected, instead of the day school on the Maniwaki Reserve, a transfer of the appropriation in Indian Education could be made to Administration and utilized in the erection of the residence for the Agent.\n\nMight I point out, however, that there are many demands for repairs, painting, etc., at Indian day schools, for which no appropriation was provided in our Estimates, and the amount provided for the erection of the school on the White Bear's Reserve could be used to good advantage in carrying out repairs to day schools.\n\nSgd. as William\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nActing Superintendent of\nIndian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI regret to report that Miss Blair, who has been teaching the Indian Day School at Moose Mountain has been forced to request Leave of absence on account of illness. She has found the situation there very exacting, and it was probably unfair to put as young a person in such a difficult position.\n\nWe desire to nominate in her place Miss Myrtle McGregor. Miss McGregor is 35 years of age, holds a Permanent Second Class professional certificate, is musical, and a graduate of the United Church Training School. She has had seven years' experience. I have no hesitation in recommending her to the Department as, in many respects, the most experienced and satisfactory teacher nominated for that School since I have been here.\n\nHoping that this will meet with your approval,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

The Department would therefore appreciate if you would confer with Mr. McKenzie, at an early date, and decide what is the best action to take in order to provide school facilities for the children to whom he refers in his letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, August 6, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to a number of children on the White Bears Reserve, for whom school accommodation is required.\n\nInspector Murison is being written and requested to confer with you and decide what is best to be done under the circumstances.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No. 113-1-1, dated the 6th of August last. This letter arrived during my absence on holiday and immediately upon my return I called up Indian Agent McKenzie and asked him to come to Regina when convenient and confer with me regarding this and other matters in connection with his Agency. The letter referred to above is in regard to the best action to take in order to provide school facilities for the Protestant children at the White Bear's Reserve for whom there is no school accommodation. The number given by Mr. McKenzie is 25, but there are really more. There are at present 30 children attending the Day School on the Reserve and it is over crowded with this number.\n\nI may say that upon enquiry I find that our Protestant Residential Schools have now all the children in residence that they can accommodate and have waiting lists. When submitting the Estimates for the File Hills Residential School, an item was inserted for an addition to that school to enable the Principal to accommodate a larger number of pupils and he had in mind taking in the surplus children from the White Bear's Reserve.\n\nAfter talking the matter over with Mr. McKenzie, I am of the opinion that it would be more satisfactory to the Indians on the White Bear Reserve if an addition were made to the Round Lake United Church Residential School. The White Bear Reserve is situated about 65 miles from the Round Lake School and many of the Indians on the White Bear Reserve are related to Indians on the Reserves surrounding the Round Lake School. They therefore look with more favor upon the Round Lake School than they do on the File Hills School, as the File Hills School is about 140 miles from their Reserve. It will be readily seen that the Round Lake School would be a more desirable point for these children to -\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nchildren to attend, should it be favorably considered to provide residential accommodation for them. Personally, I am of the opinion that it would be a good thing to have as many of the children on the White Bear Reserve taken to the residential schools as possible, in view of the fact that the White Bear Band are a backward lot of Indians and only through the influence of the younger generation can it be expected that they will change their habits and become more progressive. The day school may be all right in so far as giving them a knowledge of English is concerned, but they do not get the training or the formation of regular habits and instruction in domestic and outdoor employments such as farming and the care of cattle. This I consider is a very great advantage.\n\nI may point out that in my inspection reports on this school for some years back I recommended that the old portion of the Round Lake school should be removed and replaced. This is desirable in as much as the old portion of that building has passed its usefulness. It would not be an expensive matter to add to the Round Lake school, which is a frame building, but this of course might not be desirable in that it is not even semi-fire proof.\n\nAs an alternative, the classroom accommodation at the Day School on the White Bear Reserve could be increased.\n\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss Myrtle MacGregor, teacher at White Bears Day School, informing me that she will not be returning after the vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben A.W.R.

I am quite in sympathy with the need for economy during the present crisis and am entirely in agreement with a salary cut. But I have been wondering if it would effect any noticeable economy to close the school as well. In other words, I am quite willing to teach during the month of September without a pay cheque if the Department will but grant me permission to open the school for that month.\n\nIf the Department is willing for this to be done the only expense would be the cost of the pencils and scribblers used by the pupils during that month. A matter of hardly one dollar. All other expenditures such as janitor work and mid-day lunch could be so arranged that they would not increase the amount the government are prepared to allow for the nine months they suggest school be open.\n\nHere are a few of the reasons why I consider it would be undesirable to close White Bear's School during September.\n\nWe have no attendance problem at this school as our quarterly reports will indicate. As the majority of our pupils are juniors they are not kept out to assist with haying and other Fall work. Last September our attendance was over 97%.\n\nI have been trying for the past two years to cultivate an interest in school on the part of both pupils and parents. I feel that this has been partly achieved and I am afraid that a prolonged holiday might create another state of apathy.\n\nThis year we have increased the school garden until it consists of almost half an acre. This has been divided up into four plots and a different group of children made responsible for each plot. Quite an enthusiastic competition has resulted and an interested outsider has donated a prize for the best plot. But if the school is closed for July, August and September the weeds will win the competition.\nIn view of the above facts, and in view of the fact that Moose Mountain, being such a backward Reserve, requires all the educational exposure it can get, I would like to operate during September.\n\nI am not concerned over the salary but I am concerned over the welfare of my pupils. After all, I am in Indian work because I am keenly interested in Indian education and not because of financial remuneration. To me it is 'experimental education' and ten months is none too long a period for the conducting of the experiment. I very willingly give up my September salary cheque, but I very unwillingly give up September school.\n\nAs school can be operated during September with practically no additional expense for the government I would greatly appreciate it if the Department would grant me permission to open the school on September 4th. in accordance with the regular schedule.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"Mabel K. Waywell\"\n\nMabel K. Waywell,\n(teacher)\nTo Dr. McGill\n\nReport on White Bear Indian Day School\n\nI wish to report on an inspection made on the above mentioned school on the White Bear Reserve, Carlyle, Saskatchewan. This school is situated just a short distance from the old Agency where the Farming Instructor, Mr. J.R. Morrison, now resides.\n\nThe building is in fair state of repair and does not require any decorating, etc. in the near future. The number of children on the roll is 33 and the average attendance is 30. This is quite outstanding. At the back of the school building there is an additional room which is used as a kitchen. The children eat their lunch on their desks and they have a mat which fits on the desk while they are eating.\n\nNear the school the United Church of Canada own a Mission House where the teacher resides and also the nurse together with the man who looks after the chores around the place and his wife. I believe the Church Authorities pay part of the salary of the chore man, and the teacher and the nurse augment the remainder out of their own salary.\n\nMrs. K. Waywell, the teacher, is very energetic and I would say she is obtaining good results.\n\nI wish to point out here that she has no cupboard room at the school for books and stationary, and her desk consists of an old rickety table. If the Department would furnish her with some cupboards that can be built on the wall, and a teacher's desk, I am sure it would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit my report for the month of March, 1941, as follows:\n\nHEALTH:\n\nWith few exceptions the health of the Indians has been fairly good, there was quite a large number of influenza cases on all reserves.

I found that there were 30 children on the register, and this last quarter the average attendance there has been 18.\n\nThe school I am afraid will need a lot of repairing. The shingles will have to be renewed as the place is beginning to leak. The nails in the shingles have all worked up.

I do not know whether the shingles are good enough to stand re-nailing or not. I believe it would be better to put new shingles on than try to patch the old ones by re-nailing them. However, this will be looked into.\n\nThe interior of the class room also needs painting. No decorating has been done for several years and the room is dark and dingy and certainly needs brightening up. Mr. Kerley will go into the matter of repairs for the school in due course, so they can be\n\n........carried out\ncarried out through the holidays.\n\nThere are probably about 20 children of school age that were born in '35 that will attend school this year for the first time. I spoke to Mr. Kerley, Mr. Morrison, the Farming Instructor, the Teacher and the Nurse about the attendance of the children. I also spoke to the Chief and Councillor regarding this matter, pointing out that to keep up the attendance at the school was very important. I realize that there are times in the winter when the weather is cold, that there are reasons for the children staying home as some of them live about four miles from the school, but I am sure my talking to the Staff and the Indians will bring about some improvement.\n\nThey had good gardens at the School and I found that the teacher, Miss Cass, is no doubt doing her very best and is very much interested.

Such concrete activities are a valuable field of social and conduct education, and well suited to the personality of the children. Stress is placed on vocational education and in grounding in fundamentals of language and number.\n\nEssential equipment for the classroom is provided. This includes necessary books and writing materials as well as primary working materials.\n\nI observed a number of lessons in reading, physical education, singing and arithmetic. Taking allowance for their special characteristics, these children might be said to be making nearly normal progress in reading. In arithmetic the pupils are exact on mechanical work. I left a number of special recommendations on various matters.\n\nMr. Dobbin takes a deep and helpful interest in the personality and in the educational welfare of these Indian Children.\n\nSigned\n\nW.

Neary,\nDept. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nI understand that Day School Teachers are now included in the Civil Service, and as such are entitled to superannuation. Am I correct?\n\nAs I have spent the past ten years in Indian work, (5 years as teacher in Cote Improved Day School, Kamloops and 5 years as principal of Idle Hills Indian Residential School) I wish to know whether by paying the required percentage of my salary for the past five years into the Pension Fund, these years of service could be counted when computing the rate of superannuation. I am informed that this procedure has been followed in similar cases of teachers entering the Civil Service.\n\nThanking you in advance for this information, truly,\n\nLeonard L. Dobbin\nOttawa, October 20, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nThe details of our superannuation plan for teachers are detailed fully in the last year's issue of the Bulletin.\n\nYou will note that service in the day schools only counts at the present time, towards these years of superannuation. This is due to the fact that whilst employed at a residential school you are not being paid by the Dominion Government directly, but by the Denomination concerned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nLeonard L. Dobbin, Esq.,\nWhite Bear Indian Day School,\nCarlyle, Sask.\n\nBFN/MGD\nWhite Bear Day School\nCarlyle, Sask., Nov. 10, 1947\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training\nInd. Aff. Br., Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago I forwarded a completed copy of T.D.1 to your office and the information contained therein has been used in making income tax deductions.\n\nSince then it has been brought to my attention that I am entitled to 'married' status, since my wife, whose yearly salary is $900, will actually have worked only 5 months of the year 1947 and earned only $375+$50 living accommodation. This, of course would not be the case in 1948 as she will then have earned a full year's salary and I would then be taxed under 'single' status.\n\nI am enclosing a corrected copy of T.D.1 which you may use in making income tax deductions for the months of November & December.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLeonard L. Dobbin, Teacher\nOttawa, November 21, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Dobbin:\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th instant enclosing revised T.D.l form. The salary cheques for the month of November have already been typed and consequently it is not possible to make any change for this month. We will, however, make the change in your cheque for the month of December.\n\nIt is regretted that we cannot return the extra deduction that has been made. As you are aware, the deductions for income tax have been made as a result of the information given on the T.D.l form which you previously forwarded.\n\nAny over payment of income tax that you have made during the current calendar year will have to be adjusted when you are submitting your income tax return for this calendar year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Leonard L. Dobbin,\nWhite Bear Indian Day School,\nCarlyle, Sask.\n\nPP/MGD\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your of Oct. 26, 1947, you state that service in a residential school does not count for superannuation due to the fact that the salary is paid by the Church, which seems reasonable. However, during the five years in which I taught in Cote Bay School, Kamsack, Sask., I received my salary direct from Ottawa, and for this reason those 5 years should be counted as teaching service for the purpose of superannuation.\n\nI would be pleased to receive the following information regarding superannuation:\n\n1. What is the retirement age?\n2. What would be the amount of the pension in my case should I continue as welfare teacher in a Day School at my present salary until I reach the retirement age? I am at present 57 years of age.\nThanking you in advance for the information requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL. L. Dobbin\nTeacher\nWhite Bear Indian Day School\nCarlyle\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nWhite Bear Indian Day School.\n\nYou will recall that Mr. Dobbin, formerly teacher at the above school, was classified as a welfare teacher upon your recommendation.\n\nTo replace him, the United Church has nominated Miss Ruth Nelson, who holds a second class teaching certificate and has some 20 years' experience in Indian schools and 7 years in provincial schools. She was formerly at White Bear School for a period of 2\u00bd years.\n\nWe have been advised that Miss Nelson will remain on the reserve for the full 12 months' period and will report for duty on August 1. Miss Nelson has recently had a furlough year during which time she attended the Scarritt College Rural Centre in Tennessee and also observed some of the American centres in Indian work.\n\nBefore she can be classified as a welfare teacher, as requested by the United Church, it is necessary to have your recommendation upon the local situation, as outlined in article 56 of the Indian School Bulletin for 1947.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nWhite Bear Indian Day School,\nCarlyle, Sask., June 15/48\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago I forwarded my resignation as teacher here, same to take effect on July 31st. This should have read August 31st, as this is the end of the year for which I was engaged. As I expect to be here during August (with the exception of the 18 days allowed for holidays), I shall be entitled to receive salary for this remaining month.\n\nI would appreciate it very much, Mr. Phelan, if you would give this your consideration with a view to having my name remain on the pay list for August.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.

Dobbin, welfare teacher of the White Bear Indian Day School, tendering his resignation effective July 31st, 1948, and this has been accepted.\n\nFor your information I enclose a copy of a letter which has just been received from him.\n\nPlease let me know if Mr. Dobbin is still on the reserve and if you consider he should remain on the reserve for part of August.

Mrs. J.R. Morrison, wife of the Assistant, Indian Agency, White Bear Reserve, has been operating a Homemakers' Club on that reserve for some years, without remuneration. This club is very active and is doing good work toward home improvement by giving instruction to the Indian women and girls of all ages.\n\nIf Miss Nelson, when appointed, will assume even a part of the work which Mrs. Morrison has been doing, she will well earn the right to be classified as a welfare teacher. The White Bear Reserve is very backward and, before Mrs. Morrison took hold, most of the Indian homes were disgraceful. They have improved some in recent years, but there is still much room for improvement.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nDear Miss Nelson:\n\nBefore proceeding to set your salary in accordance with our new salary schedule, it would be appreciated if we could have more information concerning the Summer Schools which you have attended. I understand from the Board of Home Missions that you attended Scarritt College Rural Centre, Crossville, Tennessee during the Spring Semester. It would be appreciated if we could have information as to the type of Certificate obtained from this institution and also be informed as to any other professional or academic Summer Sessions which you have attended.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

We had lectures on Rural Sociology and Anthropology etc., and did observation work at various schools for the mountain and negro people. I was sorry that I couldn't have spent longer on the one Indian Reserve we visited, the Cherokee. On my various furloughs I have attended lectures similar to the above and done observation work but I never have done so with the intention any type of Certificate. Perhaps I made a mistake in not doing so but it is too late now. However I was pleased while at Crossville to meet an eminent sociologist who had somewhat the same views, but I see where that doesn't help set a salary schedule!\n\nIt is eighteen years since I came to this reserve for a short term of work and I see many changes, the population being much larger but the roads are no better especially as there has been rain, that too is rather a change for I was here during the time when it was too dry.\n\nWith kind regards I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRuth Nelson\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe 2499-304-11 (108), Dec. 15th, 1948.\n\nReplying to your above letter regarding Miss Ruth Nelson, teacher, I may say that when she was teaching at Round Lake Residential School her teaching methods did not impress me favorably and I was rather disappointed when I heard she was coming to White Bear. However as this was arranged with the church authorities I had no say in the matter. She was not particularly successful at File Hills either. In both these cases she had the assistance of the Principal on discipline, but now that she is on her own the discipline is poor.\n\nShe would no doubt make a fair sewing matron in a Boarding School and I would recommend that she be replaced by a male teacher, preferably a married man whose wife could act as school matron.\n\nFor the balance of the term perhaps Mrs. Morrison would be willing to take over and would I know improve the existing conditions.\n\n(Sgd) W.J.D. Kerley,\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter received from Superintendent W.J.D. Kerley of the Crooked Lake Agency regarding the work of Miss Ruth Nelson as Indian Day School Teacher at the White Bear Reserve.\n\nIt was a mistake to appoint Miss Nelson at the White Bear School as we were all aware that her work had been unsatisfactory at Indian Schools where she had formerly been employed. She has not the ability to keep order or to teach when left to her own resources in an Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Kerley makes a suggestion as to Mrs. J.R. Morrison, wife of the Assistant Indian Agency at the said Reserve, who might be employed temporarily as teacher at this school. Mrs. Morrison has had many years of teaching experience, has a first class certificate and taught at the school in question, where her services were entirely satisfactory.\n\nPerhaps a suggestion to this effect might be made to the Church authorities. If Miss Nelson remains at the White Bear Day School for the remainder of this term, it is a waste of time as far as the children are concerned.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nJanuary 10, 1949.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\n\nWhite Bear Indian Day School.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nJust after you had left my office last week, I received a letter from Mr. Ostrander with regard to Miss Ruth Nelson, teacher at the above school.\n\nI had written to him in connection with the Provincial School Inspector's report on Miss Nelson's work at this school. This report, submitted after a visit of November 9, 1948, indicated that Miss Nelson is proving unsatisfactory as a teacher at this school. On the teacher grading scale she received a B for Health and Language, a C for Appearance, Personality, Initiative, Discipline, and a D for Relations, Management, Teacher Skill, Preparations and Pupils' Progress. In other words, she is graded as poor in the most important items on the teacher grading scale.\n\nIn his general comments, Mr. Thomson states as follows:\n\n\"I was very unfavourably impressed with work being carried on this year in the White Bear School. Although the present teacher has had much experience in Indian Schools, she continues to teach the academic subjects only. School hours would appear to be irregular. No time-table is being used, although the time-table of the last teacher is still on the wall. Pupils rarely speak and then only in a whisper.\n\n\"There is a strong antagonistic spirit in the school. The pupils quarrel and fight. To avoid this...\"\nMiss Nelson sends those going East and those going West home at different times with the girls and boys at different times. All were, however, sent home close enough together to permit the last to overtake the first, and the segregation tended only to emphasize the ill will. One or two parents came for their children. The school cannot enjoy a successful year under present conditions.\"\n\nI was rather perturbed at this report and so searched our files for an inspector's report upon Miss Nelson's work at Ahousaht. Unfortunately, we do not have such a report on our files, which is probably due to the fact that she was there during the period when we had no District Inspector of Schools for British Columbia. Mr. Indian Superintendent Kerley apparently knew of Miss Nelson when she was teaching at the Round Lake Residential School and also at the File Hills Residential School. In both these cases she had the assistance of the Principal in maintaining discipline, but now that she is on her own, the discipline is poor.\n\nMr. Ostrander feels that Miss Nelson's work is unsatisfactory and that she has not the ability to keep order or to teach when left to her own resources in an Indian day school.\n\nThey both recommend that Mrs. J. R. Morrison, wife of the Assistant Indian Agent at the above Reserve be considered as a temporary replacement for Miss Nelson. As you are probably aware, Mrs. Morrison has had many years of teaching experience, has a first class certificate, and formerly taught at the school in question, where her services were quite satisfactory. Mr. Dobbin made a favourable impression on the academic work and discipline at this school. I would not like to see it continue to deteriorate under Miss Nelson and would appreciate hearing from you in this regard.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Ostrander and to Mr. Kerley\nAttention: Colonel B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: White Bear Indian Day School\n(Your File 624-1 - E.)\n\nJanuary 14th,\n1949.\n\nI have just had a conversation with Mrs. Loveys, because White Bear is really under The Woman's Missionary Society. We both regret the kind of report the Inspector has been compelled to give concerning Miss Nelson, and, like you, we are perturbed.\n\nI note that Mr. Ostrander recommends that Mrs. Morrison be considered as a temporary replacement for Miss Nelson, which indicates that you think Miss Nelson should be discharged forthwith. That is not so easily done, in addition to which I am not sure of the wisdom of appointing the wife of the Agent, - just on general principles. We join with you in not liking the idea of seeing the school deteriorating under Miss Nelson, but we wonder whether it would be possible for Miss Nelson to continue until the end of the year. If this were possible, we would at once communicate to her the fact that the Inspector's report had been so unfavorable, and both by letter and by conference we would try to get her to improve sufficiently to get by. I rather think that it would be very helpful if we had a married man and his wife on that Reserve; but that is not the point at issue.\n\nI shall be glad to know what you think of the suggestion I am making.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of your long experience, you can appreciate the dissension which can result from having a day school teacher of this type on a reserve. I hope that Mrs. Loveys will find it possible to have one of her field officials visit this school and thoroughly investigate the situation as reported by both the Provincial School Inspector and our own departmental officials.\n\nI have asked Mr. Indian Superintendent Kerley to be prepared to assist in every way in this connection.

I clarified the impression which he had concerning Mrs. Morrison and advised him that she was not anxious to return to the school as a teacher, but had only been persuaded to consider such a move as the result of representations made by departmental officials.\n\nI am writing again to Dr. Dorey, asking that he again take up this situation with the Women's Missionary Society. It is very likely that they will make a local investigation and I would ask that Mr. Kerley assist wherever possible in this connection.\n\nI am sending an extra copy of this letter, in the event that you would wish to forward it to Mr. Kerley.\n\nBernard F.

She was nominated for the position by the authorities of the United Church of Canada, under whose auspices this school is conducted.\n\nMiss Blair holds a first class professional certificate for the province of Ontario.

Blair, teacher at the White Bears Reserve Indian Day School, informs me that she has received a cheque for $90.00 for April salary and that she also received a draft of $170.00 from the Women's Missionary Society which is said to represent her salary for the months of April, May and June and is equivalent to the amount received for the previous quarter.\n\nI would be glad if this matter could be investigated and I could be advised at an early date as to its correctness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In the case of the White Bear Indian Day School, it has been the practice of the Department to forward the teacher's salary cheque to the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada. However, present regulations require salary cheques to be issued direct to the person doing the work. Consequently, Miss Blair's cheque for the month of April was forwarded direct to her, and she should cash it.\n\nAs you are aware, the salary of the teacher at the White Bear School is $900 a year, payable on a ten month basis. For the past two years, there has been a 10% deduction from all salaries, but, on reference to the last paragraph of circular letter of the 30th ultimo, you will note that persons being paid under $1,000 are not reduced this year. Consequently, Miss Blair was paid at her own salary rate. As far as the Department can see, she should return the cheque which she received from the Women's Missionary Society.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

It is the old style school with three large windows on both sides. The blackboard extends across the front with one piece on each side and rear wall. The side and rear pieces of board are badly worn and are of little use.\n\nThere is an outside entrance where the children hang their coats and wraps. This was clean and tidy. The floor in this entrance was badly worn, in fact, a hole was worn through it. The school-room was clean. The floor in this room is badly worn and very difficult to keep clean.\n\nThe number of Indian children enrolled is 22; -Boys 16 and girls 6, and the highest grade is Grade III. Some of these children have about 2\u00bd or 3 miles to come and yet the attendance as shown by the register is fairly good.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nI noticed the window blinds were poor and not in working order, and a number of the seats are very old and about ready to fall apart. The stove is a box heater; quite satisfactory but one corner is broken. This allows the ashes and sparks to escape and there is always a danger from fire.\n\nThe discipline was good. The children were neat and clean. Their school work was fair. These children are very self-conscious and it is difficult to get them to either speak or read very loudly. I believe the teacher devotes considerable time to this part of his work. Their writing and arithmetic was good, and their exercise books clean and the work neatly done.\n\nMr. Kerr, the teacher, holds a Second Class Professional and I believe he is doing good work. He is very interested in the welfare of the Indian children.\n\nMrs. Kerr prepares the noon-day meal for these children in her own home and it is then taken across to the school for the children to eat. I was not present at the noon-hour but I believe the children receive abundance. The dinner consists of soup and biscuits, sometimes boiled vegetables and rice.\n\nI might add, in addition to the Indian children, five white children attend. Some of these I believe, are in Grades VIII and IX. These children belong to the teacher and agent on the reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., January 19th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a short report on the White Bear School in the Moose Mountain Agency, which was visited by Inspector Hamilton on the 12th of the present month.\n\nWith reference to that portion of the report which deals with the floor of the school, it seems to me that as this floor is very old and worn it would be a mistake to try to repair it, and that a new floor should be put in. I believe it would cost approximately $100.00 to have this work done.\n\nI think that it would be well to supply the school with new window blinds. This would cost about $20.00. I would also recommend that a new heater be purchased, at a cost of about $30.00, as you will note the Inspector says there is a danger of fire with the heater at present in use.\n\nYou will note that Inspector Hamilton speaks well of Mr. Kerr and his wife, and that he found the children clean and the discipline good.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 26, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your No. 308-11 of the 19th instant, enclosing a report from Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his recent visit to the White Bear Indian Day School in the Moose Mountain Agency.\n\nRelative to the installing of a new floor in the school building, the supplying of new window blinds and the purchase of a new heater, I beg to say that the Department will approve of your having a new floor put in, the necessary window blinds installed and a heater supplied. The department would like, however, to have this work deferred until after the 1st of April, next, the beginning of the new fiscal year. If, however, the heater and blinds are necessary at the present time, you may arrange for the purchase of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have received a requisition from Mr. H. W. Arnold, Indian Agent at Carlyle, to be supplied with biscuits for use at the day school, stating that last year's supplies have been exhausted. Mr. Arnold ran short of biscuits in the same way a year ago, explaining that the consumption had been more owing to the very good attendance of school children. I therefore forwarded him 600 lbs. from surplus stock and later when the contract supplies arrived sent him another 400 lbs. to complete his requisition for the fiscal year.\n\nI shall be glad if you will please advise me whether Mr. Arnold has been issuing the proper allowance of biscuits at the school during the past two years. I note that for the coming fiscal year, he is asking for 1200 lbs., and it is hoped that this quantity will be sufficient to meet his requirements and obviate the necessity of his again asking for supplies before the fiscal year ends.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 14th, 1927.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your No. 308-7D of the 2nd instant, relative to the request of the teacher of the White Bear Indian Day School to be supplied with twelve hundred pounds of biscuits for the use of the pupils during the coming fiscal year.\n\nIn connection with the issue of biscuits to the pupils to supplement their mid-day lunch, I have to say that the quantity allowed is four ounces per pupil per day. The returns from the school show that there has been an average attendance of approximately fifteen pupils and, therefore, three and three quarter pounds of biscuits should be ample. As there are approximately two hundred teaching days in the school year, a total of seven hundred and fifty pounds of biscuits is all that should be necessary if reasonable care is taken by the teacher in issuing same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It will be of decided advantage to make the proposed changes which will make the lighting of the school more in accord with modern methods. The chief item of expenditure will be for labor as a practical man will have to be engaged to make the alterations. It will, I think, be possible to use two of the windows, but new casing will be required, as I do not consider it will be possible to remove the old casing without splitting it or damaging it so that it is unserviceable. A small quantity of shathing, drop-siding, and V joint will also be required for closing up the spaces at present occupied by the two windows, and also some nails. The materials should not cost more than $10 or $12, but I am at present unable to say how much the labor would cost as the only man in the district who could do the work is at present engaged on other work and I shall be unable to get in touch with him until Saturday night next. In the event of his being engaged to do the work it will be necessary to have the Agency team fetch him and take him home again as the snow is now too deep for auto travel. It will also be inconvenient to do the work until the vacation at Xmas.\n\nI am enclosing a rough diagram of the school room which will probably convey some idea of the existing arrangements and also the proposed changes.\n\nThe amount of blackboard required will be 13' long and either 3'6\" or 4' wide.

You should engage the services of a competent man to do the work - closing in the space occupied by the two windows on the east side and installing two new windows on the west side. You may purchase the quantity of sheeting, drop siding, V joint, nails, etc., required in carrying out this work. Should any new windows, sashes, etc., be required, they may also be purchased. You will be good enough to keep all expense as low as possible, having in view the carrying out of a satisfactory job. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangements for the proposed changes in the lighting system of the classroom.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, you should forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of the labour and for the material required.\n\nAn order is being placed with the Government Stationery Office here to forward to the teacher's address the quantity of asbestoslate blackboard required, viz. 13' x 4', with chalk trough and moulding. It is noted that this board is to be placed on the east wall. In installing this board you should be guided by the public school inspector's recommendation as mentioned in official letter to you of the 5th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. W.

It was found impossible to get the work done during the time in which the school was closed for the Christmas vacation owing to the cold and stormy weather, and the school therefore was kept closed for the remainder of the week of Jan 2 to 6 in order that these alterations might be carried out. The job was very well performed; the man employed is a careful workman and succeeded in removing the old window casings intact and without damage so that they were again made use of. Some panes of glass in the windows had been broken previously and new ones have been purchased.

The amount usually allowed is about $50 per year for these services. For this amount it is expected that the floor will be scrubbed at least once every two weeks, swept regularly, and the fire lighted each morning in time before the classroom work begins.

Stephenson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 14, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, relative to the janitor work at the White Bear Indian Day School, and enclosing a voucher in payment for the scrubbing of the floors. A cheque in payment will be sent you in due course.\n\nIt is considered that the arrangement you have made to have an Indian woman scrub the floor occasionally and the teacher do the other necessary work is satisfactory, and you may forward a voucher from time to time covering the cost of the scrubbing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. W. Stephenson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nOttawa, June 26, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his recent visit to the White Bear Indian Day School. I have to request that you will draw to the attention of the teacher the following remarks of the Inspector:\n\nHe states that while the classroom was tidy and clean, the wash basins and the bench upon which they are kept were not in a cleanly condition; further, that the teacher did not have the children wash before lunch. The teacher should insist upon cleanliness of person among the pupils, and, as there are facilities provided for the purpose, he should see that the children wash up before partaking of lunch.\n\nHe further states that the soup for the noonday meal is made by Mrs. Kerr in her home, brought over and served to the children and the dishes are then returned and attended to by Mrs. Kerr. This school is provided with a kitchen and supplied with a stove and table. Two rooms adjoin it, one of which is supplied with a large white sink for dish-washing and a pump for soft water, and the other is equipped with a good enamel bath and looking glass. These rooms are only used for storage and are not even kept clean and tidy - all of which is wasted effort. The teacher should be instructed to see that these rooms are kept clean and tidy, and it is not understood why the preparation of the midday lunch could not be carried out in the room for that purpose. You should draw this matter to the attention of the teacher and have him carry out the above requirements of the Department.\n\nThe Inspector states, further, that the fence about the school is in a disgraceful condition, as many of the posts have rotted off, and the wire is badly bent and twisted. We understand that you have been instructed by Mr. Commissioner Graham to have the teacher, himself, fix the fence and arrange to have a garden plot broken.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you regarding the above requirements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. W. Stephenson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-5, part 2)\nOttawa, June 26, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your 308-11 of the 20th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on his inspection of the White Bear Indian Day School. We are requesting Mr. Agent Stephenson to take up with the teacher the various matters mentioned by the Inspector as requiring attention.\n\nWe have noted what the Inspector says regarding the condition of the fence, also that you have instructed the agent to have the teacher, himself, fix the fence. Should any fencing material be required, such as wire, posts, etc., you may arrange to supply same.\n\nRegarding the painting, the repairs to the roof and the chimney, if you consider that this work should be carried out before the cold weather next fall, I shall be pleased to have your recommendation, together with an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The work was carried out by the Indians under my direction, and the weeds and grass were cut by the Agency farmer and the Dept. team. No assistance was given by the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.F. Stephenson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nReferring to your No. 113-1-5, of the 11th instant, informing me that funds are available for the painting required at the White Bear Indian Day School, and also instructing me to take steps to have the fence put in good condition, as the Rev. Mr. Barner was of the opinion that the teacher could hardly be expected to do this work, I beg to say that the painting at this institution has been completed, but notwithstanding Mr. Barner's report I consider it is the duty of the teacher to keep this small fence in repair. If little jobs of this kind are not to be looked after by the local teacher, where are we going to end? However, I instructed the Agent to have this fence repaired, after I knew the condition in which it was found.\n\nInspector Hamilton visited this school during the summer, and he points out that he found the children were not washing before taking their midday meal, and that Mr. Kerr, when this matter was brought to his attention, said it would take too much time. I think this pretty well indicates the kind of a man Mr. Kerr is. The Inspector also points out that the kitchen which was provided in this school at the request of the church authorities, and furnished with a stove, table, sink and pump, also another room containing a good enamel bath, looking glass, etc., are never used, and that these rooms are not even kept clean, but are used as store-rooms. Nurse Lucas, as late as last month reports on this school as follows,- \"The kitchen at the back was in a very untidy condition and is not used for the children, nor is the cook stove used to teach the children to cook.\" She also states that the toilets were in a dirty and unsanitary condition. Now, there is -no excuse-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nno excuse for conditions of this kind existing, and it is very discouraging for our officers, especially the Agent and Inspectors, to have to contend with a man of this kind in keeping the school premises and property of the Department as they should be kept, to say nothing of the training of the children. If Mr. Kerr is under the impression that it is the duty of our Agent to go and look after such matters as the toilets and the repairing of the fence, etc., I think the Department should put him straight on this point. These teachers will have to take some responsibility, and there is too much of a feeling at large that the Department has to run and do every little trifling thing that is to be done. This applies not only to this school, but to other places as well, and I should be glad if these teachers and others were given to understand that they must shoulder some of this responsibility as well. Any teacher in a country school would be expected to keep the premises in good order, and this should be expected all the more in the case of a teacher living right at the school, who is supposed to be teaching the Indian children in sanitary habits, and matters of economy.\n\nOnly a short time ago I received a letter from Mr. Kerr, informing me that he was obliged to supply vegetables from his own garden to put in the soup that is used for the midday meal given to the children. I think this matter is so small and trifling that it is scarcely worth mentioning, but it will give you a further idea as to the kind of man Mr. Kerr is, and the difficulty the Inspectors and Agent have with him. I am of the opinion that if he were to receive a letter from the Department it would have the effect of letting him know that he has some obligations in connection with this school, and would make matters better for everyone concerned.\n\nWe have not the staff to do the kind of work these schools expect us to do, and matters are getting worse instead of better.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The grades range as follows:\n\nGrade I - 9 pupils\n\" II - 4 \"\n\" III - 4 \"\n\" IV - 1 \"\n\nThe average attendance for the quarter ending March 31st was 8.74. However, since that date the attendance has improved, averaging about 10 or 12.\n\nThe pupils were neatly clad and were clean, and I noticed that their hair was neatly combed. They appeared fairly well along in their work, although there is no outstanding progress. The work in the exercise books was fairly neat, although the books were not kept clean.\n\nThe classroom was tidy, but as there were no screens on the windows a great many large flies swarmed about the room and disturbed the attention of the children. In order that the room be properly aired, it is necessary to keep these windows open and screens should be provided as it will be impossible to remain in the room when the mosquitoes become bad. A screen door should also be provided.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nA new fence\nA new fence was erected last year around the school property and this has greatly improved the appearance of the place.\n\nA small garden plot was broken, but will not be put into garden this year. The Agent intends to have it properly worked and made ready for garden purposes next year.\n\nI found some repair work was needed on the toilets and these also need to be thoroughly cleaned. The Agent had instructed this work to be done, but apparently he was misunderstood, and assured me that the repair work would be carried out, as well as having them properly cleaned.\n\nMr. C. B. Kerr, the teacher who has been in charge for the past two years, will be leaving at the end of the present term, and I understand that a lady is being appointed by the Church to work with Miss Ferguson, a Deaconess, who is also appointed by the Church. I have no doubt that this change will be an improvement as I found it very difficult for Mr. Kerr to adapt himself to the teaching of Indian children. No doubt, if this change is made, some repair work will be needed to the kitchen in connection with the school. As pointed out in previous reports, this kitchen has never been used since Mr. Kerr was placed in charge, and the children receive no instruction in the preparation of meals or in the washing of dishes. No doubt the new teacher and deaconess will wish to carry out this line of work and this will necessitate a certain amount of repair work. The basement to the kitchen is infested with rats and already they have gnawed through the floor, which will now need to be repaired.\nThe tank used as a cistern has been left to freeze and no doubt is destroyed. However, this could be removed and a smaller tank installed which would be large enough, no doubt, to meet the requirements.\n\nI understand that an amount was placed in the Estimates for these repairs and, if granted, the school can be put in first class shape before the fall term opens.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:\n\nI forward a report by Inspector A. G. Hamilton of his recent visit to the White Bear Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to some needed repairs referred to by him at the end of his report, I note that $100.00 was provided in the Estimates, but that no authority to expend this has as yet been received. If any money is available, perhaps you will advise me. Out of that amount it might be possible to provide for screens for the windows and doors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 25, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 308-11 of the 17th instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his recent visit to the White Bear Indian Day School.\n\nRelative to the supplies and repairs referred to by the Inspector, I have to say that you may arrange for the providing of the number of window screens required and also a screen door.\n\nRegarding the tank used as a cistern, the Department will approve of having a smaller tank installed to replace the present one, which was destroyed through freezing.\n\nIt is noted that the agent is arranging to have the toilets repaired and thoroughly cleaned.\n\nThe change in the teaching arrangements for next school year is noted. The Department is taking this matter up with the church authorities and you will be advised later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

Stephenson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., 8th April, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the White Bear Indian Day School inspected April 4th, 1930.\n\nSince my last inspection Miss M. K. Anderson has been appointed teacher. Miss Anderson holds her 2nd Class certificate, and has had a number of years teaching experience. She presents the lessons in an interesting manner and is obtaining good results.\n\nThe roll calls for 16 pupils, 10 boys and 6 girls. The grades are arranged as follows,- Grade 1 - 7; Grade 2 - 9. This is the first time since I have inspected the school that I have been able to hear the children read so as to be heard at any distance. There is still room for improvement, but I believe in time Miss Anderson will accomplish it. Some of these children are 12 to 14 years of age, and should at least be in Grade 5 or 6; however up till this year the school has been at a stand still. I believe if Miss Anderson remains the Department can expect marked improvement in the children. The discipline is good.\n\nThe children were fairly well dressed, and were clean and tidy in appearance.\n\nA noon-day lunch is provided which consists of soup and biscuits. The girls prepare the meal and wash the dishes. Miss Anderson remains at school during the noon hour and supervises the work as well as the children's recreation.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-5, part 2)\nI noticed that the children have individual drinking cups, as well as towels and combs, and apparently these are all made use of.\n\nThe school building is in good repair. Outside windows were provided and these greatly improved conditions, as it was difficult to heat the building previously.\n\nThis year an effort will be made to have a school garden. This side of the work has had practically no attention during the past and the garden usually turned out to be little better than a weed patch. Miss Anderson is interested in outside work, and I am sure the work will be carried on equally as well as is the classroom work.\n\nThe attendance during the past few months has dropped so that the average ranges between 9 and 10. Some of the children live a distance of about 3 miles from the school, and lately the roads have been very bad. As soon as the snow is gone I would expect a much better attendance. I am pleased to report the marked change at this school, and I feel the Department is fortunate in the appointment of Miss Anderson as teacher.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report made by Inspector Hamilton on the White Bear Indian Day School, in the Moose Mountain Agency.\n\nThe report is quite favourable. Matters in connection with this school have greatly improved in the last year, and I am looking for even further improvement in the coming year.\n\nA few years ago we did supply this school with the necessary tools to work a garden, but they never made a success of the work. I feel, however, that the people who are now in charge of the school will take more interest in this particular line of work and we shall have some results.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Bupt General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your 308-11 of the 12th instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his inspection of the White Bear Indian Day School. The Department is pleased to note that there has been a marked improvement at this school under the charge of Miss Anderson as teacher, and that conditions generally are satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nM. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR W. LEWIS,\nDATED JUNE 23RD, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nWHITE BEAR INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 115-1-6.\n\nThe buildings consist of the school and toilets. From the outside, they appear in fairly good condition. The school is very old and I understand cold in winter. They are owned by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nScreens should certainly be provided. There were innumerable flies in the school. Screen doors should also be provided. The ventilation was not the best. I could discern a distinct odor. Possibly this is unavoidable.\nOttawa, August 15, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 308-11 of the 9th instant, enclosing the report of the Provincial School Inspector, Mr. W. Lewis, on his visit in June, last, to the White Bear Indian Day School. The Department has noted the reference made by the Inspector to the supplying of screens for the windows and for one door. If you consider that these screens are required before next Spring, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of same to the school. It is thought, however, that it may not be necessary to supply this equipment at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI have just received a letter from the Indian Agent at the Moose Mountain Reserve with reference to several small items for repairs to the Day School which were incorporated in his Estimates for the current year. These will involve an expenditure of about $30.00, and, as they appear to be necessary and urgent, I have directed him to proceed with the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 6th, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, in which you advise that you have authorized an expenditure of $20., to cover minor repairs at the White Bear Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

June 16th, 1931.\n\nInspector Hamilton's report on White Bear Indian Day School, Moose Mountain Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the White Bear Indian Day School, inspected on June 11th, 1931.\n\nThe teacher in charge is Miss L. R. Nelson. The roll calls for 23 pupils, and I found 12 present. The average for May was 15.9, and the June attendance, so far, is higher. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 16     |\n| II    | 4      |\n| III   | 3      |\n\nThe children appeared to be well along in their grades, and a marked improvement can be noted in the manner in which they read and speak. Two years ago they could scarcely speak beyond a whisper and appeared too shy and frightened to attempt answering the most simple questions; today such is not the case.\n\nThe children were fairly well clothed, neat in appearance, and clean. All had their hair neatly combed.\n\nThe classroom was tidy and bright. A screen door has been provided, also screens for the windows, so that I found the room well aired and free of flies.\n\nA noon-day meal is provided, and this is prepared in the school kitchen by the girls, under the supervision of the teacher. I found the kitchen tidy,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 624-5, part 2)\nand the wash sink clean. The children are provided with individual towels and cups. Miss Nelson is the first teacher for years to make use of the kitchen, which is fairly well equipped and most suitable for the work. However, if this room is to be used during the coming winter, some work will be needed on the foundation, and storm windows should be provided. The room is on the north side of the building and is very cold and draughty.\n\nThe eavetroughing needs repairing as most of the water is lost before it reaches the cistern. The soft water is used for dishwashing and for the children.\n\nA garden was planted, but, due to the extremely dry weather, has made little headway, and I doubt if it will amount to much.\n\nMiss Nelson is doing excellent work, and I was delighted with the manner in which the work is carried on.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., June 20, 1931\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith Inspector Hamilton's report on the White Bear Indian Day School, in the Moose Mountain Agency.\n\nIt seems to me the Department should provide for the repairs required to the kitchen. In the Estimates we asked for $50.00 for interior painting and $12.00 for repairs to the eavetroughing. I do not know whether or not this has been allowed, but if it has I believe we could make the necessary repairs to the kitchen and eavetroughing for $62.00 and the painting could stand over for another year. I have not the exact figures but I do not think it should be much more than this amount.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nM. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 25, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 308-11 of the 20th instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his recent inspection of the White Bear Indian Day School. The Department notes that there is improvement in the general conditions at this school and that progress is being made under the teacher, Miss Nelson.\n\nRegarding the repairs to the kitchen and eavestroughing, I have to say that the Department will approve of the expenditure required in having the repairs to the foundation of the kitchen and to the eavestroughing carried out. It is noted you estimate the cost to be approximately $62. This work should be done during the summer holidays. Any painting will have to stand over for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This tank is 8 ft long, 6 ft wide, and 6 ft deep, is rectangular in shape, constructed of galvanised iron encased in a plank form for support. The tank was constructed close against the earth side of the cellar, and the planks on one side have now become rotten through contact with the earth and have allowed the earth wall to cave in and break one long side of the tank.\n\nThere is no well at the school and soft water storage is depended on entirely for cleansing purposes\u2014drinking water is carried from the well at the mission which is about 150 yards away.\n\nThe present tank has several times previously developed leaks and has been repaired but it is now beyond repair; it appears to have been in use since the additions were built on to the school many years ago.\n\nI would suggest that one or two round galvanised tanks be installed in place of the old tank, with a storage capacity of 40 to 50 barrels.\n\nI included an item of $200 in the Estimates for 1933/4 for repairs at this school.\n\nPlease instruct me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.W. Stephenson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 15, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the condition of the soft water tank in the cellar at the White Bear's Indian Day School. It is noted that the present tank is now beyond repair and that you recommend the installation of two round galvanized tanks, with a storage capacity of 40 to 50 barrels.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the cost of supplying one galvanized tank of sufficient capacity to meet the requirements. It is considered that it should not be necessary to provide water storage to the capacity stated by you, but that one tank having a capacity of, say, from 12 to 15 barrels would store sufficient water to meet all requirements at this school. Our funds will be so limited next fiscal year that it may not be possible to provide the expenditure required in furnishing and installing the tank. We will await your estimate before deciding whether authority can be granted or not. Please furnish full particulars as to the type and size of tank you would recommend for the purpose and what work would be necessary in connection with the installation.\n\nRegarding the item which you placed in your estimates for repairs at this school, I have to say that it was not possible to provide same in the estimates of this Department for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. W. Stephenson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nSir,-\n\nRe White Bear's Day School in this Agency.\n\nIt has been customary at this school to serve a noon meal to the pupils. The food provided has been beef soup, biscuits, vegetables when available, or boiled rice and milk\u2014the latter prepared from milk powder.\n\nI shall be pleased to be informed whether or not this practice may be continued.\n\nThe school re-opened on Monday 24th inst after the Easter recess and the attendance has been very good for the three days\u2014on Monday 23 pupils were present, on Tuesday-25, and today-25.\n\nIn the case of some of the pupils I am aware that the meal received at the school is the best one obtained during the day.\n\nThe older girls prepare the meal under the supervision of the teacher, and thus receive instruction in simple culinary methods.\n\nIn the Estimates for 1933/4 I included items of biscuits, soap, rice, drimilk, rolled oats, and beef. The biscuits have now been received but the invoices have not yet come to hand. I shall be glad to know if any of the items requested under the heading of equipment have been allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.W. Stephenson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 2nd, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the midday meal at the White Bear's Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that you have already received biscuits but, with regard to the other items mentioned, you should again communicate with the Department about the middle of August and a decision will be made regarding what additional amount, if any, can be allowed for midday meal purposes. When writing at that time, you should give an estimate of the expenditure that would be required for the period November 1st, 1933, to April 30th, 1934. Our appropriation has been reduced and it is necessary to keep all expenditure as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. W. Stephenson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCarlyle, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to Departmental letter 113-1-5 of March 15th last regarding a water storage tank for White Bear's Day School I beg to inform the Department that I have only just been able to obtain a quotation on this tank as the party quoting could not visit the school sooner.\n\nMessrs Porteous Bros of Carlyle, who are the nearest firm handling or constructing water tanks, quote $4924.75 for a 15 barrel tank installed at the school.

It also appears to give us the post office address of Mr. Ostrander as Broadview.\n\nWe would be pleased if you would verify this and let us know if Broadview is the correct post office address or if it should be Carlyle. We wrote a letter to Mr. Ostrander when we first received this order and addressed it to Broadview, but up to the present have not had any reply, which leads us to believe that perhaps this is not the correct post office address.\nAwaiting your further commands,\n\nwe are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nCHRISTIE SCHOOL SUPPLY, LTD.\n\nSales Manager.\nOttawa, January 9th., 1934.\n\nDear Sirs,-\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, in reference to our Order No. 310 for school desks.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the order has evidently been placed in the wrong envelope and gone to Mr. Ostrander.

We are in receipt of a letter from them saying that they have written to you in connection with that matter, but have had no reply. Will you be good enough if you have the order to forward it to them immediately, and also complete the enclosed advice note by entering thereon the number of desks received and return to the Department at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.C.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nCrooked Lake Agency\nBroadview Sask.\nMay 7th, 1934\n\nSir:\n\nAbout a year ago an outdoor galvanized iron tank for water was purchased for the White Bears Day School. This tank dropped off the stand and was ruined. Another tank is badly needed. It must be admitted that this tank was ruined through being badly installed in the first place as the first time that the tank was filled the stand upon which it rested collapsed with the weight and the tank was ruined beyond repair. This happened previous to my taking charge at that point.\n\nThe source of supply of drinking water for the White Bear Day School is \u00bd mile from the school and if a small iron tank holding about two barrels of water costing about $7.00 were supplied to the school a team which hauls water from the same well for the Farm Instructor's residence could stop at the school when necessary and keep the tank filled with drinking water.\n\nAt the present time there is no place to store water.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 15, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, I beg to say that you may purchase a small iron tank for the White Bear Indian Day School, at an approximate cost of $7.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI find that there is very little bread being made by the Indians of the White Bears Band and very little effort has been made by the Indians in this connection in the past. I have talked to the Indians considerably on this question and it seems that the chief reason why very little bread is baked is in the fact that so few of them have stoves fit for baking. I have always looked upon the use of bread instead of bannock as a very progressive step in improving the Indian's home conditions and I have wondered if the Department would consider using Band Funds of this Band for the purchase of stoves where they are needed and where they will be used for this purpose.\n\nI would submit two reasons that in my opinion are good ones for this step, first that the use of bread instead of bannock saves a great deal of flour, second that the children of this Reserve attend the Day-school and walk a distance of from two to eight miles per day going to and from school and I found upon enquiries from 22 pupils that only two have bread in their homes, the remainder having only bannock and a majority of those using bannock make this daily trip with absolutely nothing in their stomachs but a piece of bannock and a cup of tea. As the mid-day meal at this school has been discontinued reference Dept. Letter 113-1-5 March 18th last, the majority of the children will be badly undernourished and not fit for the walking expected of them and I expect that irregular school attendance will be the result.\n\nIf the Department is not prepared to approve of the supplying of stoves I beg to enquire whether consideration would be given to the expenditure of an amount not exceeding $100.00 per annum from Band Funds, the money to be used for providing a mid-day meal to the children at school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 17, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, I beg to say that Band Funds will not bear the expenditure of $100 per annum for supplying food for midday meals at the White Bears Indian Day School. This applies, also, to your suggestion that stoves be purchased for those Indians who might require them. As you are aware, an interest distribution has just been made to this Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B.

The cost of meat and vegetables used for this purpose is very small compared to the benefits derived from the same and I would like very much to have this restored for the winter.\n\nIf an amount of $50.00 is allowed I shall see that it is kept within that amount to the end of the fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

However, it has been decided to allow the sum of $25 for the purchase of meat and vegetables. In addition to this amount a supply of biscuits will reach you in the near future.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, you may expend a sum not exceeding $4 in the purchase of gravel for the school yard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

There are 12 R.C. children of this Reserve attending Residential Schools, 11 at the Qu'Appelle School and 1 at the Cowessess I.R. School and 3 Protestant children attending the Brandon School.\n\nThe three schools mentioned are well able to fill their quota without taking any children from White Bear Reserve and I am sure that if a 2-room undenominational school were in operation the children would be receiving a useful education at a much lower per capita cost.\n\nThe available children of school age by the beginning of next term after allowing for five possible discharges would be 60 of which about one half are members of the R.C. Church and the other half members of the United Church and while I do not wish the Department to feel that any favoritism is shown in the day school to members of either church under the present arrangement I believe that a day school operated strictly under Departmental Supervision with the teachers responsible only to the Department would be more satisfactory to all.\n\nIf the Department decides to erect a 2-room day school it should be erected at a point approximately one mile directly west of the present day school then the greatest distance that any child would have to travel to school would be 3 miles and I believe that the operation of one 2-roomed day school together with a small outlay for transportation during bad weather would be more economical than the operation of two small schools which would be perhaps 3 miles apart.\n\nThere is another point which deserves some consideration viz:- the fact that the present day school is operated more or less under the auspices of the United Church and as the two denominations are evenly divided I presume that a second day school would be expected by the R.C. Authorities to be run under their auspices, therefore the question immediately arises in connection with transportation of R.C. children from the east side of the reserve to the west and vice versa. A 2-roomed school operated strictly by the Department would overcome this difficulty.\n\nAs I have no idea what the views of the Department are in this matter I am pointing out the circumstances as I view them and I shall be glad to furnish any further information which might be of assistance.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B.

ORR,-\n\nWhite Bears (Moose Mountain Agency)\n\nTo erect two-roomed school building with living quarters for two teachers - $8,000.\n\nThe above amount is provided in the Estimates, 1935-36, to erect a two-roomed day school building to provide classroom accommodation for 75 children and living quarters for two teachers. Each classroom should provide seating accommodation for approximately 36 children.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain a site, centrally located, making it possible to have approximately 80% of the children reside within one mile and very few at a greater distance. The site selected should be dry, level and with water supply available. It would require approximately 1\u00bd to 2 acres for buildings and playground.\n\nBesides the school building, it would be necessary to erect toilets and a woodshed. Mr. Agent Ostreider would arrange for the obtaining of the site.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would be glad to be advised as to what money will be available this year for that purpose.\n\nI may state that the Indians on this Reserve are very poor, the children have to come to school in many cases 3 to 4 miles on foot and practically the only decent meal they have in the course of the day is the meal provided at the school and that has been rather on the small side lately.\n\nI appreciate the financial difficulty is the main question but I feel that in this case it is a matter of money exceptionally well expended as besides placing the children in a far better condition to receive the education offered them it greatly benefits their physical condition and I have no hesitation in strongly recommending that the Department consider this as favourably as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The response in brightness and general appearance since the little extra food was given has been so noticeable in the children that she is not going to be able to continue the present meal to the end of the term and asks if the Department would consider the granting of an additional $10. for this purpose.\n\nBasing her request on her enrollment of 30 pupils which have maintained an average attendance of 90 to 95%, she states that when $35. was granted the cost for the daily meal for the 30 pupils was $17.50 for all not including the potatoes which they grew themselves. When they received the additional $15. this brought up the total cost for the $200 days to $25 per day for the 30 meals. With an additional $10., if granted, the cost would not be in excess of $30 per day for the thirty pupils or less than one cent per day per pupil for this purpose.\n\nMay I have authority to purchase the additional $10. of food between now and the end of the academic year?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEben A.W.R.

In estimating the cost of serving a midday meal at this school, the teacher overlooked the fact that the Department supplied nine hundred (900) pounds of biscuits, which cost slightly over $90.00.\n\nThe amount already allowed for midday meal purposes is considered sufficient to provide a meal until the fine weather starts. This is the only provision that our funds will permit us allowing and, therefore, it will not be possible to grant the further amount requested in your recent letter. I may add that, at other Indian day schools where midday meals are provided, it is distinctly understood that the Department will only allow funds for the purpose during the extremely cold weather.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

This should, in the opinion of two of our experienced Day School teachers, supply a nourishing meal, and I would recommend that it be granted.\n\nIt will be noted that he is asking for 100 lbs. of onions and 100 lbs. of carrots. Onions and carrots were planted in the Community Garden at White Bear this season, but were destroyed by the grasshoppers and other pests, consequently will have to be purchased. With regard to the biscuits supplied by the Department, it is very doubtful, in my mind, whether on Reserves where we can secure meat, vegetables, etc., it is economical to supply these biscuits. A saving might be made by discontinuing the biscuits and increasing the amount of meat and vegetables. This is a matter I am taking up with our experienced teachers, and upon receipt of their replies I will submit a report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

It was understood that your letter referred to the exterior painting and as no funds were provided for the purpose it was not possible to favourably consider your request.\n\nIf the redecorating of the interior of the school can be done at a reasonable cost it may be possible to provide the necessary funds. Please let me have an estimate of the cost of redecorating the interior and at the same time state if Indians can be employed or if it will be necessary to secure outside labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: White Bear Day School.\n\nI beg to advise that I am in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Mabel K. Waywell, teacher at the above school, drawing attention to the fact that at the opening of the next term they will have an enrollment of 39 pupils, and that their allowance for the mid-day meal is $50.00 or an expenditure of 25\u00a2 a day for the 200 teaching days. She points out that this is not sufficient to give a nourishing lunch and asks that the amount be increased.\n\nIt is the opinion of all engaged in the field that a nourishing mid-day lunch is of the utmost importance. It is the only nourishing meal which many of our day school children receive. This particularly applies to White Bear Reserve, where the health conditions are probably the worst in the Province. I have no hesitation in stating that a good, nourishing mid-day meal would do more to build up these children and improve their health than double the amount of money spent in any other way. I would recommend that this allowance be increased to $75.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

As this will be the total amount that can be allowed during the academic year 1940-41 it will likely permit the serving of midday lunch during the winter months only.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nCrooked Lake Agency,\nBroadview, Sask.\nNov. 16th 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 113-1-5 of September 10th 1940, re the midday lunch at the White Bears Day School, would you kindly consider an increase of $25.00 in order to purchase flour, lard and baking powder; that the older girls might make baking powder biscuits, to take the place of the regular biscuits.\n\nThere are 34 pupils at this school coming from very poor Indian homes, the midday meal is often the best of the day for them. There is a kitchen at the school fairly well equipped, and the benefit from the food and the cooking lessons would mean a great deal to health and welfare of the children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. J. D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nNovember 22, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from W.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent, with reference to the amount authorized for midday meal supplies at the White Bears School.\n\nUntil last year it was our custom to supply biscuits and allow an additional amount of $50.00 for the academic year. In 1939 the late Inspector Robertson strongly recommended increasing the amount to $75.00 plus biscuits.\n\nDue to the reduction in our appropriation biscuits were not purchased this year but we have authorized an expenditure of $75.00. I am now in receipt of a letter from the Agent requesting that this be increased to $100.00 as he states there are 34 pupils attending the school and that they come from very poor homes.\n\nIt must be kept in mind by all officials that economies have to be effected in every possible way. Besides, at the majority of Indian day schools in Canada it has been the custom to only serve a midday lunch during the winter months. Apparently without any specific instructions to that effect the teacher in charge of the White Bears School serves a midday lunch throughout the entire academic year.\n\nAre conditions on the White Bears Reserve as serious as the Indian Agent intimates? With the above in\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nScarth & Victoria,\nRegina, Sask.\nmind do you consider it necessary to serve a midday lunch on every school day? Do you advise increasing the amount to $100.00 as the Agent requests?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 113-1-5 of the 22nd instent in connection with the request of Mr. Kerley, the Indian Agent at Broadview, that White Bear School be given $100.00 a year to supply a mid-day meal to the children there.\n\nI happened to visit the school last week and I found a very competent teacher in charge in the person of Mrs. Mabel K. Waywell, who is full of energy and I would say is rendering splendid work in this institution. However, as the Provincial Superintendent of Schools was there a few days ahead of me, we will wait until we receive his report. In looking over the registration I found that there were 34 pupils on the roll and an average attendance for the year of approximately 30. For an Indian Day School this is outstanding.\n\nOne hundred dollars a year for the mid-day meal would be approximately $11.10 per month, or .55\u00a2 per day. The Department must know that the White Bear Indians are a very poor lot. Tuberculosis and scrofula are rampant on this Reserve. The Indians have had seven crop failures in a row and this Fall is the first year for many that the Indians have had any returns at all. I am sure our Branch will realize that the children need something nourishing for a mid-day meal, coming from homes probably where they receive nothing but a little bannock and tea for breakfast. This .55\u00a2 per day provides something to make soup with for the children, the vegetables used are grown there. I think if our Branch want to be reasonable they will agree with me that this .55\u00a2 a day is not excessive.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 3, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo it has been decided to allow, for the academic year 1940-41, a total amount of $100.00 for the purchase of midday lunch supplies for the White Bear Indian Day School. This is the total amount that can be allowed and must not be over-expended.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nSearth & Victoria,\nRegina, Sask.\nExtract from Mr. Christianson's letter dated November 28, 1940.\n\nI wish to point out here that she (the teacher) has no cupboard room at the school for books and stationery, and her desk consists of an old rickety table. If the Department would furnish her with some cupboards that can be built on the wall, and a teacher's desk, I am sure it would be very much appreciated.\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a report regarding his recent visit to the White Bears School Mr. Christianson states that the teacher requires a new desk and that a cupboard is required to store books and stationery. Could you have these items of furniture built locally by some competent carpenter? If so, please let me know the approximate cost of material and labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nEver since starting this Indian school we have been laboring under a great disadvantage, owing partly to unsuitable textbooks. The books we are using are very good for pupils who are familiar with the English language. But most of the lessons in them are not suited for teaching a child to speak the English language. Such a book may do in an industrial school where the pupil hears nothing but English spoken. But it is very different in the day school where the pupil hears no English except from the teacher. We find the best way to teach English is by question and answer. And I have included a sample lesson which we find very useful in teaching them to speak English. We have the pupils commit the question and answers to memory. Then after reading the lesson we ask questions and have them answer and by varying the questions we get them to thoroughly understand what they have been reading. For instance we will ask the question, \"What does the bear like for dinner?\" Then after receiving the answer we will ask, \"What do you like for dinner?\"\n\nIs there any such a book as published? And if not do you think you could recommend having such an one published. The lessons could be taken from the Ontario Readers with a supplement to each following the lesson.\n\nI think if any Indian child had gone through the Ontario Second Reader so revised would have a very good knowledge of the Indian language.\n\nWill you kindly let me hear from you on the subject.\n\nIndian Affairs Ottawa\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6295, file 625-1, part 1)\nThe White Bear.\n\nQuestion: What did we read about in another lesson?\nAnswer: About the black bear.\n\n1. What have we been reading in this lesson?\n   A. About the white or polar bear\n\n2. Where does the white bear live?\n   A. He lives away in the far north\n\n3. Do they have much winter there?\n   A. Yes; there is nearly always snow on the ground\n\n4. What kind of summers do they have there?\n   A. The summer is very cold\n\n5. What makes the summer so cold?\n   A. There are always great pieces of ice floating in the sea\n\n6. Is the bear afraid of the cold?\n   A. No; he has a coat of fur to keep him warm\n\n7. Can you tell me why he never slips on the ice?\n   A. Because the soles of his feet are covered with long hair\n\n8. Does he make any noise when he walks?\n   A. No; he walks as softly as if on a pair of fur shoes\n\n9. Why does he like to live near the sea?\n   A. Because he likes to swim in the water\n\n10. Can you give another reason?\n    A. For there he finds plenty of fish and seals to eat\n\n11. What does he like to have for dinner?\n    A. He likes to catch a seal for his dinner\n\n12. What does he try to find?\n    A. He tries to find a place where the water is clear\n\n13. Why does he do that?\n    A. Because he knows the seals will come up there to breathe\n\n14. When he finds such a place what does he do?\n    A. He watches for the seals and keeps very quiet\n\n15. When a seal comes up to breathe what does it generally do?\n    A. It crawls out upon the ice and goes to sleep\n2. What does the bear do then?\nA. He creep softly along towards the seal\n2. Does he make any noise in so doing?\nA. No, the long hair on his feet enables him to walk noiselessly.\n2. If the seal wakes up and looks around what does the bear do?\nA. He falls down flat upon the ice and lies very still\n2. What does the seal do then?\nA. When he sees no one about he goes to sleep again\n2. How does the bear act then?\nA. He does the same thing over and over again until he gets close to the seal then he jumps on him and kills and eats him\n2. Does he ever hunt anything else than seals?\nA. Yes, he sometimes catches fish\n2. How does he catch fish?\nA. He jumps into the water after them and he is so quick that he often catches them before they can get away\n2. When he can find neither seals or fish what does he do?\nA. He goes to a place where the snow has melted and feeds on berries.\n2. Yes, but if he can find no berries what does he eat?\nA. He eats sea-weed which he can always find along the seashore.\n2. Where does the black bear live in the winter?\nA. He crawls into his den and there sleeps till the next spring.\n2. Does the white bear do the same?\nA. No; where the white bear lives there is winter nearly all the time.\nOTTAWA, 27th February, 1900\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, in which you ask to be supplied with a text book specially adapted for teaching the Indian children to speak and understand English; and in reply I beg to say that as far as the Department is aware, there is no such book published, but it might be well for you to make enquiries of the Indian Commissioner in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

The school is closed for the winter and I do not think it would be advisable to open it again unless a new building is erected within easier reach of the pupils.

Nearly every young man and woman can speak and write intelligibly in English, and make all necessary calculations.\n\nCommissioner's Marginal Note\n\nNo provision asked for a new building. We are in receipt of a letter from Mr. W.R. Tucker dated Apr. 4, informing me that the school was re-opened on that date.

The Parents who have children of school age inquired whether it was the intention of the Department to re-open the day school on this reserve. They would be glad to see this done, and spoke as though they would avail themselves of its benefits. I made a census of the school population and found that there are 8 boys and 3 girls, in all 11 children of school age on the reserve. These belong to seven families and their homes are situated that they could all conveniently attend a school centrally located. The school was closed some years ago on account of the removal of the Indians from the vicinity of the school to a more remote part of the reserve, the number of children of school age being then also quite small.\n\nAs an evidence of the results of former school work here I may say that during the inspection I had occasion to obtain the signatures of ten men of the band. Six of them signed their names in perfectly regular and legible hand. These are, of course, among the younger men; and they also speak English with a fair degree of correctness and fluency.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nPrince Albert (sgnd) W. J.

Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from its Inspector on the Moose Woods reserve in which he says that there eleven children of school age so situated that they could attend a school centrally located. You will recollect this school was closed some years ago on account of the removal of the Indians to a more remote part of the reserve.\n\nThe number of children above stated would hardly warrant the engagement of a high salaried teacher for that work alone and the Department would be glad to know if you have any suggestions to offer as to how the needs of these children might be met. The school when in operation before was in charge of Mr. Tucker.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T.

It would\nrequire a new school house, if the old\nbuilding is not centrally located. I think\nif the Department would be willing to put\nup the building and give a grant of $300\nor $400 a person might be placed in charge\nwho would do good work to the few that are\nthere. If there are only eleven of school age,\nthe attendance will be very small. It is a\nquestion as to whether the expenditure will\nbe justified.

There are quite a number of children of school age upon the Reserve, and unless something is done for them soon they will grow up illiterate.\n\nWhat is the policy of your department regarding the education of the Indians? I might say that there is a\nschool or mission house there.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd inst., relative to the advisability of re-opening the day school on the Moose Woods reserve, I have the honour to report that I have no definite information later than that contained in paragraph 17 of my report on the inspection of this reserve dated Dec. 17th, 1909. The school population was at that time 11, and it may now be slightly larger as there were then a relatively large number of children just under school age.\n\nThe opening of a school here would involve considerable expense; but in my opinion it would be wisely incurred, provided there is a prospect of securing a suitable teacher, who would require to be a married man or woman. The Indians are located in such a way that it should be possible to maintain an average attendance close to the maximum. The parents of children of school age are still, I understand, anxious for the re-building and re-opening of the school.\n\nI shall make inquiry, and if I can obtain any further information bearing on the subject that would be of value I shall communicate it to the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to departmental letter of the latter part of May, (which I have not before me), I have the honour to state that I requested the Overseer of the Moose Woods reserve to make a careful enumeration of the children of school age on the reserve, and he now informs me the school population numbers 14. He also states the Indians are unanimously in favour of petitioning the Department for the re-opening of the school. He is of opinion that these children would attend regularly; and two other Indians of that band with whom I have spoken recently on the subject are also of opinion that a regular attendance of these children could be had. There would be no need for conveying the pupils to school in this instance, as the school could be so located as to be within easy reach of all; and their present abodes can safely be counted upon as being permanent so far as the center of population is concerned.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nBill\nWait for letter\nfrom Mr. Turner\nExtract from Report of W.J. Chisholm, Inspector of Indian Agencies, on Moose Woods Reserve, Dated December 6th, 1911. Original on File 154027-22.\n\nQuestion of reopening Day Schools\n\n14. An enumeration of the school population was made and there were found to be 10 boys and 5 girls; or including the family of Yellow Hawk, who are likely to be permanent residents, 11 boys and 6 girls, making 17 in all of school age. These are all so situated that they could attend a school centrally located; and this condition is not likely to be altered. The Indians, all of whom are anxious for the reopening of the school, express the opinion that these children would all attend regularly, barring cases of sickness. In most cases the children are learning a few words of English from their parents, and to count both in the Dakota language and in English. A day school with a well trained teacher in charge would do a valuable work here.\n\nRespectfully submitted\n\n(Sgd.) W.J. Chisholm\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, January 10, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn May, last, the Rev. T. J. Colquette, of Dundurn, Sask., applied to the Department for the re-opening of the school on the Moose Woods Reserve. Mr. Colquette was asked to communicate with you and give you full particulars as to the reasons for the re-opening of this school. The matter has again been brought to the attention of the Department by Mr. Inspector Chisholm. It would appear advisable to re-open the school and I should be pleased to have you look into the matter and nominate a competent and, if possible, qualified teacher to take charge. The Department will allow a liberal salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt.

The expenditure called for is very large and the Department is not disposed to undertake this work unless assured that there will be reasonable prospects of a successful school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir,\n\nSome six weeks ago I received a departmental letter inquiring as to the present school population of the Moose Woods reserve. I am only now in possession of accurate information on the subject, which I beg to submit.\n\nThere are at present 15 children of school age on this reserve, the oldest of these being 13 years and the majority being between 8 and 10 years.\n\nProvided the school were centrally located the homes of all these children would be within a distance of half a mile from such location; and there is no prospect of any material change in these conditions.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 22, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to previous correspondence in connection with the establishment of a school on the Moose Woods Reserve I have to ask you to be good enough to advise the Department whether you could not arrange to visit this reserve with a view to recruiting these children for the Brandon Industrial School. There are hardly sufficient children to justify the Department in the erection of new buildings for a day school and in any event it is thought that it would be in the best interests of the children to send them to the industrial school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nTo the Secretary,\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your favor of the 22nd instant, No. 119699/1, I carried on a correspondence with Charley Eagle of Moose Woods Reserve re recruits for this Institute a few months ago, but up to the present none have been brought in. I will renew that correspondence and if possible back it up by a visit to the Reserve and see what can be done. If this could be carried out it would be a much better arrangement for the education of the children than the establishment of a day school on the Reserve.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEL.\nTF.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Indians have renewed their request for the re-opening of the day school, and are very urgent in the matter. They complain that some of their children are coming to be almost beyond the age for attendance at school and yet as they have never had a school to attend they are entirely without education. They have been asked repeatedly to send their children to the industrial or boarding schools; but they are strongly opposed to the idea, and say that they will never allow their children to leave home for the purpose of attending school. I have observed that about half the Indians of this Band over 21 years of age, or practically all between 21 and 40 years, are able to speak, read and write English, while those under 21 can speak but a few words and cannot read or write. This certainly is an unfortunate state of things.\n\nThere are at present 14 children of school age in the Band. Two of these are at Qu'Appelle at present, but it is understood that their father would bring them back promptly in case a school were opened here. They are not attending school at Qu'Appelle, but merely staying with a relative.\n\nThe total population, and the school population, have been rather steady for some years past; and they are so located on the reserve that all would be within three quarters of a mile from a school centrally situated.\nIt is impossible to predict with absolute certainty what the future of the Band may be; but to all present appearances a school would be useful and successful from the beginning, and with a prospect of its usefulness increasing.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Sgd) W.J. Chisholm,\nInsp.of Indian Agencies.\n\nPrince Albert,\nNov.15,1913.\nJanuary 8th, 1914.\n\nSir -\n\nReferring to your report on the Moose Woods Reserve inspected on November 5th, I beg to say that your remarks with regard to the opening of a day school are noted. I would ask you to state if there is any building available in which a school could be conducted temporarily in order to see what the results would be. With a total population of school age of 16 there might be some doubt as to the advisability of incurring large expenditure in the way of erecting new buildings. If no such building is available the Department would like to have your views as to what should be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI write you to ask if you would consider erecting a new school house on the Goose Woods Reserve.\n\nThere are on the Reserve at the present time, eight families who have altogether fourteen children of school age; and we do not wish to send our children to the Industrial School.\n\nWe would rather have a school of our own on the Reserve with a Protestant teacher, so we know what the day school did for the children, while we had one here; and we all of us do not want a Priest to come to the Reserve to get our children to go to Our Appelle or else where.\n\nIf the Department will not consider building this school, we would make arrangements to send our children to a school in Dundurn or elsewhere as our children are coming to the age when they ought to be studying somewhere and not grow up without education.\n\nI have the honor, to be Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Chas. R. Eagle,\nOverseer,\nMoose Woods Reserve,\nNutana, Sask.\nReplying to your letter of the 5th inst., as to a building available for school purposes on the Moose Woods reserve, I have the honour to state that there is a small building used as church, and precisely in the right location, which would, I am sure, be gladly loaned for school purposes by the authorities of the Methodist Church, to whom it belongs. The building is of logs, well roofed, properly lighted, and suitable for use temporarily.\n\nFor teacher's dwelling there is no house quite suitable to be had on or near the reserve. However, a new, clean, Indians' dwelling, constructed of logs, with good floor and shingle roof, and consisting of two rooms, might, I think, be had near by at a rental of about $10 per month. The rooms are a fair size, and if the teacher's family were very small such quarters might suit temporarily.\n\nThe noon meal could be prepared and served either in the kitchen of the teacher's house or in an Indian's kitchen near by, as might be found most convenient.\n\nIn case you decide to adopt some such measure I shall visit the reserve and make the best arrangement possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 26, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in reference to opening a day school on the Moose Woods Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the fact that a building can be obtained for school purposes and one rented for the use of the teacher and his family, the Department will be prepared to open a day school there and the Rev. Mr. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, has been written to to this effect and requested to nominate a suitable person to take charge of this school. As soon as a teacher is secured the Department will agree to pay a rental of $10.00 a month for the house for him, if you cannot make a better arrangement.\n\nWith regard to the mid-day meal you should furnish suitable supplies for this purpose when the school is in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Mr. Sanderson has been doing Mission work for the Methodist Church for some three or four years. Mr. Chisholm, the Inspector of Schools in Northern Saskatchewan, recommends his work. He is a man of staunch Christian character, kindly in disposition, is a good vocalist and has an excellent wife. I am not sure that he has a Normal training but it would be very difficult to find a more suitable man to teach this school.\n\nMr. McLeod who was engaged and sent there, got discouraged and left the field, and we put Mr. Sanderson in to take up the work which accounts for his name on the last report.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

He had, of course, been informed that such an allowance was made in some other instances and that he assumed from the beginning that Mrs. Sanderson would have the same remuneration for her services. The work has undoubtedly been done faithfully and the noon meal is serving a good purpose, not only in providing one substantial and well cooked meal for children in some instances not too well fed at home, but also in rendering the school more attractive and helping to maintain a regular attendance.\n\nI would accordingly recommend that the allowance asked for be made, dating from November 1st, at which date Mrs. Sanderson took up her residence on the reserve and began her duties in this capacity.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDuncan C.

Mr. Sanderson, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Owing to sickness among the Children I closed school for the last two weeks in February-15th. to the 26th.\"\n\nHe then goes into particulars, showing that a rash broke out on several children of different families, and that he thought it better that the school should be closed to avoid any danger of a possibly contagious disease. He states that he visited the houses from time to time, giving direction regarding fresh air, cleanliness and diet and that the results proved very beneficial and satisfactory.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDundurn, Sask.\n\nNov.7, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Ghisholm,\n\nWe purpose giving up the appointment of the Dundurn circuit; Mrs. Sanderson and myself have been overtaxed. We are prepared to give our whole time to the work of \"Moose Woods Reserve\" providing satisfactory arrangements can be made.\n\nWe have been married seven years and we have never had a dwelling that is worthy of the name \"Home.\" We even dread the severe months of winter on the \"Reservation\". We could not during the severe cold period sleep upstairs and to have beds downstairs would be constant confusion. We don't mind the inconvenience when the climate favours it. I would not mind bearing it alone, but when it comes to my wife and children having to bear it it is more than can be expected. If a house and school is built next year things will be much better.\n\nWe would be glad if you could arrange for us to have four months leave of absence, during which time we would visit our home in England, which has been well earned. Family ties have been broken. Three years ago I lost my Father, and Mother is now feeble. Mrs. Sanderson had a brother killed in the war; her parents had an accident at the same time and only escaped death, and are still suffering the consequences. So if you could do this we would appreciate it very much; and no doubt we would resume our work by April 1st 1916 with new life, and we would teach through the summer months.\nOr, if you would permit, I would try and secure someone to take the work for Jan., Feb., Mar., and we would teach until the middle of December ----- and that person would have the use of our home there.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n\"R. H. Sanderson.\"\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a communication which I have just received from the Reverend R. H. Sanderson, Teacher on the Moose Woods Indian Reserve, in which he requests, for reasons which he gives at length, that he be allowed a leave of absence for four months during the coming winter. The circumstances are fully described and I can add nothing further on the subject except to recommend that the request be granted and that the school be left vacant during the period, not because of the season, for the pupils could and would attend as well during that period as during the summer, but because of the improbability of a substitute being secured for so short a term who would accomplish anything of value in connection with the school work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nWJC/WMS.\n\nEncl.

Mr. Sanderson's absence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Chas. R. Eagle,\nOverseer,\nMoose Woods Indian Reserve,\nDundurn, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith my report on inspection of Moose Woods Day School.\n\nIt will be noted from the report that this school at date of inspection was under the charge of Mr. Chas. Hawke, who is taking the place of the Rev. Mr. Sanderson. This being the case it was impossible to give as full a report on the work of this school as it would under ordinary conditions.\n\nI shall feel obliged if you will kindly advise me when the Rev. Mr. Sanderson is expected to return and take charge of the school. The arrangement made with Mr. Hawke would only be suitable, of course, as a purely temporary arrangement. I would not consider Mr. Hawke competent to take charge of this school permanently.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nExtract\n\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR TROMBIE ON THE WHITE CAP SIOUX DAY SCHOOL.\n\nTeacher,- Charles Hawke,- age,-30 years, - married\nPrevious experience,- none.\n\nMr.Hawke is an ex-pupil of this school and at time of\ninspection was taking the place of Rev.R.H.Sanderson, who was on a\nvisit to the Old Country. I note that Mr.Charles Hawke was\nauthorized by the Department's letter of December 20th, 1915, to\ntake charge of the school in the absence of Mr.Sanderson. I find,\nhowever, that the school was not reopened until February 1st, partly\non account of sickness among the pupils and owing to the fact that\nMr.Hawke was unable to find register and school supplies. The keys\nfor the teacher's desk etc had been left by Mr.Sanderson with some\nperson at Dundurn. I find that the school was closed from Thursday,\nNovember 16, 1915, till Tuesday February 1st, 1916.\n\nMr.Hawke, not having any previous experience in\nteaching, is therefore handicapped in his work. He is most\nenthusiastic, however, and appears to have fairly good control over\nhis pupils. His writing is very good and his work on the blackboard\nis very well done.\nOttawa, April 11th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing your report on the White Cap Sioux school, on Moose Woods Reserve.\n\nYour remarks with regard to the teacher, and also, with regard to the period during which the school was closed, have been noted.\n\nThe Department understands that Rev. Mr. Sanderson was expected to return to this school on April 1st.\n\nThe Overseer of the Moose Woods is being written to-day and requested to notify the Department if Mr. Sanderson has returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.B. Crombie, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, April 11th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn your letter of December 11th, 1915, you informed the Department that Mr. Sanderson had been granted leave until April 1st. At that time, the Department authorised you to appoint Charles Hawk to take charge of the school during Mr. Sanderson's absence.\n\nKindly inform the Department, at once, if Mr. Sanderson has returned, as it is considered that there should be a competent teacher in charge of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sanderson stating that he has just returned and would like to know if the Department wishes him to continue teaching at Moose Woods Reserve Day School.\n\nI have all along been under the impression that Mr Chas. Hawke was hired to teach school until such time as Mr Sanderson would return, presumably about April 1st.\n\nAs there would appear to be some doubt in Mr Sanderson's mind as to whether he is supposed to take charge of the school again, and as I am not familiar with what arrangement was made with Mr Sanderson regarding leave of absence, I shall feel obliged if you will kindly advise Mr Sanderson direct to Dundurn just what your wishes are in this matter.\n\nI may say that in the meantime Mr Hawke is continuing at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 17, 1916.\n\nRev.

This letter was returned to the Department uncalled for. The Department will be glad to have you take up your duties at this school again as soon as possible, as Charles Hawk was only appointed to take charge during your absence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Crombie, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nServing to serve sickness which my wife had in the month of January, in England, she was unable to return with me, which makes it impossible for me to continue the school at Moose Woods, unless the Department can see their way clear to the following suggestion: That rooms be obtained in the town of Duncan, and that the children be kept here continuously until proper facilities be obtained on the Reservation for constructing the school. I doubt very much, even my wife here, that under existing conditions could we continue. We both love the work but what we are asked to do is too much for human nature has its limits. Unless the above suggestion or similar can be adopted, I must ask you to kindly accept this as my resignation.\n\nYours very Truly,\nR.H. Sanderson.\nDundurn, Sask.

As you state that you are not prepared to take up your duties at this school under the present conditions your resignation is accepted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Eagle, Overseer of this reserve, has been informed that until a new teacher is appointed Mr. Charles Hawk may remain on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and secretary.\n\nW. B.

R. H. Sanderson taking up school duties again, I received a letter from Mr. Sanderson part of which reads as follows: \"To-day I have written the Department asking them to accept my resignation unless they fall into line with a suggestion, 'That rooms be obtained in Dundurn and that the children be kept here continuously until suitable facilities be obtained on the Reservation for the conducting of the school.' Owing to sickness that Mrs. Sanderson had in the month of January she was not able to return with me, which makes my task of teaching impossible under existing conditions.\"\n\nI have just returned from Dundurn where I interviewed Mr. Sanderson regarding this matter and beg to report as follows:\n\nI find that Mr. Sanderson while taking charge of the school on the Reserve attended to three Methodist missions where he held services every Sunday. These services were held at Dundurn, Coate's School nine miles north-east of Dundurn, and Woodview School five miles northeast of Dundurn. In order to do this he apparently left the Reserve on Saturday morning and did not return until Monday noon, Mrs. Sanderson taking charge of the school in his absence. Owing to the fact that Mrs. Sanderson has not yet returned from the Old Country Mr. Sanderson apparently does not wish to do his own housekeeping on the Reserve.\n\nI pointed out to Mr. Sanderson that the suggestion he made in his letter to the Department was an impossible one and it is quite evident that he made this suggestion with the idea of having an arrangement with the Department which would enable him to carry on his mission work. It is quite apparent, however, that the school work as far as he is concerned is a secondary consideration.\n\nWhen at the Reserve on Friday last I called at the school and from what I observed I am satisfied so far as Mr. Hawke is concerned he has made considerable improvement since my previous visit. While his methods of teaching are not of the best yet I notice that the pupils are making some progress and the discipline is perfectly good. Mr. Hawke understood that he was to give place to Mr. Sanderson right away, but I advised him to continue teaching and in all probability the Department would ask him to continue school until summer vacation. This he was quite agreeable to do. Mr. Hawke, so far, has no farm operations to attend to so that he is at liberty to continue.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Hawke be asked to teach until summer vacation and in the mean time a teacher be found to take the place of Mr. Sanderson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 625-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your No. 119699-1 of May 10, 1916 authorizing Mr. Charlie Hawke to continue teaching at the above school until such time as a new teacher should be appointed. In making the temporary arrangement with Mr. Hawke I was of the opinion that a permanent teacher would, no doubt, be appointed to take charge of the school after the summer vacation and arranged with Mr. Hawke accordingly. Charlie Hawke, being able to make much more money by harvesting and threshing this fall, is therefore not desirous of continuing to teach. I have seen the Rev. C. Endicott of Saskatoon, Superintendent of Methodist Missions, who informs me that he is trying to arrange for a teacher to take charge of the school at once. As this school should now be open I considered it advisable to advise you just what had taken place.\n\nAs you are, no doubt, aware, there is no proper accommodation on this Reserve for a teacher and this I discussed with Mr. Endicott. I think that arrangements could be made by the teacher with the Forest Ranger, whose residence adjoins the Reserve, to rent rooms for about $10.00 per month until such time as a permanent teacher's residence is erected at the Reserve. I have no doubt that Mrs. Charlie Hawke will continue serving noon meal to the scholars.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6295, file 625-1, part 1)\nMr. Endicott informs me that he did not think he would be able to get a married man for this position and the above suggestions are in the event of a single man being appointed.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 27, 1916.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the school on the Moose Woods Reserve and stating that there is no proper accommodation for a teacher on the reserve, but that you think arrangements could be made with the Forest Ranger, whose residence adjoins the reserve, to rent rooms for about $10.00 per month until such time as a permanent teacher's residence is erected.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is hoped that Rev. Mr. Endicott, Superintendent of Methodist Missions, will be able to secure a suitable teacher to take charge of this school. I may inform you, however, that the Department is not prepared to pay rent for rooms for the teacher, as it is considered that the salary allowed, viz.- $600.00 per annum should be sufficient to cover everything.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have had the necessary work done on the school building, authorized by the Department, and the building is now made comfortable and in good shape. I have been in correspondence with the Rev. C. Endicott, Saskatoon, who now advises me that so far he has been unsuccessful in getting a teacher for this school. He is in hopes, however, of getting a suitable man to take up this work to commence January 1st and I am in hopes that he will succeed in this, as, in the interests of this Band, I consider it highly advisable that this school should be re-opened at the earliest possible date.\n\nI have written to the Rev. Mr. Endicott suggesting to him that in the event of his not being able to secure a suitable man for January 1st, he make a temporary arrangement with Mr. Charlie Hawke, who taught in this school for a few months after Mr. Sanderson left. I found that the children made some progress under Mr. Hawke and the Indians on this Reserve are very anxious to have the school re-opened at once.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 23rd 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in regard to securing a teacher for the Moose Woods School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if a qualified teacher is not secured for this school by January 1st, Mr. Charlie Hawk may be placed in charge temporarily.

They also object to Hawke coming to school during harvest season when he goes out and works for the white settlers. The reason for this is the high wages paid at that season.\n\nFurthermore, the Rev. Mr. Endicott, Methodist missionary living in Red River, \"Bark Lake,\" who is in charge of the missionary work among the Indians, also came down to have a white teacher take charge of the school, but as there is no teacher available...\nMEMO.\n\nor a vacant house, or the means which the teacher might occupy he has taken in action in the matter. I would suggest that the matter be taken up with the Church authorities and if possible that a suitable house be erected on the reserve during the coming summer, and that the services of a duly qualified teacher be engaged.\n\nSigned: [Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, March 28, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Agent Schmidt of the Duck Lake Agency, in which he states that when visiting the Moose Woods Reserve, White Cap Sioux, on the 7th instant, the band, at a meeting held that night, discussed at length the question of having a white teacher take charge of their school. The Indians find that the children are not making satisfactory progress under the present teacher, Charles Hawke, who is an Indian and who is not qualified. The Agent suggests that, as there is no teacher's residence nor a vacant house on the reserve which the teacher could occupy, a teacher's house be erected during the coming summer.\n\nThe Department would like you to take up the question of securing a qualified white teacher to take charge of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

For this reason we have been unable to keep a white man as teacher. If as suggested by your agent a residence can be built, or some suitable house obtained, we would be able to secure a permanent teacher for this work.\n\nI believe that this is the only solution from our experience in the past and from all I know of the conditions on this reserve. If the Department can undertake to build, I would suggest that it would be very inexpensive and not large. A house 20 x 24 with a summer kitchen would be large enough. There would be no use of providing for a man with a family on the account of lack of school accommodation for white children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nOttawa, April 16, 1918.\n\nRev.

On the return the teacher states that the reason for this was that he had to close the school on November 17th owing to it being impossible to proceed daily from Dundurn to the school. It is apparent from this that the teacher is residing in Dundurn, which must be, at least, about twelve miles from the school.\n\nIt is evident from the number of days that the school was open during the September and December quarters that this arrangement is not going to prove satisfactory for the successful carrying on of the school work. The Department feels that it should only pay Mr. Coveney grant for the December quarter for 31 days, but, before making any payment I am placing the matter before you.\n\nI would be pleased to receive a full report from you, furnishing your views in regard to the general situation that has arisen at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Coveney to take charge of the White Cap Sioux Indian Day School on the Moose Woods Reserve.\n\nThe September return showed that the school was only open for twelve days during that quarter but, as the Department felt that the church authorities had, no doubt, paid his salary in full, a cheque for his full quarter's salary was sent to your general treasurer.\n\nThe December quarter return showed that the school was open 31 days only, during that quarter. The Department decided to allow salary for two months and a cheque for $100.00 is being forwarded under separate cover.\n\nFrom information received it is apparent that the teacher resides in Dundurn, which must, at least, be twelve miles from the school and this, no doubt, accounts for the few number of days that this school was conducted during the September and December quarters. It is doubtful however, if this arrangement will prove satisfactory and I would be pleased if you would advise whether you have had any report on the work that is being done. As we have no agent at this point, the only news received by the Department is the information required by the quarterly return.\n\nI might point out that the Department is considering placing in the Supplementary Estimates an item covering the cost of the erection of a combined school and teacher's residence at this place. If this work is proceeded with we would like to secure, if possible, the services of a man and his wife, the former to act as overseer and the latter as teacher.\n\nKindly advise if you consider a suitable couple could be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. C. E. Manning, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Home Missions,\nMethodist Church in Canada,\nMassey Buildings\n10 Queen Street West,\nToronto, Ont.\nApril Seventh,\nNineteen-twentytwo\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI duly received your letter of April 4th, in which you enquire about the teacher in the White Cap Sioux Indian Day School on the Moose Woods Reserve.\n\nOur information is to the effect that for a time Rev. H.E. Coveney, who serves the Dundurn Mission, drove in from his field to supply this school, but at the present time Mr. Hawke is the teacher in charge. He is paid at the rate of $3.00 a day for five days a week service. You will probably get the returns for the January Quarter in a short time, which will show the number of days the school has been kept open.\n\nWe are glad to note that you are placing in the supplementary estimates an item covering the erection of a combined school and teacher's residence on the above Reserve. We will interest ourselves in helping to secure a man and his wife - the former to act as overseer and the latter as teacher, as suggested in your letter.\n\nI am very sorry to learn by a wire received from Mr. J. D. McLean, that Dr. Duncan Scott has sustained injury and is unable to transact business. I trust that it is not very serious.\n\nA delegation representing the Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist Churches has arranged to be in Ottawa on Thursday, April the 13th, to interview the Premier, the Finance Minister, the Superintendent General, and if possible the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, re including in the supplementary estimates a grant to erect the buildings we badly need.\n\nHoping to see you then,\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC. E. Manning\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI sent Rev. Arthur Barner a copy of the letter which I wrote you on April 7th, with a statement of the situation as I understood it in connection with the School on the Moose Woods Reserve. He replies in part as follows:\n\n\"The statement you make to Mr. Russell Ferrier is true, as far as it goes, but I shall be glad if you will write to him again upon receipt of this, completing the statement.\n\nIt is as follows:\n\n\"When I visited this Reserve on the 31st of January last I found that the school had been closed since the 17th of November last, owing to the fact that Mr. Coveney could not get through so much deep snow every day. I proposed to the Indians that Mr. Charles Hawke (who had taught there previously) be engaged by Mr. Coveney as supply until he could again resume duties in the spring; Mr. Coveney to be recognized as in charge of the school. This was agreed to by all concerned. I reported my action to Rev.C.Endicott and to Rev.C.W.Brown of Saskatoon. They agreed to this as a temporary arrangement.\n\n\"I agree with Mr. Ferrier's judgment that the plan of supplying the school from Dundurn is impracticable and I so reported to Messrs. Endicott and Brown when I returned from the Reserve. They, however, wished to give the scheme a good try-out. On the other hand we are up against the difficulty of being absolutely unable to station a teacher there as there is no building in which to live. Mr.Hawke is a member of the Band and has his home on the Reserve. I would not be in favor of engaging him for any great length of time as teacher, though it is much better to have him in charge than it would be to close the school.\n\n\"I think the Department has treated us very generously as far as the finances for this year are concerned. I also think that Mr. Ferrier's suggestion of a man and wife there to take charge of the Reserve and the school is the ideal arrangement. Strange to say I received an application from a graduate of one of our Agricultural Colleges just this morning, who, I think, would fill such a place. I am corresponding with him and if I think him suitable I will send his name to Mr. Ferrier.\n\n\"Since I returned from Toronto I received word from Rev.C.W.Brown that Dundurn has entered the Union ranks and...\"\nMr. R.T. Ferrier.\n\n\"that as a consequence it will be impossible for the minister at that point to teach school at Moose Woods after the present year. All things work together for good.\"\n\nI think this gives you full information in regard to the matter, and trust it will be satisfactory. Mr. Barner will write you as soon as he is satisfied relative to the applicant to whom he refers in his letter.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nI am,\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E. Manning\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, April 24, 1922.\n\nDear Dr. Manning:\n\nI have yours of the 7th and 19th instant, referring to the White Cap Sioux Indian Day School on the Moose Wood reserve. I am still hopeful that funds will be provided this year for the erection of a combined school and teacher's residence. In the event of success in this connection, you will be asked to nominate a man and his wife for this reserve. The lady could do the teaching, at a salary say of $750 per annum plus whatever bonus is allowed by law. The man could act as lay missionary for the church and would receive from the Department a small stipend as overseer, a second remuneration as janitor and a third payment in case the services of a truant officer are required. A total of perhaps $350 per annum could be offered for these services, or a grand total for man and wife of $1250, which includes the present bonus.\n\nIf the Missionary Society could give say $350 a year to the man for services as missionary, there is no reason, with the new building as a home, why we could not engage the services of an excellent couple, who would put the Moose Wood reserve into a splendid condition. If at all possible, the man should have a knowledge of farming activities. I personally feel that this is a splendid opportunity to do real Christian and civilizing work, and a good couple would make their presence and worth felt throughout a community of 60 Indian people.\n\nThis information and these suggestions are confidential for the time being, and no overtures should be made in which it is promised that a new building is to be erected. I am sending to the Rev. Mr. Barner a copy of this letter, for his information.\n\nThe temporary arrangements with Mr. Charles Hawke, although not wholly satisfactory, are approved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

Her salary is not to be included on your monthly pay sheets. Her salary will be paid at the end of each quarter, at the time the salary of the teacher is being paid.\n\nA midday meal should be given the pupils of the school, and Mrs. Churchill should assist in the preparation and serving of the same. Besides, she should visit the Indians' Homes on the reserve and instruct the women in housekeeping and the care of children, and give any treatment she can in cases of illness.\n\nAs supplies will be required for the providing of the midday meal, the Department will authorize you to incur a small expenditure in the purchase of these supplies. A requisition should be prepared and forwarded giving a list and the quantities of the supplies required for this purpose for at least two months. When this list is received, consideration will be given to the authorizing of the supplies asked for. In the meantime, you may purchase a sufficient quantity to carry on. There should be ample accommodation in either the teacher's residence or the school to prepare and serve the midday meal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6295, file 625-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReference to the last paragraph of your letter of the 10th of February, No. 109-11-1, re giving a mid-day meal to the children of the Moose Woods reserve day school.\n\nI have the honour to report that I visited the school and made arrangements for the serving of the meal. This will be prepared by Mrs. Churchill who will be assisted by the older girls from the school. The meal will be served in the teachers residence.\n\nI asked Mrs. Churchill to prepare a list of what she would require for the meal, the following is part of same.\n\n| Item       | Quantity |\n|------------|----------|\n| Beef       | 20 lbs. per month |\n| Lard       | .5 \"      |\n| Tea        | 2 \"       |\n| Rice       | 2 \"       |\n| Beans      | 6 \"       |\n| Oatmeal    | 10 \"      |\n| Sugar      | 10 \"      |\n| Soap       | 5 \"       |\n| Potatoes   | 1 Bu.     |\n| Baking Powder | 1 lb. |\n\nI recommend that the above articles be authorized. Fresh beef can be bought in Dundurn and brought out to the reserve on different occasions by Indians who go for their mail. The lard is to be used as butter.\n\nMrs. Churchill also asked for Cocoa, Corn starch, Tapioca, Evaporated apples, or prunes, or other dried fruit. I informed her that I did not supply these at other schools, and would not purchase same unless authorized by the Department. A flour bin is necessary for the school, and I recommend that one be purchased at a cost of about $4.00.\n\nMr. Churchill asked me whether the Department would supply fuel for his residence and the school room. Since he arrived on the reserve he has purchased wood and coal for his house. The Indians have as yet supplied the fuel for the school room free of charge. As Mrs. Churchill is to prepare the children's meal in her home, I think it only fair that we supply the fuel for this purpose at least, if not for heating the house throughout.\nI wish to draw the Department's attention to the size of the teachers house. This is a two room cottage, 18x24 feet, the front room is used as a living room and bedroom, the rear part for a kitchen, dining room etc., as it is these rooms are crowded. I noticed Mrs Churchill's washing machine, and other things were left outside, these cannot be used inside in summer, in rain & snow. Other things such as storm sash, screen doors and windows when taken down must be stored away, and we have no room. I would suggest that an addition say 12 feet be built at the back of the building, all under the roof, this addition could be divided into two rooms, one to be used as a pantry and the other as a store room, wood shed or summer kitchen.\n\nIf the Department approves of the idea, I will prepare a list of material required and figure out the approximate cost of building same.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 24th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, giving a list of the supplies that will be required each month in the providing of a midday meal to the children of the Whitecap Sioux Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery each month of the following supplies:\n\n- Beef - 20 Lbs.\n- Oatmeal - 10 Lbs.\n- Lard - 5 Lbs.\n- Sugar - 10 Lbs.\n- Tea - 2 Lbs.\n- Soap - 5 Lbs.\n- Rice - 2 Lbs.\n- Potatoes - 1 Bu.\n- Beans - 6 Lbs.\n- Baking Powder - 1 Lb.\n\nThe quantities mentioned above should not be exceeded.\n\nWe are not prepared to furnish cocoa, corn starch, tapioca, evaporated apples or prunes.\n\nIf possible competitive prices should be obtained for the furnishing of the above supplies each month.\n\nYou may purchase a flour bin, and the cost should not exceed your estimate of approximately $4.\n\nRegarding fuel for the teacher's residence, I beg to say that the Department will pay for the fuel required for the residence and for the preparation of the children's meals. You may, therefore, arrange from time to time for the purchase of the fuel required in wood or coal. Only the quantity of fuel absolutely necessary for the above purpose should be supplied. Competitive prices should be obtained, if possible, and the fuel purchased from the person quoting the lowest price.\n\nRegarding the wood for the school, it is considered that the Indians, as in the past, should continue to supply the quantity required for the school room, free of charge.\n\nRegarding the providing of more accommodation in connection with the teacher's residence, I beg to say that you should state the cost of the material in erecting an addition of, say, 12' at the back of the present teacher's residence. You should also ascertain whether the teacher will, with the help of Indian labour, undertake the erection\n\nC. Paul Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nof this addition.

Schmidt Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nMay 14th, 1924\n\nSir:\n\nI have no report from Mrs. Churchill of Moose Woods Reserve, Dundurn, other than a letter saying she was prevented from performing her customary duties owing to illness. I never understood why the Department appointed a Field Matron for the Sioux Reserve. It was absolutely unnecessary, and I do not think her duties amount to anything. I was opposed to this, but I was not consulted.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Sd) W.M. GRAHAM\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nMrs. Churchill, wife of the school teacher on the White Cap Sioux Reserve, Dundurn, has applied for six weeks leave of absence, commencing July 1st.\n\nIt is unusual to grant six weeks leave of absence to field matrons, especially when they have only been in the service about a year, but as Mrs. Churchill was appointed to a position that I did not think should have been created, and her duties are very, very light, I do not think that the Department should hesitate in granting her the leave of absence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 30th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 305-11 of the 25th instant, with reference to the leave of absence requested by Mrs. G. Churchill, junior teacher of the White Cap Sioux Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that approval is granted for Mrs. Churchill's absence for the period covering the usual summer holidays allowed to teachers in Indian day schools.\n\nI would point out that Mrs. Churchill's position is that of junior teacher, as you were informed in official letter of December 26, 1922.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nJuly 21, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 395-11 dated July 7th, re the report made by Mr. A.R. Brown of the Normal School, Saskatoon, on the Moose Woods Indian School which he inspected, and asking me for my report on the matter.\n\nIn my opinion the children of this reserve are not different to other Indian children, and if the attendance and punctuality is good and fair, as I am told it is, I see no reason why the children cannot make as good progress here as in other schools.\n\nAs to it being difficult to hear the pupils read, there is no difference here, with other schools, and it simply rests with the teacher whether they mutter or shout their words. I have been at this school and remarked to the teachers that the pupils did not speak loud enough, that they did not stand properly with head up and face forward, that they held their readers in front of their faces. I have made them stand erect - look me in the face, and repeat till they spoke loudly words they had muttered.\n\nThere is no reason why children 8-10 or 12 years of age in standards 1-2 or 3 should not understand words they read, if these words have been explained to them.\n\nAs regards their being more or less hopeless as potential scholars, personally I should not class them as such, as they appear to me to be intelligent children whom I should judge possess sufficient efficiency and expressing power which could be developed advantageously.\n\nThe class room is a well-built well-light room with individual seats for all pupils. It is situate about the centre of the settlement, which is a row of homes built along the main road, the further of which is about one half mile from the school. Attendance and punctuality should be good if the teacher exercises proper vigilence and authority.\n\nThe parents are all favorable to, and ask for education for their children.\n\nAs regards Mr. Churchill, he has never impressed me as an Indian School teacher, and much less as a master.\n\nWhen I first met him on the reserve he told me that he was there temporarily only, or until he could get some other position.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nC. Fant Schmidt,\nIndian Agent,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6295, file 625-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nIn my letter to you of the 7th instant reference is made to the comments by the Provincial School Inspector when he visited the Moose Woods Indian School in the Duck Lake Agency. I requested the Agent, Mr. C. F. Schmidt, to let me have his views on the subject and for the information of the Department I beg to enclose a copy of his reply dated the 21st instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

They gave me to understand that they wished to continue another year, so I was not anticipating any change there. I am personally acquainted with Mr. Churchill particularly and they are very excellent people. They are both of exceedingly fine character and very energetic. I believe they intend taking up missionary work in the foreign field at some time in the future. I do not think we have any finer people in our Indian work anywhere in Canada. I would be very slow indeed to believe any adverse reports concerning their work. However, if the Department so desires I will investigate any report which may have reached the Department.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to ask for authority to purchase for the Moose Woods Sioux Indian Day School, the following vegetables:\n\n3 Bu. Carrots @ $2.00  $6.00\n2 \" Onions @ 3.50    7.00\n5 \" Turnips @ 2.00    10.00\n30 \" Potatoes @ .75\u00a2   22.50\n\nThese are to be used in preparing the mid-day meal for the pupils attending the school.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.P. Schmidt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 3rd, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 25th ultimo, I beg to inform you that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following supplies for the midday meal for the pupils attending the Whitescap Sioux (Moose Woods) Indian Day School, viz:\n\n- 3 Bu. Carrots,\n- 2 \" Onions,\n- 5 \" Turnips,\n- 30 \" Potatoes.\n\nWe note that you estimate the cost of these supplies to be approximately $45.50. Competitive prices should, if possible, be obtained, and properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Schmidt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 14, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing reports from the teachers of the John Smiths, Fort a la Corne North and Whitescap Sioux Indian Day Schools for the month of October, last.\n\nWith reference to the report from the teacher of the last named school, it is noted that the greater part of the supplies furnished such as bacon, rice and oatmeal were spoiled and unfit for use. Please furnish a report as to the reason the above food supplies became unsuitable for use, and if it was caused through any carelessness on the part of the teacher or others who handled the same. The teacher states that she returned these supplies to Charles Eagle, the farm instructor. You should make full enquiry regarding these spoiled provisions, and inform the department as to the reason therefor. The teacher requests that a fresh supply of bacon, oatmeal and rice be furnished. Please state your views regarding this request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. F. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, No. 109-11-1, re report of the teacher of the Whitecap Sioux School, re the condition of the supplies furnished for the preparation of the mid-day meal for the pupils of the school, and asking me for a report on same.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the supplies shipped to the reserve for the destitute and the school are kept by Overseer Chas. R. Eagle in a small frame building at his home.\n\nThe bacon shipped some time ago being coarse, heavy, and fat, was kept in the shipping box & became mouldy and rather strong.\n\nThe rice and oatmeal are kept in tin cans, but it appears that mice got into same and left traces of their visit.\n\nThe balance on hand in the Overseers possession on the 30th ultimo was bacon, 153 lbs., rolled oats 56 lbs., rice 30 lbs. These will be issued to the destitute Indians during the winter months, and a fresh supply will be sent early in the year.\n\nTo say that these supplies are unfit for use is a matter on which opinions may differ, and the fact that they are kept and issued to the field nation by an Indian is, I have noticed, not altogether to her liking. I visited the reserve on the 12th instant, and told Mr. Churchill that he would ship him some rice and oatmeal which he will keep at his home. I will not ship any bacon at present as I have ordered some beef for the winter months. In the summer months I have made arrangements with the local butcher Mr. Taylor at Dundurn to supply the school with a few pounds of fresh beef each week; this is brought out by Mr. Churchill when he goes to town, or by an Indian who is given an order by Mr. Churchill to get same.\n\nI trust that the above explanation will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.P.

The situation it has created makes it almost impossible for us to carry on, and as yet I have received no satisfaction whatever from you with regard to the matter.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent at Duck Lake, in which he states as follows,-\n\n\"When I visited this reserve on the 11th inst. I found both Mr. & Mrs. Churchill were away and was informed by the Overseer, Chas. Eagle, that they had left the reserve during June, going to Winnipeg to attend some school or University. No application for leave of absence was received at this office.\"\n\nIt seems to me that no Government officer should leave the reserve without obtaining authority from those over him. Mrs. Churchill at least should not have left, and I am of the opinion that Mr. Churchill should have had leave of absence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 8, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-11 of the 2nd instant, with reference to the absence of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill from the Whitecap Sioux Reserve on the 11th ultimo. In reply I have to point out that these two workers, who are classified as teacher and assistant teacher, are paid for the 10 teaching months of the year and it is entirely probable that they did not consider it necessary to ask for leave of absence for the holiday months of July and August.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of Department letter 109-11-1 of 8th instant with reference to principals of schools being absent from the Institutions in their charge without the Department or this office being aware of the fact.\n\nYour letter referred to mentions only the case of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill of the Whitecap Sioux Day School but is apparently intended to cover the cases previously reported by me and referred to in my letter of 2nd instant to which it is a reply.\n\nIt is, of course, well understood that teachers employed and paid for ten teaching months would not consider it necessary to apply for leave during the time for which they receive no remuneration and in such cases it would be sufficient if they notified the Indian Agent, who would in turn inform this office, that they intended to be absent from the Reserve between certain dates. In the case under discussion the Indian Agent visited the Reserve expecting to see Mr. and Mrs. Churchill and had he known that they would not have been there he would have arranged his visit at a time to make sure of meeting them. It appears also that they left in June to attend College and it is just possible that they were away for some part of the time for which they drew salaries. If teachers can be absent without notice to the Department we will never know whether they are on duty or not. I think they should be required to give reasonable notice to the Indian Agent of their intention to leave the neighbourhood.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nThe more important phase of the matter however, has not been dealt with. The real trouble arises when principals of the residential schools are away at a time when it is important that they should be at home. Cases have occurred lately in which an Inspector of this Department has arrived at an institution of this kind expecting to transact important business, only to find that the principal is away. It is not necessary for me to point out that our Inspectors are much too busy to make long, expensive trips, only to be handicapped in this way when they arrive.\n\nI do not think the Church Authorities under whose auspices these schools are operated would have the slightest objection to their appointees being required to arrange with the Department when they desire to be away. It is not my wish to approach the matter in an arbitrary or domineering spirit - I merely wish to secure their co-operation with a view to greater harmony and efficiency. The point I wish to make particularly clear is that a great deal of valuable time has been wasted and work has been delayed on account of my not knowing that this, that, or the other man was not on duty at a time when his presence was necessary. This can be avoided by the Department requiring that leave of absence be arranged for through this office and I trust this will be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner,\nOttawa, Sept. 18, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-11 of the 12th instant, with particular reference to the absence of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill from the Whitecap Sioux Day School and with general reference to principals of Indian residential schools being absent from their institutions without the permission of the Department. I might point out that my 109-11-1 of the 8th instant did not refer to the general question - please see my 108-1-1 to you of the same date.\n\nI note that Mr. and Mrs. Churchill left in June to attend college.

He evidently intends to belittle the teacher and his work but in so doing places himself in a very undesirable position. The report being so contradictory condemns itself and needs no further consideration. I visited this school the latter part of November and found Mr. Churchill, the teacher, present in a well kept, clean class-room. His equipment and methods were up-to-date but the attendance was small. Mr. Churchill has a Second-Class Normal Certificate and is a graduate in Arts. In looking over the school register, I found that the average attendance in 1924 was 8.6 and for 1925 7.5 and the outlook is that it will not be any better for 1926. The entire population for the reserve is 67. Mrs. Churchill as nurse and field matron, is doing very good work on the reserve. She holds a Second-Class Normal Certificate.\n\nIf Mr. and Mrs. Churchill are desirous of doing this two-fold work of teaching and field matron work, they are well qualified for it and should have a larger number of people to whom they can render service. The expenditure of keeping two employees for such a small number of people can hardly be justified. The schoolhouse and teachers' residence are both very small buildings, yet large enough to accommodate all the children of school age and make a suitable home for one lady teacher. If the Department wishes to continue this work it should be under a lady teacher who would undertake to do the work of a field matron as well. A better arrangement would be to close the school and take the children to Brandon or Edmonton and this would be my recommendation.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6295, file 625-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 24, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, concerning the Whitecap Sioux Indian Day School. I note your suggestion that either a single teacher be appointed or the school closed. In reply I have to state the Department considers that a further trial should be given to this work. You should make arrangements for a single teacher for this school as from September first, next. And, if you are desirous of having Mr. and Mrs. Churchill remain in Indian work, you should in due course nominate them for some other school or absorb them in the residential school activity. Our local officers will not be informed of this proposed change, until after you have made definite arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

The following are the details:\n\nMr Chas Eagle, the Overseer, brought the bacon to the teachers residence in the forenoon. It was placed on top of an old dresser, in the drawers of which it was our custom to keep the meat after it had been cut up in convenient size pieces. On this particular occasion the meat was left on the dresser while we visited a neighbor off the reserve, between the hours of five and eight P.M. On our return we noticed that the meat was gone. Diligent search failed to locate it anywhere near the house, and as there were no traces of dogs having pulled the meat away, it was concluded that it had been stolen by some unknown party.\n\nDuring our absence, while visiting, Miss Nora Littlecrow and her sister had been left in charge of the house. In the interval they had gone for a short walk with the baby, and it was perhaps then that the meat was taken, although the girls had not paid any particular attention to it and were not aware that it had been taken until we made mention of the fact. They had not noticed any dogs in the vicinity nor heard any noises near the house while they were inside.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) G.M. Churchill.\nREPORT of Provisions used at Moose Woods Day School\non Moose Woods Reserve, for the Month ended May 31, 1926\n\nAggregate Attendance: 138\nMeals Served: 138\n\n| Item       | On hand 1st of July | Received during Month | Used during Month | On hand at end of Month | REMARKS |\n|------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------|\n| FLOUR      | 45 lbs              | 25 lbs                | 20 lbs           |                         |         |\n| BACON      | 40 lbs              | 40 lbs                | 0                |                         | The bacon, 26 pounds of bacon were stolen. |\n| BEEF       | 0                   | 20 lbs                | 20 lbs           |                         |         |\n| TEA        | 2 lbs               | 1 lb                  | 1 lb             |                         |         |\n| RICE       | 20 lbs              | 5 lbs                 | 15 lbs           |                         |         |\n| SOAP       | 15 bars             | 7 bars                | 6 bars           |                         |         |\n| SUGAR      | 25 lbs              | 15 lbs                | 10 lbs           |                         | In order to save on the potatoes more flour, sugar, salt, beans, B. powder and lard were used in biscuits, soup dumplings etc. |\n| SALT       | 2 bags              | 1 bag                 | 1 bag            |                         |         |\n| POTATOES   |                     |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| BISCUITS   |                     |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| BEANS      | 15 lbs              | 8 lbs                 | 7 lbs            |                         |         |\n| OATMEAL    | 2 lbs               | 2 lbs                 | 0                |                         |         |\n| PEAS       |                     |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| B.

J. Hare to Moose Woods (Whitecap Sioux) Indian Day School at a salary of $30 per teaching month. I have advised Miss Hare that she will be expected to take up her duties on September 3rd next.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAMA.\nOctober 26th, 1929.\n\nDear Miss Hare,\n\nI wish to thank you for your report for the month of September regarding your field work among the Indians of Moose Woods Reserve.\n\nIf you can teach these people to keep their homes, their children, and themselves reasonably clean, you will be accomplishing a great deal, and in this connection I enclose a departmental circular which may be of help to you. It was originally prepared for distribution in remote areas, but if you find that it can be suitably distributed to the Indians of your district, further copies will be sent on request. Other circulars pertaining to health regulations of the Department are being forwarded to you under separate cover, and from time to time literature will be sent you which we hope will be helpful in your work. A set of publications issued by the Child Welfare Council of Canada are also being forwarded and your name will be placed on the mailing list of the Canadian Anti-Tuberculosis Society to receive publications issued for laymen, and which I think you will find of service. While it is recognized that a number of the pamphlets being sent you are not suitable for use on the reserves, it is thought that you will find the information in them suitable to use in your talks with the Indian women.\n\nWhile your September report is quite satisfactory, I would suggest that you might find it convenient to divide your monthly report into headings such as:\n\n(a) House to house visiting,\n(b) Sick calls,\n(c) Child welfare,\n(d) Classes or Mothers' Meetings,\n(e) General remarks and recommendations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss Helen J. Hare,\nDundurn, Sask.\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nMOOSE WOODS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nSince my last visit to this school Miss H. J. Hare has been appointed teacher. She holds her Second Class Professional, and has had 17 years teaching experience.\n\nThe roll calls for 11 pupils and last month the average attendance was 10.69. The grades are as follows\nMOOSE WOODS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nas follows:\n\nGrade I - 6\n\" II - 4\n\" III - 1\n\nThe children are very backward in their work and little, if any, progress is noticeable. Miss Hare has only been in charge since September, but is winning the confidence of the pupils and I expect she will do good work. The parents are very indifferent to education and consequently the children receive no encouragement from home. Furthermore, the parents all speak the Indian tongue and English only comes to the children during the few hours at school.\n\nThe school building and teacher's residence are both badly in need of painting. It is hoped to have this work carried out during the coming year if funds are obtainable.\nRegina, Sask., Dec. 11th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Duck Lake Agency, which were inspected by Mr. Hamilton during the month of November.\n\nThe children at the Moose Woods school are not doing very well. They are only in the three lower grades and this school has been open for years.\n\nW. M.

(RG 10, Volume 6295, file 625-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward, herewith, Provincial School Inspector Everts' report of an inspection of Moose Wood Indian Day School in the Duck Lake Agency.\n\nI was present in the class room while the Inspector was making his inspection. It will be noted by his report that the class standing in this school is away below what should be expected. I am quite in accord with him in his remarks in connection with conditions at this school and in my opinion it is not, as the teacher states, through lack of intelligence on the part of the children that this condition exists. They appear to me to be equal in intelligence to other children and I feel that a teacher who has belief in the possibility of educating the Indian children could do a great deal with them.\n\nThe teacher stated that if we knew the parents that these children sprang from we could understand their low state of intelligence. I made it a point to visit the parents and talked with them and found them to be bright and intelligent men, so that excuse does not carry any weight with me.\n\nComparison between the class room standing in this school and other Indian Day Schools where conditions are similar satisfies me that there is something wrong with the management. It is, in my opinion, very necessary that a teacher of Indian children or, I expect the same applies to any children, should be sympathetic and should have a belief that she can accomplish something. When a person starts out as apparently the teacher here has, with the belief that the Indian child is not capable of absorbing knowledge, I do not think that we can hope for much progress.\n\nI am quite in accord with the inspector when he suggests that a change should take place at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison, Inspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, June 20, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has received the report of the Public School Inspector on his recent inspection of the Whitecap Sioux (Voose Woods) Indian Day School. The Inspector states that the management of the school, under Miss Helena J. Hare, is most inefficient. Miss Hare has made very little success in the work. For your information, I quote from the Inspector's report, as follows:\n\n\"The management of the school is not considered at all efficient. If Indian children elsewhere can reach the requirements of the Saskatchewan curriculum, there should be no good reason why the same standard cannot be attained here. But the teacher does not seem to think this possible, does not believe in the ability of the children to reach the standing obtained elsewhere and does not seem to have confidence in herself to bring about these results. Her attitude is altogether antagonistic to suggestions.\"\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, who was present at the inspection, states that the class standing is way below what should be expected. He states that \"comparison between the class standing in this school and other Indian day schools where conditions are similar satisfies me that there is something wrong with the management. When a person starts out, as apparently the teacher here has, with the belief that the Indian child is not capable of absorbing knowledge, I do not think that we can hope for much progress.\" He further states that he is entirely in accord with the Inspector when he recommends that a change in teacher should take place at this school.\n\nI would request that Miss Hare's services be dispensed with, and that your Board nominate a qualified teacher for this school to replace Miss Hare, the duties of the new teacher to begin on or about September 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

J. Hare, the teacher. We are communicating with the authorities of the United Church of Canada, under whose auspices this school is conducted, informing them of the conditions as set forth in the Inspector's report, and requesting that they nominate the services of a qualified teacher to replace Miss Hare as from the beginning of the next school year. When we have the nomination of a new teacher you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, June 27th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your 305-11 of the 12th instant, enclosing Inspector Everts' report on his inspection of the Whitecap Sioux Indian Day School on the Moose Woods Reserve, I beg to say that this matter has been very carefully discussed with the Church authorities. It has been decided not to make any change for the academic year 1933-34.\n\nThe Department would appreciate your visiting this school on the occasion of your next trip to the reserve and give the teacher any possible assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, June 28, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to official letter to you, dated the 20th instant, regarding the report of the Public School Inspector on the services of Miss Helena J. Hare, teacher of the Whitecap Sioux (Moose Woods) Indian Day School and also to conversation with you while at the Department on the 26th instant. I now have to inform you that approval is granted for retaining Miss Hare's services for the coming school year. Mr. Inspector Murison, Regina, has been informed accordingly and requested, upon the occasion of his next visit to the reserve, to give Miss Hare any possible assistance towards securing a regular attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nReverend Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR H. A. EVERTS ON HIS VISIT TO THE MOOSE WOODS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nDATE OF INSPECTION - Oct. 24/34.\n\nSUCCESS - Rather mediocre, in fact I should not term her experience in this school a success in any appreciable measure. The pupils show very slow progress, even allowing for the fact that they might not be expected to progress as rapidly as children of white parents.\n\nThe routine work of the school could be arranged on a much more intensive basis, the children could receive much more encouragement to speak out clearly and to exert themselves mentally.\n\nOne is forced to ask the question if the teacher is not \"marking time\" to some extent.\n\nIt is felt that a younger teacher, with plenty of energy, with outstanding teaching ability and with improved organization could do much better.\n\nPupils attend quite regularly and no complaint was made regarding their punctuality.\n\nThis makes the matter of their progress in school a vital one. They do not show the progress that might be expected. In fact I have not been at all satisfied with this phase of the examination of the school. I am informed that on other reserves the pupils cover the same work as is prescribed for other children and attain suitable standing in their work.\n\nIt cannot be successfully maintained that the pupils are shy in the presence of strangers, because I taught a demonstration lesson on the \"direct method\" of teaching English, and had decidedly good results.\n\nIt is quite evident that, given an aggressive, sympathetic and enthusiastic teacher of ability, marked improvement in the standing of the pupils would be evident within a reasonable length of time. At the present rate of progress the pupils will not reach the standing that it considered normal for Grade IV pupils before they reach the age of 15 years, when most of them will discontinue school, with a very meagre equipment for the activities of adult life.\nOttawa, December 1, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to refer you to official letters of June 20th and 26th, 1933, with reference to Miss Helena J. Hare, teacher of the Whitecap Sioux (Moose Woods) Indian Day School.\n\nThe Public School Inspector, Mr. H. A. Everts, again visited this school on October 24th, last, and I enclose, for your information, some extracts from his report.\n\nIn forwarding the report, Mr. Inspector Murison writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I am of the opinion that it would be in the interests of all concerned if Miss Hare were transferred to some other point. I believe a change of environment would not only be beneficial to her, but would be a relief to both myself and the Indian Agent. I do not think it is a good thing to leave a woman too long in an isolated place like Moose Woods where there are no other associations at a reasonable distance other than that of Indians.\"\n\nI would appreciate your keeping in mind the reports that the Department have received regarding this teacher, with a view to making a change for the academic year 1935-36.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDecember 5th,\n1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Whitecap Sioux (Moose Woods)\nIndian Day School.\n\nI am in receipt of your communication of December 1st, enclosing an extract from the report of Inspector Everts on his visit to this School. I note also that Mr. Murison believes that it would be beneficial both to Miss Hare and to the School to have her transferred to some other point.\n\nI merely write to assure you that these considerations will be kept in mind when we are making nominations concerning our schools at the end of this academic year. We are anxious to meet every reasonable request of the Department which will help to improve the efficiency of our schools.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. Hare as teacher of the Moose Woods (Whitecap Sioux) Indian Day School for the next school year. The Department is approving of her appointment, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month.

Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, August 15th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a return for the quarter ended June 30th, last, for the Whitecap Sioux Indian Day School, which was taught by Mrs. A. L. Fakeley.\n\nThe school was only open for twelve (12) days during the quarter owing to the fact that the teacher was absent through illness from April 20th to May 24th, while, on May 28th, the school was closed by order of the medical officer owing to an outbreak of whooping cough.\n\nIn view of the fact that the school was only open for twelve (12) days during the quarter, the Department is doubtful as to what amount should be allowed as salary. You are aware of what the Missionary Society has allowed Mrs. Fakeley and I would appreciate your advising me what amount you consider would be fair for us to pay in order to reimburse you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.
