Maveety.\n\nNotice\n\nThe Annual Meeting of the Large Assembly will be held in the Council Chamber on Thursday, November 16th.\n\nFor the purpose of hearing the Annual Report, the Election of Officers for 1889 and any other business connected or relating to the interests of the society.\n\nJohn H. Howard,\nSec., Treas., L.A.S.\n\nLegislative Assembly\n\nThe speech of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor at the opening of the first session of the Territorial Legislature has come to hand, and we are pleased to notice that he touched upon nearly all matters requiring the attention of the law-makers. In fact it cannot be said that His Honor has neglected to bring to the notice of the Assembly anything of public interest. The speech contains, among other things, a reference to the revision and codification of the Ordinances of the North West Council which has been made by His Lordship Judge Richardson and Mr. Justice Macdonald, and names as revised will be submitted to the Assembly for their approval, and will as a matter of course be passed. A revision of the Ordinances has long been felt to be a necessity, and if it is not done now, it does nothing more than they will have accomplished a good work. Attention is also called to the question of prairie fires, and His Honor very properly points out that the existing laws in reference thereto are defective and unsatisfactory and that new legislation is necessary; in this we entirely agree with His Honor and we trust that the law will be very wisely framed. One of the features of the Speech is the reference made to the necessity for an act respecting vital statistics; such an act has long been felt to be a public necessity, and we are sure that any legislation in this direction would meet with most cordial approval. His Honor makes a lengthened reference to the success of the agricultural operations throughout the Territories during the past summer, and speaks most encouragingly of the capacity of the soil of the country. The liquor question is also referred to, and the Assembly invited to consider the matter. As there is no subject at the present time more important than this, we express the hope that the deliberations of the Assembly will tend to a solution of the difficulties which have hitherto existed in regard to the matter. The Assembly cannot legislate on the liquor question, but it can make recommendations to the Imperial Parliament which would most likely be accepted and acted upon by them. It therefore behoves our legislators to act in the most careful manner until this question comes before them, and we trust that whatever is done will be to the advantage of our country and the cause of temperance. We congratulate His Honor on the able and satisfactory manner in which he has managed the affairs of the North-West. It is evident that he has a complete knowledge of the country and its requirements, and evinces a desire to do only what must be for the public welfare. He has been only a few months in office, but so far his administration has been eminently satisfactory to all classes and parties, and he has shown his intention of making reforms where they were required.\n\nRemoval\n\nR.
