The Council is growing.\n\nTENDERS.\n\nSTORMS SOUTH AND EAST.\n\nChicago, April 6.\u2014A heavy snowstorm, accompanied by high winds, has resulted in practically nothing being accomplished in connection between the west and New York. The storm center is near Buffalo and extends into Canada, and south, covering Chicago, Indianapolis, Detroit, Cincinnati, and even south of the Ohio river. Why the Sun does not reach us complete to New York, up to ten o'clock this morning the telegraph officials have taken their discharge, and left for the east on Tuesday night. They were met by the three men of Mr. E. F. Miller's party, who came in charge of Capt. Peters. A large number of \"I.\" Battery and the artillerymen immediately proceeded to formally send them off with cheers.\n\n\u2014Gunner Wm. Adams, of I. Battery, has presented the editor of THE PROGRESS with a beautiful piece of work. It comprises a wreath surrounding a piece of steel, which is fixed on each side of a bird in each corner of the sheet. The word \"Ulpiope\" is inscribed at the bottom in a neat hand. Altogether it is a fine piece of work.\n\n\u2014Last Saturday a considerable number of people visited THE PROGRESS (Qu'Appelle) by the April Monthly Fair for the sale of all kinds of farm stock. The next fair will be held at the National Hall, May 1st. The Man Fair promises to be a big success, as it will have a good indigenous attendance. We shall also offer prizes for the exhibition of stock, in addition to the opportunity there will be for the sale of goods.\n\n\u2014Registered at the London house, Mr. Campbell, Stoneville; Mr. Lindblom, Touchwood Hills; J.

We hope they take steps in that direction. Meanwhile the settlers at McLean station are desirous of organizing a school and propose to include a part of that township in their district. We hope that the settlers at McLean will be able to carry out their plans.
