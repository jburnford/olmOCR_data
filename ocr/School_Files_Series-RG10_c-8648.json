In the month of April there is a great deal of work to be done that the boys cannot be very tidy in their clothing in doing, being a time for a general cleaning up. We calculate during that month to wear the clothing that has been worn all winter, rather than store it up for future use. If there is a month in the year in which the boys appear untidy, that month is April. I may say that, since Mr. Jackson was here, the boys in the school at that time have received a new suit of clothes, which is used during the summer for Sunday wear, and the suits, that the boys have been wearing during the past months for Sunday, is taken for every day wear. We postpone this as late in the Spring as possible for two reasons, one being that we wish to get all we can out of the old clothes, and another is, it is a hard time of the year on clothing. In justice to the general appearance of the boys, no boy was shabby. At the same time, the clothing in the aggregate was far below the average. I do not make this defence in opposition in any spirit of resentment to Mr. Jackson's criticism. He had reasons for the ground of his criticism. The method has another effect upon the boys. It teaches them to wear their clothing as long as possible.\n\nAs to the girls milking the cows, there are plenty of cows, but the boys have always done the milking, inasmuch as we have not had a lady member of the staff supervise the work of milking. It is quite possible for the girls to do the milking, and with our improved dairy barn, it is more feasible and easier arranged for than it has been in previous years.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.F./M.C.E.\nOttawa, June 11, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, and in reply I beg to say that your explanation with regard to the boys' clothing is quite satisfactory to the Department.\n\nWith reference to the inspector's recommendation that the girls be taught milking, I beg to say that, while the Department does not expect the girls to do all the milking, still, it is thought that every effort should be made to allow them to do some milking and thus acquire a knowledge which would be of much use to them in after life.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nFor some years we have been trying to get into sufficient stock for a farm of our dimensions. This we have about accomplished, having about one hundred head of horned cattle, thirty head of horses, fifty small pigs with nearly twenty brood sows. I wrote you about sending some of them to Fishing Lake for the winter but afterward concluded that this was not wise. I have had the teams hauling straw from the farmers around to a distance of six miles, wherever we could get a stack. I think we will be able to secure sufficient straw in this way. It is costing me considerably, anywhere from fifty cents to three dollars a load, depending on the distance and the quality of the straw. Over and above this, I have had to purchase in the neighborhood of twenty-five hundred dollar's worth of grain, screenings and shorts and bran. I think this is a much better policy than to send our stock out to have them in a half starved condition in the spring. Our failure of crop and shortage of feed was due entirely to the light fall of rain. The average for twenty-eight years at the Experimental Farm was ten inches including last year. The rainfall last year was a little less than four inches; we are expecting better crops and therefore have not too much stock on the farm. Another reason why I think we should keep our stock up particularly the hogs and cattle, is that great need of food production at the present time and no doubt for the next few years. We are anxious to anything in our power in increased production.\n\nMy object in writing you and giving you this information is to let you know that it is impossible to meet these extra expenses to say nothing of the increased cost of management without some special assistance.\n\nWould it be possible for the Department to make a special grant for the purpose of assisting in food production and helping us out financially this year? If this is not possible would it be feasible to give us a loan of two or three thousand dollars without interest until we can see our way towards paying it back? Your consideration to this matter and any advice or suggestions will be gladly received.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nINDUSTRIAL SCHOOL BRANDON\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6255, File 576-1, part 1)\nMr. Scott,\n\nIn regard to Mr. Ferrier's request for financial assistance I think we might make him a loan of $2,000.00 or $3,000.00 upon the understanding that it is to be repaid without interest next year if there is an average crop and from stock raised. We should be able to finance this.\n\nAccountant.\n\nOttawa, January 17th., 1918.\nJanuary 25th, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI have received your note of January 15th, and would like to assist you in some way. If the loan is given, how would you propose to repay it? We usually have some understanding on that point, and the repayments are usually made from the per capita grant. It would be too vague to loan it on the understanding that you would pay it back when you could see your way towards that end. Kindly let me hear from you at once, and I will give the matter further consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T.

C. Norris, Premier of Manitoba, could not go among the farms of Manitoba without catching the enthusiasm of the agriculturist and do a little farming here on their own account. The Duke and the Premier have left this morning for Regina, but before leaving, the former visited the Experimental Station, where a job waiting for him at Donald McEwen's farm inter alia. \"I do like working the binder,\" said Premier Norris, but Mr. McEwen failed to take the hint and the Premier will have to look elsewhere for a position. Neither of the distinguished men were on the field for two minutes before they asked to see the machine. The idea of working the mechanical contrivance that does the work of cutting, binding, and stocking grain at one and the same time. Neither had ever seen the machine before, and it spoke volumes for the simplicity of the mechanism when it is stated that the novices carried out the experiment with unqualified success.\n\nSir James Aikins was not with the party on its arrival from Ninette. It appears that the Lieut.-Governor, with his private secretary, Mr. Coleman, had left earlier in the day for Winnipeg.\n\nReturning from Ninette the ducal party were met at the C. P. R. station at 4.30 p.m. by Messrs. Cater, S. E. Clement, M.P.P., Kenneth Campbell, H. J. Pugh and Ald. M. McKenzie. Taking automobiles, they were driven direct to the farm of Mr. Donald McEwen, where they inspected the mechanical stooker, after which they drove to the Experimental and Indian Industrial School farms, and returned to the city at seven o'clock. After staying overnight at the Prince Edward Hotel, the vice-regal party left for Regina this morning.\n\nAt the McEwen Farm\n\nMr. and Mrs. Donald McEwen received their visitors in cordial fashion and were evidently delighted at the opportunity of entertaining the representative of His Majesty the King at their prairie homestead. The visit had been anticipated with the greater interest because it was known that there were two machine stookers at work on the farm.\n\nThe machine turned out to be an ordinary binder with a parachainette to do the stocking attached thereto. The very simplicity of the thing is the surprising part of the mechanism which is certainly not more complicated than the work of the ordinary binder. The binder merely repeats its work. When the sheave is completed, rather than being thrown on the field.\n\n(Continued on Page 3, Column 1)\n\nPUBLIC MEETING TO PONDER PROBLEM HELP FOR FARMERS\n\nBusiness Men, Farmers, Stookers to Gather in City Hall at 4 p.m. Sunday\n\nThe very serious situation that is facing the crops unless prompt action is taken, has resulted in a public meeting being called for...\nDuke of Devonshire\n\n(Continued from Page 1)\n\nit drops into a crate that trails along at the side of the machine. When the crate is loaded, the sheaves are bound together with string, lifted up, and the whole chopped.\n\nThe machine driven by Mr. James Anderson, son-in-law of Mr. and Mrs. McEwen, had not gone half the round of the field before the Duke expressed his intention of handling the ribbons. Mr. Anderson gave his seat on the binder up to His Excellency, while Premier Norris took charge of the other machine. Both managed their four and five horses respectively as to the manner born and delighted everybody present by their demonstration of the latest labor-saving device to put in an appearance on a Manitoba farm.\n\n\"It is a wonderful invention,\" said the Duke.\n\n\"If I only had a couple of days with this, I bet I could make it do some work,\" said the Premier.\n\nAt Experimental Farm\n\nThen came the drive to the Experimental Farm. Here the party were received by Superintendent McKillan who, with Mr. Campbell, imparted some very interesting information respecting the work of the institution. Another pleasant surprise that awaited the Duke was the threshing machine in operation. They were taken the rounds of the cattle sheds, and here it was that the Duke and Premier showed that they were farmers born and bred.\n\n\"She is a good cow,\" said the Prime Minister of Manitoba. The Duke acquiesced.\n\n\"She should be a little fuller here,\" said His Excellency the Duke of Devonshire, touching a domesticated looking animal on the back with a stick. The Premier signified approval.\n\nThe sight of milking by machinery did not seem unusual to the seasoned and distinguished agriculturists, but attracted considerable attention among the more city-bred crowd. A Short-horn bull that was calved from a cow brought from Lord Rothchild's farm in England, was examined with interest by both the Duke and Mr. Norris. The party, having made a round of the horses, were taken to the gardens where the possibilities of Manitoba soil were shown at their best.\n\nIndian Industrial School\n\nLeaving the Experimental Farm, the next stopping place was the Indian Industrial School Farm. The visitors were received by the Rev. T. Ferrier and conducted through the various buildings and given the opportunity of seeing the Indian boys and lasses at their respective tasks. Everybody was surprised at the showing made at the farm. The crops were in splendid shape and the beautifully situated and irrigated grounds made them appear delightful places for rendezvous. Mr. Ferrier had collected an exhibit of the products of the garden, and a splendid collection it was. A dish of strawberries was equal in flavor and size to the fruit grown in summer climes at B.C. and elsewhere.\n\nThe Hon. Dr. Thornton was particularly interested in the evidence of industry on the part of the pupils. The Duke asked the teachers if they found the children apt pupils, and on receiving a reply in the affirmative addressed a few questions to the children themselves, and was particularly gratified with their bright appearance and ready replies.\n\nA large class of little Indian girls were drawn up outside the building to sing for the benefit of His Excellency. They sang sweetly the strains of the National Anthem.\n\nThe Duke, addressing the little girls, thanked them very much. \"I am very pleased to know,\" he said, \"that many of the boys from this school have gone overseas to fight for their King and country and for the great cause which is of so much interest to all of us. I know that you will live to be worthy of those brave lads, and to become useful citizens of Canada. I do wish you all success and happiness in your lives. I thank you very much.\"\n\nA hearty clapping of hands on the part of the children and visitors alike greeted the words of His Excellency.\nMonday\u2014Labor Day\u2014is the beginning of Fall\u2014and every day now means an extra day's wear that your suit will give you this season\u2014if you are going to have one at all.\n\nSuit weather has been with us for some time, but the real suit season is just about to open.\n\nYou know right well that Fall suit the better are the earlier you order a your chances for quick delivery\u2014and the bitter you appreciate it.\n\nWe are getting busier every day on ladies' suits, but we can still complete an order within reasonable time.\n\nPARSON & CO.\nTailors to Ladies and Gentlemen\n1037 Rosser Ave.\n\nSome Service Features\nUp to the minute storage battery service\u2014Expert mechanics\u2014Big assorted stock of tires\u2014Free air\u2014Gasoline from a Bowser pump\u2014Storage space\u2014and a willingness to go to the end of the world to pull you out of a hole.\n\nSome Specials in Stock\nHasler Shock Absorbers for Ford Cars\u2014Canvas Seat Coverings\u2014Self Starters\u2014Fordson Tractors\u20141 Ton Trucks\u2014All models Ford Cars\u2014Bumpers for Ford Cars\u2014Speedometers, etc.\n\nTell us your car troubles.\n\nMcGregor Motor Co.\nLimited\n\nIndian Affairs.

We had an exhibit of farm and garden products placed on the tables in the dining-room. Our roots and vegetables this year are very fine. He inspected the work in our kitchen, laundry and sewing-room. When he was through in the main building he took notice that we had our stock herded on the hill-side and in the valley, the milk cows in one and the young stock in the other. He walked through both herds and asked me about the calves which were in the stable. He said he would like to see them. After seeing these he wished to see the new barn. We have it all nicely completed inside, so we showed him through. He then returned to the main building and heard the girls sing. After this he expressed a desire to drive down through the corn and potatoes. He asked me many questions regarding the work and stated that he was very much pleased with the work we were carrying on in the education of Indian boys and girls.\n\nI am enclosing you the write-up that appeared in the Brandon Sun believing that this will be of interest to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\n\nTF/GF\nSeptember 9th, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier -\n\nI have your letter of the 4th inst., advising me of the visit of His Excellency the Governor-General to the Brandon School, on Friday, August 30th, and enclosing the report thereof from the \"Brandon Sun.\"\n\nI am pleased to learn of this visit and of the interest shown in the institution by His Excellency.

T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nMy object in writing to you is to bring before you the question of pupils for the Brandon Institute.\n\nAll the Indian people on the prairies of Manitoba are ministered to from a missionary point of view by the Anglican and Presbyterian churches. The nearest Methodist Reserve is Fisher River.\n\nUntil we built the new school at Norway House we secured a large number of pupils from the north end of Lake Winnipeg. About the same year the Elkhorn school was closed and during the past eight years we have always had a sufficient number of pupils brought voluntarily to keep up the attendance. During the past summer and fall the new principal of the Elkhorn school has been recruiting for that institution. Consequently very few new pupils have been brought to Brandon this year.\n\nWhen we closed the Red Deer school some twenty-two pupils were transferred here with the understanding that they were to be returned when the building was completed at Edmonton. We are preparing to take these pupils back next week. There are also about a dozen of the pupils who should receive their discharge in the near future. This will leave us about seventy-five or eighty pupils with little hope of increasing the number during the year. Denominational courtesy is sufficient reason why we should not recruit on those reserves ministered to by other religious denominations. There is no doubt but that when organic union takes place between the Presbyterian and Methodist churches the problem will be solved by reorganization.\n\nAs you are aware, we have accommodation for one hundred and twenty-five pupils. Before the closing of the Elkhorn school, I discussed with you the possibility of taking some pupils from Ontario to our Institute. If this can be done and say forty or fifty brought in, it would be the solution of the problem until union takes place.\n\nI would appreciate very much your favorable consideration of this proposition.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, F.R.S.C., Litt. D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, December 12, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to the recruiting for the Brandon Industrial School. I have been much concerned because of the situation that has arisen and I have given much thought to the possible sources of recruits.\n\nI am pleased to note that union of the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches will solve the problem in future years and I am disposed to make a special effort at this time to assist you. My suggestion is that you arrange to have a representative of the Brandon school visit the Protestant reserves from Sarnia to Hud Lake with a view to enrolling the physically fit orphan and destitute children. The Rev. Mr. McFitty can put you in touch with many applicants for admission to the Mt. Elgin Institute. As you are aware, that institution is filled to the limit of its accommodation.\n\nThe Department will give you every help, by corresponding with the agents, and will assist in gathering up any children who are orphans and without legal guardians. Destitute children present a more delicate problem, as the full concurrence of the parents would have to be secured. The expenses of your officer cannot, of course, be met by Parliamentary Appropriation. However, if success attends the effort, the Department would be responsible for the transportation of the children themselves to Brandon.\n\nIf this course of action recommends itself to you, your recruiting agent should first visit the Department and receive advice and instruction. Following his tour of the reserves, he should report again to Ottawa and we could then arrange for concerted action on the part of our representatives in the agencies. Children could be gathered at some central point and a special car, if the number warranted such accommodation, could be secured from one of the transportation companies.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Ferrier,\nIndustrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI hereby certify that the balance at credit of your \"Principal Account\" as shown in our Ledger at Eleven A.M. this date is $192.74.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. A. Wetmore,\nManager.\n\nJAW.B\nRegina Sask.\nSeptember 29th 1925\n\nW.M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, I went down to Brandon on the 3rd inst. to inspect the books of the Brandon Residential School. I found only one book in use in the institution. This book is called, Receipts and Expenditures of Cash. The left hand side of this book's pages shows the receipts of cash. The right side of the folio detailed the expenditures, columned under various headings. There was neither Invoice book, Journal, nor ledger in use. These latter books I feel are needed in this school, together with another Cash Book, that a proper record of the business of the school be kept. I would strongly advise doing away with the one book now in use, and adopting the books above mentioned in its stead. This one book is not adequate to record the business of an institution of the magnitude of the Brandon Residential School. The Invoice book need not be used, although it is a useful book. Invoices can be filed in such a manner that ready reference can be made to them in the Journal and from the Journal to the ledger. Accounts should be opened in the ledger corresponding with the various headings shown on the book in use at present. Accounts should also be opened with merchants and firms from whom goods are purchased on time, that a proper record of such dealings be placed before an auditor at any time. Although there was an amount of $5,702.94 owing to various firms, there was no record of this in any book, but was taken off.\noff invoices, the information being supplied by Mr. Ferrier. These items should have been shown in a ledger, and not left haphazard on an invoice file.\n\nI went back to January 1st 1922 and checked all the receipts from that date to Sept 4th 1925. I tested the additions, both in the receipts and expenditures, and found them correct. The receipts during the period under inspection amounted to $136,056.64. I compared this with the bank book deposits, and found that the receipts exceeded the deposits by $22,505.21; the deposits being $113,578.43. The difference was explained by Mr. Ferrier thus. An amount of $2000.00 was paid for cattle by the Mission Rooms. It was charged against the school, and was passed through the cash book, notwithstanding no cash was received. Then $500.00 were received for an old gas engine. This was turned over in payment on accounts, and was not deposited in the bank. The balance was made up of the following entries:\n\n| Proceeds of Farm and Garden | $7000.00 |\n|-----------------------------|----------|\n| \"                            | 1924     | $1000.00 |\n| \"                            | 1925     | $6000.00 |\n| Rebates                     | $6.21    |\n|                             |          | $20,005.21 |\n\nThis with the other two items explained above make up the $22,505.21, the difference between receipts and deposits.\n\nThere is no account with the Department of Indian affairs to show the amount of per capita grant received. The amount showing in the statement, $69,094.61 is not an actual amount taken from an account, as it should have been, but was derived at by adding all the monies received from the Mission Board, and deducting what was actually received from the Church. The balance was presumably what had been received from the Department. I will not vouch for the accuracy of the amount. I had to depend on Mr. Ferrier's information for this. To my mind an account with the Department would be one of the most important accounts in the school ledger, if a ledger were kept, as the Department is the source of revenue, and this account...\naccount should be carefully and accurately kept.\n\nThe credits showing to farm and garden were not detailed, but estimated and added in a lump sum at the end of the year. I had no means of checking these amounts and accepted them as they were. These credits should be accurately detailed in future and not estimated.\n\nThe bank account was overdrawn as will be seen from the adjustment statement. It seem customary for the Principal to carry on issuing cheques on the bank even if he has no funds, but his overdrafts are always taken care of when remittances are received.\n\nThe statement shows a deficit of $404.99. Accounts Payable amount to $5,702.94. To offset these amounts the Principal has in the elevator 658 bushels wheat, some rye, and more wheat to thresh. This with the grant from the Department for September quarter will nearly meet the indebtedness.\n\nI attach herewith the following statements.\n\nBank adjustment\nAccounts Payable\nFinancial Statement.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., Oct. 1st, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report, made by Mr. Agent Taylor, of an inspection he made of the books and office at the Brandon Industrial School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

This is to be on Tuesday, November 9th at 2 P.M.\n\nMy object in writing you is to give you an opportunity of being present at the trial so that you will be satisfied that no injustice is meted out to him.

The magistrate is of the opinion that the charge should be for house breaking. This would be a clear case upon which he could commit him. He will send him to the Portage School providing they will accept him. If not, he will send him to Stony Mountain for two years. The date of the trial is to be Tuesday, November 9th at 2 P.M. In the meantime, I am writing to his father and to the Farm Instructor and enclose you copies of these letters.\n\nIf it were only a case of this boy, I would discharge him and send him home, but this is what he would like and it would place a premium on his conduct for other boys who wish to be discharged. The Sergeant of Police was down at Indian Springs for a boy, Joe Kinney, Agent Ogletree sent here. Mr. Minnelly, the Farm Instructor, requests that he not be sent to the reserve. He was a bad actor when there and hence his presence here.\n\nIf the Department has any further advice, kindly wire before Tuesday.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGRD\nThe Officer Commanding\nR.C.M.Police\nWinnipeg,Man.\n\nSir,\n\nRe-Wabie Scott (Indian Boy) - Brandon Man.\nCarnal Knowledge.\n\nI have the honour to submit the following in the above connection.\n\nThe Rev.Ferrier, Principal of the Indian Industrial School at this point called at this Detachment on the afternoon of the 2nd inst and informed me that he had received word from Ottawa in the above connection and they had informed him that whatever action he took would be endorsed by the Department.\n\nI accompanied him to the Police Magistrate, A.C.Fraser, and the matter was discussed at length, resulting in the decision that the boy as he is 18 years of age be charged with House Breaking and sent to the Penitentiary in the event of him being convicted, this it was thought would be better than a common Gaol sentence as he would have something to work at there. He was deemed too old for the reformatory.\n\nI would now ask whether or not I should continue to handle this case on this boy in a Ward of the Government or whether I should turn it over to the Provincial Police, needless to say the Principal is desirous of keeping the matter as quiet as possible. I would further ask that if the boy is convicted and I still keep charge of the case should I escort him to the penitentiary.

Mr.Fraser however on having been informed that by the Rev.Ferrier that the boy was registered at 17 years of age at his school decided that he would handle the matter under the Child Welfare Act charging Scott with Breaking and entering the Indian Industrial School on the 6th October, 1926 and being guilty of other improper conduct at such time and place. Mr.Fraser acting in his capacity of Judge of the Juvenile Court read the charge which was in the form of a Complaint made by the Rev.Ferrier, and when offered a plea of Guilty, the situation was explained fully to the prisoner and also to an Uncle of the boy who had come to Brandon for the trial from the Indian Springs Reserve, he having been notified by Mr.Ferrier of the happenings. The Judge committed the accused to the Industrial School at Portage la Prairie for an Indeterminate period not exceeding one year. Warrant of Commitment was handed to me.\n\nCst.Morley of this Force who is stationed here having arrived here on other Police Duties will take this boy to the Reformatory at Portage la Prairie.

He was charged with house breaking, to which he pleaded guilty. On his behalf, I requested that he be tried under the juvenile act as he is seventeen years of age on our report. This made it possible to have him committed to the Portage Industrial School. He was sent there for a year with the understanding that if his behavior was good that he be allowed out on parole.\n\nHis uncle arrived here on his behalf and was given to understand that he could engage legal advice if he so desired and should the charge be made under the criminal code. When he found out what the boy was guilty of and that the management of the school as well as the magistrate were inclined to be as lenient as possible by having the case in the juvenile court, he concluded that legal advice was not required.\n\nI trust that what has been done in this case will meet with the approval of the Department. It is the first time in an experience of twenty-seven years that I have had to take legal action against a boy for crime. When I consider the large number of boys and girls I have taken into this school for crime of one kind and another, the wonder is that I have had so few turn out incorrigible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing-Ass't. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nIt was my intention to have visited Ottawa when Rev. Thompson Ferrier was there recently for the purpose of interviewing the Honorable Charles Stewart and yourself regarding the necessity and desirability of building a new school at Brandon.\n\nThe main building is thirty-four years old and far from modern. It is inadequate to carry on the work and has outlived its usefulness.\n\nIt has served the Lake Winnipeg District for all these years and still retains a large part of this constituency. Over fifty of its present enrolment are from this district. During the last year, the Nelson River Valley has been opened up and sixteen new pupils have been sent in from Nelson House.\n\nA large number have been taken in from the courts, incorrigibles from other schools and orphans from many places, saving many from lives of crime and shame. The whole work has been carried on with a good degree of success, a heritage that should not be lost.\n\nThe Department owns the farm of over 900 acres of land which, with the outbuildings, is valued at $200,000.00, a property well adapted to carrying on the work of training Indian boys for farming, gardening, and caring for livestock. We are in a position to give advanced training in these occupations to boys from other parts. This should be made a specialty.\n\nPupils from this school have been attending the Brandon Collegiate. Six were in attendance last year. Others would have been there this year if arrangements could have been made to send them. To meet their need a class of grade nine pupils is being taught in the Institute, four of these are from other schools. This work might be enlarged if there was sufficient accommodation in the present building.\n\nThe location of this school is strategically situated for visitors. Every year they come from all parts of Canada, as well as from other lands. The usual comment is that our main building is not in keeping with the beautiful farm, lawns, gardens and outbuildings.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., Litt.D., F.R.S.C.\n\nI believe you have recently visited the school and are fully convinced that the time has come when a new building should be erected. I trust that the next Parliament will make provision for putting up the proposed new school.\n\nWishing you the Compliments of the Season,\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGEMr. AMA\nDecember 21st, 1927.\n\nDear Dr. Manning:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the advisability of replacing the main building at the Brandon Indian Residential School.

In the case of ordinary Non-Residents, the Department pays $50.00 a year and the Municipalities pay the balance. In your case, the Board would waive this balance.\n\nThere are, as you say, nine pupils in attendance this year, and two others attended last year, which would make a total bill for the two years of $550.00.\n\nHoping that you will be able to make arrangements for this, I am\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFAW-DR\nSecretary-Treasurer\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed find voucher No. 38 and No. 39.\n\nNo. 38 is in favor of the Brandon School Board for $550, fees for two pupils attending Collegiate during 1927-28 and nine pupils for the present school year.

Brendon School Board,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of Jan. 9th, I might state that no allowance can be made in the non-resident grant for the pupils from the Indian Industrial school, nor for Mary Parker nor Roy Patterson.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) J. E. Millard,\nAccountant.\nNovember 16, 1928\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal Indian School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI have just received the copy of letter from the Department of Indian Affairs re fees for non-resident students at our Collegiate, and am giving the following additional information regarding the amount for $550.00, which was rendered to you some time ago.\n\nThe total cost of education in our secondary school last year was $97.02 per pupil. Part of this cost we are not allowed to charge for, such as taxes, interest on investment, and proportion of overhead expense, and when these are deducted it leaves a cost of $73.52 per pupil. When the Government grant is deducted from this amount, it leaves $64.60 per pupil. It is this latter amount which we are allowed to charge non-resident pupils from surrounding municipalities.\n\nThe Department of Education pays $50.00 of this amount, but only when the student comes from an organized municipality in the Province of Manitoba. These Indians come, I presume, from reserves, which do not pay the Municipal Commissioner's Levy, and consequently do not contribute to the funds from which this $50.00 is paid. Probably some of them come from outside the province, and if so, the Department in such cases assumes no responsibility for their fees. It is just a case of the Department spreading the $50.00 amount over all municipalities paying the levy, and then asking each municipality individually to pay the balance chargeable to the students from its own municipality.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter from the Department, in which they disclaim responsibility for the fees for these students. In this letter, the last two names; namely, Mary Parker and Roy Patterson, are from outside the Province.\nNow, in cases where there is no outside body to assume the fees, we charge the students direct, under section 134 (g) of the Public Schools Act, which allows only $5.00 per month. This explains the reason why the rate was placed at $5.00 a month in your account, although as a matter of fact I think the Department of Indian Affairs should pay $64.60, even although the Act is not very clear on the point.\n\nWhen we charge the student direct, the amount is $5.00 a month, but when the municipality or department is responsible, the amount is $64.60. It seems to me that the Indian Department should come under the latter classification.

The formal ceremonies were presided over by Rev. J. A. Doyle, D.D., the present head of the school, while brief addresses were given by Dr. J. W. Atkins, president of the Manitoba conference, Dr. J. H. Edmiston, M.L.A., and Mayor Cater.\n\nThe actual laying of the corner stone was performed by the Rev. Thompson Ferrier, former principal and superintendent of Indian schools and hospitals for the United Church. Assisting in the program were the Rev. J. A. Cormie, M.D., president of missions for the Manitoba conference, Rev. R. G. Pritchard, W. H. Shillinglaw, and the Rev. D. H. Telfer, chairman of the Brandon conference. On the platform at the time were Mrs. T. Ferrier, members of the presidency and a number of ex-pupils.\n\nDuring the ceremony, a splendid tribute was paid to the Rev. Thompson Ferrier for the great work accomplished by him during his long term of office, and confidence was expressed in the future of the training that will be conducted in the new building under the principalship of Dr. Doyle.\n\nHistory of School\n\nThe historical sketch of the school placed in the corner stone by Rev. J. A. Doyle shows that it is part of the insistance in the policy of the Department of Indian Affairs in providing an educational and vocational training for Indian children in Canada. This educational program is carried out in cooperation with churches which years ago commenced missionary and educational work among the Indian people.\n\nThirty-seven years ago it was decided to establish a residential school under the care of the Methodist church, and the choice of the site here was made by the late Rev. James Woodsworth and the late Rev. Alex. Sutherland, D.D. It was three years later that the school, which has just been finished to make room for the new building, was erected, and a veteran missionary, Rev. J. Simmons, appointed principal. He was a master of the Cree language and had years of experience in Indian work. Four years later he retired and thirty years ago last June, Rev. Thompson Ferrier, then pastor of the Methodist church in Edmonton, and who laid the corner stone Wednesday, was appointed head of the institution.\n\nSplendid progress in connection with the school and its 960 acre farm has been made, and high tribute to the business sagacity, tact and diplomacy was paid to the Rev. Thompson Ferrier for bringing the Brandon school to such a high standard. In February last, Rev. Ferrier tendered his resignation, and later the Rev. Dr. Doyle was appointed in his place.\n\nMore commodious quarters were needed and the present new structure will remedy deficiencies. During construction the pupils had to be taken care of, a number returned home where they could attend school for the present year, and 35 were taken on to the Edmonton school. It is expected that the new building will be ready for occupation in September, 1930. It will take about 150 pupils and when a number of other residential schools are filled to capacity and have waiting lists, it is expected that the new building will soon occupy in a very short time. The number of Indian pupils seeking higher education makes it necessary that high school work be undertaken as soon as school re-opens.\nCORNER STONE OF NEW INDIAN SCHOOL LAID\n\nCeremony Attended by Representative Gathering; Historical Sketch of School\n\nThirty-four years after the original building was constructed, the cornerstone of the new Indian Industrial school was laid on Wednesday afternoon before a very representative gathering.

Eliza Sutherland who wrote on grade ten last year, and who has been employed with Mrs. Hughes of this city since the school closed, is very anxious to take a Business Course, and has spoken to me a number of times about it. I had her doing some Office work before she left the school, and I believe she is quite capable of taking the course, and being very efficient in some lines especially. She wants to return to the school when it opens, and attend Business College from there. After watching her carefully since last mid-summer, I am quite decided that it would be wise to give her this chance. She is saving some money, and I think her father might be persuaded to pay at least part of the fee required at the Business College.\n\nThere is another girl about whom I believe you have had correspondence with Mr. Roy Hunter of the Juvenile Court, Dorothy Frances by name, who says she wants to take a Business course also. I have been taking an interest in this girl since her case was brought to my attention by Mr. Hunter, and the present indications are that she is by no means a bad girl, and has a good chance of making good. She is now in Mr. L. C. Ferrier's home, and is doing well. She wrote on her grade eight last summer, and wants to take grade nine and ten before taking a Business course. I would be glad to have your advice in this matter also.\n\nI am,\n\nyours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. A. Doyle, superintendent. Construction work has been carried forward all winter with the result that only some minor details remain to be done. It is not likely that any of the school pupils will arrive here until July 15th, but it is anticipated that the authorities will let them finish out their school year at their present place. The new school, now in charge of about 160 pupils, the building being raised as the best in the west.\n\nThe formal opening of the building will be witnessed by more than 200 guests in the city on that day. The New Orleans Southern Railroad, has arranged a special excursion train to travel through the district and it is being provided in the itinerary that a stop will be made at Brandon for the occasion. This special train will arrive at ten o'clock in the morning of July 18th, and the visitors will be taken on an inspection tour of the city and district until noon when they will arrive at the Indian school. There they will be met by members of the board of trade and members of the church organization assisting in the exercises. It is expected that several prominent speakers will be along with the special train, and will have a place on the opening ceremonies that day.\nIndian Residential School\n\nR. A.

Sutherland, of the General Board of Missions of the Methodist Church, pressed for the establishment of an industrial school for the benefit of children of Lake Winnipeg Indians. The Department's policy at that time was to establish institutions in white centres and to emphasize vocational training of pupils.\n\nIn 1889, the Department approved of the scheme and the question of a suitable site was given consideration. Various localities were suggested - Fisher River, Berens River and Selkirk. Dr. Sutherland, the Rev. John McDougall and Dr. J. Woodsworth were in favour of a site in the southern part of the province. They were not satisfied, however, with the property near Carman, which was set aside by Order in Council for the school.\n\nPeople of both Brandon and Carberry became interested and John Kerr, Clerk of the City of Brandon, wrote Rev. Mr. Woodsworth, of the Methodist Church, that the City Council would give a site next to the Experimental Farm and accept in exchange government lands elsewhere. Dr. Sutherland visited the West in 1891, examined the sites and recommended that the one at Brandon be secured. The City of Brandon purchased from J. W. Stewart the half section on which the school is situate. The price was $5,700. Mr. A. Kelly, Mayor of Brandon, wrote to the Department in 1891, accepting the section near Carman in trade for the site at Brandon. The site was occupied and the building operations commenced in 1892. In 1900, the deal was finally completed and regularized by Order in Council.\n\nIn 1911, the section on the hill was purchased for the use of the school for the sum of $16,000. In 1920, the City of Brandon completed a 99 year lease of the most southerly part of the school property for $6,000. 52 acres was required for municipal park purposes.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev.

The new structure is one of the finest of its kind in Canada, and those present at the opening of the building today were members of the church who had been called over in Brandon for the occasion.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D., principal of the school, spoke briefly about the aims of the institution and to the work it is doing. Hon. T. A. Cressy, minister of Indian Affairs, made a brief but made mention of the partly of the country. Russell T. Ferrier, education for Canada, spoke of the place education plays in the work of the department, and that experience indicated that residential schools are needed. Rev. J. H. Smith, of Regina, was present and, after re- diction of the students, he officially handed over the key of the building to the Rev. D. B. S. general secretary of the board of mission affairs of the United Church of Canada.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle mentioned the valued services of Mr. Ferrier and congratulated him on his superintendence administration of the school. The dedication service was in the hands of G. W. Macdonald, minister of the United Church, Dr. Cochran, president of the church, and D.D., president of the Manitoba con- gregation, spoke. Addresses were also given from Rev. Thompson, Ferrier, Rev. W. H. Whitehead, Rev. G. R. Cox and others.\nProgramme of Official Opening, July 18th, 1930, at 2 p.m.\n\nSelection by Band.\n\nHymn: \"All People That on Earth Do Dwell\"\n\nScripture Reading: Rev.

In addition there were 150 special guests who were touring the west on the New Outlook excursion. Quite a large number of Brandon citizens availed themselves of the opportunity not only of attending the official opening but of inspecting this new building as well. The school is probably the finest of its kind in Canada and was favorably commented on by hundreds who went through it on Friday.\n\nThe program began early in the auditorium of the building with the Salvation Army band in attendance to furnish the music throughout the program. Rev. J. A. Doyle D.D., principal of the school, presided, while groups of about 200 performers were leading officials of the United Church and of the Indian department. In his introductory charge, Rev. Doyle emphasized the work that the school is doing, of its objective to send students back to their homes with Christian influence in the community, and of all the efforts being made by the school to make its program successfully.\n\nNeed of Schools\n\nHon. T. A. Crevar was present and in a brief address he said it gave him great satisfaction that the long-recognized need was finally coming to the Indians. Russell T. Perrier, M.A., superintendent of education, said that protection and education are two of the primary duties of the department he represented, and he told of the efforts made in times of education. Experience had taught them that residential schools are very necessary in planning the future life of the Indians, and he told of the steps that had been taken up to the erection of the new school.\n\nReferring to the fact that it is quite necessary to turn the Indians to agriculture, Commissioner Graham of Regina gave figures to show that the number of Indians who now own thousands of acres of land under cultivation each year. As a sign of the times, he then handed the key of the building over to Rev. R. B. Codrane D.D., representing the United Church in Canada. The latter in his remarks paid special tribute to the sterling work of the Rev. Thomas Miller, who informed him that he was interested actively in Indian affairs, to the general work of the Board of Education in the question of schools, and congratulated Dr. Doyle on his administration.\n\nThe address of welcome was ably handled by G. W. Mason K.C., of Toronto, representing the moderator of the United Church in Canada, and the Rev. J. George Miller F.R.G.S., D.D., president of the Manitoba conference, greeted the audience from the platform from Rev. S. Wikens B.A., D.D., representing the Bishop of Brandon, who had been elected moderator of the synod of Manitoba of the Presbyterian church, but received from Rev. Thomas Miller, who was also representative of the Catholic church.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6255, File 576-1, part 2)\nGreat advancement has been made in Canada, particularly of late years, in providing our Indian population with a high standard of educational and vocational training. Through the aid of increased appropriations and personnel during that time, the Department of Indian Affairs has been enabled to enlarge existing buildings and construct new model rural and progressive schools, whilst higher salaries and grants have attracted better qualified teachers and instructors.\n\nThere are now 78 residential schools and 272 day schools, making a total of 350 centres of Indian education and activity. The total number of pupils is now 15,743, the average attendance being 11,579, constituting an increase during the past ten years of 25 per cent in enrolment and 6 per cent in attendance, ample evidence of the success of the work in preparing Indian children to become self-supporting citizens of the Dominion.\n\nThe residential schools are conducted by the Anglican Church, the Catholic, Presbyterian, and United churches, and high tribute must be paid to the zeal and self-sacrifice of those engaged in the work. The present administration, the close co-operation of religious denominations in the education of the Indians, and this well-meaning policy has demonstrated beyond all question the effectiveness of the system.\n\nThe formal opening of the modern residential school at Brandon, Manitoba, on July 18, 1930, adds another unit to the fine system of Indian educational institutions throughout the Dominion. It will be administered by the United Church of Canada and will have as its principal the Reverend A. A. Doyt. Dr. Duncan C. Scott, the modern educationist, the Reverend Thompson Ferrier.\n\nThis school, which replaces the residential school built on the same site in 1894, is one of the finest of its kind in Canada. Built of tapestry brick with trim of Manitoba limestone and a razzoo floor, it is fireproof throughout. Some idea of the accommodation afforded may be gleaned from the fact that it has five large dormitories, four dormitories, four class-rooms, a large study room, recreation rooms for both girls and boys, separate bath-room, hospital equipped with nurses' quarters, also a laundry equipped with the most modern hygienic appliances.\n\nAdjacent to the school are a number of first-class farm buildings, one of which, the cow-barn, is one of the finest in Manitoba. There are, also, four residences for the use of the principal and married members of the staff.\n\nThe institution has a landscaped setting, and places it on a par with some of the finest schools and colleges of the older provinces. Brandon is situated on the north slope of the Assiniboine valley. The Indian school is on the north side of the valley, three miles northwest of the city and is between the Golf Club and the Dominion Experimental Farm. To the east, on the same ridge, is a large provincial hospital.\n\nThis school draws its pupils from widely ranging, owing to the scarcity of local resources. Residential schools are required because many of the Indians are engaged in occupations which prevent them from attending day schools, such as hunting, trapping, which take them away from their homes; and even the farms of those engaged in agriculture are not solidly built near white settlements, but are strung out along rivers and lakes, thus making it impossible to provide day-school accommodation for the greater portion of the pupils.\n\nThe curriculum provides academic instruction equivalent to the second year of secondary school. In addition, the girls are given a thorough training in domestic science, and the boys, a course of study together with a preliminary training in carpentry, blacksmithing, and the operation of internal combustion engines, sufficient to enable them to acquire a practical mastery in modern farm life.\n\nWhile every possible effort is made to secure a sound moral and mental education, special attention is given to the health of the pupils. During the years spent in the residential schools, medical treatment is provided, which, with a balanced diet, and supervised recreation, assists in the building up of a robust constitution.\n\nUnder the care and tutelage of the Department of Indian Affairs the prairie Indian has now become a successful agriculturist. The official records for 1928 show that 65,104 acres in the Prairie Provinces alone, were sown to grain from seed of the approved seed-breeders. In addition, 971 acres were planted to root crops from which 61,448 bushels were harvested; and 97,706 tons of hay and other fodder were produced.\nOttawa, October 21, 1950.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI am enclosing the current number of \"Natural Resources\".

In age they range from four years to over twenty years, and in school classes from little tots in a Kindergarten class to young men and women taking High School grades nine, ten and eleven. The Inspector of Schools has given us a splendid report. One student is going to Brandon Collegiate, taking Grade Twelve. Another attends the Business College in Brandon and still another the Normal School. We are anxious to give every pupil the best possible education and at the same time train them in every way to become happy, successful and useful citizens when they go out to take their place in life.\n\nEvery girl in the School is getting a good training in Household Science, and every boy is trained in Farming, Gardening, Stockraising, the use and care of Tools and Machinery. Each year a number of our older boys attend the Tractor School put on by the International Harvester Company. When our boys graduate they are in good demand for farm help.\n\nFuture Prospects\n\nThis School accommodates 160 pupils. We now have 150 on the roll and every month new names are being added. Our capacity will be reached by mid-summer. Eight or ten, we expect, will graduate this summer and will make room for that many new pupils. We, therefore, wish to urge that those planning to send pupils have the Application for Admission filled out by the Agent as early as possible and sent to Ottawa for approval.\n\nAs we have two University Graduates on our Teaching Staff, both of whom are splendid teachers, we are in a position to take as many High School students as can come. We would suggest to prospective High School pupils especially, that your Application be sent in with as little delay as possible.\n\nPlease write us for any information you may desire, and we will be glad to have any word from you which you think would help us.\n\nThanking you for your co-operation and help.\n\nI am,\nYours sincerely,\nJ.

Camp for ten days, which is held on a little lake about ten miles south of Belmont and I find that the Department has been making a grant of $100.00 for this purpose and I do not think that any money has been spent that has given a better return in the life and conduct of the pupils than has this money.\n\nThis year we have a number of older girls whom on the advice of the Agent or Missionary we are not allowing home for holidays as well as a number of others would be greatly helped by a Camp of this kind. There are 18 in all and two leaders from our Staff will be required to accompany them. The cost for the camp for the ten days is $7.50, in addition to cost of transportation and some extra expenses. We can use our truck to take them to the camp and bring them back and we will be glad if the Department can see fit to give us $160 which is the actual cost of the Camp.\n\nI might point out that when $100 was granted 12 girls were sent.

T. Perrier for thirty years is making fine progress under the new management. Rev. J. A. Doyle, D.D., and his efficient staff find the new building, which opened at year ago and opened July, 1930, an ideal place for the task. This school, which replaces the residential school built on the same site in 1894, is one of the finest of its kind in Canada. Built of superior brick with trim of Manitoba limestone, and terrazzo floors, it is fireproof throughout. Some idea of the accommodation afforded may be gleaned from the fact that it has a fine assembly hall, four dormitories, four class rooms, two large study rooms, recreation rooms for girls and boys, sewing room, sun room, hospital ward, teachers' quarters, also a laundry equipped with the most modern hygienic appliances.\n\nThis plant, with a good farm and suitable residences for the married members of staff situated on a fine landscape setting north of the city of Brandon, is the property of the Dominion Governments but operated by The United Church of Canada.\n\nThere is accommodation for one hundred and sixty children. During the first year of the new management there are one hundred and fifty-five in attendance. The prospects for next academic year are a school filled to capacity with a waiting list.\n\nIt is a real home for the children, as the spirit and atmosphere of family life are demanded to a high degree. The academic work is excellent, two of the teachers are graduates in Arts, and high school work, including Grade XI, is given. On the other hand the smaller children are well cared for by an expert in kindergarten work.\n\nRecently under the guidance of Miss Dorothy Doyle, able assisted by other members of the staff and Miss G. W. Wood, a special dramatic evening was given in the assembly hall, one evening for the pupils and the staff, the following evening for visitors. The effort was to represent the coming of spring and the crowning of the May Queen. It was one of those occasions which cannot be described in words, but the costumes of the little ones, especially by the pupils, and the graceful action of those who took part was fascinating in the extreme.\n\nThere is a great future for this school as a builder of Canadian manhood and womanhood.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev.

This year they have had to enlarge their premises to accommodate the increased number of students.\n\nThis Course seems to be especially suitable and desirable for a number of our Indian boys. Ever since the School commenced a number of our boys have been looking forward with a hope of taking this Course and this year two of our new Grade IX boys express a very earnest desire to commence on this course as soon as the school opens. These are Robert Bird and Harvey Dreavor, both from the Pine Hills School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a leaflet giving information in regard to the School and am hereby making request for your direction in regard to allowing these boys to attend this school.\n\nTrusting that I may have an early reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

We have been trying our best to secure employment for her as a stenographer but have been unable to locate anything. I was wondering if you had any opening in your Department where she could be used. She still has to complete an examination for speed, otherwise her Course is clear.\n\nIn regard to her I wish to say that she is a very trustworthy and reliable girl. She is very neat and careful in her work and is sensible and can be trusted in every respect.\n\nIf you have no opening in connection with your office, can you give any advice as to where we might find employment for her.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

I would request that you continue your efforts to secure employment for her.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nTo Indian Agents, Missionaries, Teachers, Chiefs and Parents or Guardians of Indian Children\n\nGREETINGS:\n\nWe wish in the first place to thank most sincerely, especially the Agents and Missionaries, who have been so helpful to us during the past year in connection with the pupils which have come to us from your Reserves. We do appreciate your kindly co-operation and we are anxious to have you visit our School and get a first-hand knowledge of the work we are trying to do. In the meantime we are glad to give you as much information as we can concerning your boys and girls under our care.\n\nThe picture of the pupils which we present on the back page of this letter is divided into three groups according to their class room work.\n\nThe Intermediate Class Room Pupils\n\nThe top section of the picture includes the pupils in Grades III-VII. Miss W. E. Steinhauer, the teacher, is a graduate from this School. She attended Brandon Collegiate Institute and Brandon College until she secured her Grade XII, and the year following secured her Normal Diploma in the Brandon Normal School.\n\nThe Senior Grades\n\nThe middle group in the picture includes the members of the staff and all the pupils from Grade VII up. Miss D. E. Werthenbach, B.A., who is an Honour Graduate of Alberta University, is the teacher of this room. Twenty-two pupils are taking Grade IX, two in Grade X, one goes to Brandon Collegiate taking Grade XI, and her work is pronounced \"very satisfactory\" by the Principal of the Collegiate. One attends the Brandon Normal School and will graduate in June as a fully-qualified teacher. Three boys are attending the Brandon Technical School which gives a three-years course in Automobile Mechanics and which should qualify the student in every way to take any position in an up-to-date garage. One girl has just finished a Business Course in the Wheat City Business College in Brandon.\n\nPrimary Grades\n\nThe bottom group includes a kindergarten class and Grades I and II. Miss D. L. Doyle, who is a Scholarship Graduate of Chicago Teachers' College, is the teacher, and Miss Doris Ireton, B.A., a graduate of Brandon College, has been supplying for the last few months.\n\nThe class room work is inspected regularly by Inspector J. Boyd Morrison of the Department of Education for Manitoba, and his reports state very definitely that satisfactory progress is being made in every department of the class room work.\n\nThe Health of the Pupils\n\nWe are watching this phase of our school life very carefully. Our Matron, Mrs. Gertrude Mason, is equipped with that experience and those qualities of mind and heart which enable her to be a real mother to the pupils, and she is quick to observe anything physically wrong with any of them. The Boys' Matron, Miss M. Cranna, has had a partial hospital training, and renders the best of service in caring for any who are sick. A Doctor is called whenever necessary. In addition we now have the services of the Ninette Clinic. These doctors come from time to time and examine most thoroughly all new pupils and any others who may be suspected of developing serious trouble. The X-ray plates show that four out of five of all our pupils have had something trouble before coming to the School. This shows the urgent need of this watchful service.\n\nA wholesome and balanced diet is being followed. The pupils are weighed regularly, and satisfactory gains in weight are recorded. A number of boys gained from twenty to thirty pounds each during the first three months of the school year, and taken altogether the Ninette Clinic found the pupils averaged five per cent overweight for girls and boys of their age and height.\n\nThe other departments of the School's life and training are being carried on satisfactorily. Miss R. Harland, the Girls' Matron, in a very kindly and tactful manner is carefully looking after the welfare of the girls. She is also stenographer and office assistant.\nThe Sewing Room\n\nThis department is under the efficient management of Miss M. McDonald, and under her charge many of the girls are showing marked ability in mending, dressmaking and fancy work.\n\nKitchen and Dining Room\n\nAn experienced and capable dietician in the person of Miss H. Reeder has charge of the kitchen and dining room, and the healthy appearance of the pupils proves her efficiency.\n\nThe Laundry\n\nOur girls are being well-trained in all phases of laundry work by Miss L. Barager, who has charge of this department. She is painstaking and thorough-going in her work.\n\nFarming\n\nNo matter what other education our boys receive it is our purpose that every one of them shall be given a good training in farming. The farm consists of 960 acres, and the Farm Manager and Instructor, Mr. W. E. Wood, is well qualified for his position.\n\nStock-Raising\n\nMr. C. H. Waldon is our careful and efficient Stockman, and is giving our boys a careful training in this connection. Our milch herd of dual-purpose pedigreed Shorthorns is pronounced by Hon. Robert Weir, B.A., Minister of Agriculture for the Dominion, one of the very best dual-purpose Shorthorn herds in the Prairie Provinces. Every animal is under Govt. inspection, and only healthy, good-producing cows are being kept in the herd.\n\nMechanical Work\n\nTraining in the care of machinery and implements and in mechanical work generally is by no means neglected, and this department is under the care of a capable mechanic in the person of Mr. H. Bicknell.\n\nSports\n\nFootball, softball, skating, hockey, etc., are thoroughly enjoyed by our pupils. Mr. Ernest McEwen, an outstanding athlete and a leader in boys' work, is coming on our staff next year and will direct the sports and athletic life of our School.\n\nSinging and Music\n\nA choral class of boys and girls is being voluntarily trained by Miss Jean Doyle to compete in the Musical Festival to be held in Brandon in May. Pupils chosen for this work are showing real promise.\n\nMoral and Religious Life\n\nWe have no hesitation in stating that the moral and religious and general atmosphere of the School has greatly improved during the past year. More and more the pupils are taking an active part in our religious services and are showing a deeper interest in the worthwhile things of life.\n\nProspects for the Future\n\nWe now have 161 pupils in the School and a small waiting list. We expect, however, that ten or twelve pupils, at least, will graduate this year. We, therefore, wish to repeat our urgent appeal that those planning to send pupils will have the Application for Admission filled out by the Agent as early as possible and sent to Ottawa for approval. We can take a few new pupils in April and a number more after July 1st.\n\nWe would especially urge that prospective High School pupils have their Applications sent in with as little delay as possible.\n\nPlease write to us for any information you may desire, and thanking you again for your cooperation and help.\n\nI am, Yours sincerely,\n\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man., March 21, 1952.\n\nJ. A. DOYLE.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRe J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Sept. 13th, '32\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs prices for all farm produce continue to be very low, and as the cost of supplies required in our school have not been proportionately reduced in price, we are finding it difficult to meet our requirements on the reduced Per Capita Grant. I am therefore, writing you to see if you will not permit us to increase the number of pupils for which we receive grant to 165 instead of 160. This would meet our requirements fairly satisfactorily and enable us to maintain the good standard which I feel we have reached in the maintenance of our school both in regard to food, clothing and education.\n\nIn another letter of this date I am giving a somewhat detailed report of our recent examinations.\n\nTrusting that the above request may meet with favorable consideration,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\nOttawa, September 19, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, requesting an increase in pupilage at the Brandon Indian Residential School from the present number for which the grant is allowed, viz., 160, to 165 pupils.\n\nIn reply I regret that, as our funds this year are extremely limited, it will not be possible to provide the funds required in increasing the pupilage at this school. Consideration will be given to an increase in the pupilage to the number asked for when our Estimates are being prepared for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

She attended the Birtle School and Mr Currie will write you in regard to her transfer to this school. Her father brought her over yesterday. We have two other pupils taking Grade XI, eight are studying in Grade X, eleven are registered in Grade IX, and seven in the Technical School. Two of the Grade IX boys have just applied to be transferred to the Technical School, but it is still doubtful whether they can be accepted or not on account of a city regulation to have two-thirds of their students from the city of Brandon.\n\nI have come to value this Technical School training as very desirable for our boys. They take to it splendidly, manifesting great interest and efficiency.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A.

Therefore 63 1/3% of those that wrote had a clean sheet, 13 1/3 passed conditionally.\n\nThe above results are considered by our Inspector above the average secured in the High Schools of Manitoba.\n\nMiss Lulu Ironstar, who took the Normal Course, passed with good standing and we now have her employed on our Teaching Staff. She is showing decided efficiency in her work, is a good member of the staff as far as compatibility and school duties are concerned and is a young woman of splendid and sterling character. We regard her as a valuable acquisition to the staff.\n\nThe three boys who attended Technical School did exceedingly well.

We would, however, require a few more beds.\n\nDesirable and promising pupils are available and, in fact, are being urged upon us.\n\nFinancing is becoming increasingly difficult. Resulting from our reduced per capita grant, profit from farm produce has become in some things almost and in others altogether negligible. Commodity taxes, by both dominion and provincial, are adding much to the cost of many things we have to buy.\n\nThe Board of Home Missions, that might otherwise relieve us, is now taxed to the limit of its resources in providing the ordinances of the Church and in many cases material relief to Canadian people in the increasing number of impoverished districts and settlements.\n\nIf this increase in our pupilage can be granted it will help us materially and will be very much appreciated.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 1st, 1938\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of April 21st, #133-0-1, which came during a brief absence at Edmonton, where I went at the request of the Home Mission Board to assist with a Commission in regard to some items of their work there, and which informs me that our pupilage has been increased from 160 to 165. And let me say how much I appreciate this consideration.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nTo Indian Agents, Missionaries, Teachers, Chiefs and Parents or Guardians of Indian Children\n\nGreetings:\n\nWe wish in the first place to thank most sincerely, especially the Agents and Missionaries, who have been so helpful to us during the past year in connection with the pupils which have come to us from your Reserves. We do appreciate your kindly cooperation, and we are anxious to have you visit our School and get a first-hand knowledge of the work we are trying to do. In the meantime we are glad to give you as much information as we can concerning your boys and girls under our care.\n\nThe picture of the pupils which we present on the back page of this letter is divided into three groups according to their class room work.\n\nThe Intermediate Class Room Pupils\n\nThe top section of the picture includes the pupils in Grades III-VII. Miss W. E. Steinhauer, the teacher, is a graduate from this School. She attended Brandon Collegiate Institute and Brandon College until she secured her Grade XII, and the year following secured her Normal Diploma in the Brandon Normal School.\n\nThe Senior Grades\n\nThe middle group in the picture includes the members of the staff and all the pupils from Grade VII up. Miss D. E. Werthenbach, B.A., who is an Honour Graduate of Alberta University, is the teacher of this room. Twenty-two pupils are taking Grade IX, two are in Grade X, one goes to Brandon Collegiate taking Grade XI, and her work is pronounced \"very satisfactory\" by the Principal of the Collegiate. One attends the Brandon Normal School and will graduate in June as a fully-qualified teacher. Three boys are attending the Brandon Technical School which gives a three-years course in Automobile Mechanics and which should qualify the student in every way to take any position in an up-to-date garage. One girl has just finished a Business Course in the Wheat City Business College in Brandon.\n\nPrimary Grades\n\nThe bottom group includes a kindergarten class and Grades I and II. Miss D. L. Doyle, who is a Scholarship Graduate of Chicago Teachers' College, is the teacher, and Miss Doris Ireton, B.A., a graduate of Brandon College, has been supplying for the last few months.\n\nThe class room work is inspected regularly by Inspector J. Boyd Morrison of the Department of Education for Manitoba, and his reports state very definitely that satisfactory progress is being made in every department of the class room work.\n\nThe Health of the Pupils\n\nWe are watching this phase of our school life very carefully. Our Matron, Mrs. Gertrude Mason, is equipped with that experience and those qualities of mind and heart which enable her to be a real mother to the pupils, and she is quick to observe anything physically wrong with any of them. The Boys' Matron, Miss M. Cranra, has had a partial hospital training, and renders the best of service in caring for any who are sick. A Doctor is called whenever necessary. In addition we now have the services of the Ninette Clinic. These doctors come from time to time and examine most thoroughly all new pupils and any others who may be suspected of developing serious trouble. The X-ray plates show that four out of five of all possible head symptoms are being trouble before coming to the School. This shows the urgent need of this watchful service.\n\nA wholesome and balanced diet is being followed. The pupils are weighed regularly, and satisfactory gains in weight are recorded. A number of boys gained from twenty to thirty pounds each during the first three months of the school year, and taken altogether the Ninette Clinic found the pupils averaged five per cent overweight for girls and boys of their age and height.\n\nThe other departments of the School's life and training are being carried on satisfactorily. Miss R. Harland, the Girls' Matron, in a very kindly and tactful manner is carefully looking after the welfare of the girls. She is also stenographer and office assistant.\nThe Sewing Room\n\nThis department is under the efficient management of Miss M. McDonald, and under her training many of the girls are showing marked ability in mending, dressmaking and fancy needlework.\n\nKitchen and Dining Room\n\nAn experienced and capable dietitian in the person of Miss H. Reeder has charge of the kitchen and dining room, and the healthy appearance of the pupils proves her efficiency.\n\nThe Laundry\n\nOur girls are being well-trained in all phases of laundry work by Miss L. Barager, who has charge of this department. She is painstaking and thorough-going in her work.\n\nFarming\n\nNo matter what other education our boys receive it is our purpose that every one of them shall be given a good training in farming. The farm consists of 960 acres, and the Farm Manager and Instructor, Mr. W. E. Wood, is well qualified for his position.\n\nStock-Raising\n\nMr. C. H. Waldon is our careful and efficient Stockman, and is giving our boys a careful training in this connection. Our milch herd of dual-purpose pedigreed Shorthorns is pronounced by Hon. Robert Weir, B.A., Minister of Agriculture for the Dominion, one of the very best dual-purpose Shorthorn herds in the Prairie Provinces. Every animal is under Govt. inspection, and only healthy, good-producing cows are being kept in the herd.\n\nMechanical Work\n\nTraining in the care of machinery and implements and in mechanical work generally is by no means neglected, and this department is under the care of a capable mechanic in the person of Mr. H. Bicknell.\n\nSports\n\nFootball, softball, skating, hockey, etc., are thoroughly enjoyed by our pupils. Mr. Ernest McEwen, an outstanding athlete and a leader in boys' work, is coming on our staff next year and will direct the sports and athletic life of our School.\n\nSinging and Music\n\nA choral class of boys and girls is being voluntarily trained by Miss Jean Doyle to compete in the Musical Festival to be held in Brandon in May. Pupils chosen for this work are showing real promise.\n\nMoral and Religious Life\n\nWe have no hesitation in stating that the moral and religious and general atmosphere of the School has greatly improved during the past year. More and more the pupils are taking an active part in our religious services and are showing a deeper interest in the worthwhile things of life.\n\nProspects for the Future\n\nWe now have 161 pupils in the School and a small waiting list. We expect, however, that ten or twelve pupils, at least, will graduate this year. We, therefore, wish to repeat our urgent appeal that those planning to send pupils will have the Application for Admission filled out by the Agent as early as possible and sent to Ottawa for approval. We can take a few new pupils in April and a number more after July 1st.\n\nWe would especially urge that prospective High School pupils have their Applications sent in with as little delay as possible.\n\nPlease write to us for any information you may desire, and thanking you again for your cooperation and help.\n\nI am,\n\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man., March 21, 1932.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. DOYLE.\nIndian Residential School\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 15th, 1933\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General, of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI am taking the liberty of enclosing herewith a copy of a circular letter which I sent out to Agents, Missionaries, and Indian parents throughout the constituency served by this school. I expect to send out another similar letter in a few weeks and as your appointment has taken place during the past year I would very much like to include your picture in the letter. If this request meets with your approval I would appreciate it very much if you would provide us either with a suitable cut or with a photograph from which we could have a cut made.\n\nTrusting that you may favor us in this matter,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\n\nEnc.\nMay 18, 1933.\n\nDear Dr. Doyle:\n\nYour letter of May 15th, with attached folder reached me this morning. Please accept my thanks for your consideration in forwarding this circular, which is very informative and attractively gotten up.\n\nIn reply to your request for a photograph from which a plate could be taken, I must confess that I have nothing of the kind in my possession at the present moment. However, I shall institute a search amongst my belongings and if I run across one I shall be pleased to forward it to you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nBRANDON, MANITOBA\nTo Indian Agents, Missionaries, Teachers and Parents or Guardians of Indian Children:\n\nGreetings:\n\nAs the third year in our new school building is closing we wish to say a hearty \"Thank you\" to all who have helped us in making this year the best we have had. We wish also, by a number of pictures and a short letter, to tell you something of our progress.\n\nFirst let us record our deep sorrow at the passing since our last Annual Letter of Mr. Russell T. Ferrier, M.A., of the Department at Ottawa, and Inspector John R. Bunn, of Winnipeg, both of whom have been warm friends of our school. While we regret the retirement of Dr. Duncan Campbell as Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, we gladly acknowledge our loyalty to Inspector Dr. Harold W. McGill and have pleasure in presenting his picture in this folder. We also welcome, most happily, our friend of many years, Inspector A. G. Hamilton, who succeeds the late Mr. Bunn, as our Inspector in Manitoba.\n\nThe Pictures tell you as words cannot how your children look, and reveal something of their activities. We want you especially to become acquainted with each member of our staff and the position they occupy, for it is they who are influencing the lives and characters of your children while they are with us.\n\nThe Health and Happiness of our pupils is our first concern, for they cannot make progress as they should unless they are healthy. The general health of our school has been excellent this year. The Ninette Clinic helps us greatly. They did not find one case of active Tuberculosis on their last visit. This is very gratifying. Many things are contributing to secure these results. Common colds are being carefully watched. Each pupil is weighed regularly. Cod Liver Oil is given daily and medical and hospital treatment is given when necessary. Deep breathing, physical training and outdoor sports have also helped. That our pupils are happy is registered in their faces and also indicated in the general tone of the letters you receive from them.\n\nGrades and Graduates. The success of our classroom work is well attested by the Inspector's reports and by the splendid results in last year's examinations. Our Normal student of last year is now our fully qualified teacher in the Normal Teacher's School. The three normal boys of last year are now teachers. This year seven boys attended the Technical School for Automotive Mechanics and we are glad to report that all have passed with good standing. Of the thirty students who wrote the Departmental Examinations last year four passed with Honours. Ewart Monias reaching 87.5%. Nineteen passed clear. Two had one subject only, and only two had more than one subject. These results are above the average in High School grades, and we expect equally as good standing this year. We have eleven pupils in what we call our Graduating Class, and all will leave behind them a good record.\n\nTraining Homemakers and Homemakers. It is our definite aim and purpose to train every boy that can go home and become a good farmer or go out into the world and make a good living and provide for a house, and to so train every girl that whether she becomes a teacher or a nurse or may be a business girl, she can be successful and happy in life. This year our girls are preparing some very fine pieces of needlework to be exhibited at the World's Fair in Regina. The boys also will show some artistic designs in fretwork.\n\nSports, Dramatics and Music. Under the guidance, training and coaching of our director of athletics the sport life of the school has been greatly developed. Our football team carried off the shield in the Second Division competition. The girls' basketball team, Bobcaygeon boys' basketball and skating, Hockey is also a favorite sport. On Victoria Day Percy Barrens easily won the three-mile race over all contestants. One June 3rd, the Brandon section of the Sunday School National Athletic Competition was held. Our boys entered the contest. One Texas group and one Trail Ranger group scored higher than any Turis or Trail Ranger group in Manitoba. Our National standards are not as available elsewhere as yet. In dramatics a number of our pupils have discovered powers that surprised themselves and others. Six plays were prepared and put on in the school during the year. One play by a group of boys was put on twice in the school, once in Brandon, and at two outside points. Fifty of our girls were formed into a Choral Class, and after careful and patient training sang at the Musical Festival in Brandon. Their work was highly commended by the adjudicator, Dr. Slater of England, who presented them with the shield.\n\nReligious Activities. The spiritual side in the four-fold character is being well cared for in the very successful C.G.S. and Troopwork. Trail Rangers are held in the Sunday School. Members of the staff have given splendid leadership, and the pupils themselves have taken an active part in the services. Nineteen of the older boys and girls were prepared and taken into Church membership last Easter.\n\nNext Year. With our excellent staff, fine equipment, and improved health and general spirit, we are looking forward with good prospect to the coming school year.\n\nThose desiring to send us pupils should forward the Application for Admission at once as we will only have room for a limited number when the holidays are over. We especially desire that prospective High School students should get word to us at the earliest possible date.\n\nAgain thanking all who have helped us, and bespeaking your continued kindly co-operation,\n\nI am, Yours sincerely,\n\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man., June 7, 1933.\n\nJ. A. DOYLE.\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6255, File 576-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI wish to thank you for your permission to use the picture about which I wrote you. It has come out very well. And I have returned the photograph to your brother's home.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of this year's circular letter. I find a letter like this to be the most effective method of maintaining an interest in the school among the Indian people whom we serve. The pictures no doubt make more impression than the letter itself. And they insure that the letter is preserved and shown to all their friends.\n\nAgain thanking you,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nIndian School Shows Progress\n\nJ. A. Doyle Announces Growth of Scholarship and Industry in Industrial Institution at Brandon\n\nEnding the third year in its course, Dr. J. A. Doyle, principal of the Indian residential school, Brandon, has issued the annual report showing progress made in all directions. The latest report enables students to form large groups of boys, Trail Rangers and Camp Girls in Training. These groups under the direction of leaders in the school.\n\nStudents who wrote the grade examinations during the past year achieved results above the average. In addition to regular scholastic instruction, both the boys and girls are trained to be self-supporting and homesteaders. The definite aim of the school is to train every boy so that he can become a good citizen on his father's land or go out into the world and earn a living. Every girl receives training which will fit her to take up a profession or become a successful homemaker.\n\nThe health of the pupils is a primary consideration. Each day is weighed regularly and foods are carefully selected. With the Ninette clinic last visited the school, not one case of active tuberculosis was found. The organized outdoor games and physical training are regarded as largely responsible for this.\n\nThe pupils are encouraged to take an active part in the organization of groups and in the church. Nineteen of the older boys and girls were prepared and assisted by church leaders last Easter. A large choir from the school competed in the musical festival at Brandon and carried off the shield.\n\nDr. Doyle was formerly mission secretary of the United Church in Canada. He has a well-equipped staff of teachers and workers, one of whom is a graduate of the school and the Brandon normal school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sutherland,\n\nKnowing your very deep interest in the moral and religious life of the Indian pupils under your care, I am taking the liberty of dropping you this extra word.\n\nI have been extremely disappointed in the past in our failure to secure a definite religious response which seemed to carry with it real conviction and a sense of a vital relationship and responsibility to God. Some members of the Oxford Group were in Brandon and in attending their meetings their methods and appeal seemed so sane and free from objectionable emotionalism that I felt a visit from them would be a good thing for our school. As it has turned out it would seem the time was ripe for just the type of appeal these people were able to make and the response on the part of the older pupils has altogether exceeded my expectations. As you may know, the Group leaders advocate a quiet time to be observed every morning. We have laid this before the pupils who have indicated their desire to live the better quality of life and are giving them the opportunity to come to the chapel before six o'clock in the morning at which time a chapter of the Bible or a portion of it is read by one of themselves and the rest of the time for at least fifteen minutes is spent silently. The number attending at this quiet has gradually increased and now between sixty and seventy are regularly in attendance. If this is maintained the results will be far-reaching. Already the spirit and atmosphere of the school has wonderfully improved.\n\nI was also greatly encouraged that in the confessions made, and many of them at least were very thorough, very little seriously objectionable conduct was revealed. In all, while I think we are not over-optimistic, we are greatly encouraged.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nJune 6th., 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., August 10, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter giving the matter serious consideration I am writing to see if it would be possible to have our pupilage in this school increased by five, i.e., one hundred and seventy instead of one hundred and sixty-five as at present. There are three main reasons for making this request:\n\nFirst. We find that we can handle the extra five in dormitory, dining-room and classrooms without the slightest difficulty or inconvenience.\n\nSecond. We are having requests from agents and parents sufficient to indicate that this number of pupils and more will be available.\n\nThird. This would help our financial condition very materially. The reduction of 15\u00a2 in the per capita grant we felt seriously. The extra expenses we are at for minor repairs have added many hundreds of dollars to our expenditure but the most serious situation is from another partial crop failure. The high winds and drought in the spring with no rain during July has made it so that more than half our crop cannot be cut and bound with the binder. That which can be handled with the binder is much less than half an average crop. We will, therefore, have to buy a large quantity of feed in order to maintain our livestock.\n\nThe granting of this request would help us greatly in maintaining a living wage for our staff and a good standard of food and clothing for our pupils. Trusting that this may meet with your approval,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJAD/W\n\nIndian Affairs.

Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nTo Indian Agents, Missionaries, Teachers and Parents or Guardians of Indian Children\n\nGREETINGS:\n\nAnother busy and successful year in our school life is drawing to a close. Once again with a few paragraphs and pictures we wish to tell you about your children, who are under our care. We feel that our work is more sincere than to those who have given us much less help and co-operation.\n\nWe were honored recently with a visit from Dr. Harold W. McGill, of Ottawa, Deputy Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs, Inspector A. G. Hamilton, of Winnipeg, a warm friend of our school and pupils, has visited us a number of times and it was most stimulating.\n\nWe wish to record our regrets that Rev. Dr. Barner is withdrawing from the Superintendency of Indian work and will miss his visits. His stimulating visits. We will welcome Rev. Dr. Corning, the Missionary-Superintendent of the United Church for the Manitoba Conference, and Dr. Barner's successor, Rev. K. N. Ross, who is visiting the Indian Residential Schools in Toronto, and who has special oversight of all our Indian work, is always a welcome and helpful visitor in our school.\n\nWe are glad to report that these visits have been very helpful.\n\nSome New Features. A Home Nursing Class, under the St. John's Ambulance, has been conducted this year. Thirteen of our older girls have been trained under the direction of Miss M. Matchett, R.N. Drs. Rawson and Sharp, of Brandon, conducted the examinations. All of the girls passed successfully except one. The average for the whole class was 76%.\n\nWe expect to continue this work so that each girl before graduation will have this training.\n\nA Short Course in Agriculture has been conducted at the Provincial Farm, which is just across the road from our school. Two of our boys took the course this year and we expect to have a number next year.\n\nClass Room Work. We believe that the average of our class room work has been the best we have yet had. One pupil will, we expect, enter Grade XI next fall. We have three pupils writing Grade X this fall and two others are writing Grade XI this month. Three boys have graduated from the Technical School in Brandon with good standing and one of them received a scholarship to the University of Manitoba. One of the Technical School graduates has taken Grade X work in addition to this course, and we expect he will pass. Prospects look very promising for the coming year.\n\nHealth. With the aid of the Ninette Clinic, the careful attention of our school doctors, the services of a trained nurse on the staff and the constant watching the weights and diet of the pupils, we have achieved a high standard of general health in the school.\n\nAthletic. We give attention to athletics that we may develop sound bodies, good health and the spirit of good sportsmanship.\n\nLast year our boys played football in the Brandon League and was successful in winning the Charity Cup. In the North Brandon League our girls played softball, and when the season was over they were placed second. Our teams finished third in the Brandon League. Our teams, Junior Eagles, Senior Eagles and Buffaloes, made the three highest scores in the province, and one of our boys won the Junior Eagles' award for the best player.\n\nThe Spirit of the School is continually on the upgrade. The Boys' and Girls' Councils have greatly helped by promoting good feeling and better understanding. The older pupils have been taking charge of the Sunday evening service very efficiently and are taking more responsibility.\n\nDuring the past year we have not had room for all the pupils for whom application has been made. This year the Department has increased its capacity five, and we expect that twenty-five of our senior pupils will graduate. We, therefore, will have room for the largest number of new pupils of any year since the opening of the school.\n\nIt is important that all pupils commence with the opening of classes after the holidays. We will, therefore, appreciate very much the cooperation of Agents, Missionaries and parents in arranging for new pupils to come with the others when they return from holidays.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nI.

We took the liberty of placing your picture on it again this year.\n\nI find that this letter serves an exceedingly good purpose in helping us keep in better touch with the reserves from which we have pupils. It also serves in enabling us to say a kindly word of thanks to those who are constantly giving us help.\n\nI was sorry that I could not be here at the time of your visit a year ago.

Doyle D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Nov. 6, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince I have had charge of this school our gasoline has been supplied to us by the Imperial Oil Company and we have been exempt from the Provincial tax. They now request that a certificate number be supplied or some statement indicating that this school is carried on as an institution of the Dominion Government. We will be glad if you will supply us with the necessary number or statement.\n\nThanking you,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 18, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, in connection with the Provincial Gasoline Tax.\n\nRemission of gasoline tax is allowed on Government owned cars but this provision does not apply on cars used for Government business but not owned by the Government. The Department has never purchased cars for Indian residential schools and, consequently, we have never considered such cars our property. Under these circumstances, the Department has not felt prepared to sign the declaration that cars operated by Principals of residential schools are Government owned and are, therefore, entitled to remission of the gasoline tax.\n\nI understand, however, that you are entitled to remission of the tax on gasoline used for tractors, engines, etc. Provision for remission of the tax in this regard can be made by yourself with the provincial authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended September 1941.\n\nPrincipal P.T. Chapin\n\nDated Oct 17th 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFont No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated ........................................... 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated ........................................... 19 ...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated ...........................................\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residences of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated ........................................... 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ........................................... this ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated ........................................... 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated ........................................... 19 ...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19 ...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated ........................................... 19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ........................................... this ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended December 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated ........................................... 19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ........................................... this ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended December 1943.\n\nPrincipal: P.T.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated ........................................... 19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated ...........................................\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended June 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated ........................................... 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ........................................... this ........................................... 10\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whose grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated ........................................... 19 ...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ........................................... this ........................................... 19 ...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6256, File 576-2, part 1)**\n\n**PUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLICI\u00c8S**\n\n**CANADA**\n\n**VERY POOR COPY**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: P.T.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated ........................................... 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ........................................... this ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 19...\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter minus the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................School for the Quarter ended .................................................. 19 ..........\n\nPrincipal ...........................................\n\nDated ........................................... 19 ..........\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ...........................................\n\nDated at ........................................... this ........................................... 19 ..........\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 9, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at: Brandon\n\nthis April 9, 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................19.........\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated..................................................19.........\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent..................................................................\n\nDated at..................................................this..................................................19.........\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................Sept..................19...........\n\nPrincipal:..............................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................19...........\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at.................................................................this..................................................19...........\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. O.B. Strapp\n\nDated July 3rd 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nDated at Brandon Man.\n\nthis July 3rd 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. O.B. Strapp\n\nDated: April 18, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at Brandon, Manitoba, this April 18, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. O. Scott\n\nDated: July 14, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDated.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: Rex O.B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal: R.O. Straff\n\nDated: October 3rd 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: R.O. Straff\n\nDated at: Brandon\n\nthis October 3rd 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFund No. I.A. 403\nReq. No. 2759\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 12th 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated at Brandon Man.\n\nthis April 12th 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 5, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Brandon, Manitoba this July 5, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 635             | Ralph Royal    | 4   | 1   |      | Moose Woods 1  |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 636             | Andrew Crate   | 6   | 1   |      | Norway Hae 1   |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 637             | Peter Beardy   | 8   | 1   |      | Little Sank 1  |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 638             | John Beardy    | 10  | 1   |      | Little Sank 1  |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 639             | Russel Standing| 7   | 1   |      | White Bear 1   |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 640             | John Bottle    | 11  | 1   |      | Lao Seul 1     |                    |                         |                             |            |\n\n**TOTALS**\n\n|                | 62 | 91 |\n|----------------|----|----|\n|                | 33 | 5  |\n|                | 16 | 9  |\n|                | 21 | 19 |\n|                | 11 | 20 |\n|                | 10 | 16 |\n|                | 5  | 4  |\n|                | 1  | 1  |\n|                | 1  | 1  |\n|                | 1  | 1  |\n|                | 1  | 1  |\n|                | 1  | 1  |\n\n**TOTALS**\n\n|                | 187 | 296 |\n|----------------|-----|-----|\n|                | 198 | 164 |\n|                | 104 | 72  |\n|                | 187 | 296 |\n\n**NOTE**\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\n\n**TOTAL number of days in Quarter...** 91\n\n**AGGREGATE number of days pupils in residence during Quarter...** 19716\n\n**AVERAGE attendance of pupils during Quarter...** 150.87\n\n**AMOUNT of per capita grant due for Quarter...** $9,046.16\n\n---\n\n**Indian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 30, 1945\n\nI have

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 6, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at Brandon, Man.\n\nthis July 6,

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. O.B. Stumpf\n\nDated: October 14, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at: Brandon, Man.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal Rev. O.B. Strapp\n\nDated January 9, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Brandon Man this January 9, 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal Rev. O.B. Stepp\n\nDate October 8th, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Brandon, Man. this October 6th, 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brandon Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 6, 1952.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Stamp]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals; placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

A. Doyle of the Brandon Industrial School, Brandon, Manitoba, in connection with the WAVERLEY PICTORIAL DICTIONARY published by The Waverley Book Company of London, England. We understand that Dr. Doyle has made a request for a set of this dictionary work for the school library. Dr. Doyle referred our representative to Inspector A. J. Hamilton of Winnipeg. The latter looked over the work with Mr. Chapin, and both approved very highly of it.\n\nThe WAVERLEY PICTORIAL DICTIONARY is a publication in eight volumes, and has been placed in a very, very large number of schools and libraries throughout Canada. The price of this work is $49.50.\n\nMay we have your instructions to send a set of this work to the Industrial School at Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nThanking you, we remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE BRITISH EDUCATIONAL SOCIETY,\n\nA.W.Meredith: S\n\nManager.\n\nUniversal History of the World - Lands and Peoples - The Pictorial Dictionary\nOttawa,\nJune 4, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to supplying the Waverley Pictorial Dictionary to the Brandon Indian Residential School.

Sir:\n\nYour requisition for school material dated December 31, 1947, has been received and is being checked in this office before it is forwarded to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery, where it is filled.\n\nIt is noted that you have requested:\n\n- Builders of the Old World (Grade 7) - 15 copies,\n- Story of the English Speaking Nations (Grade 5) - 12 copies,\n- Story of Nations (Man. Ed. - Grade 9) - 6 copies.\n\nIn connection with your requisition of last year, the under-mentioned items were ordered:\n\n- Builders of the Old World - 15 copies,\n- The Story of Nations - 12 copies.\n\nThese books were not available at the time of ordering, but the Government Stationery Office promised to supply them at the earliest opportunity. Please let me know if you have received them so as to avoid duplication of your order.\n\nThe official list of Manitoba texts for 1947-48 does not include The Story of the English Speaking Nations. It shows Builders of the Old World authorized for Grades 7-8, and the Story of Canada authorized, in addition, for Grade 5. Please advise further your minimum requirements for these two texts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. O. B. Strapp,\nBrandon Indian Res.

Builders of the Old World.\nGr.VIII. Story of the English Speaking Nations.\n\nThese books are listed in; \"Junior High Grades\"\nIntroduction to Social Studies Guidance. Province of Manitoba, 1947, page 40.\n\nInquiries have lead us to believe that these books will not be available until September 1948. We repeated the requisition as we were not aware that the previous list would be carried over to this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6256, File 576-4, part 1)\nSeptember 13, 1949.\n\nRev. O.B. Strapp,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\n\nHigh School Pupils\n\nDear Mr. Strapp:\n\nA copy of our telegram of September 13 is enclosed. As you are aware, it has been our practice to provide textbooks and the usual school necessaries for High School pupils who have not in the past been very numerous at any one point. Now, however, the number of these pupils is sharply increased, and as your school has one of the largest concentrations of such pupils I shall welcome your cooperation in effecting any reasonable economies possible.\n\nFirstly, I suggest, it must be impressed upon the pupils that the books, etc., are not their personal property but are merely on loan to them and are not to be damaged or defaced in the manner common to too many pupils. Indeed the books can well be regarded as acquisitions to your school library, be numbered and marked appropriately, and be charged out to the individual for as long as he needs them. The related library procedures could be appropriately performed by one of the senior students under direction.\n\nThe concessions to your conditional or provisional students represent a relaxation of the Department's previous ruling in regard to students whose year's work has not been completely successful. This relaxation, however, extends only to those pupils whose enthusiasm for school work is great enough to have prompted them to return to residence before the receipt of our telegram today.\n\n.....2\nexpect that you will consult with the High School Principal and determine now on the basis of their past performance whether they should repeat their grade and course or whether they should attempt the next grade carrying conditions. In either case if at Christmas the results achieved by them are not satisfactory, any assistance to them will terminate and they will have to go home.\n\nYour mention of the High School's readiness to accept fourteen grade nine pupils caused me to wonder whether there are more than this number and whether a few would be left over to continue their instruction in your school. You are aware of our wish to eliminate the instruction of pupils above grade eight entirely. We are advised that the transition to Provincial schools is more likely to be successful when carried out in a grade lower than grade ten. The casualties among your grade ten pupils give some support to this view. Hereafter exploration and appraisal of the abilities and interests of these older children will take place in grade nine or below and their retention in school will be based on something more than hope.\n\nYou are aware, of course, that in all this we are attempting to carry out recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee and while it will probably add to the load on you we are confident that you will give the experiment a fair trial.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nCAFG:MNcN\n\nIndian Affairs.

The lowest tender received on the Plans and Specifications was $20,000.00, and to this amount the Public Works Department adds $3000.00 for extras and contingencies, making the total amount to be provided $23,000.00. There is an evident difficulty in this matter; either the Plans and Specifications must be revised to conform to the Estimates, or else the expenditure of a larger sum than that originally provided must be authorized. If the former course were adopted the proposed award of the contract would have to be deferred, new plans and specifications drawn, and the tenders again advertised; if the latter, the amount required would be $20,000.00, which would have to be provided during the year 1892-3. These plans and specifications were drawn upon the same scale as those of the St. Paul's Industrial School. The contract for this School was awarded at $18,955.00, with extras and\nand additional works, $2,593.50, the total amount paid to the contractors was $21,948.50. When the original Estimate was made for the Methodist Industrial School, which has been located at Brandon, it was understood that the building would be erected upon the St. Peter's Reserve. The location was afterwards changed to Southern Manitoba, and from that to Brandon, where it was finally fixed. There is no doubt that the building could have been erected upon the St. Peter's Reserve, as originally intended, for the same amount, or very nearly so, as the Institution at St. Paul's, and in inserting an amount in the Estimates for the new building the expenditure at St. Paul's was taken as a guide. The present location of the school at Brandon has undoubtedly materially increased the cost of the building, and, as I have shown above, the only way now out of the difficulty is either to reduce the plans or to consent to the provision of a sufficient sum of money to carry them out on the present scale.\n\nJune 8th, 1892.\nSECOY'S BRANCH,\nJUN 8 - 1992\nWRITTEN\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a memo of a further amount required to be placed in the Supplementary Estimates of the Dept. of Indian Affairs for the year 1892-93 for the erection of an Industrial School at Broomton, Man., the said amount being $25,000.00.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to have the additional made.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6256, File 576-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nOttawa, 2 Oct. 1892\n\nDear Mr. Secretary,\n\nI am sure you remember asking me to have a copy prepared for you of a plan of the proposed Indian Industrial School at Chilliwack B.C. The copy I enclose herewith. I think you intended to send it to the Indian Commissioner with a view to ascertaining from him whether or not such a plan would be suitable for the proposed Industrial School at Brandon. If such\nto your wish, and you\nare to do so I will send the\nplan to the Indian Com-\nmissioner for the purpose.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon. E. Dewdney\nDept General\nIndian Affairs\nDear Sinclair,\n\nRe your letter of the 12th instant herewith, Mr. Dewdney says to send the plan to the Indian Commissioner as suggested.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. Chisholm\n\nR. Sinclair, Esq.,\nActing D.S.G.\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nI beg to call the attention of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to the matter of the proposed Industrial Institute at Brandon. Also, with the hope that some means may be devised to terminate the delay in the erection of the necessary buildings. I have learned indirectly that the Department of Public Works is unwilling to proceed with the buildings on the present plan, as the expenditure involved will be considerably beyond what is thought to be necessary. The site that has been selected close by the town.\n\nThe Honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa\nof Brandon, in full view from the \nE.P. Railroad, and in close proxim-\nity to large and handsome build-\nings, both Provincial and Municipal, \nit would seem to be very necessary \nthat the proposed Institute building \nshould be superior in its proportions, \nor at least in the architectural ap-\npearance, to other buildings more \nremotely situated. The more so as \nwe confidently hope to make this \nin many respects the model Insti-\ntute of the North-West; at the \nsame time we feel assured that \nthis can be done without in-\nvolving a higher expenditure than \nthe proposed buildings would fairly \nrepresent. You are probably aware that \nthe Provincial Asylum occupies a \ncommanding site only a short dis-\ntance from where it is proposed \nto erect the Institute, and I am...\nInformed that the Edmonton Government are about to expend some $40,000 in the enlargement of the asylum. I have not seen the plans for the new estate; but if what I have heard about them is correct, I think it would be a pity either to reduce the size or change much their architectural character. I believe it is not an uncommon thing to find trustees for Government work are very much higher than in the case of private individuals, and it has occurred to me that a possible solution of the difficulty might be found in placing at the disposal of the missionary society a certain fixed sum to be expended in the erection of a building under the oversight and with the concurrence of a representative of the Department.\nMay the Dominion Commissioner for the North-West deal with plans so prepared as to account of enlargement with the growing needs of the Institute. I think a building could be erected that would meet the needs of the case and at the same time come within reasonable limits with regard to cost.\n\nI shall be glad to be informed if any such method of procedure is practicable, and whether there is any thing that we can do to facilitate matters in regard to this enterprise.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Macdonald\nGeneral Secretary.\nRev. A. Rutherford\nCivil Society,\nMethodist Mission Room,\nToronto, Ont.\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\nRev.

Dr. Sutherland for an Indian Mission School at Chilliwack, B. C.\n\nThe adoption of this plan for the Brandon School, I am unable to recommend, for the following among other reasons.--\n\nThe building is intended to be constructed of wood, and would be too cold to resist the severity of the winter weather in this country, and even could that objection be overcome by the employment of different material, where are others such as the location in the basement of lavatories and bath-rooms, the inability to place in the basement the necessary closets, the cramped character of the rooms, the comparatively limited amount of accommodation generally, and the want of a proper system of ventilation, so peculiarly necessary to the health of Indian children, in climate such as this.\n\nTo the Deputy of the\n\nSupt. Genl. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6256, File 576-5, part 1)\nam however returning by parcel post, the plans and specifications transmitted by the Department, and at the same time fresh plans shewing the alterations which are suggested with a view to reducing the cost within the required limit.\n\nThe alteration in the specifications necessary to meet the changes in the plans I am not of course in a position to make, but beg to give the following additional information respecting the proposed changes.\n\nIt is suggested that the building be constructed of wood with brick veneer instead of walls of brick.\n\nI am advised that the walls of the building as originally proposed are unnecessarily heavy.\n\nIt is proposed to confine the application of the Smead & Dowd system of heating and ventilation to the main building where it is considered essential, for the proper ventilation of the dormitories, and to enable closets to be placed in the basement, which is considered indispensable.\n\nThe wing not having dormitories nor closets, can, it is thought, be sufficiently well heated by an ordinary furnace, and so permitting saving in that direction to be effected.\n\nIt is thought that by the adoption of the changes referred to, the whole cost of the building will not exceed eighteen thousand dollars, thus leaving a sum of two thousand dollars available for the heating.\n\nAlterations made as will be observed, include the provision of tanks, which are essential in view of the possibility of fire occurring, and where placed,\n\nI am\nam assured by Clerk of Public Works and other competent authority, there exists no danger of their freezing.\n\nIt may be pointed out incidentally that the arrangement of the original plan of the basement has been changed to get fuller advantage of the accommodation, and afford room for the children to play in stormy weather. Upon fuller consideration of the arrangement of the attic floor as I have had it shown in the new plan, I think a further slight alteration might be made with advantage.\n\nThe bed-room next to the bath-room might be enlarged by pulling down the partition between it and the bath-room and including the space occupied by the latter.\n\nIn that case the door on a line with that of the adjacent bed-room and entering upon the corridor might be closed up, entrance being by the door now shown as for bath-room.\n\nSpace for the bath-room might then be taken on the other side of the corridor from between the nurse's room and the bed-room, and the window of the bed-room could be moved more into the corner, and thus making the rooms a trifle smaller.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to point out the strong probability that if plans were on view at Brandon as well as at Winnipeg, the result would be the receipt of reduced tenders for the building.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo the Deputy Minister Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 1st Dec. 1892\n\nRe the Changed Plans of the proposed Brandon Ind.

There has been some correspondence since regarding this matter but I am not aware that any further steps have been taken to secure the necessary...\nnecessary building. Quite a number of years have elapsed since negotiations with reference to this Institute began - the very long delay has been a serious inconvenience to us as well as a great loss to the children of those bands from which the pupils were to be drawn. I am instructed by our Missionary Committee to ask for a definite statement of the intentions of the Government respecting this Institute.

Paget as to the certificate of electrical soundness which I gave you for one of the mares purchased for the Industrial School, I beg to say that while the Department is correct in inferring that the mare is not perfectly sound, it is wrong in supposing that she is not of good value for the money and will adapted for the work of the school.\n\nThe reason that she is not perfectly sound is that she has partial ossification of the lateral cartilages. This is a condition frequently present in the heavy breeds of horses, and in slight cases like the present one, it does not interfere in any way with the action or usefulness of the horse.\n\nThe law of soundness as recently applied in cases before the Courts in England...\nlooks upon soundness as nearing perfection, and that therefore the veterinarian is bound to consider any defect however trifling which prevents an animal from attaining that standard. For this reason and from the fact that comparatively few animals reach the standard of perfection, many veterinarians, myself among the number have adopted the practice of giving qualified certificates for animals sufficiently sound for the purpose intended.\n\nI understand from you at the time the mans were examined and I had explained to you the nature of the defect of this one. That a qualified certificate would be sufficient, and I regret that there should have been any difficulty about the matter.\n\nTrusting that this explanation will prove satisfactory I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFred Torrance D.V.S.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 10th instant respecting horses purchased by Mr. Tedd for the Branden Industrial School, I have the honor to enclose a letter from the Veterinary Surgeon, together with a copy of one from Mr. Tedd.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHayter Reed\n\nCommissioner.\n\nTo the Deputy of the Supt.

That the several parts of this Contract shall be taken together, to explain each other, and to make the whole consistent; and if it be found that anything has been omitted or mis-stated, which is necessary for the proper performance and completion of any part of the work contemplated, in either the drawings hereinbefore referred to, or the specifications annexed, the explanation and interpretation given by the Chief Architect shall be received as such, be final binding and conclusive upon the Contractor, and the Contractor will, at his own expense, execute the same as though it had been properly described, and the correction of any such error or omission shall not be deemed to be an addition to or deviation from the works hereby contracted for.\n\n5. The Architect shall be at liberty at any time, either before the commencement or during the construction of the works, or any portion thereof, to order any extra work to be done, and to make any changes which he may deem expedient in the works, in shape, size, nature, location, or position of the works, or any part or parts thereof, or in any other thing connected with the works, whether or not such changes increase or diminish the work to be done, or the cost of doing the same, and the Contractor shall immediately comply with all written instructions of the Architect in that behalf; and the Contractor shall not make any change, addition, omission, deviation from the works, and shall not be entitled to any payment for any change, addition, omission, deviation, or any extra work, unless such change, addition, omission, deviation, or any extra work, shall have been first directed in writing by the Architect, and notified to the Contractor in writing, and unless the price to be paid for any addition or extra work shall have been previously fixed by the Architect in writing, and approved of by the Minister of Public Works for the time being, and the decision of the Architect as to whether any such change or deviation increases or diminishes the cost of the work, and as to the amount to be paid or deducted, as the case may be, in respect thereof, shall be final, and the decision of his decision in writing as to such matters shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to be paid therefor. If any such change or alteration constitutes, in the opinion of the said Architect, a deduction from the works, his decision as to the amount to be deducted on account thereof shall be final and binding.\n\n6. That all the clauses of this Contract shall apply to any changes, additions, deviations, or extra work, in like manner, and to the same extent as to the works contracted for, and no changes, additions, deviations or extra work shall annul or invalidate this Contract.\n\n7.

That the Architect shall be the sole judge of work and material in respect of both quantity and quality, and his decision on all questions in dispute with regard to work or material, or as to the meaning or intention of this Contract and the plans, specifications and drawings shall be final, and no works or extra or additional works or changes shall be deemed to have been executed, nor shall the Contractor be entitled to payment for the same unless they shall have been executed to the satisfaction of the Architect as evidenced by his certificate in writing, which certificate shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to be paid therefor.\n9. A competent foreman is to be kept on the ground by the Contractor during all the working hours, to receive the orders of the Architect, and should the person so appointed be deemed by the Architect incompetent, or conduct himself improperly, he may be discharged by the Architect, and another shall at once be appointed in his stead; such foreman shall be considered as the lawful representative of the Contractor, and shall have full power to carry out all requisitions and instructions of the said Architect.\n\n10. In case any material, or other things, in the opinion of the Architect not in accordance with the said several parts of this Contract, or not sufficiently sound or otherwise unsuitable for the respective works, be used for or brought to the intended works, or any part thereof, or if any work be improperly executed, the Architect may require the Contractor to remove the same, and to provide proper material or other things, or properly execute the work, as the case may be, and thereupon the Contractor shall and will immediately comply with the said requisition, and if twenty-four hours shall elapse, and such requisition shall not have been complied with, the Architect may cause such material or other things in such work, to be removed, and in any such case the Contractor shall pay to Her Majesty all such damages and expense as shall be incurred in the removal of such material materials, or other things, or of such work, or Her Majesty may, in her discretion, retain and deduct such damages and expenses from any amounts payable to the Contractor.\n\n11.

If the Architect shall at any time consider the number of workmen employed or quantity of machinery or other plant, or the quantity of proper materials respectively employed or provided by the Contractor on or for the said works to be insufficient for the advancement thereof towards completion within the limited times, or that the works are, or some part thereof is not being carried on with due diligence, then in every such case the said Architect may, by written notice to the Contractor, require him to supply and provide such additional workmen, horses, machinery or other plant or materials, as the Architect may think necessary, and in case the Contractor shall not thereupon within six days, or such other longer period as may be fixed by any such notice, in all respects comply therewith, then the Architect may, either on behalf of Her Majesty or if he see fit, as the agent of and on account of the Contractor, but in either case at the expense of the Contractor, provide and employ such additional workmen, horses, machinery and other plant, or any thereof, or such additional materials respectively as he may think proper, and may pay such additional workmen such wages, and for such additional horses, machinery or other plant, and materials respectively such prices as he may think proper, and all such wages and prices respectively shall thereupon forthwith be repaid by the Contractor or the same may be retained and deducted out of any moneys at any time payable to the Contractor; and Her Majesty may\nuse, in execution or advancement of the said works, not only the horses, machinery, and other plant, and materials so in any case provided by any one on Her Majesty's behalf, but also all such as may have been or may be provided by or on behalf of the said Contractor.\n\n13. In case the Contractor shall make default or delay in diligently continuing to execute or advance the works to the satisfaction of the Architect, and such default or delay shall continue for six days after notice in writing shall have been given by the Architect to the Contractor requiring him to put an end to such default or delay, or in case the Contractor shall become insolvent, or make any assignee for the benefit of creditors, or neglect either personally or by a skilful and competent agent to superintend the works, then in any of such cases Her Majesty may take the work out of the Contractor's hands and employ such means as She may see fit to complete the work, and in such cases the Contractor shall be liable for the cost thereof, and in respect of the works performed, but shall nevertheless remain liable for all losses and damages which may be suffered by Her Majesty by reason of the non-completion by the Contractor of the works; and all materials and things whatsoever, and all horses, machinery and other plant provided for the purposes of the works, shall belong and be considered as the property of Her Majesty for the purposes and according to the provisions and conditions contained in the eleventh clause hereof.\n\n14. The Contractor shall be at the risk of, and shall bear, all loss or damage whatsoever from whatever cause or cause, which may occur to the works or any of them, until the same be fully and finally completed and delivered up to and accepted by the said Minister of Public Works for the time being; and if any such loss or damage occur before such final completion, delivery and acceptance, the Contractor shall immediately at own expense repair, restore and re-execute the work so damaged, so that the whole works, or the respective parts thereof, may be completed within the time hereby limited.\n\n15. The Contractor shall not have or make any claim or demand, or bring any action or suit or petition against Her Majesty for any damages which he may sustain by reason of any delay in the progress of the work, arising from the acts or omissions of Her Majesty's agents, and it is hereby agreed that in the event of any such delay the Contractor shall have such further time for the completion of the works as may be fixed in that behalf by the Minister of Public Works for the time being.\n\n16. That whenever and so often as it may be necessary for the Contractor to co-operate with other Contractors on this work, shall diligently, and under the directions of the Architect, perform all such works as shall be requisite and proper on part for such co-operation, and for securing and placing in proper position the portion necessary in and hereby connected to, or constructed or other portions of the work, even though not contracted for by , in a proper and sound mode without any extra charge therefor, and shall be bound in all things to conform to the direction of the Minister or the Architect, touching upon such co-operation and work.\n\n17. The Contractor shall not make any assignment of this Contract, for the execution of any of the works hereby contracted for; and in any event no such assignment, even though consented to, shall exonerate the Contractor from liability, under this Contract, for the due performance of all the works hereby contracted for. In the event of any such assignment being made by the Contractor, shall be void or made no claim or demand upon Her Majesty for any future payments under this Contract for any further or greater sum or sums than the sum or sums respectively at which the work or works so assigned shall have been undertaken to be executed by the assignee; and in the event of any such\nassignment being made without such consent, Her Majesty may take the work out of the Contractor hands, and employ such means as She may see fit to complete the same; and in such case the Contractor shall have no claim for any further payment in respect of the works performed, but shall nevertheless remain liable for all loss and damage which may be suffered by Her Majesty by reason of such completion of the Contracted of the works, and all materials and things whatsoever, and all horses, machinery and other plant provided by for the purposes of the works, shall remain and be considered as the property of Her Majesty for the purposes and according to the provisions and conditions contained in the 12th clause hereof.\n\nAnd it is further hereby understood and agreed that no sub-contract for the execution of the works herein contracted for shall be recognized in any manner or form by Her Majesty, who shall not in any way be held liable for the payment of moneys due to said sub-contractor, if any, but shall hold, under any circumstances, the Contractor herein responsible for the proper performance of the work, as if the whole had been executed under his own immediate responsibility and supervision.\n\n18. Time shall be deemed to be of the essence of this Contract.\n\n19. This Contract is hereby, pursuant to the provisions of the 16th section of the Statute 49 Victoria (1886), Chapter 11, R. S. C., made subject to the express condition that no member of the House of Commons of Canada shall be admitted to any share or part of such contract, or to any benefit to arise therefrom.\n\n20. The Contractor shall be responsible for all damages claimable by any person or corporation whatsoever in respect of any injury to person or to the lands, buildings, or other property, or in respect of any infringement of any right whatsoever, occasioned by the performance of the said works, or by any neglect or misfeasance or non-feasance on part, and shall and will, at own expense, make such temporary provisions as may be necessary for the protection of persons, or of lands, buildings, or other property, or for the uninterrupted enjoyment of all rights of persons or corporations, in and during the performance of the said works.\n\n21. Should the Contractor not complete the work herein contracted for at the period agreed upon as above mentioned shall be liable for, and shall cause to be paid to Her Majesty all salaries or wages which shall become due to person or persons superintending the work on behalf of Her said Majesty from the above named period for completion, until the same shall actually be completed and received.\n\n22. If the Contractor fail at any time in paying the salaries or wages of any person employed by upon or in respect of said works, or any of them, and any part of such salary be twelve days in arrears, or if there be due to any such person twelve days wages or salary, the Architect must notify the Contractor to pay such wages or wages and if two days elapse and the same be not paid in full up to the date of payment, or to such other date as may be in accordance with the terms of employment of such person, then Her Majesty may pay to such person salary or wages from any date to any date and to any amount which may be payable, and may charge the same to the Contractor, and the Contractor covenant with Her Majesty to repay at once any and every sum so paid.\n\n23. The Contractor will protect, and will not remove or destroy, or permit to be removed or destroyed, the stakes, and other marks placed on or about the said works by the Architect of the works, and shall furnish the necessary assistance to correct or replace any stake or mark which through any cause may have been removed or destroyed.\n24. Any notice or other communication mentioned in this Contract to be notified or given to the Contractor shall be deemed to be well and sufficiently notified or given if the same be left at the Contractor's office or mailed in any Post Office, to the Contractor or foreman, addressed to the address mentioned in this Contract, or to the Contractor's last known place of business.\n\n25. And Her Majesty, in consideration of the premises, hereby covenants with the Contractor, that will be paid for and in respect of the works hereby contracted for, and in the manner set out in the next clause hereof, as follows, viz.:\n\nFor the whole of the works herein contemplated as set forth, referred to and described in the hereto annexed specifications, and on the plans prepared for the purpose of these works, which said works are required to be executed to ensure the construction and completion of\n\nthe sum in the whole of thousand\n\nhundred and cents, of\n\nlawful money of Canada.\n26. Cash payments equal to about ninety per cent of the value of the work done, approximately made up from returns of progress measurements and computed at the prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this Contract, may be made to the Contractor monthly, if practicable, on the written certificate of the Architect that the work for, or on account of which the certificate was granted, has been done to his satisfaction and stating the value of such work computed as above mentioned\u2014and upon approval of such certificate by the Minister of Public Works for the time being for the Dominion of Canada, and the said certificate and such approval thereof shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to be paid the said ninety per cent or any part thereof. The remaining ten per cent shall be retained, unless otherwise ordered by the Minister, till the final completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the Chief Architect for the time being having control over the work, and within two months after such completion the remaining ten per cent will be paid. And it is hereby declared that the written certificate of the said Architect certifying that the work has been completed to his satisfaction shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to receive or be paid the said remaining ten per cent, or any part thereof.\n\n27. It is intended that every allowance to which the Contractor fairly entitled will be embraced in the Architect's monthly certificates; but should the Contractor at any time have claims of any description which he consider are not included in the progress certificates it will be necessary for him to make and repeat such claims in writing to the Architect within fourteen days after the date of each and every certificate in which he allege such claims to have been omitted.\n\n28. The Contractor in presenting claims of the kind referred to in the last clause must accompany them with satisfactory evidence of their accuracy, and the reason why he think they should be allowed. Unless such claims are thus made during the progress of the work, within fourteen days, as in the preceding clause, and repeated in writing every month, unless finally adjusted or rejected, it must be clearly understood that they shall be forever shut out, and the Contractor shall have no claims against Her Majesty.\n\n29. The progress measurements and progress certificates shall not in any respect be taken as an acceptance of the work or release of the Contractor from responsibility in respect thereof, but shall at the conclusion of the work deliver over the same in good order, according to the true intent and meaning of this contract.\n\n3. Her Majesty shall have the right to suspend operations from time to time at any particular point or points, or upon the whole of the works, and in the event of such right being exercised so as to cause any delay to the Contractor, then an extension of time due to such delay by operation, to be fixed by the Minister of Public Works shall be provided for, shall be allowed to complete the Contract, but no such delay shall vitiate or avoid this contract or any part thereof, or the obligation hereby imposed, or any concurrent or other bond or security for the performance of this Contract, nor shall the Contractor be entitled to any claim for damages by reason of any such suspension of operations. And at any time after operations have been suspended either in whole or in part such operations may be again resumed and again suspended and resumed as Her Majesty may think proper. And upon the Contractor receiving written notice on behalf of Her Majesty that the suspended operations are to be resumed the Contractor shall at once resume the operations and diligently carry on the same.\n\n31. Should the amount now voted by Parliament and applicable towards payment for the work hereby contracted for be at any time expended previous to the completion of the works the Minister of Public Works for the time being may give the Contractor written notice to that effect. And upon receiving such notice the Contractor may if think fit, stop the work\u2014but in any case shall not be entitled\nto any payment for work done beyond the amount voted and applicable as aforesaid\u2014unless and until the necessary funds shall have been voted by Parliament in that behalf. And in no event shall the Contractor have or make any claim upon Her Majesty for any damages or compensation by reason of the said suspension of payment, or by reason of any delay or loss caused by the stoppage of work.\n\n32. The Contractor shall not permit, allow, or encourage the sale of any spirituous liquors on or near the works.\n\n33. No work whatever shall at any time or place be carried on during Sunday, and the Contractor shall take all necessary steps for preventing any foreman or agent or men from working or employing others on that day.\n\n34.

That Department, I am advised, has made a rule not to entertain the claims of sub-contractors on any Government work, experience having shown that the recognition of such claims involved the Department in unending trouble without in the end making the position of the subcontractors any better. This rule cannot possibly be departed from as the agreement entered into with the contractors for the school contains the stipulation that no sub-contract for the execution of any of the work shall be recognized in any manner or form by Her Majesty, who shall not be in any way held liable for the payment of any moneys due the subcontractors.\n\nI have learned that Messrs. Harrington & Chambers have up to the present only received $11,820.00 of the total amount of the contract, which is $21,475.00, and I trust that you will yet be able to secure from the contractors full payment of the balance due by them to you.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Sept. 11th, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of August 16th file No. 133-0-5, I wish to say that we tried out more thorly the 1020 tractor and found it unsatisfactory. It did not have power enough to handle the cultivator in our light land. We therfor brought out 2866 H. P. engine and have tried it out on the different phases of our work. It is now running the corn cutter. It handles everything with entire satisfaction. And at the same time we took in the old engine for repairs.\n\nI saw the L. M. C. representative this morning, and he tells me that they have the engine apart, but have not completed the repairs. He finds that the cost will be $255.00. The arrangements with the Company was if we took the 2866 tractor, it would cost $750.00, and the old tractor. We therfor now have the option of taking this new tractor at $750.00, or waiting until the old engine is repaired and taking it back at a cost of $255.00. I am quite convinced that it would be in the interest of economy in the long run to purchase the new tractor on the terms defined.\n\nAwaiting your final word in this matter,\n\nI am yours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man.,\n\n#2.\n\nWe were anxious to find out if the drain pipes were clear, and after the water ran for the night, we found the drainage coming out in the pasture field about 20 rods below the tank. We had a man dig down to the pipe at this point, and found the tile about 7 feet in the ground and the tile continued beyond the point where we dug the hole. We found a brake in the tile where the water was coming out. It would seem from this indication that the tile beyond this point at least is plugged up.\n\nI felt that we should not go any further with work in this connection without consulting your Department, and I assume that further consideration and negotiations in connection with it will be carried on with Mr. Shillinglaw, your representative in connection with the new building.\n\nI am yours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Sept. 6th, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA short while ago a representative of the Water Power Department of the Dominion Government called on us and stated that their Department in Winnipeg had received a request from the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa to inspect the Water system and water supply on your property here, and we gave him what help we could in this connection.\n\nHe asked us to open the septic tank. We found it covered at the upper end with about 5 feet of earth. We engaged a man to dig down to the manhole, and opened up the three sections of this tank.\n\nWe found the first one filled to the top, about \u00bd of the substance in it was solids. After it was opened, it began to bulge out through the manhole, and we had as much as we could shoveled out, and then the liquid came up through the manhole and partly up in the hole we had dug. The second chamber was not quite full to the top, it contained liquid in the most part, about a foot or 18 inches heavy solids in the bottom. The third section was full to the top. We had the crust broken up, and set a man at dipping it until it was almost empty. Then the liquid burst through the obstruction and filled it to its normal level. This reduced the level in both the first and second chambers to normal. We then turned a flow of water from our water system into the sewerage drain and left it running over night, and found the tanks at normal level in the morning.\nOttawa, September 14th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to a corner stone at the Brandon Indian Residential School. Your proposal to have a private function is approved as it is improbable that The Hon. Mr. Forke would be available. It would be satisfactory to the Department to place a metal box in the wall beside the stone already ordered for the corner. At a later date, if some lettering on the outside of the stone is desirable, you may correspond with the Department.\n\nI trust that Rev. Mr. Ferrier's health will permit him to be present on the 24th instant.\n\nI have, also, your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the Dominion Water Power Branch Engineer's finding in connection with the septic tank. Please do not incur any expenditure in this connection as it is possible that the engineer in question will recommend an entirely new septic tank. The Department's officers have already discussed this with Mr. Atwood, the District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg, who will continue his investigation and will be in charge of any improvements to the sewage disposal system at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The bond of \"Anti-Hydro\" cement coating to brick, stone, concrete or cement finished surfaces is perfect, adhering permanently against any head of water.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nWATERPROOFING\u2014All interior surfaces of all exterior walls, upper surface of concrete floor slabs below grade, all pits, piers, etc., as shown on plans shall be waterproofed by the application of a plaster coat of 1 part Portland cement and 3 parts clean sand, gauged and tempered with a solution of 1 part \"Anti-Hydro\" to each 10 parts of water. Floor toppings shall be 1/2 inch thickness and shall serve the double purpose of waterproofing and a hard, dustless floor surface. Wall coatings shall be 3/8 inch thick, properly coved and bonded to the floor, and carried up to 1 foot above grade.\n\nGROUTING\u2014To insure perfect bond to underlying masonry, all surfaces, before application of \"Anti-Hydro\" mortar, shall be thoroughly roughed and cleaned and brushed with a slush or grout made by stirring Portland cement into a solution of 1 part \"Anti-Hydro\" and 3 parts water to the consistency of a heavy paint. The coating specified above shall then be applied, while the slush coat is still wet.\n\nCONSTRUCTION JOINTS\u2014Wherever possible the coatings should be made continuously until completed. Where construction joints are necessary they should be carefully cleaned and slushed with the grout described in previous paragraph before new coating or topping is applied. Care should be exercised to join the topping at a point away from the construction joint in the slab.\n\nPUMPING\u2014Where water is present in the excavation a pump of sufficient capacity to keep water below the floor shall be operated continuously while the floor and walls are being troweled and for 24 hours thereafter.\n\nIf, because of architectural treatment of interior surfaces of walls it is desirable to waterproof from the outside, the following paragraph should be substituted for the WATERPROOFING paragraph above.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nWATERPROOFING\u2014Footings of all exterior walls shall be covered with a 1\" topping of \"Anti-Hydro\" gauged mortar before walls are placed. The outside surfaces of the exterior walls shall be plastered with the same mortar from the footings to 1 foot above the grade, and the inside surface of these walls shall be plastered from the footing to the top of the floor level. The waterproof mortar shall consist of 1 part Portland cement and 2 parts clean sand, gauged and tempered with a solution of 1 part \"Anti-Hydro\" to each 10 parts of water. Wall coatings shall be 3/8 inch thick and coved and bonded to footing toppings. The upper surface of concrete floor slabs below grade shall be topped with the same waterproof mortar 1\" thick, and properly bonded to the waterproof plaster on the inside of the walls.\n\nSERVICES\u2014Information and advice on all problems of waterproofing and concrete hardening may be had from any of our offices.\n\nANTI-HYDRO WATERPROOFING CO.\nLaboratories, 265-295 Badger Ave., Newark, N.

Specifications for cement plaster are shown on a separate sheet.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nWATERPROOFING OF MASS CONCRETE\n\nAll concrete in contact with earth on one side, and such other masonry as is indicated on the plans, shall be made of 1 part Portland Cement, 2 parts sharp, washed sand, 4 parts broken stone or gravel, and shall be waterproofed throughout the mass by the addition of \"Anti-Hydro\" liquid waterproofing to the water used in gauging the concrete mixture. Not less than 1 1/2 gallons of \"Anti-Hydro\" shall be used for each cubic yard of concrete. The correct proportion of \"Anti-Hydro\" and the proper consistency of the mixture will be obtained if for each barrel of cement 1 gallon of \"Anti-Hydro\" and 10 to 15 gallons of water be used. Concrete shall in all cases be mixed without excess water. Where forms are below water level, extremely stiff mix shall be used.\n\nPUMPING\n\nWhere water is present in the excavation a pump of sufficient capacity to keep water below the forms shall be operated continuously during the pouring and for 24 hours thereafter. The earth must be so prepared that the water will easily drain under the concrete to the pump.\n\nSPADING CONCRETE\n\nAll concrete shall be thoroughly and continuously spaded during the pouring.\n\nCONSTRUCTION JOINTS\n\nWherever possible floor slabs and exterior walls and footings shall be poured continuously until completed. Where construction joints are necessary same shall be keyed with a 2\" x 2\" key. When pouring is about to be resumed the entire joint shall be treated with a slush composed of 1 part \"Anti-Hydro,\" 3 parts water, and sufficient neat cement to form a thick creamy mixture. This slush should be applied with a brush and should still be wet when followed by the new concrete.\n\nSERVICES\u2014Information and advice on all problems of waterproofing and concrete hardening may be had from any of our offices.\n\nANTI-HYDRO WATERPROOFING CO.\nLaboratories, 265-295 Badger Ave., Newark, N. J.\n\nForm 157 July 1929\nANTI-HYDRO hardens and waterproofs Concrete\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nSee Table for All Mixing Proportions\n\nIn General\nSuccessful waterproofing or hardening requires one gallon of \"ANTI-HYDRO\" for every barrel of cement used. To attain these results use a solution of \"ANTI-HYDRO\" in water or introduce directly into the mixer one quart of \"ANTI-HYDRO\" for each bag of cement while the water is being added.\n\nTo Secure A Certain Bond\nWhen continuous work from start to finish is impossible, preparation joints is important. If work is to continue over a surface or from a joint that has reached its final set, become dry or dirty, the surface must be roughed as with a pick, washed with water and thoroughly brushed over or sprayed with \"ANTI-HYDRO\" grout. The new work must cover the grout before it dries.\n\nCautions\nInsist on accurate measurement of all ingredients.\n\nUse a fairly stiff mix and not a sloppy mixture. Concrete poured too wet will not be waterproof, will set slowly and will not be hard and will never attain normal strength.\n\nConcrete must be well spaded in the forms. Don't depend on simply filling the forms.\n\nFloat and trowel well all plaster coats, floor topping, etc.\n\nUse no lime in the same mix with \"ANTI-HYDRO.\" When pouring floor surfaces, no drier should be used. The apparent need for a drier indicates that the mix was too wet.\n\nANTI-HYDRO WATERPROOFING CO.\nNEWARK NEW JERSEY\nThe Integral Method\n\nThe function of \"Anti-Hydro\" may be expressed as waterproofing cement with cement, that is, mixing the unhydrated cement with a cement solution with which it is chemically active. The pores in ordinary concrete are thus completely filled with a material of the same character as the cement itself. This integrally forms an insoluble mass which is permanently waterproof and hard through and through. The unprecedented record of \"Anti-Hydro\" success since 1904 demonstrates beyond all doubt the permanency of this method.\n\nHow It Waterproofs\n\n\"Anti-Hydro\" is a colorless liquid compound friendly to cement. When added in certain percentages to the water used in gauging Portland cement mixtures in the usual way, it accelerates the set, increases the strength, and renders the cement masonry impervious to water, moisture, frost, gas, oils, odors, etc. It chemically combines with Portland cement and excites and brings into service all the cohesive possibilities of Portland cements, which in themselves are the most efficient waterproofing mediums.\n\nFor Hard and Dustless Floors\n\nBy building hardness into concrete instead of painting it on the surface, \"Anti-Hydro\" produces dustless, adamant floors that are permanent. All of the earliest installations, now more than 25 years old, are in perfect condition today. \"Anti-Hydro\" increases the hardness of concrete at the age of three days, equal to that normally attained in one month's time.\n\nPrevents Efflorescence In Brick Mortar\n\nThe addition of \"Anti-Hydro\" to Portland cement mortars used in masonry eliminates the necessity for any other waterproofing or damp-proofing. It also helps prevent efflorescent salts coming from the mortar and staining the masonry.\n\nPrevents Disintegration\n\nWhen used in concrete \"Anti-Hydro\" positively prevents disintegration. Corrosion of the reinforcing steel with its consequent bursting of the concrete is entirely prevented. It eliminates porosity, thus excluding moisture and renders walls non-conductive. Concrete walls or cement floors made with \"Anti-Hydro\" will resist the action of sea water, as well as the action of acids and alkalis. Similarly, concrete blocks, pipe or other cement products when made with \"Anti-Hydro\" will resist local acid or alkal conditions in the soil.\n\nA Perfect Bond\n\nThe bond of \"Anti-Hydro\" coatings to brick, stone concrete, or cement-finished surfaces is so perfect that they will adhere permanently against any head of water.\n\nPrevents Freezing\n\n\"Anti-Hydro\" is almost indispensable in cold weather. One part \"Anti-Hydro\" and ten parts water used for mixing permits concreting at temperatures as low as 15 degrees F.\n\nRoad Work\n\n\"Anti-Hydro\" produces a waterproof road with a harder and more durable surface which can be opened to traffic in days, where weeks are required without it. With certain brands of Portland cement, \"Anti-Hydro\" gauged concrete road patches may be opened for traffic in 24 hours. An exceptional bond is formed with adjacent concrete.\n\nOther Uses\n\nWherever water resisting or water holding is required of cement, \"Anti-Hydro\" will prove invaluable. It has been most successfully used for waterproofing tunnels, subways, foundations, cellars, walls, pipe reservoirs, roofs, swimming pools, tanks, floors and for stucco work.\n\nSaves Its Own Cost\n\n\"Anti-Hydro\" enriches the mortars and saves the cost of trowelling, mixing and supervision. This saving in labor more than pays the cost of the \"Anti-Hydro.\"\n\nHow \"Anti-Hydro\" Is Used In Various Mixes\n\n| Cement | Sand | Stone | ANTI-HYDRO To Water | One Gallon Covers |\n|--------|------|-------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Mass Concrete | 1 | 2 | 4 | 1:10 to 1:15 | \u00bd yards |\n| Plaster Wpfg & Floor Type | 1 | 2 | - | 1:10 | 1/2-100 sq. ft. |\n| Stucco Undercoats | 1 | 3 | - | 1:10 | 80 to 100 sq. ft. |\n| Stucco Finish Coats | 1 | 3 | - | 1:10 | 80 to 100 sq. ft. |\n| Brickwork Above Grade | 1 | 2 | - | 1:10 | 100 sq. brick or 50 cu. ft. |\n| Brickwork Below Grade | 1 | 2 | - | 1:10 | 700 sq. ft. or 35 cu. ft. |\n| Acid Resistant Tank Lining | 1 | 1 grit | 1:8 | \u00bd cu. ft. | 50 to 100 sq. ft. |\n| Road Work Grout or Dmpg Paint | 1 | 2 | 4 | 1:10 | \u00bd yards |\n| | | | 1:3 | 600 ft. 1 cost |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gen'l,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe note with interest that you are about to construct an Indian industrial school at Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nNo doubt you will require waterproofing for your foundation walls and floor slabs or perhaps only in the floor toppings and wall plaster coats. Or you may have floors which must be hard and dustless and perhaps resist the action of chemicals.\n\nAnti-Hydro added to your mixing water will impart all of these qualities to cement masonry in one operation and without any extra labor cost.\n\nWhen you specify Anti-Hydro you get a product which for 25 years has been giving satisfactory results all over the world.

D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Shillinglaw, Esq.,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nMr. Attwood's wire of September 11th states that the Department of Indian Affairs consider that a gravity system from their present reservoir will provide sufficient pressure for water services in the basement and first floor.\n\nOur survey of the location shows that the elevation of the top of the reservoir is 112.4, elevation of outlet pipe from reservoir 109.4, the elevation of the basement floor will be 91.5 and the elevation of the first floor will be 102 with service outlets at an elevation of approximately 105 on the floor. Thus we will have a maximum pressure head of 112.4 - 105 or 7.4 feet on the service outlets of the first floor. This head will produce about 3.2 lbs. per square inch pressure at the service taps.\n\nIn ordinary private installations for houses the water supply usually operates under a pressure of from 20 to 40 lbs. per square inch and the lowest pressure considered serviceable is from 10 to 15 lbs. It is therefore evident that a pressure of 3.2 lbs. per square inch on the first floor at the Brandon School cannot be considered to give satisfactory results although water will flow.\n\nThe new building at Brendon is being equipped with fire hose on every floor, bath rooms are provided for on all floors and to supply these upper floors a pressure system is required.\n\nThe installation of fire protection equipment on every floor implies that fire protection is necessary and this can only be provided for by an adequate pressure system. Small pressure tanks cannot provide this protection, although they would serve to give a better service on the two upper floors. Without the installation of a good gravity tank system for water supply the situation would be that the basement would be supplied fairly adequately from gravity, the ground floor would have an unsatisfactory service and small pressure tanks would have to be installed to supply the upper two floors. No water supply for fire protection would be available.\n\nUnder these circumstances I would again strongly recommend that the water supply installation for this school be a pressure tank system to supply water to all services within the building. Nor can the prime requisites for any residential school be an adequate water supply and also a considerable measure of fire protection.\n\nI am arranging to make a thorough examination of the present septic tank system in a few days and will let you know the results at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Shillinglaw\nCorner Stone of New Indian School Laid\n\nCeremony Attended by Representative Gathering; Historical Sketch of School\n\nThirty-four years after the original building was constructed, the corner stone of the new Indian Industrial school was laid on Wednesday afternoon before a very representative gathering. The formal ceremonies were presided over by Rev. J. A. Doyle, D.D., the present head of the school, while brief addresses were given by Dr. J. W. Hilton, president of the Manitoba conference, Dr. J. H. Emerson, M.L.A., and Mayor Cater. The actual laying of the corner stone was performed by the Rev. Thompson Ferrier, former principal and superintendent of Indian schools and hospitals for the United Church. Assisting in the program were the Rev. J. A. Corbett, secretary-treasurer of mission for the Manitoba conference, Rev. R. G. Pritchard, W. H. Shillinglaw, and the Rev. D. H. Telfer, chairman of the board of directors. On the platform at the time were Mrs. Ferrier, members of the presidency and a number of ex-pupils.\n\nDuring the ceremony, splendid tribute was paid to the Rev. Thompson Ferrier for the great work accomplished by him during his long term of office, and considerable expression was taken of the training that will be conducted in the new building under the principalship of Dr. Doyle.\n\nHistory of School\n\nThe historical sketch of the school placed in the corner stone by Rev. Doyle showed that it is one of the institutions whose policy is the department of Indian affairs in providing an educational and vocational training for Indian children in Canada. The educational program is carried out in co-operation with churches which years ago commenced missionary and educational work among the Indian people.\n\nThirty-seven years ago it was decided to establish a substantial school under the care of the Methodist church, and the choice of the site here was made by the late Rev. James Woodworth and the late Rev. Alex. Sutherland. But only three years later that the school, which has just been demolished to make room for the new building, was reopened and a veteran missionary, Rev. J. Simmonds, appointed principal. He was a master of the Cree language and had years of experience in Indian work. Four years later came Mr. and thirty years ago last June, Rev. Thompson Ferrier who was then pastor of the Methodist church in Edmonton and who laid the corner stone Wednesday, was appointed head of the institution.\n\nSplendid progress in connection with the school and its 960 acre farm has been made. Much credit due to the business acumen, tact and diplomacy was paid to the Rev. Thompson Ferrier in bringing the Brandon school to such a high standard. In February last Rev. Ferrier tendered his resignation and later the Rev. Dr. Doyle was appointed in his place.\n\nMore commodious quarters were needed and the present new structure will remedy conditions. During construction the pupils had to be taken care of as numbers returned home where they could attend school for the present year, while 83 were taken to the Edmonton school. It is expected that the new school will be ready for occupation in September, 1950. I will take care of 150 pupils and as a number of other residential schools are filled to capacity there have been many who is expected that the new building will be occupied in a very short time. The number of Indian pupils seeking higher education makes it necessary that high school work be undertaken as soon as school re-opens.\nIndian Residential School\n\nR. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Sept. 28th.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe informal laying of the Corner Stone of the new Indian Residential School took place on Wednesday. I am sending you under separate cover, yesterday's copy of the Daily Sun which carries an account of the function.\n\nThe cost of the copper box in which the documents and articles were placed cost $2.75, if it is in order, I shall let this go with our tinsmith account and pay this item in our current expenses.\n\nThe face of the stone upon which lettering could be placed, is 32\" long by 12\" deep. The contractor has no one on the construction who could do this lettering. I called the marble works today, and they could do the work by bringing out an electric machine which they use. If \"1929\" alone was placed on the stone, it would cost approximately $5.00, and the cost would be in proportion to this, according to the lettering required, but $20.00 would be the limit of cost on a surface of this size.\n\nWe will await your direction as to what ought to be done.\n\nI am yours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nBrandon, Sep. 28, 1929.\n\nMr. R. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect,\nDept' of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have today received certificate forms and note you require them in duplicate. I will forward the next certificate direct to you.\n\nRe water supply into building:\nThere is a 3 in. pipe, which served the old building, now running through the new Basement. This pipe enters at \"Store room\" and runs across Kitchen and on to the barns. Unfortunately it is only about 4 ft. underground now and will have a pretty good chance of freezing up for lack of cover. If it could be run into building at Pumproom there would be less danger from frost. It should be at least 7 ft. deep.\n\nCould you take this up as the Contractor wishes to put it into shape before freezeup.\n\nThe Basement story is now practically complete.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nW.H.

(RG 10, Volume 6256, File 576-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSir:\n\nOn October 5th I made an examination of the septic tank that has been in operation at the Brandon Industrial School for at least twenty years, during which time it has never been cleaned out or opened up. The contractors recently have uncovered the opening to the tank and have done some work in trying to flush it out and latterly have tried pumping out the liquid contents. It was found that the drain from the septic tank was plugged and that the tank itself was nearly half full of solid matter in all three compartments. After being pumped as dry as was possible, it was found that the tank again became nearly half filled up with water, showing the tank itself to be in bad condition and leaking. In speaking with Dr. Boyce, Principal of the Industrial School, he stated he had met a man who was engaged about twenty years ago on the construction of the septic tank. This man stated that they had encountered springs in the excavation for the tank and that great trouble was experienced in pouring the concrete for the chambers because of these springs and that a very poor job was made.\n\nThe septic tank in its present condition is practically useless and it is considered uneconomical to reconstruct it or to use the present site for another septic tank owing to the presence of the springs referred to above. It is therefore our intention to construct an entirely new septic tank, identical in size and character with that constructed for the Cecilia Jeffrey School at Kenora. Boring are to be taken so as to secure a location as close to the old site as possible, but yet be free from the presence of springs. If weather conditions permit, it is planned to complete the work this fall, the work to be done on a cost plus basis by the general contractor for the new school under direction of this office and under the personal supervision of the inspector at the school.\n\nWill you please let me know at as early a date as possible whether this meets with the approval of yourself and the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

This does not include any motors.\n\nI took the matter up with Mr. Gow of the Water Power Department, and they say that they have no authority from the Department of Indian Affairs regarding this matter. And that I would have to take it up with you. If you cannot sanction this you had better wire the Department, as the Star Electric man is on the job. Also this should be done while the walls are open, that is it should be done before the plastering is done.\n\nKindly advise me on this matter at the earliest possible date in order that I can have the work proceeded with.\n\nKindly return the Star Electric letter for my file.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

He has asked me to write you in regard to this as to your wish in the matter. He informs me that it will cost six cents per lineal foot extra to run a cove base.\n\nI have suggested to him and the terrazzo contractor that it would save considerable time in laying terrazzo if they put in the cove base and would be to the advantage of the floor layer if he did this himself but the suggestion to the terrazzo man did not bear fruit.\n\nI expect they will commence on this floor about Thursday next and if you will let me know by return mail it will be in time.\n\nThere are now seven plasterers on the job and the top floor is partly first coated and some of it second coated.

(RG 10, Volume 6256, File 576-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nREPORT ON SOFT WATER SUPPLY FOR BRANDON INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL.\n\nAn analysis made by the National Testing Laboratories, Winnipeg, of a sample of the water supply for the new Industrial School at Brandon shows a total hardness of 341 parts per million or 23.87 grains of hardness per Imperial gallon. This analysis shows that while the water is good for drinking purposes it must be classified as very hard water. Mr. A. Blackie, President of the National Testing Laboratories, and also City Chemist of the City of Winnipeg states that this water corresponds very closely in total hardness to the water in use in Winnipeg prior to the completion of the Greater Winnipeg Water Aqueduct from Shoal Lake. It is also stated that it is not as hard as the present water supply in the City of Brandon.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, has requested a recommendation as to the advisability of installing a water softener or constructing a rain water tank to supply soft water to the building. In view of the degree of hardness, 23.87 grains per gallon, shown by the analysis made of a sample of the water supply it would be desirable and advantageous to those entrusted with the\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector, Dominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\noperation of the school to have available an adequate supply of soft water. Officials of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa will necessarily have to decide whether or not the extra expenditure required to obtain an ample soft water supply is warranted. To assist them in making their decision there is outlined below what is involved in securing an adequate supply of soft water at the school and the cost of same.\n\nThe present water supply system of the Brandon School was designed for a daily requirement of 5,000 gallons, this amount including the water supply to the barns and staff residences. However, the anticipated daily requirements within the school building itself will approximate 4,000 gallons. It is further estimated that 75 percent of this amount, or 3,000 gallons, will be required for service connections in the basement of the building, the remaining 1,000 gallons being required for the floors above. The basement connections include the kitchens, laundry, children's showers and toilets, the boilers and hot water heaters and also the water supply to the barns. This basement water supply is a gravity system operating under a head of approximately 16 feet, the source of supply being a 12,000 gallon reservoir located 540 feet from the building and fed by springs. The water supply for the floors above the basement is furnished by a pressure tank system. This system consists of a 2 h.p. motor direct connected on the same shaft to a 1,000 gallons per hour Typhoon pump which is connected to a 1,200 gallon cylindrical tank. This pressure in this tank can be varied but ordinarily will operate between\n40 and 80 pounds, automatic regulation being obtained by means of an automatic pressure regulator.\n\nSoft water is preferable for use in the laundry, kitchens, baths, washrooms and boilers and these services alone will require about 2,000 gallons daily. This supply cannot be obtained by the construction of a rain water tank and depending upon the water collected from the roof of the school building. The total area covered by the building approximates 10,000 square feet, the average yearly rainfall at Brandon is 13 inches, so that the quantity of rainfall that could be collected yearly would not exceed 68,000 gallons, or less than 200 gallons per day.\n\nWater softeners are all based upon the principle of removing the grains of hardness by forcing the water through a thick mineral bed and periodically regenerating the mineral bed by the addition of salt. The size of the plant and the cost depends upon the quantity of soft water required, the quantity of hardness to be removed and the frequency of regeneration. Manufacturers of water softeners will not guarantee satisfactory results, nor will they recommend their products unless the water is fed to the softener at a pressure of at least 25 pounds.\n\nAt the new Brandon School the services for which softened water is desired are supplied from the gravity supply system. This system operates under an approximate head of 16 feet or a pressure of about 6.5 pounds per square inch. The installation of a water softener under these conditions will not give satisfactory results and cannot be recommended. To install a water softener and obtain a pressure of at least 25 pounds on the feed to\nthe water softener as required by the manufacturers, it will be necessary to do away with the existing gravity system and connect the whole water supply to the building with the pressure tank system. This would involve changing some pipe connections between the pump, the pressure tank and the water supply pipes to the building. This could quite easily be done and would not be an expensive switch. It would also be necessary to lay a new line of 1\" piping between the intake pipe in the pump room through the building to the south west corner of the same in order to complete the gravity system to the barns, since it is not proposed to soften this water.\n\nAs installed the pumping costs for domestic water supply in the school would be approximately 12 cents per day as it is only necessary to pump 1,000 gallons per day. If the whole system is changed to the pressure tank system it will be necessary to pump 4,000 gallons daily at a cost of about 48 cents per day. These costs are based on a power cost of 8 cents per kilowatt hour, the existing rate at Brandon.\n\nManufacturers Agents in Winnipeg were requested to submit proposals recommending the type of softener required and the cost of the same F.O.B. Brandon. Only one proposal has as yet been received, this being from the Ward-Love Pump Corporation of Rockford, Illinois, through their agents in Winnipeg, Cranes, Limited. They recommend the installation of their D30 - 42S Crane Warlo Water Softening Plant, the cost being $1,800.00 F.O.B. Brandon. This softener would require regenerating about every three days, each regeneration taking about 45 minutes.\nduring which interval the water supply to the school would be shut off. This inconvenience could, however, be overcome by installing their double unit for which no quotation was given. It would be possible by means of interconnecting piping and installation of valves to retain the gravity water supply system for maintaining a continuous water supply during the periods of regeneration.\n\nThe floor space occupied by the softener is 4'6\" by 7' and the headroom required is 7'6\". Delivery could be made in from two to four weeks. The cost of installing, changing over from the gravity to pressure tank system, together with the cost of the softener would amount to approximately $2,150.00. Installation can be made in the pump room of the school building.\n\nIn conclusion it might be pointed out that if soft water is required the only satisfactory method of procuring the same is by means of the installation of a water softening plant. This plant will not give satisfactory results if connected up with the present gravity system because of the low pressure. The whole water supply for the school building can readily be changed to the pressure tank system with but little expense and if this is done a satisfactory and adequate water softening plant can be installed for $2,150.00. The elimination of the gravity water supply system will increase the cost of pumping about 36 cents per day, which increase will be more than repaid by savings effected in the laundry and kitchen. The water softening plant could be installed at any time, now or after completion of the building, but in the case of the latter the cost would be slightly increased as the installation and changes in piping would necessitate some\nredecorating.\n\nAssistant District Chief Engineer.\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nJanuary 22, 1930.\nJanuary 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of December 17th last regarding the water supply at the new Indian school at Brandon, Manitoba, I enclose herewith a report received from our District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg with reference to the advisability of installing a water softener or constructing a rain water tank to supply soft water to the building.\n\nYou will note that the report recommends the installation of a water softening plant at an estimated cost of $2,150., it being calculated that the rainfall which would be collected would not be sufficient to provide a supply for the necessary service at the school.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nFebruary 5th, 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nI have your letter of the 31st regarding Mr. Gow's report on the advisability of installing the water softener at the new Brandon school, and requesting my views as to the installation of the water softener at the present time.\n\nAccording to the chemical analysis made, the water at the Brandon school is hard water. However, it is the same source of supply that has been used in the old Brandon school for a number of years, and unless your Department has in the past had complaints regarding the hardness of the water, I do not see why it should not be continued in the past. One of the main features of the water supply to the new school was the matter of supplying water to the laundry, kitchen, showers and toilets in the basement, or probably eighty percent of the total water requirements of the school, by a gravity feed system, thus eliminating a great expense in the cost of pumping to provide a pressure system.\n\nWhile the gravity system should provide ample water to meet the requirements of the school and the equipment supplied in the basement of the school, the pressure on this gravity system is not sufficient to operate a water softener. When inquiries were made of the firms supplying water softeners and it was found that these could not be operated on the low pressure of the gravity system, Mr. Gow and myself in discussing this matter both agreed that the installation of a water softener might well be left in abeyance for a time in order to determine whether or not a softener was an actual necessity.\n\nMy own views in this regard are to continue the installation of the water system as originally planned and to omit the installation of the water softening equipment for the present. The increased cost of installing a softener at a later date would in any event be a small item and need not be considered at the moment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. H.

Gurney Orr,\nArchitect,\nDep't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Indian Residential School, Brandon.\n\nI am enclosing you a list of Lighting Fixtures selected by Dr. Doyle and myself when in Winnipeg last month. These were provided for under the $700.00 item in the Specification and the numbers are from Northern Electric Catalogue.\n\nYou will note that all fixtures, lamps, etc., amount to $637.36 and an additional item of 19 extra plugs, $76.00 making a total of $713.36. The Contractor is covering the entire list for $700.00.\n\nDr. Doyle wished to have these plugs in certain rooms and as there were no outlets for them we arranged to have these plugs combined with switches on the same plate.\n\nI trust this will be satisfactory to you and will have your approval.\n\nI am not going over every day this month.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gunney Orr, Esq.,  \nArchitect,  \nDept. of Indian affairs,  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRE: Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nOn page 59, Paragraph 12. of the Specifications, calls for \"Best quality burlap shall be provided in all corridors, passages and stairways. Burlap shall be provided three feet high.\" This specification covers walls composed of studding, lath and plaster, with wood base. The present walls are tile and plaster with a cement base.\n\nWould it not make an incomplete job to place burlap on the present walls? Would it not be better to paint the plastered walls in place of applying burlap.\n\nI took this matter up with Mr. Shillinglaw, but he thought I might better take the matter up with you direct.\n\nAwaiting your early reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. H. SIMMONS.\n\nPer\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6256, File 576-5, part 4)\nMarch 15, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Shillinglaw,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter which I have received from Mr. Simmons with reference to burlap. It is not my intention that burlap shall be installed on the walls where we have used tile partitions, and it will therefore be satisfactory if the walls, corridors, etc., to the height of three feet are painted as suggested by Mr. Simmons.

Gurney Orr,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Indian Residential School.\n\nThere appears to be some misapprehension as to who was to order the Extractor and Washer which were not in the contract.\n\nMr. Yates is under the impression they would be ordered by the Department and sent here. I understood he was to order them as an extra on the Plumbers work but he has not done so.\n\nAs there appears to be some doubt about it I thought it advisable to refer it to you before instructing him to order them.\n\nThe plasterers will be out of the building this week and the other work is following them up closely.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It also makes it necessary to bank the house well in the cold weather in order to keep things in the cellar from freezing.\n\nThe studs supporting the cribbing have rotted at the foot and in a number of places the cribbing is giving way, and the earth coming into the coal bin end passage.\n\nThe mainposts supporting the house are also decayed, so that the house is settled in some places seriously. There is a 2 and a \u00bd inch drop in the living room, and in the kitchen the floor drops 5 inches in 8 feet.\n\nThe cellar is always wet. Commencing about February a spring broke out in front of the furnace and has been running constantly since.\n\nThe furnace fire pot is cracked, but may do through another winter.\n\nThroughout the house the hardness has gone out of the plaster. One can shove a screwdriver into it anywhere, and in many places it is only held up by the wall paper, and in one room strips of cotton were used over the cracks in the plaster before the last wall paper was put on. The pulverized plaster is constantly coming done around the burlap in both the living room and hall.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nVERY POOR COPY\nBrandon, April 4, 1930.\n\nMr. R.

Ward,\nDeputy Minister of Labour,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThe latter part of December 1929 and the early part of this year 1930 I was working on the Brandon Indian School, Brandon, for Mr. L. Boaz, 478 St. Jean Baptiste, St. Boniface, Manitoba, plastering contractor. I have only received ($3.80) three dollars and eighty cents from him my first pay for Dec. 20th. Then for the next two (2) weeks I have never been paid as you will see by the account. Mr. Boaz ignores all letters and I cannot get in touch with him in any way, nor can the general contractor who has paid me all monies excepting for the two weeks for which I am sending account. This account he refuses to pay. I feel he is responsible for this as general contractor. Would you kindly advise me as to whom I should go as this is a Dominion Government job. Mr. Simmons address is:- 506 Confederation Life Bldg., Main St., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThanking you for your attention. I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Morris Kennedy.\nOttawa,\nApril 22, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nEnclosed herewith is a copy of a letter which has been received in the Department of Labour from Mr. Morris Kennedy of Toulon, Man., in which he refers to his employment as a plasterer's helper on the Brandon Indian School and states that he has not received payment in full for his work while employed by a subcontractor, Mr. L. Boaz of 478 St. Jean Baptiste, St. Boniface, Manitoba. Would you be good enough to have this matter brought to the attention of the general contractor in order that any amounts which may be owing to this workman shall be paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

I include herewith their statement. Whatever you decide to do in this connection this year will be appreciated.\n\nI am,\n\nyours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nOttawa, May 7, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with enclosure, with reference to the cars in use at the Brandon Indian Residential School. In reply I have to state that it is the general practice for the management to make replacement of cars, agricultural machinery, etc., from the per capita grant or other school earnings. At the present time, the school is not receiving a regular grant and your inquiry was properly addressed to the Department this year. As our funds are extremely low, I regret that authority for the trade-in cannot be granted. After the school is on per capita grant and farm receipts are good, it is hoped that it may be possible for you to make replacement, without reference to the Department. The enclosure is returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nR. Gurney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nThe Brandon Indian Residential School has been completed since April 21st. My foreman turned the keys over to Dr. Doyle, but officially the building has not been taken over. In order to protect myself I had to renew the insurance again today. When will the building be taken over?\n\nI forwarded to Mr. Shillinglaw some time ago the bills for extras and additional work, which I hope he has forwarded to you long before this date.\n\nI am anxious to have the building taken over in order to cut out the extra expense of insurance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. H. SIMMONS.\n\nPer. [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6256, File 576-5, part 4)\nMay 15, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Simmons,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the Brandon School I note that the building was completed on April 21st. I expected to be in Brandon before this, but owing to pressure of work here have been unable to make the trip. I have today written to Mr. Shillinglaw instructing him to issue final certificate on your contract on the 21st of May, which will be 30 days after date of completion. He has also been instructed to take over the building from you for the Department.\n\nA telegram was sent you today advising that it will be satisfactory to apply your security cheque held in connection with the Brandon School on your tender for the Blue Quills School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nJ. H. Simmons, Esq.,\n506 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMay 15, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have been advised by Mr. Simons that his contract for the Brandon School was completed on April 21st. It will therefore be in order for you to issue a final certificate on Mr. Simons' contract on May 21st. The amount of this certificate should be made up of the balance due, including any extra work and the 10% which has been held back. I would also ask you to please accept the building from Mr. Simons for the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H.

May add that this is no reflection on Mr. Simmons, the Contractor, and we are extremely sorry to have to do so, but we could not get anywhere with Mr. Boux, The Plasterer, and to protect ourselves we found it necessary to put this lien on.\n\nWe are simply drawing this to your attention in case you might not be acquainted with the fact when making final settlement.

It was organized in 1914 by about 100 members, it obtained the use of the Victoria Museum for its productions. The lecture hall where the lectures have been given, the lecture hall was destroyed by fire, and its present location is the House of Commons, in consequence of which it has not been available for other purposes. The league presented four productions in 1915-16 at the Russell Theatre.

Gurney Orr,\nArchitect,\nDept' of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Indian Residential School, Brandon.\n\nIn accordance with the instructions of May 13th from the Department of Indian Affairs, I am enclosing the Final Estimate on this contract together with all accounts for Extras and Additional work done by Mr. Simmons.\n\nI understand from Mr. Simmons that he discussed with you certain items when in Ottawa and which are included in these statements, such as Pumping Water, Front Entrance Stairs and some other details.\n\nReferring to Summary No.1:\n\nItem No.1 - This work was required to be done on account of the soil conditions under portions of the outer wall footings, to loose material and soft soil under some of the columns and portions of the interior wall footings.\n\nNo.2 - On the removal of old concrete floors, old drains, etc., some portions required refilling to grade. It was considered advisable to use gravel for this refilling.\n\nNo.8 - I instructed the Contractor to have these hung to permit of putting up and removing transom storm sash. It will also allow of ventilation if they do not wish to open windows.\n\nNo.9 - Mr. Simmons claims that this was not provided for in the change from wood to concrete and steel construction. Cement floors in rooms in main portion of the building have been painted for which no charge is made.\n\nNo.10 - The plans shew 6 in. C.I. columns which were changed to 6 in. H columns on approved steel plans. These columns did not look good in the Diningroom and I had him encase them in plaster forming them round.\n\nNo.11 - On account the possible filling in behind the Boiler and Pumproom wall to form a road I had the waterproofing carried up 8 ft. above grade.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6256, File 576-5, part 4)\nReferring to Summary No.2.\n\nItem No.3 - This was done to ascertain if old tank was in a condition for future use but it was leaking and later abandoned for a new tank.\n\nNo.4 These swings had to be removed for disposal of earth from excavation and it was also desired to erect them in a new location.\n\nNo.7 - No mention of light or power is made in specification or plans for Projection Room and the Contractor claims he is entitled to an extra for this.\n\nThe above explanatory notes cover items which were not otherwise provided for.\n\nI have checked these items as closely as possible and the work and materials have been done and provided. I have included the amounts in the Certificate but have not certified to the individual items. I have informed Mr. Simmons that the extras are subject to your criticism of any items you may consider are not correct and on which you may require further information. Should you require further explanation or information of any items please let me know and I will give it to you.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Shillinglaw, Esq.,  \nInspector, Indian School,  \n108 Strand Block,  \nBrandon, Man.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRE: Accounts of A. R. McDiarmid Ltd. and Lane & Co. -vs- L. Boux.\n\nI am in receipt of yours of the 26th inst. RE; the above mentioned parties. In reply may state as follows:-\n\nL. Boux, plastering contractor, Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man. has no monies due him, but has been over paid the sum of $1,577.01 on his contract. This over payment is accounted for by me having to pay all plasterers and plasterers laborers wages direct to the men from December 21st, 1929 to the completion of the work.\n\nIt was necessary for me to take over the payment of the plasterers direct or they would have quit the work on account of not having received their wages from L. Boux. If I had advanced any money to Boux to pay wages, it is doubtful if the men would have received same.\n\nAs there is no money due L. Boux, who owes Messrs. A. R. McDiarmid Ltd. $962.60 and Messrs. Lane & Co. $260.80 I do not see how I can be held liable for these accounts.\n\nHowever I am satisfied to have the Department, when making final settlement, deduct the amount of these two accounts and hold same under protest, until such time that a proper settlement has been arrived at with these parties.\n\nRE: C. M. Kennedy, Laborer -vs- L. Boux.\n\nFurther to our conversation when in Brandon, I have paid C. M. Kennedy, Laborer the sum of $38.25 in settlement of his claim against L. Boux. Enclosed find his receipt.\n\nTrusting that this will clear the way in order to have my Final estimate put through immediately,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS/L.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Some equipment also has come in.\n\nThe wash-basins in the boys and girls wash-rooms have been used to some extent by the working men, and it is the consensus of opinion on the part of the members of the staff and others that there should be a splash-board placed the full length of the rows of basins, and between the two rows so that the dirty water would run back into the basins rather than splash down on the piping etc. below the basins. There is also need of soap dishes to accommodate these basins. I have therefore asked McDowell & Co. of this city to quote a price on this equipment, and I inclose herewith their statement.\n\nThe soap dishes would be bolted at the peak of this splash board, the iron extending about an inch above the peak, and the one pair of bolts would accommodate the two soap-dishes for the pairs of bowles.\n\nIf the installing of these splash-boards meets with your approval, we will instruct this Firm to put them in at once.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am, yours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe Brandon Industrial School\n\nAs no doubt you are aware, we have filed a lien for the sum of $962.50 against the above mentioned property, covering materials supplied to L. Boux, who was a sub-contractor to Mr. J.H. Simmons for plastering, etc.\n\nWe would advise that this lien has not as yet been satisfied by either Mr. Boux or Mr. Simmons, both of whom are responsible. We would appreciate your advice as to how you are handling this matter, whether you are remitting us direct or whether you are making arrangements with Mr. Simmons to take care of this amount; as we are anxious to have this matter cleaned up at as early a date as possible and we shall be glad to have your advice as to what course you are taking. We shall be pleased to furnish you or Mr. Simmons with a discharge of the Mechanic's lien immediately on receipt of remittance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.R.

Boax of 478 St. Jean Baptiste, St. Boniface, Manitoba. Mr. Brown's letter requested that this matter be brought to the attention of the general contractor in order that any amounts which might be owing to the workmen might be paid.\n\nTo-day the Department is in receipt of a further letter from Mr. Kennedy stating that his claim has not yet been adjusted nor has he had any word from the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nI would therefore be glad to know how the matter stands at this time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

Please arrange with Mr. Cuff, of Christie's Limited, to have the pole lengthened 25 ft. Then, you will please properly install it in cement, seeing that no unnecessary expense is incurred. Christie's account, in duplicate, for the pole complete and for one flag, which was purchased, should be forwarded to Ottawa for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nMemorandum:\n\nWhen I was at Brandon, there were three matters that were brought to my attention, which should be referred to you.\n\nThere was no flagpole or suitable place to fly a flag for the opening, so I got Christies Limited, of Brandon, to temporarily place a 40 ft. steel pole in front of the building. If the pole remains in its present position, it would have to be lengthened at least 20 or 25 ft. It might be better to install it on the building. What do you advise?\n\nIn order to protect the root house from slipping any farther and opening up any larger cracks, I understand filling should be placed at the back of the building, up to the top of the cement, which is waterproof. Would you please give instructions in this connection, indicating what type of fill would pack the best.\n\nThe large stock barn is in need of early attention. The interior surfaces of the cement wall, which is approximately 10 ft. high, are rapidly deteriorating, with the result that chunks are falling down or can be picked off with the fingers. Mr. Shillinglaw states that it is very difficult to get good gravel for cement work at Brandon and he blames the present condition on the hear frost, which adheres about an inch thick all winter long on this interior surface. It was suggested that an air space be left and a cheap brick be used for a new surface, but this would be very expensive. Something should be done without delay, for the cement has been eaten away to a depth of 3 inches in places.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The amount of $180.00 is his commission for purchasing and handling these machines making his charge $1980.00. This is the usual 10 percent charge for such service unless some special arrangement is made. I had him attach Stanley Brock receipted bill to his account for your information. Perhaps I should have had him show the 10 percent commission separately on his account which would have been clearer.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nW.H. Shillinglaw\nBrandon, Man. June 18, 1930.\n\nMr. R.

The photographer did not take enough plates with him to get interiors but I will get them again. The weather has not been good here for outside photography on account of wind, rain, etc., until this week which accounts for the delay in getting them.\n\nWe had about 5 in. of rain here last week and it left the ground around the School in a pretty soft condition and muddy and does the same after every rain with the result that a large amount of mud is carried into the building.\n\nOn account of this Dr. Doyle and I thought it better to lay some gravel where necessary and doing some necessary grading to better conditions around the building until final decision is made as to the grounds.\n\nThe old roothouse is showing some tendency to move downhill and to prevent any mishap we are doing some extra filling at the rear of the school to hold the bank in place. I trust the above will meet with your approval.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. Doyle appears to think his own staff will be able to do this work in spare time.\n\nRe Stock Barn.\n\nI have examined these walls and they are in a very poor condition. On two sides and west end there is very little of the surface which is not more or less scaled off, in a good many places to a depth of two to three inches and an occasional place to at least 4 inches. Where this scaling has taken place, and this will cover about 75 per cent of the wall surface, the surface is in poor condition to receive a coat of cement and I am doubtfull if it would stay on any length of time. It would be useless to attempt to fill up the deep places. I attempted to get a photo of this wall with poor success but the enclosed one will give you some idea of its appearance. The whole wall in this photo is scaled and at points marked X is 2 to 4 in. deep. I am going to have another examination of it and try to form some idea of the cost of the work and will advise you further before doing anything.\n\nI trust this will be satisfactory to you.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDept' of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Barn,-Indian Residential School, Brandon.\n\nReferring to your letter of Aug. 2 and my reply of Aug. 7 regarding Barn.\n\nI have gone over this wall again with the plasterer I would employ to do the work. He considers he can make a reasonably good job of this cement plastering but will not undertake to put on a greater thickness than one inch of cement mortar as it will not hold. I agree with this. This will leave the wall uneven.\n\nThe proposal is to clean off all loose concrete and thoroughly brush and wash the surface then apply a brush coat of neat cement to form a bond with old concrete. This to be followed with a coating of cement mortar composed of one part Portland cement to two parts sand and waterproofed with Pudlo Waterproofing Powder mixed with the mortar.\n\nPractically the whole of the north and west walls and approximately onehalf of the south wall will require plastering, or approximately 210 sq.yds. I do not think that this can be done for less than $1.50 per sq.yd.and be at all satisfactory. I am not at all satisfied that the results will be what I would call permanent on account of the old concrete providing a poor base for bond. On good sound concrete I would not be afraid of good results.\n\nThis will probably answer your purpose until something more permanent is decided on.\n\nI thought it better to let you have this information before going to any expense and if you will advise of your decision I can have the work done at once.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nW.H.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, requesting that a mangle be supplied for use in the laundry at the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I regret to inform you that the Department has no funds available at the present time to provide the amount required in the purchase of a mangle.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Doyle.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE: Kelvinator equipment for Industrial School \u2014 Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nWe are pleased to submit prices and specifications of the units required to do the work efficiently, with a 40 degree difference of temperature, namely, if the average temperature in the basement were 75 degrees Fahrenheit, the units specified below would pull the temperature in the box down to 35 degrees quite easily, with a small reserve in case the weather became extremely hot.\n\nThese prices include equipment fully installed in the Institution with our guarantee behind them.\n\n- Equipment required -\n\n2 #4108 Single Coils @ $90.75 .............. $181.50\n2 Drip Trays @ $12.50 ......................... $25.00\n1 F30 Compressor .................................. $401.50\nInstallation, Tubing and Freight ............... $655.00\n\nTrusting we shall be favored with orders to place this equipment in the near future, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nImperial Motors Limited,\n\nFrank Donnelly\nManager.\n\nNEW AUTOMATIC\nISO-THERMIC TUBES FOR FASTER FREEZING\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Sept. 17, 1930\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe find it quite impossible to keep the cold room in the basement sufficiently cool for the food stuffs which are kept in it. We keep a tub of ice in it constantly but this is not very effective as the doors have to be opened so frequently. The Imperial Motors Limited of this City offered to install a Kelvinator Equipment for $565.00 and I enclose their statement herewith. It may be, however, that your architect has in mind some cheaper and yet effective way of overcoming this difficulty.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\nOttawa, September 23rd, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, relative to the installation of Kelvinator equipment in the Brandon Indian Residential School, and enclosing a quotation for this work.\n\nIn reply I regret to inform you that the Department has no funds available at the present time to provide the expenditure required for the above purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Another man was out this morning with the man who came before and they both declare that it is unsafe to go on with the furnace as it is. A new fire pot will cost $5 in Winnipeg. I am now writing for authority to have this repair made. I had hoped it would do over winter but these men are very emphatic that the risk of continuing is very great.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the installing of a new fire pot in the furnace at the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of the purchase and installation of a new fire pot.

In some cases the wall is becoming quite dented.\n\nThe stop required is one that screws into the door. The metal one with a rubber tip which would be suitable comes at $4.00 a Dozen.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., April 29th, 1931\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYesterday Mr. Ames, formerly of Ames & Baker of this City, called to enquire if we desired to disposed of the Windmill and Derrick and I told him I would write you immediately.\n\nThe windmill is not in use now and I cannot see that any emergency might arise which would make it practicable to use it. In very windy weather when the wind is from the north, especially, the mill continues to turn a good deal and the derrick is leaning out of plumb to the south. Mr. Ames says the most he could offer is $35.00.\n\nIt seems to me as it is deteriorating in value it would be best to dispose of it. If this meets with your approval I would be glad if you could see fit to add this amount to the $175.00 you have set apart to be spent this year on the fixing up of the grounds around the School.\n\nI might say that we have our teams busy whenever possible doing some necessary grading at the west side of the School and at the back.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nOttawa, May 5, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, requesting authority to dispose of the windmill and derrick at the Brandon Indian Residential School. It is noted that this equipment is of no further use and that you have received an offer of $35 for same.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging for the sale of the windmill and derrick, and you may utilize the proceeds in fixing up the grounds around the school building. It will not be necessary, in accounting for the expenditure which you were authorized to incur in the fixing up of the grounds, to account for the proceeds received from the sale of the windmill and derrick.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 12th, 1931\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter ten months of occupation of this splendid new School and doing our best to care for food stuffs we find that some sort of a cooling system or frigidaire equipment is necessary for the store room for food. This room as you know, while insulated with four inches of cork has no means of either ventilation or keeping the air cool. Placing a tub of ice in the room has practically no effect, as it can only be placed near the floor and the air does not circulate.\n\nWhen Dr. Scott was here last autumn he asked me to get estimates on the cost of frigidaire equipment and submit the same to the Department. And that he would urge that this matter receive attention immediately after the opening of the new fiscal year. I have secured tenders from the Imperial Motors of this City and also of Mitchell's Hardware Limited and enclose them herewith.\n\nTrusting that it will be possible to give us help in this connection,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nEnc.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 12th, 1931\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen Dr. Scott made his visit to this institution last Fall he looked over the Principal's residence and while doubtful if anything could be done this year on account of the prospective scarcity of money he asked me to have a sketch made of the house I thought would be suitable and forward the same to the Department.\n\nI talked this matter over with the architect Mr. Shillinglaw, and we looked over a great number of plans and he made a sketch which I enclose herewith. This house only has six rooms, apart from the sunroom, sleeping porch and a small sewing room and is nothing like the size of our present house but I think will meet the requirements splendidly.\n\nWhen the Department decides to go ahead with this building we will have other suggestions to make in regard to this or a similar plan.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, May 19, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a sketch of a house that is desired as a principal's residence at the Brandon Indian Residential School. This will be placed on file and will be given consideration when funds are available for the building.\n\nI have also your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to frigidaire equipment for the food stores at the Brandon School. The appropriation for improvements at Indian schools was so seriously cut, that the Department will have to postpone consideration until it is determined whether or not a supplementary estimate is to be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., June 21, 1931\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen the old school building was being wrecked about two years ago the bell was broken in getting it down and since opening the new school we have tried to get along without the use of a big bell but we find it very unsatisfactory. I am, therefore, herewith applying for a big bell to be placed somewhere on the building.\n\nI have consulted Christie's as to the size of bell usually sold for purposes of this kind and find that bell #24 on page 58 of their Catalogue #40 is recommended by them. And that is approximately the size of our old bell. The price is $48.50. There would be some additional expense for material to build a suitable tower in which to house it. But I think the work on this would be done by our mechanic with the assistance of the boys.\n\nThe advisability of placing the bell in front of the school just within the oval, which we contemplate laying out will also be considered. The cost of placing it there would be a little greater as a cement platform should be made on which to erect the frame for it.\n\nAwaiting your reply and direction,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nOttawa, June 30, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, requesting that a bell be supplied for the use of the Brandon Indian Residential School and giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn reply I have to regret that we have no funds this year to provide for the cost of this equipment and will, therefore, be unable to authorize the purchase of a bell.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. A.

Even at that we are without water in the upstairs of the Principal's residence part of the time.\n\nThis condition is in keeping with the water supply reported all over the country and we are hoping that abundant rains will before long relieve this scarcity.\n\nAwaiting your authority and direction re going ahead with this work,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Aug. 6th, 1931\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe reservoir at the spring which gives us our water supply for the houses, school and barns demands serious attention. Both the south and the west walls in the west chamber have cracked down the centre and are bulging in. The west wall has come in about five inches at the centre. I had the Brandon Heating & Plumbing Co. bring out a man yesterday to examine it and it is very evident that something should be done at once.\n\nThese men advise and I think their advice is sound, that the only thing that can be done is to dig the earth away from these two walls, and put in a re-enforced concrete wall on the outside. That would mean two walls approximately 10 X 10 X 9 and 10 inches thick. They place the approximate cost of this work at $125.00. We would use the gravel from our own pit, which I think is satisfactory for work of this kind.\n\nWe think this work should be done as soon as possible for if a heavy rainfall should come within the next few weeks and the water should fill up our tank and therefore the gravel field surrounding the tank, it would be impossible to do this work satisfactorily. If on the other hand rain does not come and the tank therefore stands nearly empty a good deal of the time, it will cave in all the sooner.\n\nThe water supply from this source is not yet adequate to supply the school and other buildings, as I stated in a previous letter we have made a connection between the\nOttawa, August 11, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, reporting on the condition of the reservoir which supplies water for the houses, school and barns at the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may incur an expenditure not exceeding approximately $125 in having the work mentioned by you carried out in placing this reservoir in good condition. The school staff should give any assistance they can in carrying out the work.\n\nAfter the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of any materials required and for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We did not have scales on which to weigh them and as I was anxious to commence this record as they returned from holidays I secured suitable scales the other day through the Johnson's Hardware. This was a $24.00 scale which I purchased for $16.00, with a Government guarantee. I would have waited and consulted you in this matter but the condition of some of the pupils returning made me desirous of getting this work under way at once. Unless I am otherwise instructed by you I will have this item charged to the Capital account.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\nOttawa, August 24, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIt is noted, from your letter of the 18th instant, that, on the recommendation of the medical officers, you recently purchased a set of scales to assist you in recording the weight, height and general health of the pupils. It is also noted that you were able to secure these scales at a cost of $16, and payment for same will be made upon receipt of a properly certified account, in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We are also reducing the number of pens for hogs and providing additional space for cattle. We do not require any new lumber for this but a quantity of nails and some paint. We are also fixing up what was to be a gymnasium above the shop for handicraft, fretwork and athletic games. It had been re-arranged when part of the old building was torn down for sleeping quarters. We also need some athletic equipment.

This you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nRegarding the athletic equipment, the Department does not provide or pay for 5 or 5 pound shot, and if you require this equipment you should pay for same from per capita allowances or other receipts of the school.\n\nA basketball will be ordered here and sent to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., August 9, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to write you in regard to the Recreation Room on the boys side of the Residential School here. The walls on the West and South sides and part of the East side were finished with metal lath and plaster. The wall on the North side and part of the East side was plastered right on the brick. Where the metal lath was used, the plaster has crumbled off to a great extent and to some extent the metal lath has given way and the room is therefore in a bad and unsightly condition.\n\nI had Mr. E. C. Higgins looking at it the other day, and he suggests that the only satisfactory way of repairing it will be to plaster up the broken places and line the room where the metal lath is used with v-joint to the height of a little over four feet.\n\nWe also find that the plaster on this room also on the bathroom, lavatory, and lockerroom and the small entrance to the dining room are getting discolored and cannot be washed to get good satisfaction. We believe that when the walls are repaired these rooms should be painted so that they can be washed satisfactorily. Mr. Higgins estimates the cost of this work as follows: Repairing plaster $16.00; Lining with v-joint $45.00; Painting $225.00. Total $286.00.\n\nHis Excellency, the Lieutenant Governor is making an official visit to Brandon on October 7. A visit to our School is included in his programme and I would like to have this repair work done before his visit takes place. I am enclosing Mr. Higgins letter.\n\nAwaiting your direction and authority, I am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJAD/IHR.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Any labour or materials that are required should be secured from indicated sources.\n\nPayment of the expenditure incurred, not exceeding the amount mentioned above, will be made upon receipt from you of properly certified accounts, in triplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is noted that this account includes $39.00 for labour installing supplies costing $26.70. Please let me know the length of time the electrician was engaged and the rate per hour. Would it not have been possible for some member of the school staff to do this work and thus avoid the heavy expenditure for labour?\n\nOur funds this year are so limited that it is becoming increasingly difficult to consider payment of expenditures for which no authority has previously been given.

Voucher in favor of Neale & Yates. And in reply I wish to say that the stove was so badly burned out in the fire box that it was impossible to go on without these repairs. There was no opportunity of making requisition of the Department as the work simply had to be done to keep the stove in use.\n\nI might further add that when the stove was purchased following expert advice a one-fire-place stove was secured. With the amount of cooking that has to be done in a school of this size one fire has to be kept at almost full force a great deal of the time to accomplish what is required and this stove perhaps for this reason has not stood up satisfactorily. I asked Mr. Yates sometime ago to ascertain from the Foundry Company if some change could be made in the stove that another fire place could be inserted. But have not yet received his reply.\n\nWhen information comes or we get any new light on the matter I will communicate with you in regard to it.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A.

They have charged $1.10 an hour for their electrician and 85 cents an hour for their helper. Twenty hours work was done.\n\nSince the new building was erected I have tried to have my mechanic take care of this work as far as possible and it appears that some things had been neglected and other things improperly done. We therefore, had to have a checking up throughout all the buildings, putting in switches and other appliances which had gone out of order. I am quite convinced that all the work was necessary and some of it long overdue.\n\nI wish also to assure you that we are anxious to cooperate with the Department in the keeping of expense for repairs as low as possible, consistent with what will be economy in the long run and efficiency and safety in connection especially with the electrical department.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

It was used for pumping water to the tank in the old school. And I believe gave good satisfaction. It has been out of use since building operations commenced but as far as I can see is in good condition.\n\nThis windmill will not be needed in the future as an electrical pump has been installed and it is not now connected with our system.\n\nThe highest estimate of value that I has secured from a local dealer is $35.00. They claim it will cost around $25.00 to $50.00 to disassemble and reassemble it on other premises. Mr. McPherson came in this morning, looked it over and volunteered an offer of $50.00. My judgment would be that he's offering full value.\n\nI might further add that the south side of the tower is settling into the ground, so that the top of the mill is between three and four feet of plumb, ultimately the mill would have to be removed for safety.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

It is noted that Mr. A. M.

Will you kindly inform us what to do to exterminate them? And if you can send us what is required we will appreciate it very much.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6256, File 576-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nOttawa, November 7, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, regarding trouble you are having with cockroaches in the pantry and kitchen at the Brandon Indian Residential School, I beg to say that Bulletin No. 112 of the Department of Agriculture suggests the following:\n\n\"Cockroaches may be readily controlled by means of sodium fluoride. This material should be lightly dusted in places frequented by the roaches such as about sinks, baseboards, cupboards, hot water pipes, etc. The sodium fluoride adheres to the legs and antennae of the roaches, and in cleansing themselves the insects are poisoned by it. Sodium fluoride retains its effectiveness and may be left undisturbed as long as convenient or until the cockroaches have completely disappeared. As this chemical is somewhat poisonous reasonable precautions should be taken to prevent children or domestic pets from gaining access to it.\n\n\"Two other materials which form the basis of many proprietary roach powders and which often are recommended, are pyrethrum and borax. Pyrethrum insect powder is less effective than sodium fluoride, it loses its effectiveness quickly on exposure to air, and has to be used in larger quantity. Borax, also, is less satisfactory than sodium fluoride. It is easily obtainable, however, and mixed with equal parts of powdered sweet chocolate, is a fairly effective remedy. Superheated steam and fumigation with hydrocyanic acid gas are also effective in destroying cockroaches. In the case of hydrocyanic acid gas fumigation, however, our experiments indicate that a concentration of gas produced by using 1\u00bd lbs. of calcium cyanide per 1,000 cubic feet, although effective against nymphs and adults, does not destroy the eggs.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6256, File 576-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Nov. 9th, 32\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn sizing up the difficulty we have had in the past with boys and girls snatching little opportunities to meet each other we find that if a gate were placed across the hall at the foot of the girl's stairs preventing them from going down the hall, which passes by both dining rooms, four store rooms, the kitchen, two pantries, the laundry and reaches to the furnace room, that it would solve a great deal of our difficulty. I have enquired in a number of places where a suitable gate of this kind could be secured at a reasonable price and found the most satisfactory results in every way, could be secured by having Mr. A.L. Campbell make one out of galvanized iron pipe, and the heavy woven wire, such as is used for gates in banks, burglar proof gates, etc.\n\nTo install this gate a plank has to be fastened into the solid brick wall to hang it onto and a suitable stop arranged on the frame of the first door going into the staff dining room. The cost of this is $18.50. We will supply the varnish for the plank and woodwork required at the other end of the gate, we will also put on the lock and clasp necessary.\n\nI beg therefore to make requisition to have this gate installed at this price.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\nOttawa, November 16, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, requesting authority to incur an expenditure in the installing of a gate across the hall at the foot of the girls' stairs in the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that it is necessary to conserve our funds, which are extremely limited, and I regret, therefore, that we will be unable to provide the expenditure required. If you consider it urgent that a gate be installed, it is thought that the expenditure could be met from per capita allowances or other receipts of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. A.

Then there is nothing but lath and plaster covering the upstairs rooms. This is ample explanation for the abnormal coldness of the upstairs, notwithstanding the fact that the house has an oversized furnace and consumes a great deal of coal.\n\nI had Mr. Wade of Messrs. Wade & Sons, look at it the other day and he suggests that a coat of insulax be spread between the joists over the whole attic surface. This would cost without the labor a little over a Hundred Dollars. It seems too bad to put this much expense on the building if it was only to be used for a year or so. For a temporary job he further suggested that fine shavings mixed with sawdust and slack lime might be used to give temporary relief. The cost of this would not be more than Fifteen or Twenty Dollars and we could do that work ourselves. The objection to this method is that the filling used is so inflammable that it makes it undesirable but there is only one chimney going up through the roof and it is of good brick construction and very little danger would exist.\n\nAwaiting your advice and direction in this matter,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Nov. 18th, '32\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to write you in regard to the Principal's residence here. Had times been normal it was definitely planned as reported to me both by Doctor Sch\u00fctz and the late Mr. Ferrier that a new house should be built before this. We have, therefore, not asked for any repairs except paint for the verandah, which was in bad shape. This work has been done and improves the outside appearance very much. There are some other repairs which will have to be done in the near future, unless it should become possible to put up a new building.\n\nWhen we had to open up the sewer pipe last spring we found the sills of the building rotten almost entirely away. The building has settled so much that there is five inches difference in the level of the floor in the width of the living room. In some parts it is settling in the centre of the building and others at the walls. The plaster in most of the house is quite dead, and is only being held up by the repeated coats of paper which it has had. The pulverized plaster keeps shifting down from behind the burlap on the stairway and some of the rooms are seriously in need of decorating.\n\nOur worst difficulty, however, is that the house is dreadfully cold. In the wintertime the bathroom is seldom warm enough to take a bath without either turning off the other registers or having additional heat supplied. We have just discovered the main cause of this. Following a severe storm the house warmed up and the snow which had drifted into the attic began to melt. This led us to investigate and on going through the man-hole we found the attic space almost light enough on a bright day.\nOttawa, November 26, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, relative to the condition of the Principal's residence at the Brandon Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that the Department has no funds to undertake any extensive work on this building at the present time. It is noted that you had Messrs. Wade & Sons inspect the building and that a temporary job can be carried out by using fine shavings mixed with sawdust and slacked lime, which would give temporary relief. The Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure not exceeding $20 in having this work carried out. It is noted that there would be little danger from fire in using the above mentioned filling, as there is a good brick chimney. After the work has been completed, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure.\n\nIt is not possible to state at the present time when funds can be provided for the erection of a new residence. Early next summer, you might forward a recommendation as to the repairs you consider absolutely necessary to make the building fairly comfortable, in the event of funds not being available for the erection of a new residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The junior room is in charge of Miss Lulu Ironstar. Miss Ironstar is a qualified teacher and is a treaty Indian belonging to the Assiniboine Agency in Saskatchewan. Grades are arranged as follows:\n\nGrade I - 32\n\" II - 19\n\nMiss Ironstar thoroughly understands the Indian children. She has a pleasing manner and an interesting way of presenting the work. The pupils are bright, quick in responding to questions, and I believe are making good progress. All the children were well dressed and clean. The classroom was tidy and fairly well aired.\n\nThe blackboard supplied for this room does not meet the requirements. There is wall space for another thirty feet and this should be supplied in order that the little ones may become accustomed to the blackboard work. It would also result in a saving in connection with scribblers and notebooks.\n\nThe intermediate grades are supervised by Mr. E. McEwen, and are arranged as follows:\n\nGrade III - 20\n\" IV - 18\n\" V - 18\n\" VI - 12\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nBRANDON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nSeating accommodation is provided for fifty pupils and as these grades are operated on the half day system, there is plenty of room for all. The children are well along in their grades and I consider Mr. McEwen is doing excellent work.\n\nIn this classroom there is only 15 ft. of blackboard, which is certainly insufficient for such a large number of pupils. There is plenty of wall space, both at the side and back, where additional blackboard could be installed. The room was tidy in appearance and well aired.\n\nThe senior room is in charge of Miss D. E. Werthenbach who is an honour graduate in Arts of the Alberta University. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | VII | IX | X | XI |\n|-------|-----|----|---|----|\n|       | 7   | 11 | 8 | 2  |\n\nIn addition to the above, there are three pupils, who were late in entering school and who will be discharged this coming spring, that are receiving special instruction. The pupils in this room attend class all day and are only requested to assist at other work before and after school and on Saturdays. The pupils all appeared well along in their grades and, according to the test examinations set by the teacher, they have obtained splendid marks, and I would judge they are on a par with white children in the City schools. These young people were all well dressed and one could not help but admire the care exercised by each in their personal appearance. As is the case in the other rooms.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6256, File 576-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nBRANDON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nother rooms, more blackboard space is badly required.\n\nThere are at present two girls taking Grade XII. These children are obliged to attend the Collegiate in Brandon in order to get this knowledge. There are also four boys attending the Technical School in Brandon. The work at this school covers automobile mechanics and gas welding, and is spread over a period of three years. The boys are obtaining splendid marks in their test examinations and are greatly pleased with the opportunity which is theirs of having this privilege.\n\nThe laundry is in charge of Miss L. Barager, who appears well qualified to carry on the work. The room is large and well equipped with all necessary machinery. This is a heavy department, but the sample of the work seen was well done, and the girls appeared to enjoy the work.\n\nMiss H. Reeder is matron in charge of the kitchen. She is a splendid cook and the girls receive instruction in all lines of cooking, also in the baking of bread and the making of butter. The meals served on one of the days during my visit were as follows:\n\nBreakfast: Porridge, Sugar, Bread, Dripping, Tea\n\nIn addition to the above, the senior boys received potatoes.\n\nDinner: Meat, Potatoes, Gravy, Usually one other vegetable, Bread, Water to drink.\n\nThe children receive all the vegetables and bread they desire. If no meat is supplied, they are given vegetables and a desert consisting of fruit, rice, or milk puddings.\nBRANDON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nSupper: Soup, Potatoes, Bread or Buns, Tea, and dessert (dried apricots)\n\nIn future, the children will receive butter or lard with this meal.\n\nThe refrigerator room, I understand, was built to accommodate a frigidaire, but this have never been installed. Ice is used, but as there is no ventilation in the room, the air becomes musty and laden with all the various odors, so that it is necessary each day to leave the door open, and as a result, the room is little better than a pantry as it is impossible to keep it cool with ice. The installation of a frigidaire system would be a great help in the care and saving of food.\n\nMiss M. Cranna is the boys' matron and is also in charge of the dispensary and infirmary. The boys' dormitories were all well aired, the beds neatly made, and the bedding clean. The boys are provided with nightgowns. The toilets were clean and in good working order.\n\nIn the boys' side of the infirmary I found three or four small boys in bed. These children have been running a slight temperature for some time and were receiving special food and care in order to better their health condition. There were no girls sick, and I found the infirmary tidy and the beds neatly made.\n\nThe girls' matron is Miss R. Harland, and I found the girls' dormitories well aired and clean. The toilets were in good working order. The girls are also provided with nightgowns.\n\nThe dormitories used for the small boys and girls are situated on the third floor, and accommodate fourteen beds each. The switches for the lights are placed on the inside of the dormitory walls. This should be\nshould be changed to the outside, and would entail very little work. I would also recommend that the top panel of the doors leading to these dormitories be taken out and replaced with glass. The children in both dormitories are the smallest in the school and when the doors are closed and locked, as they are at night, it is difficult to hear them if anyone is needed in case of sickness. I find that the staff member in charge on this floor sleeps across the hall from the dormitory, and at night their door is also kept closed, making it more difficult for the sound to carry.\n\nMrs. G. Mason is the matron in charge at this institution, and is a woman well qualified for the position. Good discipline is maintained throughout the building, and Mrs. Mason is very much respected by all the boys and girls.\n\nFire drill was observed during my inspection, and the children were able to get out in about 2\u00bd minutes. There are no fire bells in the basement, and I found it impossible to hear the fire alarm either in the kitchen or laundry. This difficulty might be overcome by placing an extra large bell on the first floor, but I am of the opinion that one bell should be placed in the basement of the school. The fire equipment was all in good condition, and none of the doors leading on to the fire escapes were locked.\n\nThere is a shortage of water, and very little fire protection could be relied on from this source. At the present time the water supply is so low at certain periods that it is impossible for the Principal to obtain water in the bathroom at his own home. If this condition does not improve it may be necessary, in the near future, to build another reservoir and tap a larger spring located some little distance away.\nBRANDON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nlittle distance from the old source.\n\nThere is a large root cellar at the back of the school building, which is well supplied with potatoes and all other vegetables. I understand that almost 2,000 bushels of potatoes were harvested last fall.\n\nThe barns and outbuildings are in fair repair, but badly in need of paint.\n\nThe Principal has obtained a very fine herd of Shorthorn cattle, and the school is supplied with a fair amount of milk. Sheep and hogs are also kept. Most of the meat required for the school is supplied from the surplus stock of cattle, sheep and hogs, and is killed on the farm.\n\nThere is considerable work yet to be done in fixing up the grounds surrounding the new building. On both sides of the building at the rear, a great improvement would be made if a floor of cement could be laid. In fact, I think something of this nature will be required as the water from the hill back of the school rushes down over this portion of ground, washing it away, and I have no doubt will eventually work into the foundation and cause serious trouble. The attached sketch will more clearly show the requirements in this connection.\n\nThis school is well managed; the discipline is good, and the children are receiving an excellent education and training which should fit them well for their work in later life. I find the Principal, Dr. J. A. Doyle, greatly interested in his work, and undoubtedly he has the situation well in hand.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

Sir:\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton, in a report on his recent inspection of the Brandon Indian Residential School, has drawn attention to several requirements. He refers to the need of more blackboard facilities in each of the classrooms, and, in this connection, you are being written in a separate communication.\n\nHe also refers to the dormitories used by the small boys and girls, located on the third floor. He states that the switches for the lights are placed on the inside of the dormitory walls, and that these should be changed to the outside, entailing very little work and expenditure. He also recommends that the top panel of the doors leading to these dormitories be taken out and replaced with glass. The children in both these dormitories are the smallest in the school, and when the doors are closed and locked, as they are at night, it is difficult to hear them if anyone is needed in case of sickness. He states that the staff members in charge sleep across the hall from the dormitories and, at night, their doors are also kept closed, making it more difficult for any sound to carry. It is considered that the Inspector's recommendation regarding the placing of the switches on the outside of the dormitory walls and the replacing of the top panel in the doors with glass should be carried out. This work should not involve any large expenditure, and we would request that you arrange to have it carried out at an early date, keeping all costs as low as possible. When same has been completed, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of any material and for the labour. No doubt, certain of the work could be performed by the school staff without cost to the Department.\n\nThe Inspector also draws attention to the fire alarm bells, and recommends that a bell be installed in the basement. You may arrange to have this done when the work mentioned above is being carried out. You should see that a bell of a suitable type is installed.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that a floor of cement be laid on both sides of the boiler room and laundry in the rear of the school building, in order to drain off the water and protect the foundation of the building. I should be pleased if you would furnish an estimate of the cost of the material and labour in the laying of a cement floor as indicated on the sketch enclosed, which was submitted by the Inspector. Our funds for the next fiscal year will be extremely limited, and unless the expenditure for the purpose would not be large, we could not authorize same.\n\nI may add that the Inspector's report is most favourable on the management, discipline and services of the staff and work generally at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, February 28, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 209-11 of the 21st instant, reporting on your inspection of the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that the work being carried out by the teachers in the classrooms is satisfactory and that the pupils are making progress in their studies. The question of providing more blackboard facilities will receive attention, and the Principal will be written to forward the dimensions of the blackboard material required for each of the classrooms.\n\nI regret that we will have no funds to provide for the installation of a Frigidaire system or for the installing of cement flooring on both sides at the rear of the school building.\n\nThe Principal is being written regarding the installing of a fire bell in the basement.\n\nThe Department is also pleased to note that this school is well managed; that the discipline is good and that the children are receiving an excellent education and training, and that the Principal and staff are greatly interested in the work.\n\nI wish to thank you for your very full report on the work and general conditions at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have also arranged for the change to be made in the light switches in the small dormitories on the third floor. There is not a bell procurable in Brandon suitable for a fire bell to be placed in the basement, but one will be secured as early as possible.\n\nWithin a few days I will send forward an estimated cost for material and labor which will be required in laying a cement floor as indicated in your letter and accompanying sketch. We will certainly appreciate it exceedingly if this improvement can be made.\n\nMay I convey to you my very sincere thanks for the last paragraph of your letter. I have a splendid staff, each one I feel is deeply interested in the work they are doing and a word of commendation such as you have given stimulates greatly the impulse to achieve the best results.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Davis\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man.,\n\nMr. Higgins is very strongly of the opinion that it is urgent for the well-being of the foundation of this part of the school that at least some of this cement work be put in and especially that the wall referred to be constructed. For the welfare of the building the east side is the most urgent but for the inconvenience from mud the west side is more urgent. We will certainly appreciate it very much if this work can be done.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nMarch 29th, 33\nBrandon, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of February 28, #133-045, in regard to cement floor being placed on either side of the boiler and laundry rooms at the rear of the building. The most favorable estimate I can secure is from Mr. Higgins, who finds the cost of material and labor to be as follows:\n\n1000 sacks cement----------$900.00\n150 yds. gravel-----------75.00\nLabor in mixing & laying cement--------450.00\nTotal---------------------$1325.00\n\nThis includes a cement wall from the rear corner of the school on the east side to extend 75 feet east, curving a little to the south. This is absolutely necessary to keep the parapetis bank at the rear from washing and working down over the court at this side of the school. If this wall is not put in the earth will soon be washed and worked away from the foundation of the root house, which is very close to the northeast corner of the school. If this wall were put in separately it would cost approximately $150. Without this wall it is impossible to keep the water in the spring intact and also when we have heavy rainfall from washing in around the foundation.\n\nIn the above estimate we would do all the excavating and the teaming of the gravel, but would need to hire help for loading the gravel. Our older boys are practically all in high school work and are in school for the full day and have to give a good deal of attention to their studies out of school hours. And the farm work makes very urgent demands upon the time of all the boys we have available.\nOttawa, April 4, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, giving an estimate of the cost of installing a cement floor on either side of the boiler and laundry rooms at the rear of the Brandon Indian Residential School building.\n\nIn reply I regret that, as our Appropriation for the fiscal year beginning the first instant has been so considerably reduced, there will be no funds to provide the expenditure required in having the cement floor installed. Would it not overcome, to a large extent, the present conditions if crushed stone or cinders were laid on both sides of the boiler and laundry rooms? It is thought that either of these materials could be obtained at small expense and, if spread where required and rolled down, would prevent the earth from being washed and worked away from the foundation. If either of these materials would be satisfactory, the cost of same and placing where required would have to be met by the school authorities. I shall be pleased to hear from you regarding the matter.\n\nI may add that, for the present fiscal year, a small Appropriation only has been provided for urgent repairs, etc., at our Indian residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nwalls were put in, however, the crushed stone or cinders would be a great help to the situation.\n\nThe crushed stone can be secured from the city at $4.00 per square yard. But I think the cinders, which can be secured from the C.P.R. at seventy-five cents per square yard would serve this situation equally as well. It would take about 170 sq.yds. to make a proper job.\n\nThe walls would cost about $150 each. It would also be necessary to put a cement curb at each of the two doors, as the door sills are at least nine inches below the level to which the cinders should be raised. This would cost another $25.00. Making a total cost for the walls and curbs of $325.00.\n\nIt would be impossible with our greatly reduced income to meet this expenditure out of our school funds. If, however, you can find it possible to arrange to put in the cement part of the work, we will endeavor to do the necessary excavating and secure and instal the cinders.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Ward,\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., April 7th, 1933\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of April 4, #133-0-5, concerning cement floor for courts on either side of the boiler and laundry rooms has just come in. We are naturally quite disappointed that this work cannot be done in the near future. Now that the frost is coming out of the ground and the water soaking down from the hill at the rear these spaces are in a terrible mess with mud.\n\nThe trouble is not with the earth being washed and worked away from the foundation but the opposite. The school is set back into a curve in the hill and from the back of the building the hill rises with a steep slant to about seventeen feet above the normal level at the sides of the school. With this precipitous hill curving on either side toward the front of the building when a heavy rain falls or the snow is melting in the spring the water carries the earth down towards the building instead away from it, and the water soaks in about the foundation. This, of course, will become a serious menace to the building if allowed to continue.\n\nThe only relief for this condition is to have walls built from the rear corners of the school in both directions for about seventy-five feet. And thus, prevent the water and earth from washing down over these spaces and soaking in about the foundation. Mr. Higgins, the contractor, thought that a wall on the east side would be sufficient, if the cement floor was laid on the west side with a deep gutter constructed at the foot of the hill and with sufficient slope to this floor to shed the water readily away from the building.\n\nYou can thus see that without these walls there would be very little value in putting in crushed stone orinders. If the\nMay 9, 1935.\n\nRev. and Dear Sirs\u2014\n\nReferring to your letter of the 7th ultimo with reference to the building of courts at the sides of the boiler room and laundry at the Brandon School, I would suggest that this matter be left in abeyance for the present, as it is expected that the Architect of the Department will visit Brandon during the early summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

I would refer you to paragraphs two and three, from which you will observe that no expenditure must be incurred, for which this Department will be called upon to pay, until the necessary authority has been granted. You should, therefore, before undertaking any repairs, alterations, etc., report the matter to the Department, giving full details as to the cost of material and labour, and receive authority before incurring any expenditure.

The jacket heaters in the school have never been satisfactory. We have had to abandon their use and keep a fire in one of the furnaces to maintain our supply of hot water in the building.

Would it not have been possible for the boys to get along with only one copy of each book? These could be used jointly. Our appropriation is so limited that every possible effort must be made to reduce expenditures.\n\nI am doubtful if payment of the account can be made but further consideration will be given to the matter when your reply is received.\n\nI might, also, point out that you should have forwarded a requisition in order that the books could have been ordered from the Government Stationery Office if the Department wished to supply them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Doyle D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., December 11, 1933\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of December 4th., No. 133-0-5, and I have noted carefully its contents and regret that I did not send in for permission to purchase the books for the technical boys but simply followed the precedent of both last year and 1931. I find in looking over the correspondence, that under date of September 30, 1931, I made requisition for books at that time required for first year students in the Technical School and under date of October 6th., 1931, file 133-0-1, I received your reply authorizing me to arrange for the purchase of these books and forward the account to the Department. Taking this as a precedent I did the same thing the next year and again this year.\n\nTwo years ago I approached the Principal, Mr. Austin, of the Technical School, in regard to having one copy of Dykes Encyclopedia for the three boys but he stated then, and repeated the same thing in conversation today, that it is a regulation of the School that each student must have one of these books. It is in constant use in their class room work and each boy is required to have one in front of him in connection with some of their classes. The one book of course will last for the three years and then should be well enough preserved to be of service when the boy goes into practical garage or machine shop work.\n\nTrusting that the above explanation is satisfactory and that you can see fit to pay this account as financing with us is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

We had an expert out two days ago and he finds that the tubes are all in a very serious condition and will have to be replaced. The cost, he estimates, will be ninety-two dollars. The tubes are leaking so badly that it is almost impossible to get the water heated for washing. I would appreciate it very much if you could send an immediate answer giving us authority to have this work done.\n\nThe expert tells us that in his judgment it is the hardness of the water that has caused these tubes to be in a condition requiring replacing so soon.\n\nAwaiting your word,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

It is also very desirable that the assembly hall, which also has to be used for group games, should be painted with a brown or other suitable color about seven feet high on the three walls. This will require about 6 gallons of brown and 3 gallons of cream.\n\nThe bungalow just east of the school is badly in need of decorating and should have the following colors in Muresco following Benjamin Moore's color chart:-\n\n| Color | Quantity |\n|-------|----------|\n| No. 5 | 5 lbs.   |\n| 12    | 15 lbs.  |\n| 8     | 5 lbs.   |\n| 20    | 10 lbs.  |\n\nThis house and the one at the gate will require 2 gallons of inside gloss white paint and 3/4 gallon first coat paint. The bungalow veranda should be screened in as Mr. Wood has two small children which they desire to be kept outside as much as possible. This would require 1 reel, 40\" wide, 14 x 14 mesh, screen wire cloth, black. The front room of the house at the gate is badly in need of wallpaper.\n\nWe have deferred making any request for re-decorating in the Principal's home as the building of a new house has been under consideration and if there is some prospect of this going forward within a year or two it will no doubt be advisable to undertake decorating. In some of the rooms the plaster itself is only held by the paper and just how long it will last is quite doubtful.\n\nIn two other letters I wish to refer to fencing and other matters.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A. D.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., March 13, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention: Mr. J. D. Sutherland.\n\nThe enclosed letters outline some of our immediate needs. Other items you have in the list you made last fall and I will review them just briefly.\n\nGarage: There has been no change in this building since last fall but the late spring is when we have noticed the widening of the cracks the most seriously. I do not think there is any immediate danger of the roof falling in.\n\nResidence: It is most difficult to know what to suggest and I will be guided entirely by the prospects of having a new house within a reasonable time. When I came here five years ago, Mr. Russell Ferrier was very definite in his statement that a new house would be built inside of two years. Altered conditions, of course, have made this impossible.\n\nWater Supply: For a few weeks in the winter practically no water reached the bathroom in our house but it returned with a strong flow or fairly so earlier this year than last and if we have more precipitation during the next few years this difficulty may be obviated.\n\nCold Room: I still think it most urgent that we should have some kind of refrigeration in connection with our kitchen and dining room.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., March 13, 1934.\n\nCement Courts: With the spring thaw the freshet is on now and the earth from the hills is washing down and covering up a good deal of the cinders around the outside of these courts that we put in last year. It certainly would relieve us greatly if the necessary walls could be built and the courts put in. When Inspector Hamilton visited us last we observed that the front part of the root house on the west side was continuing to move away from the rest of the building, i.e., the crack is decidedly increased and he thinks it will also be necessary to put a wall about ten feet nearer the root house than the one already proposed.\n\nAssembly Hall: In another letter I have included paint to cover the space of a wide wainscoting for three sides of this building. We, of course, would very much like to have a pulpit, suitable curtains for the platform and drapes for the windows. These, not only for appearance, but we believe they would also improve the acoustics of this auditorium.\n\nWater Softener: The water, as you know, is extremely hard and I find we are paying out a good deal of money for the necessary material to soften the water in order to have the washing done satisfactorily and I sincerely hope that we can soon have a water softener installed.\n\nHen House: On account of the serious infection of T.B. in the old hen houses we have not deemed it advisable to use them since we deserted them nearly three years ago. We have been improvising accommodation for a few hens around the other buildings but this is not satisfactory and we cannot keep a sufficient number\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., March 12, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are badly in need of material for repairs around the buildings.\n\nA little less than a year ago you notified that only $300.00 would be allowed for this school for this fiscal year.\n\nIf the figures below are correct we have received in accounts paid and one submitted herewith $242.20 against this $300.00. They are as follows:\n\n| Date   | Description                        | Amount |\n|--------|------------------------------------|--------|\n| June 22| Brandon Htg. & Plumbing            | $5.90  |\n| Aug. 16| Yates, Neale & Co.                 | $30.50 |\n| Nov. 16| A.

Heating & Plumbing            | $32.00 |\n\n$242.20\n\nwhich leaves us a balance of $57.80.\n\nI have just been checking up our school account and find that we have spent during the year on lumber, hardware, plumbing and electrical supplies for things that were urgent and could not wait $235.51.

Our total Appropriation has not been increased and, consequently, the Department has not sufficient funds to enable us to authorize all the expenditures mentioned in your letters.\n\nIt is expected that arrangements will be made at an early date for rebuilding the retaining wall and repairing the Principal's residence. In addition, the sum of $200 is available in our Appropriation for minor repairs at the Brandon Residential School. During the current fiscal year, you may forward accounts to an amount not exceeding $200. Any expenditure over and above this amount, for replacements or repairs of a minor nature at the Brandon School, will have to be paid from the per capita allowance or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mr. Frank C. Lissaman came over in a few days and took particulars in regard to the work. Mr. Jones was out of town but returned in a couple of weeks. He also came over, took measurements and specifications. Both men promised to send estimates in the near future. I did not receive answer from either of them so early in July I went to see Mr. Lissaman and urged him to give me his tender. This he did just as I was leaving for a trip to the East. I could not find Mr. Jones and since returning learn that he has been out of the city most of the summer. He returned to Brandon last night and I telephoned him this morning and he has promised to have his tender ready in a few days. As soon as it is available I will send them both forward.\n\nIt is exceedingly difficult to suggest any repairs at the residence without having the whole house decorated, broken plaster patched, the woodwork painted and the floor, in places, jacked up and new posts put in.

The railing around the veranda on the top is so rotted that it cannot stand much longer. In the kitchen part of the house the sills have rotted so badly that the walls are settling but the large soft water tank which is under the kitchen floor has not settled. Therefore, the centre of the floor bulges up quite seriously. In the main part of the house the walls have not settled but the centre has so that there is five inches difference in the level of the floor from one corner of the den to the other. As I stated in a previous letter the lime has entirely gone out of the plaster and it continues to sift down from behind the burlap in the den and hall and stairway. This could only be remedied by re-plastering these rooms. The paper is all that holds the plaster in its place throughout the rest of the house. For these reasons we have decided to ask only for the re-decorating in the interior.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJAD/W\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sept. 6, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe water situation here is becoming quite serious. Since the last week in July it has been running short. We have been cutting down in the use of it in every possible way and shutting it off entirely during the night. For the past three weeks we have had none in the bathroom at our residence and none in the hot water tap in the kitchen. That means that the water never rises above three feet in the reservoir in the hill and repeatedly it ceases to flow altogether. The recent rain, which was less than an inch, has had no effect on it whatever. In previous years the reservoir filled up during the night at this time of year and the lowest flow did not come till after Christmas or in February. If the same decline in flow takes place this year we will be entirely without water before very long.\n\nAwaiting your advice and direction in this matter,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\nWINNIPEG, MAN., September 15th, 1924.\n\nI have just returned from the Brandon Indian Residential School and wish to report that some action must be taken at once in connection with the water supply. For the past month or six weeks, the school has been operating with insufficient water and the supply is becoming less and less. This is the first time in the history of the school that any shortage has occurred, although last winter, during the real severe weather, the supply barely met the demand. I think it would be a big mistake to attempt entering the winter without making some further provision to supply the school with water. There is another spring which at present has a good flow, but the expense in connecting up will entail several hundreds of dollars.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. D. B. Gow, of the Dominion Water Power Branch, be instructed to visit the school and submit his recommendation and an estimate of the cost.\n\nThis is an urgent matter and I trust it will receive the Department's immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The water stands in the reservoir at about fifteen inches. After being shut off it will come up to about two feet but when the largest amounts are being used it empties the reservoir.\n\nIn previous years the lowest water has been during late January and February, it standing about four feet lower than at this time of year. This, no doubt, is account of the depth of frost either at the source of the spring or some place where it comes through the ground to our supply. We, therefore, feel quite certain that unless we have an abnormal amount of moisture this fall together with an unusually mild winter we will be without water when winter sets in.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6257, file 576-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of October 12th with reference to the difficulty with the water supply system at the Brandon Indian Residential School and instructing that an inspection be made and a report forwarded as to what is required to provide an adequate water supply system. In accordance with your instructions, the writer accompanied by Mr. J.T. Rose, visited this school yesterday and made an examination of the situation.\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the following paragraph from the report submitted under date of September 29, 1929, by the writer, then Assistant District Chief Engineer, and relating to the proposed water supply installation for this school:\n\n\"For the present it is proposed to make use of the present source of supply, namely the reservoir constructed in 1928. However, there is a second spring located higher up on the plateau back of the school and about one-half mile distant. It is claimed that there is a larger flowage from this spring than from the utilized one and if the necessity arises this spring can be used to feed the main reservoir by pipeline.\"\n\nThe writer at that time had some doubts as to the adequacy of the existing source of water supply, but the fact that the water supply was then in existence, and furthermore that it has provided a fairly adequate water supply for five years fully justifies the recommendations made at that time.\n\nThe prevailing dry cycle of years has affected the water supply from springs throughout the entire Province and there is no certainty that conditions will not become more serious. In 1931 it was noted that the source of water supply at the Brandon School was showing decreased volume and during the winter of 1932-33 there were times when the pressure was insufficient to furnish a continuous supply of water to the residences. Conditions were becoming more serious during the winter of 1933-34 and during the past summer and the present autumn, the water supply has been inadequate for the school's needs. Some of the residences are without water supply at all. There is grave danger that during the coming winter the water supply to the school itself will completely fail.\n\nThe second spring referred to in the above paragraph in the 1929 report, has completely failed and provides no present source of additional water supply. There is, however, a\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nflowing spring that emerges from the gravel strata about 1800 feet from the school. This spring still shows a substantial flow probably in excess of the full requirements of the school. It has not shown any material reduction in volume during the present summer and autumn, but no one can definitely say for how long this source of supply will last if the dry cycle continues. It is, however, a source of supply to augment the present supply and it is the only possible source of additional supply. At this spring the water trickles out from the gravel strata into a morass overgrown with willows and trampled by cattle seeking drinking water. It emerges from this morass as a small stream flowing down a rather deep coulee and eventually entering into the Assiniboine River. It will be necessary to impound the greater portion of the flow of this spring at the place where it emerges and convey the water by underground pipe line to either the existing reservoir or to the school itself. Some inspection is necessary to determine just how this spring water originates in various places from the gravel strata and may be impounded before being conveyed to the present reservoir 1800 feet distant. At the present time it is rather an unsightly looking source of water supply and no doubt it is very badly contaminated.\n\nIt is difficult to give an estimate of the cost of procuring this additional water supply, owing to uncertainties relating to the difficulty of impounding the water supply at this source. The pipe line would entail an outlay of approximately $2,500.00. The clearing of the source of supply and the impounding of the water might approximate $1,500.00, making a total cost of $4,000.00 under ordinary working conditions. Winter excavation, however, would add to these costs considerably.\n\nBefore recommending the tapping of this additional source of water supply, the writer would urge that the existing source of water supply be explored to ascertain whether or not sufficient additional flow cannot be obtained to provide a water supply adequate to safeguard the needs of the school during the coming winter.\n\nThose responsible for the construction of the existing reservoir in 1928 cannot now be reached so particulars relating to the same are entirely lacking. It is possible that only a portion of the capacity of this particular spring is being procured in the concrete reservoir. To determine whether or not such is the case it will be necessary to excavate a trench immediately downhill from the reservoir, tap the gravel bed and ascertain the conditions. If it is determined water is escaping and in sufficient volume to provide an adequate water supply, it will then be necessary to cut off the escaping water by plank sheeting thus forcing the water back into the reservoir so as to create sufficient head to deliver water to the residences which at present get water only occasionally. If additional water were procurable it would then become advisable also to lower the outline pipe from the reservoir.\n\nIt is possible that such an examination would entail an outlay of $100.00 but if it results in sufficient water being secured to get safely through the coming winter, this amount together with an additional $150.00 or $200.00 for sheeting and alterations, would alleviate the necessity of proceeding with the new pipe line with all its uncertainties of continuity of supply and construction during the period of year when excavation is both difficult and costly.\nI would accordingly recommend that we be authorized to expend up to $100.00 in exploring the possibility of water supply at the existing reservoir and also to carry out some test work at the second spring which it may be necessary to tap. As the situation is urgent I would recommend authorization be wired to make such preliminary investigations.\n\nI regret that it was impossible to make the inspection earlier than yesterday in response to your instructions, but owing to the absence of both Mr. Rose and the writer from the office for some time past, such an examination could not be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd.) D. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nOctober 27, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 10th instant regarding the water supply at the Brandon Indian Residential School I enclose herewith copy of a letter dated the 24th instant received from Mr. Gow in which he reports on the existing situation.\n\nHe recommends as a first step to find out if additional water can be obtained from the spring now being used by examining conditions below the spring to find out if any water is escaping from the existing reservoir, and if so to cut off the escaping water by plank sheeting thus forcing the water back into the reservoir so as to create sufficient head to deliver water to the residences which at present get water only occasionally.\n\nHe estimates that the examination would cost about $100, and if it shows that more water is available in this way, the expenditure of about $200 more for sheeting and alterations would provide water during the coming winter.\n\nMr. Gow states the situation is urgent and asks that authority be wired to him to make such preliminary investigations.\n\nYou will recall that Mr. Gow has been authorized to go to Lebret, Saskatchewan, to prepare a report on the water supply and sewage disposal system for the new school there and consideration should be given as to which of these should receive precedence in the instructions to be given to Mr. Gow.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\nOctober 27, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 27th with further reference to the water supply at the Brandon Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the Department approves of an expenditure up to $200.00, as recommended by Mr. Gow in his report, and you may therefore wire him to this effect.\n\nWith reference to the necessary survey and report on the water supply and sewage disposal for Lebret, I think it would be better to leave these arrangements entirely to Mr. Gow.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Young, Auditor, who recently visited and inspected the books at the Brandon Indian Residential School, has drawn attention to the position of Engineer, which is now filled by two boys holding Technical School certificates. In this connection there are several points that should be considered, viz.: -\n\n1. Do Provincial regulations permit the employment of boys with such certificates to take charge of a large heating plant?\n\n2. Is it in the interests of the Department to allow boys to operate this plant? If they are not competent or properly qualified, serious damage to equipment and building may result, and the Department may be called upon to meet a rather large expenditure for repairs.\n\n3. Should there be an accident due to improper handling of the heating plant, resulting in injuries or possibly loss of life to some of the inmates of the school, it would be rather embarrassing for Department.\n\n4. Are these boys qualified to look after equipment other than the heating plant, such as pumping apparatus, laundry machinery, etc?\n\nI should be pleased if, at your convenience, you will enquire into the services of the boys in operating the heating plant and other equipment at the school. If you consider that they are not competent, you should advise the Principal to arrange for the services of a fully qualified engineer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G.

Measurements taken showed this additional flow to be about 900 gallons daily and so it was decided to endeavour to block off this flow and force the same into the reservoir. It was also decided to endeavour to increase the water level in the reservoir by driving sheeting along the ends and the lower side of the reservoir. It was hoped to shut off all flow past the reservoir, increase the water table elevation and so secure the necessary increased head that has been lost during the past two years.\n\nIn placing and driving the lumber sheeting, great difficulty was experienced from the gravel cavities in quicksand was encountered at depth and it was impossible to effect a complete cut-off of the water. Accordingly, we did not succeed in materially increasing the water level in the reservoir. However, tile and piping was placed to convey the major portion of the 900 gallons per day spring to the vicinity of the reservoir. The reservoir itself was cleaned out to a depth of 1.5 feet and the outlet was lowered.\n\nThe work carried out will doubtless increase the water available for use in the school and it is hoped will ensure the school operating throughout the winter. The work apparently has resulted in increasing the elevation of the water level in the reservoir to provide continuous water supply to the second storey of the Principal's residence. The presence of quicksand at depth prevented the complete sealing up of the area around the reservoir, thus defeating our efforts to raise the water table.\n\nWhile the work performed will, I believe, ensure a fairly adequate water supply to the school during this winter, I am of the opinion that should the dry cycle continue into 1936, it will be necessary to look to additional sources for water for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDe B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a statement of disbursements, in quadruplicate, made by the writer for the Department of Indian Affairs in connection with work performed at the Brandon Indian Residential School. This statement of disbursements shows expenditures of $150.03.\n\nI am also enclosing account from Wade & Sons Limited, Brandon, against the Department of Indian Affairs for materials supplied in connection with the work carried out at the Brandon Indian Residential School - the amount of the account being $65.81. I would recommend to the Department of Indian Affairs that this account be paid.\n\nYou will note that the writer has expended $150.03 of his own money in connection with the work at the Brandon Indian Residential School, whereas the standing advance from the Department of Indian Affairs only amounts to $60.00. Accordingly, I would request a cheque as early as possible from the Department of Indian Affairs, particularly as the writer has also had considerable expense in connection with the Lebret Indian School - an account for which will be submitted shortly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

November 20th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to Department Letter 135-0-5 dated November 8th, concerning the engineers at the Brandon Residential School, I had occasion to be in Brandon last week and discussed this matter with the Principal.\n\nDr. Doyle informed me that the boys attended the Technical School for three years and both held certificates. However, he pointed out that although the boys were termed \"engineers\", they were under the supervision of Mr. Wood who has been at the school for some three years. Mr. Wood is very reliable, but neither does he hold an engineer's certificate. In order to meet with the Department's wish, Mr. Wood stated he would immediately write the examination for a Provisional Certificate which, I understand from the Bureau of Labour, Parliament Bldg., is equivalent to a fourth class engineer's certificate. Mr. Stewart, of this Department, states it is not necessary to hold a certificate unless one is operating a plant where it is necessary to carry thirty pounds of steam or over. I understand from Dr. Doyle and also from Mr. Wood that, even in the severe weather, they scarcely carry more than 10 or 15 lbs. of steam.\n\nThe vertical boiler which supplies the hot water for the laundry may occasionally have 30 lbs. of pressure, although I think the work could be carried on with from 20 to 25 lbs.\n\nDr. Doyle assured me that Mr. Wood would be left in charge and that he would immediately write the examination.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nHe would like to know if this will be satisfactory to the Department as he is anxious in every way to co-operate and meet the Department's wishes.

It is noted that the two boys are under the supervision of Mr. Wood, who does not hold an engineer's certificate. It is considered he should write his examination and obtain a certificate, as soon as possible.\n\nIf you believe the engineering services at this school are satisfactory and that Mr. Wood is fully competent, we would be prepared to accept your judgment in the matter. However, the Principal should understand that, if an accident occurs to the plant at the school, on account of not having a fully competent engineer, replacements of equipment will have to be undertaken by the school authorities - the expenses in connection with which will have to be met from school receipts.\n\nYou might advise the Department when Mr. Wood obtains his provisional certificate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

If not, the installation of a large cabinet type electric refrigerator in one corner of the kitchen would be much better than the present system.\n\nNew water supply - It may be that some action on this matter has already been taken by the Department, as Mr. A. G. Hamilton, the Inspector, reported on it towards the end of September. For the first time in 76 years the spring, which was tapped to supply the school with water, is practically dry. Brandon School is at the moment without fire protection in that sense. There is another spring, 600 yards farther up the hill, which even in this especially dry summer, has maintained a steady flow of good water. It would be an inexpensive matter to extend the lines to tap this source.\nSir:\n\nI have just been advised by Doctor Doyle, Principal of the Indian Residential School, Brandon, that the water situation there is worse now than it has ever been. It does not come up as fast and none has reached the hot water tank in his kitchen for ten days. Doctor Doyle states that if it does not get worse, they will try to carry on by conserving in every possible way. I will report any further developments in connection with the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G.

The well which supplies our pressure system is holding about the same and at the suggestion of the engineers who were here in the fall we are now tapping the pressure system pipes in order to get a supply from this source in the kitchen without having to carry it as we have been doing for some months from other parts of the building.\n\nApart from a few days we have had no water in the bathroom at our house for months and most of the time none in the hot water tank in the kitchen.

It is hoped that with the spring break-up period now approaching, some improvement in the conditions may be experienced.\n\nMr. Rose at the present time is in the Estevan district in connection with the establishment of hydrometric stations and coulds return to Winnipeg will stop off at Brandon and visit the Brandon Indian School. At that time he will make an examination of the flow of water in the spring which is situated about one-half a mile from the school and which it is proposed to connect up with the present water supply to the school. If the flow of water in this spring at the present time is insufficient to meet the requirements of the school, it will then be necessary to give consideration to other sources of supply for this school.\n\nAs soon as Mr. Rose has returned and made his report, a further communication will be addressed to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n'SGD' D.B.Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nJ.T.Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 13th instant regarding the water supply system at Brandon Indian residential school, I enclose herewith copy of a letter from Mr. Gow dated the 20th instant from which you will see that a report on the subject may shortly be expected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer M.F.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nI wish to refer to Department Letter No. 133-0-5 dated December 1st, 1934, which deals with the question of a qualified engineer for the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nI have just received a letter from Doctor Doyle, Principal of the School, stating that Mr. Wood has been successful in securing his Provisional Engineer's Certificate. In conversation with Doctor Doyle, he informed me that Mr. Wood would no doubt at a later date secure his third class papers. I have been informed by the Provincial authorities that the Provisional Certificate granted meets the requirements in connection with an institution of this kind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G.

We will, therefore, appreciate as liberal a grant for these items as you are able to make for the coming fiscal year.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nJAD/W\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., March 26, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI felt I should write you this spring again in regard to repairs and in this connection wish to refer to my letter of March 15, 1934, and would like especially to express appreciation on behalf of myself and family of the work done on the Principal's residence. The improved condition has been very much enjoyed by all of us. The other items of this letter stand about the same as last year and I know the different items will be undertaken by the Department when it is possible for them to do so.\n\nI wish especially in this letter to refer to our needs for repairs to buildings, plumbing, heating, lighting, etc. In addition to the $200.00 allowed in this connection to us last year we spent as follows:\n\n- Heating and Plumbing: $103.97\n- Boyd Electric: $6.75\n- Johnson Hardware: $254.83\n- Wade & Sons: $132.03\n- McDowell & Doke: $459.10\n\nTotal: $936.58\n\nIn previous years almost all of these items were charged and paid for by the Department. The McDowell & Doke bill, however, includes $436.55 for forced\nOttawa, April 5, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to repairs required at the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the sum of $500.00 is provided in our Appropriation for the fiscal year 1935-36, for painting and miscellaneous repairs. I would request that you advise the Department which of the items of repairs, painting, etc., you consider the most important. You should state the approximate cost for material and labour. When we have this information, consideration will be given and you will receive the necessary instructions in regard to the carrying out of the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D. D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6257, file 576-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the subject matter of your letter of the 14th instant and my reply thereto under date of March 20th, I beg to advise that Mr. Rose has now returned from his west trip, during the course of which he visited the Brandon Indian School and investigated the water supply conditions at that Institution.\n\nMr. Rose reports that the water supply at the Institution, while inadequate to meet the demands of all services, is not now more serious than the conditions that have prevailed during the greater part of the winter. There is nothing that can be done at the present time to provide an adequate water supply for all services and it is anticipated that with the break-up period now about to take place, that conditions will not become more serious and will probably be somewhat alleviated.\n\nMr. Rose made an investigation of the spring which has been referred to in previous correspondence, and made an actual measurement of the flow as it emerges from underground. He reports that at the time of his visit the flow was averaging a rate of somewhat in excess of 4,000 gallons per day. In view of the fact that the other springs have shown a lessening discharge, the fact that this spring appears to be maintaining a fairly large flow is a favourable feature. It would appear that we would be warranted in creating a small reservoir at the point where this spring emerges from the ground and conveying the supply either direct to the school or to the existing reservoir. However, this work cannot be undertaken at the present time, but should be given further consideration should the run-off conditions throughout Manitoba continue at a rate below normal. In the meantime whenever our engineer is in that vicinity, he will make it a point to further inspect this spring to determine whether or not there is a decrease or increase in the discharge.\n\nI would ask that you please convey this information to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n'SGD' D.B.Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer\n\nJ.T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of March 13th regarding the water supply at Brandon Indian Residential school, I enclose herewith copy of a letter dated March 28th from Mr. Gow which contains additional information as to the present conditions.\n\nThis supplements the information given by Mr. Gow in his previous letter of March 30th.\n\nYou will note that nothing further can be done until the spring break-up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

If you see fit to have us do the other painting it will be as much as we can handle with the boys available during the summer.\n\nWe also require shingles to cover the back kitchen on the Gate House, roof 14x20, cost $10.00. We further need about four bundles of shingles to repair roofs on barns and other buildings, cost $4.00.\n\nThe new manager of the Manitoba Power Commission at Brandon has gone over our electric wiring and states that replacement of wire, poles, etc., is urgently required.

Miss Farris is a qualified teacher and specially adapted to the training of juniors and kindergarten pupils. I consider her teaching ability of high standard and the children are making good progress.\n\nThe intermediate room has 66 on the roll and the grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | IV   | V    | VI   |\n|-------|------|------|------|\n|       | 28   | 20   | 18   |\n\nMr. N. McEwen, who is in charge of this room, is a young man with good teaching ability. The pupils are all well advanced in their respective grades.\n\nMiss M. C. Richardson has the senior room, with 35 enrolled. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | VII  | VIII | IX   | X    |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|\n|       | 18   | 13   | 2    | 2    |\n\nMiss Richardson is a graduate in Arts and a capable teacher. The pupils appear to enjoy the work and are making good progress. They were all neatly dressed and clean. The teachers each have a carefully planned\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nplanned timetable which, I understand, is closely followed.\n\nThe school building is kept clean and good discipline maintained. The laundry is supervised by Miss McLaren. The girls receive a thorough training in washing, ironing and pressing. The machinery appeared to be in good condition and is well cared for.\n\nThe kitchen is in charge of Miss H. Reader. The work is done on a large scale; nevertheless, the girls receive a fair training in plain cooking. The bread is purchased in the city, but I understand classes are held in bread making. The girls are also taught to make plain cakes, buns, and pastry.\n\nA room was provided for a frigidaire, but this has not yet been installed. I would recommend that this be provided, if possible. A large amount of food is handled at an institution of this size and a frigidaire is really a necessity, especially during the summer months. I might mention that many of the pupils remain at the school during the summer months and I doubt if the number is ever below 90 or 100.\n\nThe sewing room is on the first floor. It is well lighted and well equipped. The girls are taught mending of all kinds and plain sewing. At present this department is supervised by Nurse Matchett, the regular sewing teacher being absent on sick leave. The aim of this department is to send the girls home thoroughly trained to mend, to do plain sewing, and make the ordinary housedresses and underclothes required.\n\nMrs. Fraser\nMrs. Fraser is boys' supervisor and does excellent work. This is a hard department and needs constant supervision. The boys' playroom was tidy, and the toilets and washroom clean and in working order.\n\nMiss M. Wilson is girls' supervisor and assists Doctor Doyle in his office work. The girls' playroom, washroom, and dormitories were all in good condition. All were well aired and clean.\n\nNurse M. Matchett is in charge of the dispensary and infirmary. Although there has been very little serious sickness, there are always minor ailments. The trachoma cases receive daily treatment. The children are weighed at stated periods and, if not gaining, are given extra food.\n\nFire drill is observed and none of the doors leading to the exits are locked. Fire extinguishers are kept in prominent places on each floor. One fire hose should be renewed. The one on the hanger is useless as it has been damaged. I expected these hose to be in good condition and on the occasion of my last visit overlooked making a close check. I was unable to find out just what happened to the hose in question, but it undoubtedly has been used outside. I have instructed that the fire hose must not be removed. The one required for the top floor should be 75 or 80 ft. in length.\n\nThe school building is in need of the following interior decorating:\n\n1. Chapel - Wall should be painted to the height of 6 ft., and burlap should be used along the back. This will protect the plaster from breaking when the chairs are piled at the rear.\n2. Girls' Reading Room has been in constant use and the walls are smudged and dirty.\n\n3. Waiting Room is at the main entrance and does not look well unless kept in good condition. The walls and ceiling should be painted.\n\n4. Boys' Reading Room, like the girls', is in constant use and needs painting.\n\nThe material for the foregoing work would not entail much expense and Doctor Doyle states the work could be done by the staff and senior boys.\n\nThe Principal's residence is old and the foundation badly settled. The verandah needs repairing, but one hesitates to recommend much expense. The house is old and without a proper foundation. A new building is needed.\n\nThe Farming Instructor's house needs exterior painting, especially the verandah which, as yet, has never been painted. The dining room and bedroom in this house should also be painted. All the above work could be done by the staff and boys and the total cost of material should not exceed $150.00.\n\nThe stockman's house is in good repair, except that one room should be re-papered.\n\nThe cottage on the west hill needs the kitchen shingled. The roof leaks badly and the work should be carried out at once. The roof is 14x20 ft. The boys, with proper supervision, could do the work.\n\nThe large barns have not been painted for many years and present a neglected appearance. This work...\nwork should be carried out in order that the lumber be preserved. The school is situated adjacent to the Dominion Experimental Farm, which constitutes another reason why the buildings should be kept in good repair and not allowed to become run down and neglected in appearance.\n\nThe chicken house is located in a poor place, surrounded by scrub oak. The building and land is infested with disease, consequently no poultry has been kept since the new school opened. The building has been neglected and I would recommend that Doctor Boyle be allowed to dismantle it and re-build on a smaller scale. The only extra material needed would be some cement and nails. The new house should be erected west of the school and the yard properly fenced with chicken wire. This location is subject to closer supervision as the school is situated on one side and the farming instructor's house on the other. It would also give plenty of yard and sufficient trees for shelter. The building would not interfere or detract from the present building as the location is between the horse barn and what is known as the carpenter shop. Poultry keeping, I consider, is an important sideline and one that should be encouraged. If we can create in the boys some interest in this line of work, perhaps it would result in the keeping of more poultry on the reserves.\n\nThe present garage is built of cement. It would appear as if either insufficient cement or dirty gravel was used at the time of erection; the walls are crumbling down in places and the roof is propped by heavy...\nheavy timbers. The structure is only held together by the reinforcements and even these have given away in places. I realize the building is not old and should have served many years, yet its usefulness is gone and I think the only solution is to take it down and build a new garage. A smaller building will meet all requirements.\n\nThe carpenter shop was also poorly constructed and is a very unattractive building. A coat of paint would greatly improve its appearance.\n\nThe retaining wall back of the school should be erected. It would protect the school foundation and retain the front of the root cellar, which is gradually moving forward from the main structure. It would also improve the yards which each spring are covered with mud washed down from the embankment. I feel this wall is absolutely necessary and trust it may be allowed.\n\nWe have had several complaints from the Hydro Electric re the condition of the electric wiring leading from the power line to the building. The distance is several hundred feet and we are responsible for the upkeep. A number of new poles are needed, as well as insulators. A quantity of new wire may also be required. Some of the wire in use is very old and the covering is gone. In places this exposed wire can easily be reached and is a danger to the children. I strongly recommend the necessary repair work be authorized. The cost will no doubt be in the neighbourhood of $250. or $300.\n\nThe water\nThe water supply remains at about the same level. The only change being a quicker return after a quantity has been used. The supply, in case of fire, would give little, if any, protection.\n\nI shall be glad to be advised regarding the Department's intentions in connection with the various recommendations contained herein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nReferring to the second last paragraph of my memorandum of the 16th ultimo, relative to the need for overhauling and renewing part of the electric wiring, poles, etc., at the Brandon Indian Residential School, and in reply to your enquiry as to the necessity of having this work done, as the school was only built five years ago, I have to say that this wiring is outside the buildings and was installed a number of years ago. It was used in connection with the old school building. Mr. Inspector Macdonald, who recently visited the school, states that the work required is in connection with the wiring leading from the power line to the building\u2014a distance of several hundred feet. A number of new poles are needed as well as insulators and a quantity of new wire. The Inspector states that some of the wire in use is very old, that the covering is gone and in places this exposed wire can easily be reached and is a danger to the children. He states, further, that there have been several complaints made by the Hydro Electric Company, regarding the condition of the electric wiring.\n\nI would request your approval for having the work carried out and also your direction as to the name of the electrical firm who should supply the material and perform the labour.\n\nI should also be pleased to receive your authority for incurring the expenditure in purchasing the paint required for the interior decorating of the school building, as mentioned in memorandum referred to above, and the names of the firms from whom quotations should be obtained for the supplying of the paint, oils, etc.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, June 8, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 209-11 of the 30th ultimo, submitting your report on your recent inspection of the Brandon Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased to note that conditions generally at this school are satisfactory, that the children are making progress in the classroom and that the school building is kept clean and good discipline maintained.\n\nRegarding the painting, the repairs and the supplying of a cold storage plant, I would say that it is intended to carry out certain painting during the coming summer, as follows:\n\nTo paint auditorium, children's dining room, boys' and girls' study and waiting room, and do some redecorating to a bungalow used by a member of the staff.\n\nIt is understood the labour would be performed by the school staff, without expense to the Department and that it will be necessary to supply only the paint and other materials required.\n\nFurther, it is proposed to overhaul and renew part of the electric wiring, poles, etc. These matters are now before the Honourable the Minister, for his approval.\n\nI regret there are no funds available this year to paint the exterior of the barns and other outbuildings or to erect a new chicken house and garage.\n\nThe need of building a retaining wall at the back of the school has been noted, but I regret that it will not be possible to authorize having the work done this year.\n\nRegarding the installing of a cold storage system, in the room provided for the purpose, I would request that you inform the Department of the type of system required and the approximate cost. When this information is received, consideration will be given as to whether funds for the purpose can be provided.\n\nWith reference to the renewal of the fire hose, I would request that you will state the length and the dimension of the hose and whether any couplings or nozzles should be supplied. An order could be placed here for this equipment. It is noted that there has been an improvement in the water supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. Macimes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. G.

Mr. Inspector Hamilton, in a report regarding the condition of the wiring, states that he estimated the cost of supplying new poles, insulators, any new wire required, and the labour would not exceed the sum of approximately, $300. It is hoped that the work can be carried out satisfactorily at a cost not exceeding this amount. After the work has been completed, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.

The Principal and the United Church authorities, under whose auspices the school is conducted, have been requesting, during the past three years, to have this equipment installed. Mr. Inspector Hamilton, also, has recommended the installation. A large amount of food is handled at an institution of this size, and cold storage equipment is really necessary, especially during the summer months.\n\nAt present, there is a building located behind the main building, which is used as storage for coal and vegetables and has a space partitioned off for the storage of ice, in which the meat and milk supplies are kept.

BUSKARD,\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 13th ultimo, directing that the paints and oils required for the interior decorating of the Brandon Indian Residential School be purchased from the Mitchell Hardware, Limited, of Brandon; and also to your recent telephone conversation, stating that this firm had been removed from the approved list, I would say that the Principal of the school was written on the 22nd instant. He was instructed that, if he had not already purchased the materials, he was to cancel the authority given him to obtain the paint from the above named firm and await further instructions as to where the purchase was to be made.\n\nA reply has been received from the Principal, in which he states that this transaction was completed some little time ago and that all the materials were obtained from the Mitchell Hardware, Limited.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nReferring to my memorandum of the 15th instant, regarding the supplying and installing of cold storage equipment in a room in the basement of the Brandon Indian Residential School, and your request to be informed if the Department recommend the expenditure and the reasons therefor, I would say that, when the school was erected, a room was provided in the basement for cold storage purposes. The Principal and the United Church authorities, under whose auspices the school is conducted, have been requesting, during the past three years, to have this equipment installed. Mr. Inspector Hamilton, also, has recommended the installation. A large amount of food is handled at an institution of this size, and cold storage equipment is really necessary, especially during the summer months.\n\nAt present, there is a building located behind the main building, which is used as storage for coal and vegetables and has a space partitioned off for the storage of ice, in which the meat and milk supplies are kept. This is an unsatisfactory arrangement.\n\nIn the interests of the health of the children and in order to save a considerable amount of inconvenience to the staff, I beg to strongly recommend the expenditure required, of approximately $650.00, in supplying and installing cold storage equipment in the basement of the school. Funds for the purpose are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education. I would respectfully submit for your approval that you authorize the expenditure and furnish the names of the firms from whom prices should be obtained.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOTTAWA,\nAugust 8, 1935.\n\nMR.

H. Brown, 144 - 12th Street,\nBrandon Heating & Plumbing Co.,\nF. Collins, Corner Fifth & Rosser.\n\nIt would be advisable to consult the Principal and obtain quotations for the equipment required from each of the above firms, and you may place the order with the firm quoting the lowest price. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed in the installing of the equipment and that a guarantee is received that it will be entirely satisfactory.\n\nAfter the equipment has been supplied and installed in a satisfactory manner, you should obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost. This, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.

A retaining wall to prevent flooding and washing down of the bank at the rear of the school. $500.\n\n2. A new garage and the tearing down of the present one. 1500.\n\nDoctor Doyle states the situation in connection with the present garage continues to become more serious. He does not think there is any immediate danger of the roof caving in, but the cracks in the cement beams are getting larger and he has no idea how much reinforcement they contain, adding that we might meet a disaster any time. The present building is constructed of cement and should be entirely demolished.\n\n3. Paint for the barns and other outbuildings $300.\n\n4. Paint for interior decoration 100.\n\n5.

Hamilton,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nCommercial Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Inspector Hamilton:\n\nAs stated in our conversation we appreciate very much the paint which the Department provided for painting certain rooms in the school building here. By the use of a good deal of oil in the first coat and turpentine in the second coat we were able to extend this paint over a good deal more surface than was planned in our estimate. The contrast now between the walls that have been done and those which have not is seriously noticeable. The two playrooms in the basement and the two hospital wards together with children's bathrooms and toilet rooms, also locker rooms in the basement, are very much in need of paint.\n\nFor the painting already done we engaged a painter from town, Mr. Moore, at a cost of over $60.00, but he gave much instruction and help to the boys so that they are now able to go forward and do very good work. If the Department will purchase the paint for the rooms specified we will have it put on and it will certainly make a great improvement to the appearance of the building. It will require approximately 20 gallons of paint, 2 gallons of oil and one of turpentine. The best price I could secure here for good reliable paint is from Johnson Hardware at $2.95 per gallon.\n\nWe will appreciate it very much if the above material can be furnished by the Dept. for this work. We appreciate your kind offices in this connection.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely\n\n(Sgd) J. A. Doyle\nSir:\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter received from Rev. Dr. Doyle, Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School, in which he requests a further supply of paint.\n\nI was at the Brandon School last week and can assure the Department that the paint supplied has greatly improved the condition of the school. The work has indeed been very well done. The contrast between the rooms painted and those left undone is very apparent. The hospital wards certainly should be painted in order that the walls may be washed down and kept clean. I might say that at the time of my visit, there were over thirty children sick with the 'flu and, some days prior to that, over sixty were in bed.\n\nThe material to cover the work mentioned in Doctor Doyle's letter will cost approximately $55.00 and I would appreciate being advised if funds are available to have the necessary work carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 2, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 209-11A U., of the 26th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication from the Principal of the Branden Indian Residential School, in which he requests a further supply of paint for the two play-rooms in the basement, the two hospital wards, the children's bathrooms and toilet rooms and the locker rooms in the basement.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure, not exceeding the sum of $65.00, in the purchase of the paint. This paint should be purchased from the best source of supply.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nIt is understood that the labour will be performed by the school authorities, without expense to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 12, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn Saturday morning, when I came across from the house to the school at a few minutes after six, I noticed a hole, about two feet square, in the east end of the horse barn at the point where the loft floor joins the wall. On investigation we found that a fire was burning just inside the wall. We immediately called the Fire Department and established a bucket line of boys and before the fire engine arrived we had the fire under control.\n\nI had the fire chief and one of his men go over the situation very carefully and in view of the fact that the fire had commenced right against the wall and that it had evidently been smoldering for some hours, also in view of the fact that the loft is inaccessible except to the bigger boys, and the entrance to it comes up through a feed chute, which is difficult to find, and that no sign of any tramp's bed was in evidence, the men of the fire department were quite satisfied that it was commenced by spontaneous combustion. Sweet clover and oat sheaves were run through the cutting box and blown in from the west gable last fall for winter feed. The floor of the loft at the east end had a thick covering of very fine sweet clover dust. This was about three inches deep at the wall. There was quite a heavy rain from the east during Thursday. The dampness from this had, no doubt, gone in through the cracks in the siding. Then, Friday was a very hot day, the sun beating in on that end of the barn, and while spontaneous combustion is a very rare occurrence, those who examined the situation think it quite possible and probable that this is the explanation of the fire.\nOttawa, May 18, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, informing the Department regarding a fire that occurred in the horse barn at the Brandon Indian Residential School and the action taken in extinguishing the fire. The Department is pleased that no extensive damage was incurred. It is noted that you had an investigation made by the Fire Chief and one of his men and they are of the opinion that the fire was caused by spontaneous combustion.\n\nIn order to prevent any recurrence from a similar cause, would it not be possible, after the hay and feed in the barn are used, to have the floors of the loft cleaned and all dust, seed and other rubbish removed? The lumber required for repairs can be included with the other repairs necessary before the barn is painted.\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton was informed of the funds available in carrying out certain work, painting, etc., at your school. He was requested to interview you and forward a recommendation concerning the work to be done, how it should be carried out, and the purchase of materials.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

We had it thoroughly cleaned out but the trouble continued during the winter. I have just had Messrs. Yates, Neale & Company examine it and they find that the tile in the field had become entirely plugged with earth. The whole field will have to be dug up, re-laid, and fresh gravel put in. It is nineteen or twenty years since this tank was put in and they claim that in soil like this the present condition is what might be expected. They assure me that the cost of this will not be more than $75.00 and probably somewhat less.\n\nWe have opened up the main pipe running through the field so that the water overflowing from the tank comes out on the open ground below the field. This, naturally, can only continue for a short while without becoming seriously objectionable both from the standpoint of appearance and odor.\n\nAwaiting your authority and direction in this matter,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, May 20, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, reporting on the condition of the septic tank in the Principal's residence at the Brandon Indian Residential School. It is noted that the tile in the field has become plugged with earth and that the whole field will have to be dug up, relaid and fresh gravel put in.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure, not exceeding the sum of $75.00, for the purpose of carrying out the work required in placing the septic tank in good condition. When the work has been completed, to your satisfaction, please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost of any materials supplied and for the labour. Regarding the labour, the account should state the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid.

Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to Department Letter 133-0-5 dated May 1st, I visited the Brandon Residential School last week and discussed with Dr. Doyle the work as outlined in the above letter. We are both of the opinion that the retaining wall should be built by day labour, having a competent foreman in charge. Dr. Doyle is anxious to have this work well done and the Department can count on his hearty co-operation. In doing the work with a competent foreman, some of the labour can be carried out by the senior boys and possibly most of the gravel could be hauled with the school teams.\n\nThe chicken house should also be built by day labour with a competent foreman in charge. A number of the senior boys could be used for this work and in this way the cost would be greatly reduced.\n\nIn connection with painting the barns and outbuildings, Dr. Doyle feels that an experienced painter and helper should be employed and they could do all the high parts of the buildings. The cost of this labour, of course, would be deducted from the $300 allowed.\n\nI trust the above recommendations will meet with the Department's approval. I would like to obtain instructions in connection with this work as soon as possible as Dr. Doyle is anxious to have some of it completed before the pupils are discharged for their summer holidays. An immediate reply will therefore be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

(main building)\n\nErecting new chicken house - 350.\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton, Winnipeg, discussed with the Principal the work outlined above. They are of opinion that the retaining wall should be built by day labour, having a competent foreman in charge. By doing the work under a competent foreman, some of the labour can be carried out by the senior boys of the school and most of the gravel hauled with school teams. The chicken house, also, could be built by day labour, with\n\n- a competent\na competent foreman in charge. A number of the senior boys could be used for this work, and, in this way, the cost would be reduced. In connection with painting the barns and outbuildings, an experienced painter and helper is required, as they would have to do all the high parts of the building. Mr. Inspector Hamilton would arrange for the purchase of the materials, paint, etc., and the Principal would oversee the work.\n\nI would request your approval to incur the expenditure required in carrying out the above work. I would request, also, that you will submit the name of the foreman to be employed in the work of building the retaining wall and the name of a foreman-carpenter to have charge of the work in building the chicken house. Further, I shall be pleased to receive the name of the firm from whom the paint, oil, etc., for the painting of the barns and outbuildings should be purchased and the name of an experienced painter to do the work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter dated May 19th and Department letter just received, No. 133-0-5, dated May 18th, I wish to advise that before the outbuildings at the Brandon Indian Residential School are painted, it will be necessary to have considerable repair work carried out. A quantity of shingles, siding and common lumber will be required, as well as some rubberoid roofing for use in connection with the silo. There are also some repairs necessary in connection with the fire reported by Dr. Doyle. In regard to this, I cannot yet understand how we escaped losing the barn. The origin of the fire, of course, is not known, but is believed to have been caused by spontaneous combustion.\n\nThere are three large barns and two silos to be painted and I do not think it is possible to do more than supply paint and labour for the $300.\n\nI would like authority to purchase the repair material necessary. The approximate cost should not exceed $40. I hope the Department will see fit to allow this as Dr. Doyle will be obliged to hire a carpenter to carry out some of the repair work.

I told them to secure the services of Messrs. Yates, Neale and Co. and have the necessary work done. It was found that one of the siphons had ceased to function and all three chambers of the tank were filled up. Our boys helped in the work as much as possible but the bill which I enclose herewith as Voucher 61 amounted to $121.69\u00a2.

The Treasury Board requires that you fill in the hours, each day, that Mr. G. W. Epton was employed, as in the case of the other men. The Treasury Board has also questioned the rate paid this man, viz.: $1.00 per hour. Is this the prevailing rate of wages in Brandon for work similar to that performed by G. W. Epton?

Reference the above I beg to report that Dr Doyle telephoned this office this date to say a potato digger had been stolen from in front of the implement shed at the Indian School sometime within the past three weeks but the exact time could not be stated.\n\n2. Acting upon instructions received, the writer patrolled to the Indian School in Pol. Car Code #3202, and interviewed Dr DOYLE in this connection. A description of the potato digger is as follows:\n\nInternational make, about 10 years old but paint still in tact, possibility tongue has been spliced, grease cups removed and ZEEK fittings put on in place of cups, kicker for carrying vines to one side has been removed, six foot chain carrier with about 50 out of 70 links in chain replaced by links built up by welding nickel steel on to old original links.\n\nWhile at the Indian School, the writer interviewed C.H.WALDRON, Supervisor of Farming operations, since Dr DOYLE is not very well acquainted with the facts in this case. WALDRON stated he had taken this digger out of the implement shed about July 1st, 1926, to allow the binders in and out and the digger was left at the east end of the shed. He could not state definitely when he last saw this digger but believed it has not been since about three weeks ago. He stated he had never seen any marks in the farm yard that would show the digger had been hauled away and had any such marks been made he would certainly have seen them since the digger was equipped with lugs on the rear wheels.\n\nThere are two roads leading to the Indian School and farm, one leading from the valley road directly in front of the school and the other road leads up from the valley road directly along back of the barns, this latter road is the one most likely used by the person who loaded the digger into a truck. Both roads are gravelled and it is impossible to see any tracks. Dr DOYLE stated he was quite sure a car or truck could come to the barns without anyone seeing them since there is no watchman at the school. There are no suspects in this theft.\n\nI would respectfully request that the above description be circularized in the next circular memorandum. Further enquiries will be made in this connection throughout this district and a report submitted at a later date.\n\nS.U.I.\nN.R.I.\n\nC.H.

It appears they received a report from you on the 21st ultimo, that a potato digger had been stolen from the front of the implement shed. It now appears that, upon investigation, the police were informed, by the farm instructor, that the potato digger had been returned to the school and that it had been borrowed by a farmer, named A. M. McPherson, of the Brandon district.\n\nThe Department considers it strange that this machine should be taken without a request being made for use of same by the party who moved it from the school premises. Is there any likelihood of any other farm machinery being taken? The Department does not desire that farm machinery be loaned to outside parties.\n\nI would request that you furnish a report regarding the potato digger. Is there not a shed, where all machinery could be stored when not in use?\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. J. A.

We have had a good deal of business transactions with these men in regard to livestock, etc., and we have occasionally accommodated them with the use of a trailer and the potato digger. Last fall they were late with their potatoes and borrowed our digger, stating that they would return it as soon as they were finished with the potato digger. We were all quite under the impression that it had been duly returned.\n\nWe keep as many of the implements as we can in an open shed west of the barns. We put the binders in at the back, the smaller implements, such as corn planter, corn binder, scuppers, etc., packed in the best we can. Then the seed drills come last. Before the binders were needed this year and while I was on my holidays the farm instructor had the boys take the smaller implements out so that the binders could be used. When I returned from holidays about the middle of July they told me very confidently that the potato digger had been removed from the shed with the other implements but that it was now missing.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nEXD.\n\nBrandon, Man., Oct. 5, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the past month a number of emergency repairs were found necessary in connection with our heating plant and water and sewerage system. I beg, therefore, to enclose herewith Voucher No. 70 in favor of Yates, Neale & Company for Sixty-four Dollars and Seventy Cents ($64.70).\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\n\nREV. J. A DOYLE, D.D.,\nPrincipal.\n\nJAD/W\nenc.\nSir:\n\nI have just received a request from Rev. Dr. Doyle, Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School, for permission to purchase four combination doors, with windows and screens, at an approximate cost of $46.00. These doors are for the rooms leading on to the fire escapes. The openings are on the north side of the building and there is no outside door. Dr. Doyle states that the only light entering these rooms is through the windows in the doors, consequently an outside door should be provided as the rooms are altogether too cold.\n\nDr. Doyle points out that the $350 allowed for the erection of a chicken house will not all be required and states that the doors can be supplied without exceeding the authority. I would like to have the Department's approval to make the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 27, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your 209-11A U., of the 23rd instant, you may authorize the Principal of the Brandon Residential School to incur an expenditure, not exceeding $46.00, in purchasing four combination doors, with windows and screens. It is noted that the cost of these doors can be obtained from the amount of $350.00 allowed for the erection of the chicken house and which amount has not been totally expended.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

In this connection, I beg to say that to keep within the $350.00 we were only able to secure three of these combination doors instead of four, as required.

One door is yet required, which will cost $11.50. This is for the cold side of the school and certainly should be supplied.\n\nFurther in his letter Dr. Doyle points out that the roof of the kitchen on the stockman's residence needs re-shingling. The roof leaks badly and, in the interests of economy and usefulness, new shingles should be supplied. Dr. Doyle is willing to do the work if the Department will supply the shingles. These will cost approximately $25.\n\nThe above are necessary repairs and I would appreciate having authority to arrange for the purchases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

Ltd., Brandon.\n\nDr. Doyle states,\n\"We got an estimate from Mr. Hickling for the work in the bungalow which was $40.00. This seems high to us and if the Department would allow $10.00 we could hire a man and with the aid of the boys could get this work done satisfactorily.\"\n\nThe boys need the training and I would recommend that they do the work and that $12.00 be allowed to hire a foreman. The total expense will be $151.73.\n\nParts of the buildings are in need of paint and if some work is carried out each year, we will be able to keep them in good condition. I would recommend that this expense be allowed and would appreciate having the necessary authority.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, March 30th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your 209-11A U. of the 24th instant, with reference to a request received from the Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School for paint valued at $139.75.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to let me have definite information regarding the quantities and colours of paint necessary, also the quantity and quality of the varnish. When this is received, the request will be placed before our Purchasing Agent. Incidentally, I might point out that, when applying in future, you should give complete information regarding what is required in order to save correspondence.\n\nIt is noted that Dr. Doyle mentions that the painting could be done by the boys under the charge of a foreman. Do you consider a foreman really necessary for the painting mentioned? It is felt that some member of the school staff should be able to supervise the boys when painting these rooms.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G.

Yates, Neale & Company for Twenty-three Dollars, Sixty Cents ($23.60), for clearing drain pipe to septic tank in connection with residence of Principal.\n\nBefore New Year the water supply here became inadequate and it did not rise in the house to the bathroom all winter and for the past two months or more it only occasionally came into the hot water tap in the kitchen. This meant that all our washing had to be done at the school and practically no hot water was turned into the sewer. The result was that the pipe froze up, commencing, no doubt, at the trap just before it enters the septic tank and backing up from there to the cellar. This accounts for the bill enclosed.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.
