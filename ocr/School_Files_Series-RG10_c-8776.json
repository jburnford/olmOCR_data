Neary, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI have had the good fortune of employing a night-watchman for our school beginning the first of January. If my memory serves me right it seems possible that we can get not only assistance in paying his salary but also that the Dept. will install time-clocks to insure careful guardianship of the building during the night hours. For our school I think two clocks would be sufficient, one in the engine-room and one on the main floor. If it is possible to have these supplied I would be pleased to receive them. Would you also inform us as to the proper procedure regarding the salary and the amount allowed by the Dept.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: St. Joseph's Creek Pipeline - Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of December 24th we have received the memorandum from the Director of Indian Affairs dated January 4, 1949 in which we are advised that a transfer of $200.00 will be made to complete the work on the St. Joseph's Creek pipeline at Kootenay Residential School.\n\nWe have not, however, yet received approval from you to accept the offer of Messrs. Patmore Brothers of Cranbrook, B.C. to complete the pipework inside the school at a cost of $560.00. This matter appears to be urgent as it will take this Firm about two months to obtain the necessary material and we would like to have the installation completed during the present fiscal year.\n\nCould we now please have approval to accept this tender.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 14, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nFor some years past, we have provided an amount in our estimates in order to make an allowance towards the salary of night watchmen at certain of our Indian Residential Schools which we consider are not fireproof. The usual allowance is for a period of seven months at $60. a month.\n\nFrom time to time some officials have expressed the opinion that an allowance for night watchmen should be paid at all Government-owned Residential Schools.\n\nWe have just received a request for an allowance towards the salary of a night watchman at the Kootenay School at which school we have not previously made any allowance. We are aware that practically all our schools employ a special night watchman during the heating season and we feel that it would be in the best interest of all parties concerned for the Department to allow a grant towards the salary of the night watchman at these schools at which no allowance is made at the present time.\n\nI would appreciate having your approval.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/RM.\nAIR MAIL\n\n29th January, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe recently received a request from the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School for an allowance towards the salary of the night watchmen, effective 1st January, 1949.\n\nFor several years past we have been allowing a grant towards the salary of a night watchman for the period October to the following April at those Schools where we considered a definite fire hazard existed. The schools at which this allowance is being paid were selected some years ago, and no recent additions have been made to the list. As a matter of fact, we are not making any allowance towards the salary of a night watchman at any of the Government-owned Residential Schools in the province of British Columbia.\n\nWhen we received the Principal's request, we submitted a memorandum to the Deputy Minister asking his opinion regarding the payment of an allowance towards the salary of a night watchman. His reply was as follows:\n\n(1) Allowance must not be paid to a present member of the staff.\n(2) Allowance must be paid only to schools which are certified by an engineer as subject to special danger by fire.\n\nIn the case of the Kootenay Residential School, I note the following statement contained in the report submitted to us by Donald Inspection Limited in connection with their inspection of the Kootenay Residential School on 11th September, 1948:\n\n......2\n\"In addition to this, there should also be an elevated water tank of not less than 20,000 gallons capacity. At present a small air pump pumps pressure to a tank which has been buried in the ground. So long as it is only used for domestic purposes there should be no trouble, but should you have a fire and any quantity of water is taken from this tank, the pressure is dropped and no water will be available for fire fighting purposes.\"\n\nIn view of this report which was made by an engineer, it would appear that the Kootenay Residential School might be considered as one at which an allowance could be made towards the salary of the night watchman during the months mentioned in the first part of my letter.\n\nHowever, when we allow a grant for a night watchman at one school, we generally receive similar requests from other schools; and consequently before replying to the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School, we would like to have your comments and at the same time, you might state if you consider there are any other Government-owned schools in British Columbia at which any such allowance should be made, keeping in mind the conditions laid down by the Deputy Minister.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

Perry of the Public Health Engineering Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare, Vancouver, B.C., we have received the following from Mr. Cornish which deals with this report of Mr. Perry and gives a little more information:\n\n\"The only proposed uses of unchlorinated creek water not covered in the report are for feeding stock in the barn and for cooling milk in the dairy. Untreated creek water is now used for these purposes. I understand that there is no objection from a public health point of view to use polluted water for feeding stock; that is, no pollution can be carried from the drinking water to the milk. However, such water should not be used for cleansing cows and precautions will need to be taken on that point. At present there are several exposed taps in the barn and these are to be eliminated if possible otherwise reduced to the essential minimum and marked. The troughs for cooling water should have covers with holes through which the milk cans are inserted so that there is no exposed water surface. It should be borne in mind that the installation to supply creek water to the barn and dairy are to be made by school authorities and that this Division will not be responsible for such work.\"\n\nIndian Affairs are advised to see that the recommendations of Mr. Perry and Mr. Cornish are carried out in order that the contaminated water from St. Joseph's Creek shall not be used in its raw state in a manner which might affect the health of those using it.\n\nA.M.\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

Father Kelly. The main topic of conversation was, of course, the possibility of having this school connected with the East Kootenay Power line at the Wasa substation.\n\nYou will recall that in our Estimates we have the sum of $8,100 for this purpose, together with an item for $2,000 to effect the minor improvements to the school wiring, etc. I really feel it is imperative that the school get the benefit of East Kootenay Power. The present arrangements for ironing, which are really pathetic, should be replaced and other electrical services which are not possible under the present system provided. I am quite sure we can utilize the present diesel engine which generates power at present to good advantage elsewhere.\n\nThis letter is merely to remind you of this matter and in the hope that it will remain in the Estimates and enable us to go ahead with this much needed improvement at as early a date as possible.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nBernard F. Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n9th March, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of 1st March, 1949, with reference to electricity for the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nFor your personal information I may say that we included an amount of $10,000.00 in the main appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50 for the purpose mentioned. Our estimates have not yet been approved by Parliament, but I feel certain that the amount will be allowed.\n\nHowever, on reviewing our file, I found your letter of 28th August, 1948, enclosing a copy of a letter addressed to Superintendent Dunn from the East Kootenay Power Company, Limited. In your letter you recommend a three phase line on which the power company quoted a price of $10,893.20 and as a matter of fact, this amount was not a firm bid.\n\nWe note from your letter of 1st March, 1949, that you estimate the cost of the improvements to the school wiring to be $2,000.00. On the prices quoted the total expenditure would be approximately $13,000.00. It is our intention to make every effort to secure the additional amount over and above what has already been provided in the appropriation, but in the meantime, I think it would be to our mutual advantage if you could secure the following information:\n\n......2\n1. Another quotation from the East Kootenay Power Company, giving a firm bid if possible on the cost of supplying a three phase line to the Kootenay School.\n\n2. A quotation from two or more reliable electricians, tendering on the electrical work required to effect the necessary improvements to the school wiring.\n\nIt is possible that Mr. Webb of the Lands and Development Services Branch has already made some enquiries along the above lines, as following receipt of the Donald Inspection Company report on the Kootenay School, we wrote to the Lands and Development Services Branch. We are not certain if the Head Office here have written to Mr. Webb.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Kootenay Indian Residential School, St. Joseph's Creek Pipeline.\n\nWith reference to your marginal notation on Mr. MacKay's memorandum of January 4th regarding the above, we would advise that according to recent advice received from our Field Engineer it is now expected that this work will be completed by the 31st of March.\n\nUnder the circumstances it is expected that all funds made available for this work will be spent.\n\nJ.V.

I think, however, that in the case of the Lejac School we will let the matter stand, unless the matter of an allowance is raised by the Principal.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n15th March, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instent regarding the request for an allowance towards the salary of a night watchman at the Kootenay Residential School. In view of your recommendation, we are advising Superintendent Dunn that an allowance of $60.00 a month towards the salary of a night watchman will be allowed for the period 1st January to 30th April, 1949.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n15th March, 1949.\n\nMr. J.S. Dunn,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nWe recently received a request from Rev. G.F. Kelly, O.M.I., Principal of the Kootenay Residential School, for an allowance towards the salary of a night watchman. In connection with the request, I may say that the Deputy Minister has ruled as follows:\n\n(1) Allowance for a night watchman must not be paid to a present member of the staff.\n\n(2) Allowance must be paid only to schools which are certified by an engineer as subject to special danger by fire.\n\nWe wrote to Indian Commissioner Arneil and he has recommended that we make an allowance towards the salary of a night watchman, due to the fact that one of the Departmental engineers recently reported that there is a fire hazard at the Kootenay School. We presume from the contents of Father Kelly's letter that the man employed is not one of the regular members of the staff.\n\nIn view of the above, it has been decided to allow $60.00 a month towards the salary of a night watchman at the Kootenay School for the period 1st January to 30th April, 1949. For your information I may say that at schools where an allowance is made...\ntowards the salary of a night watchman, it is our usual practice to make this payment from 1st October to the following 30th April. However, as Father Kelly's letter stated that the night watchman only commenced duties on 1st January, 1949, we are only making allowance for four months.\n\nBefore the next heating season commences if you consider conditions warrant such assistance, you should apply in September for an allowance towards the salary of a night watchman for the period 1st October, 1949, to 30th April, 1950.\n\nFor your guidance I enclose a sample of the Voucher which should be forwarded.\n\nPP/ST Attach.\n\nBernard F.

C.\n\nRe: Electric Power\nKootenay Residential School\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 17th, 1949, your file 5-11-4, I am enclosing herewith, an estimate submitted by Modern Electric, Cranbrook, B.C. on cost of adapting the wiring system in the above noted school building to alternating current from direct current now employed.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that consideration be given to installation of the shallow well master pumping system at an estimated extra cost of $91.15. This unit is a direct motor driven turbo pump that will eliminate adjustments required in maintaining the belt driven piston pump of uncertain vintage now in use. Our fire hydrants are serviced by this system and any failure to maintain this old pump in first class condition may find it inadequate in an emergency.\n\nIt is uncertain at this time of other estimates being submitted. The Cranbrook Electric are interested in submitting an estimate but due to lack of specifications required will need additional time. If and when this Company submit an estimate I will forward same immediately.\n\nJ. S.

C. The estimate includes the necessary step down transformers to provide approximately 20 H.P., 230/115 volt, 60 cycle supply at the Mission together with lightning arrestors, cut-outs and metering equipment. The total amount of the estimate is $10,893.20.\n\nOur rate for power from this extension and the conditions of service would be the same as that in effect to the Department of Transport from the same substation, and is covered in detail in our standard contract, three copies of which are enclosed. The ownership of the line would rest with your Department, with our Company carrying out any necessary maintenance on a cost plus 10% basis, such maintenance to include a minimum of four patrols per year. In this connection you will notice that the contract is made out for 66,000 volt supply, being at the high tension side of the Wasa substation the point of delivery.\n\nAlso, kindly note that it will be necessary for your Department to obtain permission from the Department of Transport for this use of their substation.\n\nOur ability to carry out this construction will depend on the delivery of material and on the prior requirements of our normal maintenance program.\nWe have also to advise that at the present time this offer to supply must of necessity be on an if, as and when power is available basis.\n\nShould you decide to proceed with this installation would you kindly forward two signed copies of the contract to this office, together with the necessary work authorization.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEAST KOOTENAY POWER COMPANY, LIMITED\n\nE. W. King,\nElectrical Engineer.\nMr. W. S. Arneil\n\nMarch 31, 1949.\n\nThe Power Company requests that this Department obtain the required permission from the Department of Transport to make the extension from the Wasa Airport substation.\n\nIf the contract between the Rev. Principal and the Power Company meets with approval I will have this contract completed on return to this office.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nSuperintendent.\n\nJSD:FSB\nENC.\nMr. W. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.

C., on the cost of building the proposed 3 phase power line, three and one half miles from Wasa substation to our school.\n\nI am also enclosing, for your information, duplicate copies of the proposed contract on power metered on the secondary side of the main transformer situated at the point of delivery (Wasa substation) between the Rev. Principal of the School and the Power Company.\n\nThe question of obtaining a right-of-way through the St. Mary's I.R. No. 1 will have to be taken up with the Band. No difficulty is anticipated in this regard but I would respectfully suggest that any acceptance of the Power Company's estimate contain a note relative to employment preference to Indians in clearing the right-of-way.\n\nThe if, as and when power is available basis is not anticipated to interfere with delivery of power to the school due to the small amount of energy required.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nThe attached voucher covers account of Patmore Bros. to installation of toilet in the boys' new dormitory with an additional charge over $50.00 estimate of $28.60 for altering Fire water main.\n\nRepairs to the former attic to make additional dormitory space left the water main and hose rack in the middle of the main exit and it became apparent that the fire main would have to be moved to a more suitable position.\n\nI was aware of this situation some time ago but failed to remember to write you for authority to meet this additional expense.\n\nI trust that you may find it possible to recommend that this account be met in full.\n\nJ.

We are writing to the Department of Transport in order to secure their consent.\n\nYou mention that the East Kootenay Power Company are submitting \"a firm tender\". On reviewing their letter dated March 28th, it reads \"The total amount of the estimate is $10,893.20\". We presume that you feel that the cost of installing electricity will not exceed the amount estimated by the Company.\n\nWhile your letter of April 5th stated that you were endeavouring to secure competitive tenders for the school wiring, at the present time we have only received the Modern Electric tender. We would like to have competitive tenders before submitting the matter to the Minister.\n\nThe attached form which was enclosed with your communication applies to the cost of the\n\n......2\nelectric current. This will have to be signed by the school management, because as you know the Department is prepared to provide installation of the new wiring, but the cost of the current consumed is paid by the school management from their funds.\n\nPP/ST Attach.\n\nBernard N.

The ownership of the line would rest with your Department, with our Company carrying out any necessary maintenance on a cost plus 10% basis, such maintenance to include a minimum of four patrols per year. In this connection you will notice that the contract is made out for 66,000 volt supply, being at the high tension side of the Wasa substation the point of delivery.\n\nAlso, kindly note that it will be necessary for your Department to obtain permission from the Department of Transport for this use of their substation.\n\nOur ability to carry out this construction will depend on the delivery of material and on the prior requirements of our normal maintenance program.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 884-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWe have also to advise that at the present time this offer to supply must of necessity be on an if, as and when power is available basis.\n\nShould you decide to proceed with this installation would you kindly forward two signed copies of the contract to this office, together with the necessary work authorization.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEAST KOOTENAY POWER COMPANY, Limited\n\n(sgd) E.

He will visit the Kootenay School about the end of July. At that time he will decide what wiring should be installed.\n\nAs soon as we have a reply to our letter of May 21st, which you acknowledged on May 26th, we will arrange for the necessary Order-in-Council accepting the quotation of the East Kootenay Power Company.\n\nThe delay that may incur in connection with the wiring of the building will not hinder the East Kootenay Power Company proceeding with their work as soon as we obtain the necessary Order-in-Council. The power line can be brought to the transformer near the school, but the wiring should, of course, not be attached to the wiring of the school until new wiring is installed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

This ruined the hard rubber measuring disc of the meter so the adjustment and regulation of the hypo-chlorinator will have to be postponed until a new disc has been received from the Hypo-chlorinator manufacturers.\n\nMr. Snelson reports that all works in connection with this project have been completed satisfactorily, including drilling holes and placing 4\" pipes through walls, installing injector feed to boiler and all piping in connection with the hypo-chlorinator.\n\nThe Indian Agent and the school authorities should be cautioned with regard to the use of raw water from St. Joseph's Creek. Care is especially necessary with regard to the use of water from the two outside standpipes where raw water is used for irrigation. This water from St. Joseph's Creek is contaminated.\n\nR.A.

Dunn's request for authority for expenditures in connection with repairs to the boilers at the above-mentioned school, I am forwarding Mr. Dunn's letter dated August 18th regarding additional expenditures, details of which are as follows:\n\nLabour and materials to connect soft water line to the high pressure steam boiler in the school ........................................ $25.25 (as recommended by Boiler Inspector Haisall)\n\nConnection of high pressure boiler in the dairy to the water line, etc... Labour 18.83 Material 24.75 $43.58\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise if funds are available to cover the above-mentioned expenditures or any part of them.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nThe Rev. Principal has turned over an account from Patmore Bros. in the amount of $68.83 for labour and materials to connect soft water line to the High Pressure steam boiler in the Residential School, and to connecting the High Pressure boiler in the dairy to the water line and installing steam mains to equipment, injector, etc.\n\nThe first part of this account in the amount $25.25, material and labour, was requested by Mr. Halsall, Boiler Inspector, Department of Public Works in his report of June 11th, 1949, and should apparently be a proper charge to the Department.\n\nThe latter part of this account, $18.83 labour and $24.75 for material, may be considered a proper charge to the School as they did agree to doing the labour in connection with construction of the new dairy. However, the amount of free labour already expended by the School has been considerable. In addition to construction, two water lines were connected and a sewer line run out at considerable expense for digging and material.\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\n\nAugust 18, 1949.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that authorization be given to meet the cost of work on the High Pressure boiler in the School, $25.35, and that the account for the dairy building, $43.58 be met also by the Department at least in part, $24.75 for material.\n\nJ.

C.\n\nRe: Telephone Communication\nKootenay Residential School\n\nWith reference to my letter of October 18th, 1947, in connection with the unsatisfactory condition of the above noted. The pole line, 4.5 miles, Highway No. 4, to the School is now beyond repair. Some thirty poles are down and unfit for resetting and of the remainder, Mr. D. Miller, local Manager, East Kootenay Telephone Company, is unwilling to allow any of his men to climb these poles due to their hazardous condition.\n\nThe Telephone Company, up until the present, has been unwilling to give any estimate or assurance of repairing this line. However, Mr. Miller informs me that No. 3 poles, butt-treated, are now available and that his men could now install this line if so desired.\n\nMr. Miller estimates cost of this line complete, providing Father Kelly provides his proposed low cost labour as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 130 butt-treated No. 3 poles, fixtures, and line restrung @ $9.00 each | $1,170.00 |\n| 2 high lead poles to clear C.F.R.

One informing me of the cheque as advance payment on the Quarter, which I subsequently received, and the second regarding the Roneo Duplicator. It has not yet arrived but when it does I will write you as requested. I was very pleased to hear that it was coming.\n\nI am wondering if you can do anything to accelerate matters regarding our electric power. We have it within forty feet of the building but seem to have run into a stalemate from there on. With it so close it seems a shame to pass another winter with the present unsatisfactory plant.\n\nHere are the details. In June we were informed that an Order in Council had granted ten thousand dollars for the construction of a power line from the East Kootenay Power Co's substation to the residential school. Following that we were asked by Commissioner Arneil to obtain two estimates by local firms regarding the work to be done in the school building. After these had been sent to Ottawa a letter was received by our Superintendent, Mr. J.S. Dunn, that an electrical engineer would be sent here from the Lands and Development Branch to inspect the school and pass on what was needed. He was to arrive here in July. To date we have not seen him nor have we any information as to what office he was to come from.\n\nWhen the Power Company got the building of the line under way, Supt. Dunn again wrote requesting that the engineer come so that this work could be completed before winter. When the line was completed two weeks ago I contacted Commissioner Arneil by telephone to enquire what was to be done about the school. He said he had just written Mr. Neary about it and would follow it up from there. However we are still waiting for the desired electrical engineer. While we are very pleased to see the line built and the power so close we are most anxious to get it attached to the school so that we can have its benefit for the winter months.\n\nIf you can find out where the delay is and do anything to bring those responsible for it to see the inconvenience being caused we would be very grateful.\n\nAssuring you of our continued cooperation in all matters, I remain,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nG.F.

The management of the school is anxious to secure the electric power, and we would appreciate it if you would let us know as soon as possible if your engineer has reported what wiring is required.\n\nPP/ST Director.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

Dunn's letter of November 24th and communication dated November 19th from the Rev. Principal of the above school, is the result of a comment by Mr. Kosnar, Electrical Engineer of the Engineering and Construction Division, with regard to the inadequacy of fire escape facilities from the new dormitory recently arranged at the Kootenay school.\n\nIt is not entirely clear to us just what fire escape facilities should be provided but you will note in the correspondence the suggestion that a Provincial Fire Marshal visit the school. We favour this suggestion but anticipate that we will receive recommendations involving the expenditure of substantial amounts and it occurs to me that the Department might prefer to have an Engineer of the Engineering and Construction Division investigate and report.

Current. He said he would have to recommend many changes in the present wiring and lighting arrangement. He promised to get the matter through as speedily as possible on his return to Ottawa. It is now two months since his survey and we have had no further word on developments. We are in the predicament of having adequate power forty feet from the building and still we are continuing on with this antiquated system. Would you be kind enough to trace up this matter and find out where the delay is. He told me not to expect any action for a month due to the various depts. through which his recommendations would have to pass. But since two months have now passed I fear that this matter has been ditched into somebody's file until next year. I would appreciate it very much if you could find out how soon we can expect action on this matter which grows more urgent every day and which we would like very much to have cleared up.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, British Columbia.\n\nFollowing a report submitted by the Donald Inspection Company at the above, in which they recommended that the existing lighting in all buildings be improved, Major MacKay indicated in his memorandum to you dated the 4th of December, 1945, that an inspection would probably be necessary in view of the fact that they were contemplating servicing the building with hydro power and a complete change in the wiring system would be required.\n\nOur memorandum to you dated the 21st of May last, pointed out that the inspection would be carried out during a western inspection trip to be made in the fall in British Columbia. The inspection has been made and following is our report and recommendations for work which we consider should be carried out.\n\nThe present power supply consists of a 10 K.W. 110 volt direct current diesel electric generating unit which is located adjacent to the boiler room in the Residential School basement. Last year the Indian Affairs Branch entered into an agreement with the East Kootenay Power Company for the construction of approximately 36 miles of 3 phase primary distribution lines from the Wapiti substation. The line has been completed and transformers installed on a pole at the rear of the school for the provision of single phase 115/230 volt and 3 phase 230 volt 3 phase 60 cycle power supply. The reason for the inspection was to determine what work was necessary not only to convert the present electrical system so that it would be capable of receiving this new type of energy, but also to determine if any additional work is necessary.\n\nThe buildings located at the site consist of the following in addition to the Residential School Buildings\u2014 Barn, Manual Training Building, Dairy, Hen Houses and Forge Building. The barn is at present wired but is in poor condition and it will be necessary to have this building re-wired. The out buildings, with the exception of the ones have no electrical service and it is our opinion that this work should be undertaken at the same time the changes and alterations are being carried out in the Residential School. The percentage of total cost of all the electrical work at the site chargeable to the out buildings, would be small, probably in the order of 20%.\n\nThe wiring in the Residential School was installed in concealed rigid steel conduit at the time of construction in 1911. The lighting however, is very poor throughout, especially in areas such as classrooms and the sewing room where the seeing tasks are at a high level. It will be necessary to re-design the lighting by providing additional outlets and fixtures to...\nbring it up to present day standards. In this building, as in the majority of buildings wired in the same time period, there are no plug receptacles provided in the original layout for portable equipment. As a result of the lack of sufficient lighting and plug receptacle outlets, considerable extensions have been made, many in a very amateurish manner, and it will be necessary to make alterations and additions to provide a reliable electrical system throughout the school.\n\nIroning facilities are very inadequate in that all ironing is done by hand by heating flat irons on the sides of a tapered vertical wood burning stove. This is a dangerous practice as the stove is left unattended during heating periods and presents a definite fire hazard. Apart from the danger of fire, the floor space necessary for the stove and wood fuel storage makes very inefficient use of the room in which this equipment is housed, and in our opinion a steam mangle for the larger pieces of laundry together with sufficient electric hand irons, should be provided.\n\nIn discussing the laundry operations with the Principal, our officer was informed that great difficulty was experienced with drying facilities. The school is equipped with a heated drying enclosure in which the laundry is hung from removable racks. The difficulty here is undoubtedly due to the lack of air circulation and we are of the opinion that an exhaust fan installation would provide the necessary circulation and removal of damp air from the enclosure, thus eliminating the present practice of removing the heated moisture laden laundry for drying in other areas.\n\nThe present direct current motors on the water system and laundry equipment will require replacing by alternating current motors.\n\nThe distribution system throughout the school will have to be changed from 2 wire 110 volts to 3 wire 115/230 volts and it is contemplated that the majority of existing conduit runs can be re-used, using thermo-plastic insulated conductors of the required capacities.\n\nThe fire escapes at the school, in our opinion, do not offer sufficient facilities for easy removal of the children in case of fire, especially from the dormitories that have recently been built in the attic space. The Indian Affairs Branch is aware of this situation; reference Major MacKay's memorandum dated the 15th of December with correspondence attached thereto and our reply of the 22nd ultimo.\n\nSummarizing the foregoing, we recommend that the Indian Affairs Branch undertake the following work at the school in addition to revising the electrical distribution system to receive the East Kootenay Power supply.\n\n1. Improve the existing lighting to bring it up to modern standards.\n2. Wire the existing out-buildings.\n3. Improve the ironing facilities by the provision of a steam mangle and electric hand irons.\n4. Provide an exhaust fan for the laundry drier.\n5. Make alterations and additions to the present fire escapes.\n\nDrawings are in the process of preparation for the changeover to the new electrical service and an early reply regarding the above recommendations will enable us to complete our plans and specifications in the near future. Our proposal in connection with the fire escapes will be forwarded to the Indian Affairs Branch upon completion.\n\nChief.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, British Columbia.\n\nFollowing a report submitted by the Donald Inspection Company at the above, in which they recommended that the existing lighting in all buildings be improved, Major MacKay indicated in his memorandum to you dated the 4th of December, 1948, that an inspection would probably be necessary in view of the fact that they were contemplating servicing the building with hydro power and a complete change in the wiring system would be required.\n\nOur memorandum to you dated the 21st of May last, pointed out that the inspection would be carried out during a western inspection trip to be made in the fall in British Columbia.

Arneil, Commissioner,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil: Re; Fire Escapes on Above Building\n\nFurther to our telephone conversation of this morning I would like to add a few lines to clarify my suggestions regarding fire escapes.\n\nMr. J. McCormack of Blair Iron Works, Vancouver, arrived here yesterday bearing blue-prints of the school with instructions to take measurements for new fire-escapes. On looking at the plans I found certain things which I did not think quite advisable and so with all due respect to the engineer who drew them up I would offer these suggestions.\n\n1. Re: The Rear Elevation. As you will see by the plans two escapes come from the third floor to a common landing and thence to the ground. This means that girls in one dormitory can go down the fire escape to the landing and up to the boys dormitory and vice versa. As this would be on the back of the building away from the Prefects it would be a very convenient passage. While at present we are free of any such trouble we don't want to set up an arrangement which would be so convenient. It may be suggested that an electric bell with a switch in the jam of the door leading into the fire escapes, which would operate when the door is opened, would remedy any possible danger. Anyone who has attended boarding school and who wanted to go out to a show knows that a pen knife inserted in the door-jam will silence the bell. Moreover the arrangement as suggested on the plan calls for the removal of a balcony from the rear of the school to be replaced by the fire escape landing. Whoever drew up the plan probably thinks this balcony is useless but to us it has its importance. It adjoins the Sister's living room and as we have screened in this balcony it is a very convenient place for the Sisters. The Sisters use it and would be very sorry to lose it. It would be replaced by a landing it is true but this landing would have no roof over it and could not be screened in so would be unsatisfactory for any other purpose except escaping from fire.\n\nFor these reasons I find the plan as outlined by Mr. McCormack quite unsatisfactory. I have suggested to him how the job can be done and the protection made adequate without removing the balcony or giving a free passage from one dormitory to the\nother. When this building was constructed individual fire escapes were on the back of this building but subsequently they were removed to the ends. We have followed quite closely the original course which these took.\n\nII) The End Elevation. Four windows are shown on the end elevation. The two nearer the centre of the building have been chosen as exits for the fire escape. I would suggest using the two nearer the corners. From the outside it looks as though either are feasible however on the inside there is a difference. The two windows nearer the centre have a heating coil more than half way across them. For the present sash which raise up and down this is satisfactory but the new plan calls for windows opening in and these heating coils rise four inches above the bottom of the sash. Therefore in order to operate windows opening in these heating coils will have to be removed. This entails changing the feed lines which come from the basement. Moreover the heating coils are properly placed where they now are and it will be difficult to find another place where they will be suitable. The expense of moving them would be considerable. Whereas if the windows nearer the corners of the building be used as exits there are no obstructions in front of them. By using them a more gentle slope would be maintained on the fire escape stairs as the distance from these windows to the centre platform as outlined in the drawing is greater. For these reasons I would suggest using the windows nearest the corners of the building. This applies to both the south and the north elevation. The heating arrangements are similar on both ends.\n\nThis letter may sound like the obstructionists point of view, however it is not meant in that light. An installation of this kind which is to be a permanent arrangement should I think call for considerable thought and planning. I trust that the above suggestions will be considered and the best possible arrangement from every point of view worked out.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nP.S. Whatever decision may be made please save the balcony. The accommodation for the Sisters is confined enough without removing this access to fresh air.\n\nThank you.\nBLAIR IRON WORKS\nShelly Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMarch 28, 1950\n\nDominion Power & Water Bureau\n744 West Hastings Street\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nYour file No. 25720-2\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Fire Escapes-Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nWe quote you as per our tender dated Feb. 14/50, with the following addition:\n\nThe Fire Escape as shown for the rear elevation of the building shall have two more additional stairs added from the lower balcony to the roof of the boiler room.\n\nOur new price including this addition is: Six thousand, six hundred and thirty-six dollars and fifty-two cents ($6,636.52), including Dom. 8% sales tax but not Prov. 3%.\n\nYours truly\n\nBLAIR IRON WORKS\n\nPer \"Jack Blair\"\n\nJDB/IS\n\nProposal No. 1.\n\n\"Rec'd March 29/50\nMr. Robinson\"\nBLAIR IRON WORKS\n\nShelly Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMarch 28, 1950\n\nDominion Power & Water Bureau\n744 West Hastings Street\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nYour File No. 25720-2\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Fire Escapes-Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nWe submit our revised quotation for Supply and Erection of:\n\n4 only separate fire escapes.\n\nOur price on these is now: Seven thousand, nine hundred and twenty-three dollars and fifty-two cents ($7,923.52), including Dom. 8% sales tax but not Prov. 3%.\n\nYou may refer to our letter dated Feb. 14/50 for specifications and type of work that we would do.\n\nWe hope this will prove satisfactory to you.\n\nYours truly\n\nBLAIR IRON WORKS\n\nPer: \"Jack Blair\"\n\nProposal No. 2\n\n\"Rec'd March 29/50\nMr. Robinson\"\nC.V.F.

ARNEILL\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER FOR B.C.\nMarch 29, 1950.\n\nMr. C.V.F. Weir,\nChief, Engineering & Construction Service,\nDept. of Resources & Development,\nNorlite Building,\nOttawa.\n\nI am enclosing confirmation of my Army Signals message of today's date requesting that the submission to Council for acceptance of Blair Iron Works' tender for installation of fire escapes, Kootenay Residential School, be withheld.\n\nThe attached letter dated March 24th from the Reverend Principal of the school indicates why this action was requested. You will note that he objects to the installation of the structures as shown on the plan on the rear elevation of the building for two reasons:\n\n(1) The common fire escape landing from the girls' and boys' dormitories permits of access from one dormitory to another so readily that there is bound to be difficulty with the boys entering the girls' dormitory and vice versa.\n\nI am of the opinion that Father Kelly's fears in this respect are well founded.\n\n(2) The installation as shown on the plan necessitates the removal of a balcony which has been screened for the use of the Sisters whose accommodation is already too confined, without losing this access to the fresh air.\n\nFather Kelly also objects to the installation as shown on the plan of the end elevation, but the difficulties he\nsuggests will be encountered can be easily overcome, and it is considered that the fire escapes on the end elevation should be proceeded with as planned.\n\nTo revert to the fire escape on the rear elevation, we have gone into this matter thoroughly with our engineering staff and Mr. Blair of the Blair Iron Works, and on the attached plan have indicated two proposals, No. 1 of which will obviate access from the boys' dormitory to the girls' dormitory, but still necessitates the removal of the balcony, and No. 2, which will obviate both the disadvantages mentioned by Father Kelly. Of these two proposals we of course favour No. 2 as shown in yellow on the plan on which Blair Iron Works reference their letter of March 28th, quoted a price of $7,923.52. On the alternative proposal as shown in red on the plan, the Company quotes a price of $6,636.52.\n\nHaving in mind that these escapes are permanent installations and that the school will likely be in use for years to come I would strongly recommend approval of Proposal No. 2 and acceptance of Blair Iron Works tender of $7,923.52. I might add that the Blair Iron Works are proceeding with the accepted contract by making the fire escapes for the ends of the building but will defer any work on the fire escapes under question pending further advice.\n\nW.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMarch 30, 1950.\n\nYou will note from copy of letter attached, dated March 29th., to Mr. C.V.F. Weir, relative to the recent contract awarded to the Blair Iron Works, Vancouver, to erect fire escapes at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, that some difficulty is being experienced as to the adequacy of the work involved in the contract.\n\nIt will be recalled we experienced somewhat similar difficulties in connection with the contract to install fire escapes at the Kuper Island Residential School. The difficulties that confront us with these contracts seem inevitable despite the most careful and accurate preparation of plans and specifications in Ottawa, when one has in mind that due to minor structural and other changes made in the past to buildings without, in all cases, the knowledge of the Department, and in others without changes made being duly noted on the original plans.\n\nTo correct this situation and thus avoid repetition, I feel that in future the required plan should be designed and drawn and specifications prepared by an Engineer on the ground. With our Engineering staff now attached to our branch here, such an arrangement can be readily accomplished. I would recommend in future reports indicating the necessity for such work be prepared locally and forwarded to Ottawa for consideration and decision.\n\nW. S.

In respect to this balcony, Father Kelly's letter concludes by saying, \"whatever decision may be made, please save the balcony.

In respect to this balcony, Father Kelly's letter concludes by saying, \"whatever decision may be made, please save the balcony. The accommodation of the Sisters is confined enough without removing this access to fresh air.\"\n\nCommissioner Arnell concurs in Father Kelly's suggestions and under the circumstances, it is felt that separate fire escapes giving exits from each of the dormitories and leaving the balcony for the Sisters, should be given consideration by Indian Affairs.\n\nThe original estimate of cost for fire escapes of $5,992.79 from the Blair Iron Works which was approved, will be increased to $7,923.92 if the Principal's recommendation is accepted.\n\nIn view of Father Kelly's concern, it is felt that the balcony may be left intact and that separate fire escapes for the boys and girls dormitories be erected at the revised lump sum price of $7,923.92.\n\nShould this proposal meet with the approval of Indian Affairs, a revised memorandum to Council will be implemented immediately.\n\nCHBRT\n\nChief.\nOttawa, 12 April, 1950.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nThat the provision of fire exits from the Dormitories in the attic storey of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C. is inadequate, and that the said condition creates a hazard to the pupils and staff domiciled therein.\n\nThat tenders for the supply and erection of exterior metal stair fire escapes, based on drawings prepared by the Engineering and Construction Service of the Department of Resources and Development, were invited from contractors in the area, and that only one contractor, the Blair Iron Works of New Westminster, B.C. was in a position to tender.\n\nThat the said Blair Iron Works submitted a quotation offering to carry out the work by contract for the lump sum price of Seven Thousand Nine Hundred, Twenty-three Dollars and Fifty-two Cents ($7,923.52) which price is considered reasonable.\n\nThat when allowance is made for unforeseen contingencies, supervision etcetera, the total expenditure would be approximately Eight Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($8,500.00).\n\nThat the work is considered of an emergent character, and that delay occasioned by a further call for tenders would not be in the interest of public economy.\n\nThe undersigned therefore, has the honour to recommend that he be authorized to accept the tender of the said Blair Iron Works, and to enter into an Agreement with them for the supply and erection of exterior metal stair fire escapes hereinbefore mentioned, at the said contractor's lump sum tender price of Seven Thousand Nine Hundred, Twenty-three Dollars and Fifty-two Cents ($7,923.52) and to make any further expenditures required for contingencies, engineering expenses and supervision up to the total amount of Eight Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($8,500.00) which cost is to be met from funds provided in the appropriate vote of the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.\n\nThe undersigned further recommends that the security to be deposited by the contractor on the Agreement should be in the nominal amount of Three Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($350.00).\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration.\nOttawa, 12 April, 1950.\n\nMAJOR MACKAY, DIRECTOR,\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH.\n\nFIRE ESCAPES - KOOTENAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, CRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nForwarded herewith are four (4) copies of a draft Memorandum to Council for your Minister's signature.

Your File 155/6-1-384\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of May 19th forwarding a list of improvements which the Reverend Principal of the above school wishes to carry out.\n\nThe total of the Principal's request is in excess of $10,000.00, and it would simply be impossible to consider all of them or even the major portion of them this year. This is due to the fact that not only do we have to provide funds for the fire escapes, but we will also have to provide funds for the wiring of the school.\n\nPlans and specifications for the wiring were forwarded to you under cover of our letter of May 1st, but I presume that you have not yet been able to obtain the tenders from the firms mentioned in that letter.\n\nYou might review the expenditures requested in your letter of May 19th, and advise if there is anything really urgent among them.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Kootenay Residential School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of May 1st (file 884-5), Mr. Dunn has intimated that only one firm, Modern Electric, Cranbrook, is interested in tendering on wiring the above-mentioned building.\n\nThe West Kootenay Power and Light Company no longer tender for contract wiring, and Mr. C.W.

The Engineer shall be the sole judge of the work and material, in respect of both quality and quantity, and his decision on all questions in dispute with regard thereto, or as to the meaning or intention of this contract and as to the meaning or interpretation of the plans, drawings and specification shall be final, and no work under this contract shall be deemed to have been performed, nor materials or things provided, so as to entitle the Contractor to payment therefor unless and until the Engineer is satisfied therewith, as evidenced by his certificate in writing, which certificate shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to be paid therefor.\n\nQuality\n\n20. The works shall be constructed by the Contractor and under his personal supervision, of new materials throughout; the best materials of their several kinds, and finished in the best and most workmanlike manner, and in the manner required by and in strict conformity with this contract, the said specifications and special plans and specifications, and the plans and drawings relating thereto, and the working or detail drawings which may from time to time be furnished, which said specifications and special plans and drawings are hereby declared to be part of this contract.\n\nDefective work or material\n\n21. Should the Contractor use or employ, or intend to use or employ, any material, plant, tools, equipment, articles or things which, in the opinion of the Engineer are not in accordance with the provisions of this contract or are in any way unsuitable for the works or any part thereof, or should the Engineer consider that any work is for any reason, improperly, defectively or insufficiently executed or performed the Engineer may order the Contractor to remove the same, and to use and employ proper material, plant, tools, equipment, articles and things, or to properly re-execute and perform such work, as the case may be, and thereupon the Contractor shall immediately comply with such orders; and if the Contractor fails to comply with such orders within twenty-four hours, the Engineer may, at any time thereafter, execute or cause to be executed, the orders so given and the Contractor shall, on demand, pay to His Majesty all costs, damages and expenses incurred in respect thereof, or occasioned to His Majesty by reason of the non-compliance by the Contractor with any such orders, or His Majesty may, in the discretion of the Minister, retain and deduct such costs, damages and expenses from any amounts then or thereafter payable to the Contractor.\n\nInsufficient workmen, plant, etc.\n\n22. If the Engineer shall at any time consider the number of workmen, horses, quantity of machinery, tools, plant or equipment, or of proper materials articles or things, respectively, employed or provided by the Contractor on or for the said works to be insufficient for the advancement of such works or any part thereof towards completion within the time limited in respect thereof, or that the works or some parts thereof, are not being carried on with due diligence, then, and in every such case, the Engineer may, in writing, order the Contractor to employ, or provide such additional workmen, horses, machinery, tools, plant, equipment, materials, articles and things as the Engineer may think necessary, and in case the Contractor shall fail within three days, or such other longer period as may be fixed by any such order, in all respects comply therewith, the Engineer may employ and provide such additional workmen, horses, machinery, tools, plant, equipment, materials, articles and things, respectively, as he may think proper, and\nmay pay such additional workmen such wages, and for such additional horses, machinery, tools, plant, equipment, materials, articles and things, respectively, any such prices as he may think proper and all such amounts so paid shall, on demand, be repaid to His Majesty by the Contractor, or the same may be retained or deducted from any sum that may thereafter be or become due from His Majesty to the Contractor. The Contractor shall employ the additional workmen, horses, machinery, tools, plant, equipment, materials, articles and things so provided and employed by the Engineer in the diligent advancement of the works; the workmen and horses so provided shall, however, be thereafter subject to discharge by the Contractor, but only with the consent and approval of the Engineer.\n\nContractor's machinery, plant, etc.\n\n23. All machinery, tools, plant, materials, equipment, articles and things whatsoever provided by the Contractor or by the Engineer under the provisions of sections 21 and 22 for the works, and not rejected under the provisions of section 21 shall from the time of their being so provided, become and until the final completion of the said work, shall be the property of His Majesty for the purpose of the said works, and the same shall on no account be taken away, or used or disposed of, except for the purposes of the said works, without the consent in writing of the Engineer. His Majesty shall not, however, be answerable for any loss or damage whatsoever which may at any time happen to such machinery, tools, plant, materials, equipment, articles or things. Upon the completion of the works and upon payment by the Contractor of all such money lost, cost and damages, if any, as shall be due from the Contractor to His Majesty, or chargeable against the Contractor under this contract, such of the said machinery, tools, plant, materials, equipment, articles and things as shall not have been used and converted in the works or disposed of by His Majesty under powers conferred in this contract, shall, upon demand, be delivered up to the Contractor in such condition as they may then be in.\n\nWork not comprised in contract\n\n24. His Majesty may, at any time, without payment therefor, send and employ on, in and about the works other contractors and workmen, with such horses, machinery, tools, plant, equipment, materials, articles and things as the Engineer may deem necessary to do any work not comprised in this contract, and the Contractor shall afford to them all reasonable facilities, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, for doing such work, the work of the Contractor being interfered with as little as the Engineer may deem practical.\n\nThe taking of possession of the whole or any part of the works of the Contractor for such purposes shall not be deemed an acceptance by or on behalf of His Majesty of the whole or any portion of the works comprised in this contract.\n\nCo-operation with other Contractors\n\n25. That whenever and so often as it may be necessary for the Contractor to co-operate with other contractors on this work, or any or either of them, the Contractor shall diligently and under the directions of the Engineer perform all such works as shall be requisite and proper on the part of the Contractor herein for such co-operation and for securing and placing in proper position the portion necessary herein and hereby contracted to be constructed and erected for the proposed work in a proper and secure hold, and to prevent the possibility of any accident therefrom without any extra charge therefor, and shall be bound in all things to conform to the direction of the Minister or the Engineer touching such cooperation and work.\nDefect or delay by Contractor\n\n26. In case the Contractor shall make default or delay in commencing, or in diligently executing any of the works or portions thereof to be performed, or that may be ordered under this contract, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, the Engineer may give a general notice to the Contractor requiring him to put an end to such default or delay, and should such default or delay continue for six days after such notice shall have been given by the Engineer to the Contractor, or should the Contractor make default in the completion of the works, or any portion thereof, within the time limited with respect thereto in or under this contract, or should the Contractor become insolvent, or abandon the work, or make an assignment of this contract without the consent required, or otherwise fail to observe and perform any of the provisions of this contract, then and in any of such cases the Minister, for and behalf of His Majesty, and with at any further authorization, may take all the work out of the Contractor's hands and may employ such means as he, on His Majesty's behalf, may see fit to complete the works, and in such case the Contractor shall have no claim for any further payment in respect of work performed, but shall be responsible with and shall remain liable for all loss and damage which may be suffered by His Majesty by reason of such default or delay, or the non-completion by the Contractor of the works, and no objection or claim shall be raised or made by the Contractor by reason or on account of the ultimate cost of the work so taken over, for any reason proving greater than in the opinion of the Contractor it should have been; and all materials, articles and things whatsoever, and all horses, machinery, tools, plant and equipment, and all rights, proprietary or otherwise, licences, powers and privileges, whether relating to or affecting real estate or personal property, acquired, possessed or provided by the Contractor for the purposes of the work, or by the Engineer under the provisions of this contract shall remain and be the property of His Majesty for all purposes incidental to the completion of the works, and may be used, exercised and enjoyed by His Majesty as fully to all intents and purposes connected with the works as they might therefore have been used, exercised and enjoyed by the Contractor; and the Minister may, in his option, on behalf of His Majesty, sell or otherwise dispose of, at forced sale prices, or at public auction or private sale or otherwise, the whole or any portion or number of such materials, articles, things, horses, machinery, tools, plant and equipment at such price or prices as he may see fit, and detain the proceeds of any such sale or disposition and all other amounts then or thereafter due by His Majesty to the Contractor on account of, or in part satisfaction of any loss or damage which His Majesty may sustain or have sustained by reason aforesaid.\n\nPower to take action on default of Contractor\n\n27. Whenever in this contract power or authority is given to His Majesty, the Minister, the Engineer, or any person on behalf of His Majesty, to take any action consequent upon the insolvency of the Contractor, or upon the acts, defaults, neglects, delays, breaches, non-observance or non-performance by the Contractor in respect of the works or any portion or details thereof, such power or authorities may be exercised from time to time, and not only in the event of the happening of such contingencies before the time limited in this contract for the completion of the works but also in the event of the same happening after the time so limited in the case of the Contractor being permitted to further proceed with the execution of the works.\nDelays\n\n28. The Contractor shall not have nor make any claim or demand, nor bring any action or suit or petition against His Majesty for any damage which he may sustain by reason of any delay or delays from whatever cause arising in the progress of the work.\n\nNo Implied Contracts\n\n29. It is distinctly declared that no implied contract of any kind whatsoever by or on behalf of His Majesty shall arise or be implied from anything, in the contract documents contained or from any position or situation of the parties at any time, it being clearly understood and agreed that the express contract covenants and agreements therein contained and made by His Majesty are and shall be the only contracts, covenants and agreements upon which any rights against His Majesty are founded.\n\nParliamentary appropriations exhausted\n\n30. Should the amount voted by Parliament and applicable towards payment for the work hereby contracted for be at any time expended previous to the completion of the works, the Minister or the Engineer may give the Contractor written notice to that effect. Upon receiving such notice the Contractor may, if he thinks fit, stop the work but shall not be entitled to any payment for work done beyond the amount voted and applicable as aforesaid, until the necessary funds shall have been voted by Parliament in that behalf. And in no event shall the Contractor have or make any claim on His Majesty for any damages or compensation by reason of the suspension of payment, or by reason of any delay or loss caused by the stoppage of the work. And in the event of the Contractor electing to proceed, or proceeding with such work after such notice, and before such additional funds are voted, no action of the Engineer, or of any other person on behalf of His Majesty, in giving orders, instructions or directions, or otherwise acting with respect to such work, shall be taken or considered as in any manner improving the rights of the Contractor or as waiving in any particular any of the provisions of this section.\n\nMinister may suspend work\n\n31. The Minister may, from time to time and for such period as he may deem expedient, delay or suspend, in whole or in part, operations under this contract, either upon the whole of the works, or at any particular point or points. Should any such delay or suspension, or the stoppage of the works under the provisions of Section 30, or should any delay caused by any circumstance which, in the opinion of the Engineer, is beyond the control of or not the fault of the Contractor, in the opinion of the Minister unreasonably limit the time for the completion of the works, within the time specified by this contract, the Minister so often as the case occurs shall allow such additional time as to him may seem sufficient in the extension of such time for completion; but no such delay, suspension or stoppage shall vitiate or avoid this contract, or any part thereof, or any security or obligations for the performance thereof, nor shall the Contractor be entitled to make any claim for damages by reason thereof. Upon the termination of such delay, suspension or stoppage, or upon the removal of the cause thereof, or upon the Contractor receiving notice from the Minister or Engineer requiring him to resume the work, he shall at once resume operations and diligently carry on the same.\n32. No condoning, excusing or overlooking by His Majesty, or any person acting on his behalf, on previous occasions, or breaches or defaults similar to that for which any action is taken or power exercised, or forfeiture is claimed or enforced against the Contractor, shall be taken to operate as a waiver of any provision of this contract, nor to defeat or prejudice in any way the right of His Majesty thereunder.\n\nMembers of H. of C. not to benefit\n\n33. Pursuant to the provision of the Statute in such case made and provided, no member of the House of Commons of Canada shall be admitted to any share or part of this contract, or to any benefit to arise therefrom.\n\nNo Public Ceremony\n\n34. The Contractor shall not allow any public ceremony in connection with the work without having previously obtained the written permission of the Minister.\n\nLiquors\n\n35. The Contractor shall not bring nor permit to be brought anywhere on or, as far as the Contractor can prevent the same, near the works any spirituous or intoxicating liquor; and if any person employed on the works be, in the opinion of the Engineer, intemperate, disorderly, incompetent, wilfully negligent, or dishonest in the performance of his duties, he shall, on the direction of the Engineer, be forthwith discharged and the Contractor shall not employ or permit to remain on the work any person who shall have been discharged for any or all of said causes.\n\nSanitation\n\n36. The Contractor shall comply with, and the works shall be carried on subject to, all regulations made by any lawful authority and applicable to said works, and all orders given by the Engineer with respect to sanitation or preservation of health on the works. The Contractor shall, at his own expense, provide suitable privies and make adequate arrangements, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, for the medical and sanitary supervision of all his employees.\n\nContractor to clean premises on completion\n\n37. The Contractor shall upon the completion of the works, remove all temporary structures and clear away all rubbish and surplus and waste materials remaining on or about the works, and place the premises in a neat and tidy condition, satisfactory to the Engineer.\n\nDamages to persons or property\n\n38. The Contractor, his agents and all workmen and persons employed by him, or under his control, shall use due care that no person or property is injured and that no rights are infringed in the prosecution of the work, and the Contractor shall be solely responsible for all damages, by whomsoever claimed, in respect of any injury to persons or to lands, buildings, structures, fences, trees, crops, roads, ways, ships, or property of whatever description, and in respect of any infringement of any right, privilege or easement whatsoever occasioned in the carrying on of the works or any part thereof, or by any neglect, misfeasance or nonfeasance on the Contractor's part or on the part of any of his agents,\n\n-9-\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 884-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nworkmen or persons employed by him or under his control, and shall at his own expense, make such temporary provisions as may be necessary to ensure the avoidance of any such damage, injury or infringement, and to prevent the interruption of or danger or menace to the traffic on any public or private road, and to secure to all persons and corporations the uninterrupted enjoyment of all their rights in and during the performance of the said works; and the Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless His Majesty from and against all claims and demands, loss, costs, damages, actions, suits or other proceedings by whomsoever made, brought or prosecuted in any manner based upon, occasioned by or attributable to any such damage, injury or infringement.\n\nDamages to work in progress. Contractor assumes risk\n\n39. The Contractor shall be at the risk of, and shall bear all loss or damage whatsoever, from whatsoever cause arising, which may occur to the work, or any part thereof, until the same be finally accepted by the Minister, and if any such loss or damage occur before such final acceptance, the Contractor shall immediately, at his own expense, repair, restore and re-execute the work so damaged, so that the whole works, or their respective portions thereof, shall be completed within the time limited for completion thereof, and any delay occasioned by the Contractor to the other contractors on the work or any interference by the Contractor with the operations which may be a cause of delay or damage shall be rectified at the cost of, and the claim for damage or delay (if any) shall be at the charge of the Contractor.\n\nPrecautions as to fire\n\n40.

The Contractor shall, at his own expense, at all times during construction and until the final acceptance of the work, keep all buildings and structures insured against loss by fire, in such insurance company or companies and in such amount or amounts equal to at least Eighty (80) per cent of the value of work done and materials accepted by the Engineer, as may be approved by the Chief, and the policies of such insurance shall be made payable as the interests of the Contractor and His Majesty may respectively appear, and shall be deposited with the Chief.\n\nProtection of Workmen\n\n42. The Contractor shall protect the Department from all claims that may arise from injury to, or sickness of, any workmen employed by him on the work.\nWorkmen's Compensation\n\n43. The Contractor will be required to comply with the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act for the province in which the work is being carried on.\n\nPayment by Contractor for Labour, etc.\n\n44. The Contractor shall promptly pay for all labour, service and materials in or about the construction of the works, and all payments for such purposes shall be made by the Contractor, at least as often as payments are made to the Contractor by His Majesty under this contract, and in the event of failure by the Contractor at any time so to do, or if any sum due for labour of any foreman or workman, or for hire of horses, teams or carts upon or in respect of the works or any part thereof, remains in arrears or unpaid, or if there be at any time found to exist any claims against the Contractor, or any sub-contractor, for labour, teams, tools, plant, equipment, materials, articles or things employed, hired or supplied upon or for the works or any part thereof, or if the Minister has reason to believe that any such payments, sums or claims will not be promptly made or paid, the Minister may, in addition to, or in lieu of exercising any powers conferred by the Labour Conditions, at his option, retain out of any moneys due or become due to the Contractor from His Majesty such amount or amounts as the Minister may deem sufficient to satisfy the same, or pay the Contractor the moneys due him in instalments, giving him from time to time such sums as the Minister or the Engineer deems sufficient to meet such payments, sums or claims, any of them, and withholding the balance due him after deducting the payments so made. The Contractor shall be estopped from denying the accuracy and correctness of any and all payments so made by the Minister.\n\nBooks, etc., of Contractor open for inspection\n\n45. The Contractor's pay-rolls, time-books, books of account, invoices and statements shall be at all times open for inspection and extract by the Engineer and any authorized representative of the Minister, or either of them who shall be assisted in every possible way by the Contractor, to enable the Engineer and such representative to ascertain, as far as possible, the exact payment, sums or claims so due and remaining unpaid by the Contractor.\n\nWork to be free from all encumbrances\n\n46. Before making any payment on any progress estimate the Minister may require the Contractor to satisfy the Engineer or other authorized representative of His Majesty, that all work performed and materials supplied and all structures built for which payment is being made are free and clear from all lawful claims or liens under any law for labour, workmanship, materials or otherwise; the Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless His Majesty from and against any and all kind of claims or liens accruing from labour and services performed and material furnished, or otherwise, and any of the same in or about the works.\n\nStatutory Declaration\n\n47. Upon completion of the work, and before payment is made on any final estimate, certificate, or statement the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer, a statement attested by Statutory Declaration showing that all works performed and materials supplied are free of all lawful liens or claims.\nProofs required for default of Contractor\n\n48. The Minister or the Engineer may, in their discretion, at any time require proof, with such formalities or to such extent as they may deem requisite, of any claim under the said Fair Wage Clauses or Schedules, or for wages or hire of teams in arrears or of accounts for materials, or other things unpaid.\n\nSchedule of Unit Prices\n\n49. The Contractor shall submit with his tender a detailed schedule of unit prices of all materials worked or in place, which shall, upon approval of the Engineer, be used as a basis of payments for all work under the contract.\n\nClassification of Costs\n\n50. There shall also be submitted at the same time, a classification of costs at the schedule of unit prices submitted, aggregating the total contract price. This schedule shall be so computed that all incidental charges shall be distributed over the various trade items as shown on the Departmental Progress Estimate form or as approved by the Chief Engineer, and shall be used as a basis for the Engineer's Monthly Progress Estimates.\n\nPrices to be accepted as full compensation\n\n51. The said price or prices shall be accepted by the Contractor as full compensation for everything furnished and done by the Contractor under this contract, including all work required but not included in the items hereinabove mentioned, and also for all loss or damage arising out of the nature of the works or the action of the weather, tides, elements, or any unforeseen obstruction or difficulty encountered in the prosecution of the work, and for all risks of every description connected with the works, and for all expenses incurred by or in connection with the works, and for all works, and for all expenses incurred by or in consequence of any delay or suspension or discontinuance of the work as herein specified, and for well and faithfully completing the works as in this contract provided.\n\nProgress payments\n\n52. Payments equal to about ninety per cent of the value of the work done, approximately estimated from progress measurements and computed at the price or prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, will be made to the Contractor monthly if practicable, on the written certificate of the Engineer, stating that the work for or on account of which the certificate is granted has been done, and stating the value of work computed as above mentioned; and the said certificate shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to be paid the said ninety per cent or any part thereof. The remaining ten per cent shall be retained till the final completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the Engineer, and will be paid within two months after such completion. The written certificate of the said Engineer certifying to the final completion of the said works to his satisfaction, shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to receive or to be paid the remaining ten per cent or any part thereof.\nEngineer in certifying values for progress payments may disregard price list\n\n53. Provided always that, where in the opinion of the Engineer the work done is not sufficiently finished, or is not of sufficient value to justify payment at the price or prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, the Engineer may, for the purpose of such payment, disregard the price or prices agreed upon or determined and may estimate the proportionate value payable in respect of such work and issue a certificate accordingly; in which case the Contractor shall only be entitled to receive ninety per cent of such estimated proportionate value as stated in such certificate, and shall not be paid the ninety per cent of the price or prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, until such time as the Engineer, by reason of the performance of additional work, shall certify that the Contractor is entitled thereto.\n\nClaims under progress certificate\n\n54. It is intended that every allowance to which the Contractor is fairly entitled will be embraced in the Engineer's monthly certificate, but should the Contractor at any time have claims of any description which he considers are not included in the progress certificates, such claims must be made in writing to the Engineer within thirty days after the date of the delivery to him of the certificate from which he considers the items of such claims to have been omitted, but in no case beyond the period of sixty days from the date of the practical completion of that portion of the work to which such claims apply. And in default of the presentation of such claims within the times so limited the Minister may treat such claims as absolutely barred.\n\nClaims, evidence of accuracy\n\n55. The Contractor in presenting claims of the kind referred to in the last preceding clause must accompany them with satisfactory evidence of their accuracy and the reason why he thinks they should be allowed.\n\nPayment for additional or extra work\n\n56. Payment for any work or additional work done, or materials or things provided, under the written orders of the Engineer, for which no price or prices are named, and which is not covered by the contract, His Majesty in consideration and subject, as aforesaid, will pay to the Contractor the actual and reasonable cost, as determined by the Engineer of such work, materials and things, with an additional ten per cent thereon for the use of tools, Contractor's plant, superintendence and profits.\n\nApproximate quantities\n\n57. The quantities (if any) given are approximate only and no claim shall be made by the Contractor against His Majesty on account of any excess or deficiency, absolute or relative, in the same.\n\nProgress measurements and certificates not binding\n\n58. The progress measurements and progress certificates shall not in any respect be taken as binding upon the Engineer, or as final measurements or as fixing final amounts; they are to be subject to the revision of the Engineer in making up his final certificate, and they shall not in any respect be taken as an acceptance of the work as a release of the Contractor from responsibility in respect thereof.\nRectification\n\n59. Should it subsequently be found that inferior materials or workmanship have been incorporated into the works, or that the contract has been departed from in any way, the Contractor shall be responsible for making good, without expense to the Department, any defects together with any and all damages that may have resulted from such defects.\n\nPROVIDED, notice shall be given the Contractor regarding such defects within a period of one (1) year after date of the final certificate of the completion of the work.\n\nPROVIDED, the period stipulated in any guarantee given by the Contractor has not expired.\n\nExtension of time\n\n60. Any extension of time requested by the Contractor due to circumstances beyond his control delaying the work, shall be made in writing, to the Chief Engineer, at least 10 days before expiration of the contract; Any extension of time that may be granted to the Contractor shall be so granted and accepted without prejudice to any rights of His Majesty whatsoever, under this contract, and no assent thereto on the part of the Contractor shall be necessary.\n\nMinister sole judge of reasonableness of extension of time for completion\n\n61. Provided always that after the expiration of the time limited for the completion of the works the Minister shall be sole judge as to what additional time, if any, may be allowed to the Contractor for such completion, and his decision as to the reasonableness or sufficiency thereof for the purpose of completion shall be final and binding upon the Contractor.\nLABOUR CONDITIONS\n\nThe following labour conditions are applicable to the work of erection of exterior iron stair fire escapes and alteration of double hung window sash to casement type at Kootenay Residential School at Cranbrook, B.C., to be undertaken for the Department of Resources and Development.\n\n(1) No workman employed upon the said work shall at any time be paid less than the minimum rates of wages, or shall work more than the number of hours, set forth in the following schedule:\n\n| TRADE OR CLASS OF LABOUR                  | RATE OF WAGES NOT LESS THAN | HOURS OF LABOUR NOT MORE THAN |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                           | Per Hour                    | Per Day                      |\n| Brick and hollow tile layers              | $1.50                       | 8                            |\n| Brick and hollow tile layers' helpers     |                             |                              |\n| (mixing and tempering mortar)             | 1.00                        |                              |\n| Carpenters and joiners                    | 1.45                        |                              |\n| Labourers                                 | .95                         |                              |\n| Motor truck drivers                       | 1.00                        |                              |\n| Motor truck driver and truck              | 2.00                        |                              |\n| Ornamental iron workers                   | 1.70                        |                              |\n| Painters and glaziers                     | 1.10                        |                              |\n| Watchmen                                  | .75                         |                              |\n| Welders and burners (acetylene or etc.)   | 1.10                        |                              |\n\nN.B.\u2014The wage rates specified above are those deemed to be current at the time this schedule was prepared.

In case the Contractor shall fail so to do or fail at any time thereafter to employ his employees for any services performed under any hours of labour wages according to the rates set forth in the schedule or fixed thereby by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding overtime, time and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorise any person appointed by the Minister to pay any such wages as the rate fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any money owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such payment shall for all purposes as between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule annexed in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour thereon.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen, and the books and documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour employed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the rates of wages and hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any conditions in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrear; (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall at all times in time furnish the Minister with such detailed information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) If the evidence so filed be made satisfactory proof of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys so at any time payable by His Majesty under the contract and the amounts so paid shall be deducted from the contract.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights and remedies in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from subletting, the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than such as may be customary in the trades concerned, is prohibited without the approval of the Minister. Obtainment of such approval shall be bound in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractor; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister, no portion of the work to be performed under the contract by the workmen.\n\n(9) Workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

Neary, Superintendent,\nIndian Education Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nAs the weeks go by and no news of our re-wiring contract I become more and more fearful of another winter in semi-darkness. Was speaking to the manager of the East Kootenay Power Co recently and he was enquiring what the hurry was in having the line completed by last September when ten months have gone by without utilizing it. I know the delay is not occasioned by your office but I am at a loss to know where it is being stalemated. I made a trip to Vancouver last week to see the Commissioner and he could through little light on the matter except to say that he still hoped it would come through.\n\nIf you can do anything to trace this matter down and speed it up we would certainly appreciate it.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly O.M.I., Principal.\nCopy sent Mr. Arneil\n\nJuly 31, 1950.\n\nDear Father Kelly:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 25th instant with reference to re-wiring the Kootenay School.\n\nIt is regretted that there has been so much delay but this was due to circumstances beyond the control of officials of the Education Division.\n\nWe have recently obtained a quotation for the work but before awarding the contract it will be necessary for us to secure an Order-in-Council. It is hoped that this will be passed in the near future and the order will then be placed for wiring.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. G.F. Kelly, O.M.I.,\nKootenay Indian Res. School,\nCranbrook, B.C.,\n\nEP/HM\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Fire Escapes - Kootenay Residential School\n\nConsiderable difficulty has been encountered in connection with the above installation, due to the fact that the plans and specifications called for the installation of casement windows opening inward to give access to the fire escape platforms. Apart from the fact that the inward opening of the casements is contrary to fire regulations, their installation in this manner was not possible without extensive changes to the heating system for the reason that the radiators placed in front of the windows projected above the bottom of the proposed casements effectively preventing them from opening.\n\nFather Kelly communicated with us by telephone and explained this difficulty in some detail and, as the contractors, Blair Iron Works, were on the job and completion of the work could not be delayed, we authorized completion of the installation less the installation of the casement windows. Father Kelly has since written us in connection with the matter and a copy of his letter of June 16th is enclosed for your information. You will note in the second paragraph of page two of his letter he suggests two solutions to the difficulty. This office favours the installation of doors as proposed by Father Kelly and, if it is considered necessary, we will have one of our engineers visit the school and report with regard to the work involved and the expense.\n\nIn the meantime, Blair Iron Works have submitted their final progress payment, which covers the full amount of the contract less a credit of $67.00 for the casement sash, which were not installed. Work additional to the contract, involving the installation of an extra stair from the boiler house roof to the ground, was performed, however,\nand they have billed us with $78.40. A voucher covering this additional work is enclosed, together with their progress payment in the amount of $2,256.52.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nJune 16/50\n\nW.S. Arneil, Commissioner,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil:\n\nIt always delights the heart of a Principal to see new installations and improvements around the school. This is particularly true when these tend to a greater measure of safety for the children under his care. I was very pleased when informed that new fire escapes were to be installed here to insure a speedy and safe exit from the building in the event of a fire. However, I didn't expect to find an obstacle included in the plans which would render the exit unnecessarily difficult. I refer to the plan calling for two windows (or doors as they may be called) hinged at the sides, closing in the centre, and opening in. These are prescribed for the six main exits from the dormitories.\n\nWhen I saw the plans calling for this installation I contacted our Agency Superintendent, Mr. Dunn, who came down here and we discussed the matter together. We suggested leaving the present casements as is and hinging the windows to open out. Our reasons were: the facility of exit when they open out; and to avoid removal of the heating radiators which rise four inches above the window sill and at present would obstruct windows designed to open in. This second reason was evidently not considered by the engineer who drew up the plans and it is quite a serious matter. Not only will it involve a considerable expense, (each radiator is ten feet long and eight inches wide and there are four of them), but also the pipe lines leading to them from the mains in the basement will have to be relocated. This will involve cutting through floors and ceilings from the basement to the second floor.\n\nThis morning I was again speaking to Mr. Dunn and he said he had a reply from you to the effect that the work should proceed according to the plans given to the Blair Iron Works. The reason for this is, as I understand it, that if they opened out they would obstruct the landing. Quite true if they are hinged on the outer edge of the casement but the casements are 19\" in width and the windows suggested are 22\u00bd\" in width and if they are hinged on the inner edge of the casement they will only protrude 3\u00bd\". The landing\nplatform which is being installed is 3' 3\" in width so there would be no obstruction on it. To my mind they present a much more serious hazard opening in than they would by protruding 3\u00bd\" beyond the edge of the building. As I understand it when and if a fire occurs the responsibility of evacuating the children falls upon the Principal and his staff. I think it is unfair to expect anyone to guarantee the evacuation of children when the exit windows open in. Even if a special permission is granted from the proper authorities for this type of construction it doesn't alter the fact that the actual responsibility at the time of the fire, should such occur, falls on those in immediate charge. Why should plans call for making an exit difficult when it is possible and quite reasonable to make it convenient?\n\nI would like to suggest one of two things. Firstly, if we are bound to follow the plans submitted, then hinge the windows on the inner edge of the present casement. Or, secondly, and I feel this is the answer, hinge one door as shown in the attached sketch, to open out. This door to be provided with a panel window as shown. It will hinge on one side of the casement, the side farthest from the stairs descending, and when opened will swing back to the railing on the back of the landing platform entirely clear of the stairs. When closed it will have a catch on the opposite side of the casement and if recommended can be equipped with a fire-bar. This installation is very simple. The present casements can be left undisturbed. Only the doors of the size required equipped with a glass panel as shown need to be provided.\n\nMoreover, it should be remembered that these exits are being put in places where formerly there were windows equipped with double windows for the winter months. If the suggested windows as called for on the plans given to Blair Iron Works are installed they are ninety-five per cent glass and will give considerable exposure. In the colder months they will be a mass of frost. Some provision will then have to be made for doubling them. This will entail a new problem which the use of a door will eliminate. The dormitories at present during the winter months are not too warm and this added exposure of single windows as suggested by the plans will augment the heating problem. This trouble can be obviated very easily if doors are used with a panel window of reasonable size the exposure of which would be negligible.\n\nI know that all this is hard to follow and visualize from a letter. I am going to Penticton on June 23rd with the children who are returning home for the summer vacation and I would be pleased to continue on to Vancouver and explain the matter in person if you\nso advise. I feel quite sure that if you could visit here and see the actual set-up you would agree that an alteration in the plans as given to Blair Iron Works is quite reasonable.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) G.F.

Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to request the Department to grant us the two months' vacation this year as has been granted during the last three years.\n\nThis extension of holidays has been so beneficial to the Kootenay Indian children that I would like to have it made permanent if it is possible for the Department to do so. We have found that for the last three years the children have returned readily to school without any necessity at all of compulsion as formerly. Also these children for the most part live in their tepees during the vacations, and we find that their health resistance improves considerably. As they are continually moving about there is not the usual danger of tubercular contagion, and freedom from school restraint for two months makes them eager for studies again. During the two months of July and August the weather is very hot in the Kootenays and is not conducive to studies of any kind, for Indian children.\n\nTrusting you will forward this request to the Department at your earliest opportunity, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. J.H. Patterson, O.M.I.\n\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a request received from the Reverend J. M.

During these two months the weather in the Kootenays is as a rule too hot to carry on satisfactory school work. Our pupils generally spend the summer vacations in their tepees and the majority are well cared for at this time of the year. Many of our children live long distances from the school and spend considerable time travelling to their homes.\n\nI would be glad therefore if the Department will give favorable consideration to this request as they have already done in the past.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. J.M. Patterson, O.M.I.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nKootenay Agency,\nGranbrook, B.C.,\nMay 26, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend J. M.

By so doing we have been able to give the Indians a sense\nof responsibility for these children which they would not have other-\nwise. We have been trying out a method of post-school supervision\nwhich appears to be giving very good results.\n\nThe above named children have been retained in school at\nthe expressed request of their parents or guardians. Consequently\nI would like to have your permission to keep their names on the\nroll till the end of the vacation during which I shall have time to\nvisit the reserves and discuss with them how best to make a place\nfor them, as well as a few others who will have reached sixteen\nyears of age during the summer months.\n\nAssuring you of my earnest cooperation in the\ndevelopment of character and education amongst the Kootenays, I\nremain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. J.M. Patterson, O.M.I.\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 28, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, it is noted that there are only three children sixteen years of age or over, at present in the Kootenay Indian Residential School. It is noted, also, that you will write, later, with reference to whether you consider they should be discharged or retained in the school.\n\nIn writing the circular letter of the 15th instant, it was the Department's intention to bring to the attention of Principals of Indian Residential Schools the necessity for their asking the Department for permission to allow children who are 16 years of age or over to remain for a further period.\n\nIn future, requests should be forwarded whenever children reach 16 years of age, and the correspondence should be directed through the Indian Agent's office, in order that he may make any recommendation that he considers necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nfor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

On or about the 20th instant four young girls of the Tobacco Plains Reserve left the school some time during the night and returned to their homes on the reserve two days later - distance of sixty-five miles. I am told that the girls were picked up by some friends the second day of their journey and taken to their homes where, in the company of Constable Ingles of the R.C.M.P., I called and brought them back to the school.\n\nA week later two other girls of about fourteen years of age left the school very early in the morning and started for their homes on the Shuswap Reserve, almost a hundred miles away and were intercepted two days later by Mr. Sinclair, who is Game Warden at Canal Flats and kept at his home until the Principal of the school, Rev. Father Murphy, O.M.I., was able to call for them and bring them back. Canal Flats is between 55 and 60 miles from the school.\n\nI am at a loss to know why there should have been so many desertions in so short a time as the Sisters in charge appear to be very capable teachers and very considerate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAI/SH\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into\nthe Keetekey Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child\nEnglish name Raymond Adrian (Dennis)\nAge 8 yrs.\nName of Band Snusnep\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\nFather's full name and No. Adrian Isaac Dennis\nMother's full name and No. Margaret Louis Abel\nParents living or dead Yes\nState of child's health Good\nReligion Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?

They were not accustomed to their garbs and, at the beginning, were uncomfortable in their presence.

Irwin, Indian Agent for this district, that he had been notified that the two Indian girls named above had run away from the St. Eugene School, near Cranbrook, during the late evening of Monday, 21st instant. Their ages were about fifteen and ten respectively. Mary JUSTIN was the daughter of the Chief of the St. Mary's Reserve, on which the school is situated. The other girl's home is at Columbia Lake.\n\nSub-Division\n\n2. Acting on Mr. Irwin's suggestion, I understand, the principal, Rev. Father Murphy, got in touch with the Chief and the latter instituted search of the Reserve. In late a.m. of 22nd inst., Reg. No. 11256 Cst. McLeod, and myself, patrolled the vicinity of the Reserve per Police Car Code No. 3208, with view to locating the missing girls. On arrival at the School in early p.m. to maintain contact, it was learned that the Chief had located the girls and had just returned them to the school and handed them over to the Principal.

Please advise the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA. Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School which explains itself.\n\nDue to an epidemic of Measles on St. Mary's Reserve during the end of August and early September, the School was closed by direction of the Medical Officer for St. Mary's pupils until October 1st. Despite this precaution, however, as stated by Reverend Principal Collins an epidemic of Measles broke out in October when the St. Mary's children returned to school. It is, therefore, true that every known precaution was employed to spare the pupils the risk of coming down with the disease and to keep the pupils out of the school. When all efforts failed and 38 were taken down with Measles one cannot speak too highly of the untiring efforts of the Principal and staff to nurse the children back to health and strength and their splendid success in dealing with the pneumonia cases.\n\nIf, under such unforeseen and trying circumstances, the Department can see its way to meet the wishes of the Principal with respect to some sort of financial adjustment for September, such action is possibly necessary to enable the School to continue their wholesome and healthful standard of living conditions for the pupils which has been so appreciated by each and all who have visited the school during the last 2 years.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nKootenay Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n16th December 1938.\n\nMr. Andrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Irwin:\n\nI should like you to give your usual careful attention to this letter, and would ask you to place it before the proper authorities.\n\nAs you are well aware, the Measles epidemic closed our school for a considerable length of time, and in consequence, we received no grant for that period. It has been a very serious loss to this institution, for although we did not have the usual high food bill, yet the many other overhead expenses were just the same.\n\nDuring the month of September, the salaries of the entire staff had to be paid, as well as their board. The usual overhead was present in fuel, light, water, etc. The clothing item was no smaller.\n\nFrom past experience, it has been found that it requires the full quota of children to make ends meet. From 1929 until 1935 the Principal was unable to draw any salary; and during that time, and even at present, practically the entire produce of the Oblate Fathers' farm went for school upkeep without any remuneration to the Oblate Fathers.\n\nThe school was closed through no fault of ours; but in spite of the quarantine, the epidemic of measles broke out when the children returned. Some thirty eight of the children went down with it and although several severe cases of Pneumonia resulted, we were very fortunate in having no deaths.\n\nAs the medical advisor of the Department authorized the closing of the school, would not the Department look on the closing\nas an extension of the Summer holidays and give us the grant as for July and August.\n\nOwing to the quarantine, our average attendance of pupils for the September quarter was but fifty five, (55). Had there been no epidemic, our average attendance would have been seventy three, (73). We received grant for fifty five only.\n\nI feel that I have a very strong case, and I trust that the Department will see their way to making a financial adjustment.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI remain,\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nJanuary 14, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant enclosing letter received from the Principal of the Kootenay residential school with reference to the loss of grant occasioned the school as a result of an outbreak of measles on certain reserves which prevented the pupils from these reserves returning to the Kootenay school when the school re-opened after the holidays. The Principal's request has been given very careful consideration but present regulations do not permit our paying grant when pupils are absent from a residential school for any reason. The only exception is in the case of the two months' holiday leave for which grant is allowed.\n\nI note that in spite of the fact that the children were kept out of school for some weeks measles broke out in the school following their return. This emphasizes the statement made by our Medical Superintendent in the third paragraph of his letter to you dated August 30 last. As the pupils were not allowed to return to the school on the first of September it is apparent that there were no results from the meeting attended by Dr. Green, the Principal and yourself. However, as pointed out above while the Department sympathizes with the Principal in the financial loss that he has suffered there is nothing can be done about the matter at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

In June, there are only two eligible for discharge; while in September we can expect up to ten new pupils. That means we will be housing at least one hundred children in our school. This we can do comfortably, and in no way will the school be overcrowded. The class-rooms can accommodate 180 children; the dining-room can seat 120 children. We have four dormitories, 34' x 26', each; and two others, 30 x16', each.\n\nParliament provides a grant for only ninety pupils. In its Estimates for this coming fiscal year, could not the Department arrange for a larger appropriation for our school, say, for one hundred children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received today from the Reverend Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School which explains itself.\n\nWill you kindly advise in this matter and oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAI/EF\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into\nthe Kootenay Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines\nand Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: Agnes Pierre\nAge: Eight years\nName of Band: Lower Kootenay\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: Johnny Pierre\nMother's full name and No.: Teresa Francois\nParents living or dead: Both living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Roman Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?

The present quota is only 90. In the Okanagan Agency there are more children than can be accommodated in their schools. Twelve from Westbank and Similkameen desire to come to Cranbrook. There is no other place that they can go; Kamloops is overcrowded. My understanding is that those children will have to remain on their Reserves until arrangements can be made for their admission to some Residential School with its quota raised from 90 to 100. Our School could take care of them.\n\nIt would be a wonderful thing for those children, as well as for our School, if each might benefit by provision being made for their admission by increasing our quota from 90 to 100. I agree with the Reverend Principal Collins that if, at all possible, this should be done. May I, therefore, stress the urgent necessity for an increase of grant for this purpose?\n\nKindly advise in the matter and oblige.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A.

C., to the Lower Kootenay Reserve at Creston, B. C., a return trip of 140 miles, kindly be advised that this account has not been paid.\n\nReverend Father Collins, Principal of the School paid the Railway Company $86.75 for tickets to transport 14 persons from Cranbrook to Penticton as shown on the attached receipts. The item of $20.00 is for transporting the children from the School to the above Reserve with his own car and a second car owned and driven by the Reverend G. Rogers, an Indian missionary located at the School. If the Department will kindly forward cheque to the School, including the $20.00 earned by the Reverend Principal and Father Rogers, the Principal will be glad to acknowledge the same on receipt. Kindly advise if this will be satisfactory and oblige.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAI/RF\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 884-10, part 5)\nOttawa,\nAugust 21, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 17th instant the Department will forward a cheque covering railway transportation as quoted on voucher 3721.\n\nWith reference to the item of $20.00 for car transportation it will be necessary to forward separate accounts of $10.00 each, giving full details, one in favour of the Principal and the other in favour of Rev.

Thanks to the $3500.00 obtained from the Oblates, all the old bills have been paid. It is financially difficult to run this school as we are buying our meat and vegetables\u2014although it looks as if the Oblates will have to pay for the latter.\n\nThrough the letters of the Vernon Indian Agent, you are acquainted with the case of the three Steele girls. They did not return this year but I suggested that it would be better for them to return on account of home conditions even though they were said to be attending a day school. The mother is dead, the father is in the army and, I am told, their Aunt is not fit to look after them. The Agent submitted the case to the Department and, recently, told me that the Department had ordered them to be returned to this School. The Agent promised to have them taken to Penticton and asked me to provide an escort from Penticton to Cranbrook. (This is always done especially as the train gets into Nelson at about 7 or 8 p.m., and stays there for about 6 hours). I wrote to our Agent saying that, while I was really anxious, for the good of the girls (whose guardian aunt I am informed was recently arrested for her part in a drunken brawl), to have them return, I could neither send an escort nor pay for their transportation particularly as they would not be grant-earning pupils as we now have our pupilage of 83.\n\nThe Department grants us only $90.00 for the transportation of all pupils during the entire year. As the Indian fare for children over 12 is $17.00 per child per year to and from Penticton, the grant does not pay for transportation of the Okanagan pupils one way. Then, the return fare of the escort has to be paid. I had Father Murray go twice to Penticton, Vernon, etc. for children since Sept. 1st. The natural reply is that the parents should be made to pay at least something towards transportation. I have seriously tried here and elsewhere to have this done but have failed. So have others.\n\nIn my letter to the local Indian Agent, I requested that, in view of the serious danger in which I am told these three girls are, the Department pay their fares and also allow a grant for them. I submitted also that, in view of the unfortunate financial condition of this school and the small pupilage, the Department is asking too much when it expects us, with a transportation grant of only $90.00, to pay the fares of the Okanagan pupils. I would greatly prefer to receive no transportation grant and to have the Department handle the transportation problem.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. So far, we have had no illness. The Provincial Police have just called ringing the fire alarm. They appeared satisfied with the fire alarm system, recently installed, with the way the pupils responded.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 884-10, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nDecember 16, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant you may inform the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School that the Department approves the discharge of the pupils whose names are shown on the attached list.\n\nThe re-admission of Millie Paul, No. 0292, is also approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.

Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nOttawa,\nApril 16, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor the past two or three years the Department has been allowing an amount of $90.00 a month for travelling expenses of pupils to and from the Kootenay Residential School for holidays. The Principal has written to us on different occasions and stated that this amount is not sufficient. The amount provided for travelling expenses in our appropriation is limited. However, we do not wish to do an injustice to any particular school. I should, therefore, appreciate your discussing the matter fully with the Principal and advising me the amount that you think should be allowed. I cannot promise you that this sum can be granted but very careful consideration will be given to your recommendation in this particular regard.\n\nThe Department has always felt that the parents should show sufficient interest in their children's education to take them home for holidays and return them on the expiry of their leave. Certainly there should be no difficulty in having the parents take the children home and, if they do not call for them, the children should remain in the school. There may be more difficulty in having them returned and, in that event, it may be necessary to pay transportation costs.\n\nAs pointed out above, the matter will receive further consideration when you reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.

Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn his letter of April 16th (155-0-10), Mr. Philip Phelan, Chief, Training Division, asked us to discuss my contention that $90.00 a year (and not per month as the copy of the letter states) is not sufficient to pay for the pupils' transportation. I presume that, as in other schools this amount is half of what was formerly granted.\n\n\"We are agreed that the parents should pay at least transportation costs, at least as a rule, especially as the Department and the School authorities not only furnish education free of charge but also clothe and feed the pupils. This was done during and before my time in the Cariboo School and I have sincerely tried to introduce this both in the Christie School and here. I have succeeded only in creating serious ill-feeling on the part of the Creston and some other Indians towards the School and the Department. For reasons to be given later, I have not even suggested that the Okanagans pay for their children's transportation. My experience is that it is neither advisable nor economical to try to force certain Indians to do their duty in this matter.\n\nLet us take each reserve starting with the Kootenays.\n\nSt. Mary's reserve is adjacent to the School. Naturally, these people need no assistance from the Department.\n\nWindemere reserve (Columbia Lake). With the exception of a few poor people, the parents bring their children to school and take them home. The one exception, last September, was Mrs. Martin Sam who receives a soldier's wife allowance and could easily pay. She and her children traveled a great deal and she finally sent her son by bus C.O.D. to Penticton from Vernon. We could not leave him stranded there and, so, Father Murray brought him with the Okanagan children. I need not say that it was useless to try to collect from her. I expect the same of her next year as she is still traveling and, I am told, carrying on while her husband is overseas.\n\nShuswap reserve\u2014about 90 miles away. These people appear to expect us to bring their children to school. Some are poor and cannot visit their children during the year but I think that, if you take action, some at least could bring their children.\n\nTobacco Plains\u2014about 65 miles away. In general, these people come for their children and bring them back but action should be taken against those who use as an excuse their having to bring their children to school in order to keep them home and out of school.\n\nCreston\u2014(Lower Kootenay)\u2014about 65 miles distant. You will, I think agree, that these people, lazy, shiftless, apparently sitting around and doing nothing but waiting for their rental to be paid, are just about hopeless. There was very bitter feeling when I tried to insist that they come for their children last June. They did not come, while I do not like to give in to them, I do not see how we can get the children home or bring them back unless we do it ourselves. Their children do not seem to be taken care of at home during the holidays and, were it not for reasons given below, I would suggest that some be kept here during the holidays. They are taken to the orgy at Toppenish where there is drinking, immor-\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 884-10, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTwo of our pupils (one has not returned but recently asked to return to school), girls of 14 or 15, contracted gonorrhea during the last holidays. Other women are said to be in the same case. In spite of this, the parents would much prefer to keep their children out of school and on the reserve. They consider that they are doing us a favor by allowing us to take the children and, as a part payment for this, one man told me that the least we could do would be to pay the parents' fare from Creston whenever they wished to see their children here. You know the attitude. The best thing to do would be to use measures that would put sense into the Creston Indians' heads but what can be done? Leave the children at Creston where they will be undernourished and exposed to immorality and disease? I understand that they have a new Chief. I do not know him. When you see him, could you explain matters to him in such a way as to make him see things as they really are?\n\nThe Okanaganans. While there are some rather tough customers amongst these people, I think that they are much more sensible, advanced and well off than the Kootenays. However, I am very much in favour of not asking them to pay for their children's transportation even if they could do it. In the first place, we need these children both to get our pupilage, without which the school could not be financed, and also to raise the level of the school. It would be impossible to get them if we insisted that the parents pay $17.00 per child (and there are two to four of school age in these families) for the return fare exclusive of incidentals and at Indian rate. For children under twelve, the expense is half the above. This amount includes only the fare from Penticton and not from Inkameep, Westbank, Vernon, etc., to Penticton. Another factor is the attractions and the proximity of the Kamloops school to which many Okanaganans have gone and go. With its very large pupilage and consequent comparatively smaller overhead, this very efficient school can offer attractions which we cannot. But the main thing is its proximity to the Okanagan. Were I to state that Kamloops is ten or twenty times nearer than we are, a map would be brought out to show that, apparently, I was exaggerating. In reality, I am not. We have to consider the roads, the mountains, the ferries, the distance and the cost. What I mean will be understood, perhaps, if I state that more than twenty times the parents visit Kamloops than they do this School. Why? When several parents from Vernon wish to see their children (and these Indians do want to see their children in school especially as rumors come of the children's being ill, dead, maltreated, etc.), to cut down expenses, several get into an automobile and drive there, over good roads, in less than three hours. It takes an hour or two more from other reserves. When they get to Kamloops, they can get hospitality from the Shuswap Indians whom they know (probably as former schoolmates or as relatives) and spend little money. If parents wish to come here, each one has to get to Penticton and each has to pay about $17.00 for railway fare alone at Indian rate. Then, there is food for the journey and no hospitality from or friends among the Kootenay Indians. The best proof of this is that, since my coming here, only one Okanagan has come to visit her child. There is another point. Being so close to the Okanagan, the Kamloops School sends a bus or truck and picks up the children or puts them off at their houses and not at the Penticton station as we do. It would not be practical or, I understand, lawful for us to send a truck to the Okanagan as the trip would take a couple of days at least and the children would have to sleep somewhere at night. Even if no one else did, the parents would rightly object to this. It is bad enough when they come by train as they leave Penticton at 7 a.m. and arrive here about 25 hours later.\nIt hardly worth while mentioning a suggested solution make the parents bring their children to school and take them home whether they attend the Kamloops or the Kootenay School. The cost of taking them to Kamloops, especially as many would be crowded into an auto, would be negligible as compared with the cost of taking them to Penticton and then paying the railway fare to Cranbrook.\n\n(There is no friction between the Schools or the Principals. In fact unable to accept all applications for admission, the Principal at Kamloops would willingly let all Okanagans come here and he would have done so last September had he not been wrongly assured that we were filled up and could not accept the Okanagans).\n\nEven if we paid the transportation costs and Kamloops did not, it would be to the advantage of the Okanagan parents to send their children to Kamloops as they could easily visit them whenever they so wanted and as Kamloops can afford more attractions than can we. However, in order to be able to finance this School, we need the Okanagans and we shall need them especially as there have been about 25 deaths out of about 400 Kootenay Indians during the year ending last March and as more than 20 young men have joined the army from this Agency. The number of deaths and the number of births during the last year tell their story. We need the Okanagans and we shall not get them if we try to make them pay their railway fare. With a reduced pupilage of 83, this school cannot pay this amount.\n\nIs the grant of $90.00 sufficient or fair? Exclusive of all other costs, I paid the C.P.R. $88.40 last June, for the transportation of the Okanagan children alone. In September, it cost me $81.15 plus $20.00 to bring back those who came at that time. Later, five others came from the Okanagan at an additional cost. In the above expenses is included about $17.00 for the transportation of an escort at clergy rate. An escort is necessary not only because they children spend 25 hours en route from Penticton or because there are young children but also because the train waits over in Nelson from about 7 in the evening until 1 or 2 in the morning. Although it takes only from about 4:30 a.m. until 10:15 at night to get back to Penticton, it is advisable to send an escort with so many young children.\n\nI think that we could manage if the fares of the Okanagan children were paid but would appreciate an extra $20.00 to cover other cases such as those of poor families.\n\nBy the way, no word has come so far from Ottawa about the $20.00 per month salary grant for the nurse who attends to Indians on the Reserves. This has not been paid since April 1st, 1941, over a year ago. I sent her report in faithfully every month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. Forbes, O.M.I.\nMay 19th, 1942\nKOOTENAY INDIAN SCHOOL\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nMr. A. Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the letter I wrote earlier in the day, I forgot the following. It was suggested in the copy of the letter which you passed on to me that we might keep those pupils here whose parents did not take them home for the holidays. I do not like the idea. First, it is punishing the children for the faults of their parents. Secondly, it would make us lose all the ground we have gained in dispelling the idea that this is not a jail or a detention home to which children MUST come. It is a place where they have the opportunity of improving their status in life. The third reason is the strongest. I believe that, quite naturally, the children kept here would run away and this idea of running away would occur to them and to others during the school term. We have had no runaways for some years now and, I hope, the idea has died. Knowing what I do of what happened here, at Mission, at Lejacq (where runaways froze to death), I cannot agree to the suggestion that we punish the children whose parents do not come for them by keeping them during the holidays. Attempts have been made, in the past, by dissatisfied Indians to burn down this School. That is another idea I do not wish to revive. Fourthly, if we kept the children here as a punishment, we should have even greater difficulty than we now have to get them back on time or at all in September. Unless I am mistaken, the Agent is ex officio a truant officer. His expenses and the expenses of the Police and the School would far exceed the original cost of transportation if we kept children here as a punishment. The same thing holds true in the case of the Creston lot and, for other reasons, of the Okanagan if we insist on them paying transportation costs. As facts prove, in both cases, the parents simply will not return their children. They will keep them at home without schooling and we shall find it as hard or harder than we did this year to get even our reduced pupilage. There are, as you are aware, perhaps twenty children at home who should be here in school now.\n\nWhat specific amount would I suggest as a grant? It is impossible to set a fixed amount as the expenses vary with the number of Okanagan pupils and it is impossible to know exactly how many will be returning for each new term because some stay home without a real reason. This year, three sisters were kept by a relative (whose drinking and other alleged habits made her an unfit guardian) so that she might get an allowance for their keep because their father is in the army if, as I believe the story given me is true. Three brothers stayed at home (where I am told they do not attend school) because they wished to do so and, in order to stay at home, they told their father that one of our employees, no longer here, was \"mean\". In so far as I could find out, this was not true. It is hard to say how many will return as the parents seem to have a free hand in sending them to school or keeping them at school. The average cost, however, is about $200.00 for the Okanagan.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. Forbes, O.M.I.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 16th., with reference to a Departmental Allowance of $90.00 per year, for Travelling Expenses of Pupils to and from the Kootenay Indian Residential School, for holidays.\n\nThe Principal explains in his letter herewith enclosed, the difficulties so often encountered in getting the Children back to school. There is no doubt that many are not in a position to furnish transportation for their children, and others will not.\n\nPrincipal Forbes is now in Ottawa, and in all likelihood will be for some days. It is possible however, that you will have an opportunity to discuss the matter with him.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nJune 19, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing your letter of May 30, in connection with the allowance for travelling expenses of pupils at the Kootenay School, the Rev. Principal visited the Department and discussed the matter with the officials of the Training Branch. The situation at Kootenay is a little obscure, due to the fact that there is a slight possibility that the building may be taken over by the British Columbia Security Commission. However, it has been decided to allow an amount of $175.00 for travelling expenses at this school this year, on the understanding that this is the total amount that can be allowed both for pupils going home and returning from holidays. In the event of the school being taken over it will not be necessary to incur any expenditure in bringing the children back.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.

She writes: \"Father, I want to go back to School for one more year because it does me good.\" Last September, an aunt tried hard to keep the girl at home but the latter insisted & finally returned to School. I would recommend that her request be granted for the reason given - It is quite likely that we shall have more than the stipendage for which we are paid and that, in reality, the girl will cost the Department nothing.\n\nI have mentioned the matter to Mr. Duncan Scott, Border and expect no objection from him. The girl has also requested that her 6-year-old cousin be allowed to come with her. The reason suggested is that Cranbrook is far from Westbank (near Vernon) and that the young boy's mother would be anxious if Millie were here during his first year.\n\nThe following from the girl's letter is typical of what I have heard from others.

His mother died some months ago and his father, an American Indian abandoned him.\n\nThis boy and his mother belonged to the Lower Kootenay Band as did his deceased father. The mother later married an American Indian who thus became responsible for the care of the boy. After his mother's death his step-father left him with the above mentioned Indian family and returned to the states. He makes no effort to sustain his step-son. In fact he was in gaol when his wife died.\n\nThe above family would adopt the boy if his step-father would consent, which he has not done. The boy is therefore stranded, and without a home. Under the circumstances, may he, whose mother and father were both Canadian Indians, be granted permission to attend the Kootenay Indian Residential School this year, until some arrangement for his future can be made?\n\nKindly advise and oblige,\n\nI/L\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

For the following reasons, I would suggest that, while this case be not considered a precedent, the girl be admitted.\n\nShe is the daughter of Pete Pierre and his wife. The father, an American Indian I believe, resided on the Tobacco Plains reserve for several years but, on account of bad conduct was not only not admitted to the band but was expelled from the reserve several years ago. While he has made short and infrequent visits to the reserve, I think that it can be said that he has abandoned his wife and family and that he in no way contributes to their support. The family is very poor and is supported by the mother's work and the charity of a few Indians. The mother is a Tobacco Plains Indian whose parents, as well as she and the young children, reside on the reserve. I might add that, several years ago, Father Patterson, then Principal here, went into the question very thoroughly and found that the mother was in no way to blame for the breaking up of the marriage. Two or three of the older children were admitted to this School.\n\nWhile, technically, the mother, and, through her, the children, have lost their rights as Canadian Indians, they have been abandoned by the father and have no choice but to live on a Canadian reserve. The Department might be able to have the American authorities force the father to support the family and see that the young children receive an education. It seems to me that it would be far simpler to judge the case on its merits, relieve the mother of a burden and educate the children who, through the father's action, are practically abandoned children. I think that, including the girl mentioned, there is only one other child who may later wish to come here. The others are over school age.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 884-10, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Rev.

I am requesting the Reverend Principal to advise you of their names and the reserves from which they come. Please arrange to have these children returned to the Kootenay School at the earliest possible date. If the parents are unable to pay their transportation, the Department will be responsible for its cost. An itemized account, in duplicate, should be forwarded for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A. Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nMr. Indian Agent Irwin has likely submitted the case of Teresa Pierre to you. Technically, this girl is not a Canadian Indian because her Canadian mother married an American Indian. He abandoned his family who have always lived in Canada (Tobacco Plains Reserve). The mother works hard and one or two Indians help her a little to feed and clothe her children but she is poor. Technically, she may have no rights but to all practical purposes she is a Canadian Indian.\n\nAnd what can be done in this case? Mr. Irwin would quite naturally refuse to consider it on account of the very definite rulings of the Department. He has no right to disobey the Department. Has the Department the right to stretch a point? Two sisters were admitted to this school several years ago and they are still here. In the meantime, their Indian parents appear to have left the Tobacco Plains Reserve and have, I believe, thereby forfeited their Indian rights. They have sent me two younger children, who are now here and whom they do not wish to have separated from the other two who were admitted some years ago. Those admitted by the Department are Edna and Margaret Auld. The other two, whose names do not appear on the returns, are Rose and Lillian Auld. They are Canadian Indians but technically they are not. While I would like to have Teresa Pierre and the two Aulds admitted to the school by the Department, I do not wish to exaggerate - although they would find it difficult, I think that the Aulds could feed and clothe their children. I do not think that Teresa Pierre's mother could look after her daughter as she should. The little girl was thin when she came here and I think that\nit will be found that she will soon be a T. B. case unless we look after her. I would very strongly recommend that Teresa be admitted. There are good reasons for keeping the Aulds but the case is not so urgent.\nOttawa, October 31, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School with reference to Teresa Pierre and the Auld children. Apparently there has been a request for their admission to the Kootenay Residential School. I would appreciate hearing from you regarding them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Mr. A. Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.

This woman resides with her father, a half breed known as M. Phillips, about four miles off the Tobacco Plains Indian Reserve line. She has four daughters, two of whom are still of school age; they are not within reach of any Public school, and if not permitted to attend at Saint Eugene, there is not another school anywhere in the district, that they can attend.\n\nThe two eldest girls, Edna and Margaret, 0266 and 0267, attended here in 1936.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nI should like to ask for the discharge of Pupils 0291 and 0317 Edna Pierre and Celine Capilo both of whom are at the Coqualeetza Indian hospital at Sardis B.C., unless the Department feels they should be carried on the register in case they recover sufficiently to return to School.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 14, 1942.\n\nMr. A. Irwin, Indian Agent, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 9th instant, the Department is favourably disposed to admitting the two children of Mrs. Sam Auld to the Kootenay Residential School, provided they are in good health. You should forward the usual application forms and certificates of health for our consideration.\n\nFrom your second letter of the same date I note that pupils 241, 289 and 0254 are now residing in the United States. Under these circumstances I feel that application should be made for their discharge at the end of December. This will permit their names being removed from the return after that date. If the family returns to Canada, application can be made for their re-admission, if so desired.\n\nWith reference to your third letter of the 9th instant, you may inform the Principal that the discharge of pupils 0291 and 0317 is approved. If the condition of their health improves, application for their re-admission can be made at some future date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Kootenay Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Lilian Louis\nEnglish name: Lilian Louis\nAge: 28 October 1933\nName of Band: Inukameet\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: Louis Louis\nMother's full name and No.: Isabel George\nParents living or dead: Both living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?: Yes\nPreviously attended: Inukameet Day school for 2 years\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

(The father had previously told me that he was going to send the boy to school.) After consulting the Agent, I have finally found the mother and had her sign the application form. As soon as I can have the doctor examine the boy, I will send him the forms.\n\nTo prevent the pupils from getting the mumps, I had the School quarantined. The quarantine was lifted on Dec. 24th and, a few days later, our first case (no fever) appeared. Informed the Agent right away.\n\nWith best wishes for the New Year,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 884-10, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n**ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Kookumay Indian R SCHOOL DURING AOE QUARTER, 1942**\n\n| No. | NAME          | Date of Admission | Age on Admission | Band | NAME OF PARENTS AND LIVING OR DEAD (Insert L. for living, D. for dead, after name) | Father | Mother | Religion of Parents | State of Education upon entering the School | Place and period of Previous Education |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| 299 | Michael Stanley | 13/7/8            |                  |      | St. Mary's Joseph Stanley Mrs. Joe St. Susan Catholic N.E.                       |        |        |                     |                                          |                                       |\n\n**DISCHARGE OF PUPILS**\n\n| No. | NAME          | Date of Discharge | Age on Discharge | PERIODS IN THE SCHOOL | STATE OF EDUCATION | Trade or Industry Taught and Proficiency in it | REMARKS UPON DISCHARGE REASONS FOR SAME |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 291 | Joseph Qualetaro | Oct 1st           |                  | 9 1 1 0               | Grade I            |                                               | Attending day school                   |\n| 0282| Virginia      |                   |                  |                       |                    |                                               |                                        |\n| 0297| Requa         |                   |                  |                       |                    |                                               |                                        |\n| 0308| Teresa Jack   |                   |                  |                       |                    |                                               |                                        |\n\n**NOTE:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 834-10, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n**AGENT'S REPORT**\n\nRespecting Chenail Indian Day School\n\nfor the month December 1942\n\n| Name of Teacher | Mary Terrance |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Number on Roll  | 24           |\n| Number that should attend | 24 |\n| Average Attendance | 18.5 |\n| Punctuality     | fair         |\n| Discipline      | good         |\n\n| Is Register properly kept? | yes |\n| Is Time Table posted up?   | yes |\n| Care of School Material    | good |\n| Cleanliness of School      | good |\n| Cleanliness of Pupils      | fair-good |\n| Health of Pupils           | good |\n\n| Date of Visit | Boys | Girls |\n|---------------|------|-------|\n|               | 8    | 12    |\n\n**GENERAL REMARKS**\n\nUnder this heading give your opinion on the condition of the school in regard to management, progress, etc., and any matters of interest regarding the school.

Agnes will soon be 17, really past school age. The condition of her home, however, is such that if she will agree to return to school, which is at present doubtful, it would be doing her a great kindness to grant her the privilege for another year. Agnes is quite a bright girl, and would possibly stand to benefit a great deal by one more year at school.\n\nMillie Paul, No. 0292 is a member of the Okanagan Agency still under 16 years of age. Rev. Father Collins, Missionary Priest for the Indians there advises that he is hopeful but not at all sure he will be able to persuade the parents of this girl to allow their daughter to return to school.

Three small boys aged eight, eleven and twelve apparently homesick decided to run away under cover of darkness, after an absence of two days there were met at Ta Ta Creek by an Indian on his way to Cranbrook and brought back to the School, after travelling more than fifty miles in the general direction of their home. Then again at the end of the month three of the older girls aged fourteen, fifteen and fifteen belonging to three different Reserves, The Lower Kootenay, Tobacco Plains and Columbia Lake, like the three young boys moved out under cover of darkness and have not so far been located although all roads leading in the direction of their homes are being carefully watched by the Indians and the Police. One of the run aways worked with her parents in the State of Montana for about three months in 1942, and it is thought that they may be heading in that direction, for this reason the emigration authorities at Rooseville have been requested to be in readiness to receive them if they pass that way.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\n4th August 1943\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Cranbrook Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: Kathleen Doris Swite\nAge: 9th December 1933\nName of Band: Okanagan No. 9.\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: Denis Swite\nMother's full name and No.: Christine Eli\nParents living or dead: Father living; Mother just died.\nState of child's health:\nReligion: Roman Catholic.\nDoes applicant speak English?

On the occasion of my recent visit the Dormitories, Preventorium, Classrooms, dining room, kitchen, pantry etc., were all spotlessly clean and the excellent spreads on the Dining Room tables was proof conclusive that the children are not being stinted for food, on the contrary they are being well supplied with the necessary varieties of healthy, nourishing and appetizing things to eat.\n\nThe three run-away girls mentioned in my last report have since returned to school. They were picked up at McLeod, Alta., by a R.C.M.P. Police, and escorted back to Cranbrook by a priest.\n\nThe three young boys who were mentioned in my last report as having run away from school tried it again this month. The weather, however, was uncomfortably cold so much so that one little lad returned to the school of his own accord before completing his first night out. The other two were located and brought back the following day.\n\nMain Roof repair work undertaken at the School by the Firm of Patmore Bros., in which only Tremco products were used has been in as far as one can tell at the present time satisfactorily completed. The job appears to have been well done, and it is not thought possible that further trouble in this connection will be experienced for many years to come.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nOct 8 1945\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Kootenay Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Teresa\nEnglish name: Teresa\nAge: 6 1/2 (April 17/1937)\nName of Band: Shuswap\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: Joseph Eugene\nMother's full name and No.: Emma\nParents living or dead: Mother dead\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?

I surely owe you an apology, and certainly beg your pardon for what has happened.\n\nWhen your letter arrived I had just gone on holidays and on my return at the end of the month so much work had piled up that your letter was in some way mislaid and forgotten about until today. I am extremely sorry.\n\nThe Form is herewith enclosed together with an application for the admission of Teresa Eugene of the Shuswap Reserve whose mother was burned to death on June 12th, 1943.\n\nAndrew Innes,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 29, 1943.\n\nMr. Andrew Irwin, Indian Agent, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 24th, the Department approves the admission of the following children to the Kootenay Indian Residential Schools:\n\nPaul Basil Andrew, Theresa Eugene\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Rev. Father Forbes,\nThe Mission,\nCity.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nConcerning the Swite children - as you know Leonard was reported \"Negative\" - Lucy and Raymond as \"suspects\" for tuberculosis by The Travelling Clinic.\n\nTogether with my physical examination, I am of the opinion that it would be quite in order to keep these children at the Industrial School, treating the \"suspects\" as you do the other children that have been placed in this category.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) F.W. Green.\nKootenay Indian School,\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nNov. 25, 1943.\n\nMr. Alfred H. Barber,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Barber:\n\nYou will recall that the Doctor who examined the four Swite children of the one family (Violet Swite belongs to another family) recommended that they be X-rayed for T.B. as their mother died of that disease. This was reported to the Department and the Department asked that it be given the results of the examination so that it might decide whether these children might be admitted to this school.\n\nThe children were given the \"patch\" test and then, a little later, x-rayed by the Travelling Clinic. The results of these examinations have just been received in a copy of a letter written to Dr. Green by Dr. J. Douglas Galbraith of the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital. The results are:\n\n\"Lucy Swite: small infiltration just above right costophronic angle, tuberculosis suspect, refilm March, 1944.\"\n\n\"(Swite, Violet - negative - She is a cousin).\n\"Swite, Kathleen, negative\".\n\"Swite, Raymond, increased lung markings. This child is being classified as a tuberculosis suspect. Refilm March, 1944\",\n\"Swite, Leonard: The film which we have allocated to Leonard Swite is negative\",\n\nI asked Dr. Green whether he believed that these children are medically fit to attend this school.

I have gone to considerable trouble to get the real ages of all pupils and I beg to inform you that I forgot to advise you of my findings in Edna's case. I knew that her younger sister was born in 1929 and presumed by my predecessor was wrong in giving 1929 as the year of Edna's birth. I felt that it should be 1928. I found that Edna Auld was born on Jan. 3rd, 1929 and that Margaret Ault was born on Nov. 22nd, 1929. Edna is, therefore, 15 and not 16.\n\nEdward Morigean should have been listed as being 16.

While I did not suggest the change, it will, I think, meet with the approval of several employed by the Department as, after they had seen Father Anthony's work, these gentlemen suggested that Father Anthony be employed as Manual Training Instructor. Several Indians have suggested a change.\n\nIt is true that Father Anthony has a profession but, owing to his gifts as a cabinet maker and a carpenter, he has always had work where a church, a school or a rectory needed building or repairing with the result that, were he not stationed here as Manual Trainer, he would likely be sent elsewhere in the same capacity.\n\nI have not asked that the 16-year-old pupils be discharged as several asked to be given permission to return in September. As I felt that they would change their minds during the holidays, I told them to write to me during the holidays to let me know whether they still wished to return for another term.\n\n(Vancouver, B.C.) I shall likely submit the following case to Mr. Indian Agent Barber, although I do not know whether he will be able to do anything about it even though the \"facts\" given to me are as stated. At the request of the missionary, Father Collins, I allowed Eva Alec to come here. There seems to be no doubt that she is really an Indian but technically she is not. The story told me is that her mother was a bona fide Indian, with Indian rights, but lost her status by marrying a non-Indian. After she was deserted by this man, she lived with a bona fide member of the Penticton band and Eva was the result. If what I am told is true \"Her father is a full-blooded Indian of the Penticton Indian reserve\" but Eva is not considered an Indian by the Department although she is so considered by the Indians. I am not sure but I think that I was told that her parents were ordered off the Penticton reserve because of their co-habiting. Mrs. Edna Jack, who has children here, is a half sister of Eva and she wishes to have the girl given Indian rights. I am not asking that you do anything in the case unless and until Mr. Barber, who knows the case, brings the matter to your attention. I mention the matter because I intend to ask Mr. Barber to consider my request that, as an exception if necessary, the girl be admitted as a grant-earning pupil. He may have reasons not to request this favour of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. Forbes, O.M.I.\nCranbrook, B.C. Oct. 4, 1944\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe first referred to in the principal's note, Marietta Stanley, is abnormal, very much so. Her mother, Mrs. Frank Stanley, is the mother of six children three of whom are of school age and in school provided Marietta is accepted. The others and Mrs. Stanley's special care her husband having died two years ago.\n\nMrs. Stanley is one of the most industrious and conscientious women on the Reserve deserving of all the assistance that can be given.

I am sending the others to you with the exception of that of Isaac McKie. The boy's father told me that he had sent it directly to you but you have not received it. I have written to the father and spoken to the missionary and expect to have the form soon. The father has a daughter here and wishes the boy to be here.\n\nWould you please ask that the following pupils be discharged? 233-Frank Toby, 13 years old; 234 Edward Moriceau, 16 years old; 244 Raymond Teneese, 16 years old; 252 Matthias Martin, 16 years old; 268 Zachary White who is ill and whom the Doctor would like to send to the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital; 0258 Ann Mary White and 0309 Clara \"ack both of whom are 16 years of age.\n\n261 Leonard Louie and 0282 Louise Qualtier were here some years ago and their parents wish them to be re-admitted. They have been given their former numbers. The boy's sister, Annabel, was here for a short time, about 4 years ago, but does not appear to have been placed on the register as she was a superfluous pupil, i.e., one for whom no grant was received because she was one of those above the approved pupilage. (It may interest you to learn or recall that she was then as bald as a billiard ball. Now, she has a good crop of natural hair).\n\nA few are not yet 7. I request that they be admitted. One, who was 6 on Sept. 30th, is now 7. The mother did not wish to separate two sisters and, so, sent Clementine Jack (6) with Margaret (8). You know the rather sad case of Marietta Stanley (6). She is the daughter of the deceased Frank Stanley and of the valiantly struggling Mrs Frank Stanley. The mother is working for a living and has to look after her half-witted daughter Susan. Marietta is better off here with her sister Henrietta.\n\nIf it can be done, I suggest that, as an exception, 0346 Sabina David be admitted. Her deceased mother was a bona fide Indian\u2014you likely remember her (nee Christine Goodman) of the Lower Kootenay Band of this Agency. The father, an American Indian, had a woman look after her in the U.S.A. But this woman died and he could find no one else. Finally, Louie Ernest, of the Lower Kootenay Band, adopted the girl Indian fashion. Her ration book lists her as Sabina Ernest (showing that Louie Ernest has adopted her). She appears to have no home.\n\nPlease get permission for 0345 Eva Alec to stay here at least until June. She will be 16 in December but has just come. She is an orphan and her guardian, who has children here, wishes her to be here. She is an Okanagan and I believe that Mr Barber may write to Ottawa about her. She is not here because she was misconducting herself.\n\nAs I mentioned to you, five should have their tonsils removed and about 13 (what a drop!) require dental attention. Please get the required authorization.\nFor a change, very few were late returning this year. Of those absent some are ill (Felix Capilo broke leg at home\u2014now in hospital; Elizabeth Donc also was thrown from a horse\u2014broken arm\u2014at home; Lucy Swite ill at home\u2014her cousin is at home waiting to accompany Lucy to school\u2014they live near Vernon\u2014Zachary White is the sole truant.\n\nI am up to my neck in work and, so, close abruptly.\n\nYours [illegible], truly,\n\nG. Forbes.\n\nP.S. Mr. Irwin, I have just learned, has written very strong letter & fasting badly for White's parent.\n\nS.J.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa - Oct.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\n1. Would you please advance me $1500.00 so that I may pay my bills?\n\n2. The enclosed copy of a letter from Mr. Indian agent Brown will explain why I would like to see certain young ladies admitted to this school.\n\nGrasshoppers and lack of rain have brought locusts with our crops.\n\nRe 15-year-old Eva Lee. She was not sent here as a \"bird girl.\" She is O.K. I would request that she be permitted to stay here at least until June also; she will be 16 in June.\n\nMarietta deserves sympathy. Her mother is putting up a heroic struggle to care for her.\nportment money. She is a widow & has an invalid daughter whom I feel the Department should support. The mother has too much pride to ask for charity.\n\nYours truly faithfully,\n\nE. Miller Oct 7.\n7. Discharges\n9.

The Department approves the discharge of the pupils numbered as follows:\n\nNo. 233 No. 268\n\" 234 \" 0255\n\" 244 \" 0309\n\" 258\n\nThe admission of the following children is also approved:\n\nElizabeth Joseph Harry Moriceau\nSabina Teneese Johnnie Sam\nNoel John Justin Francis\nAdrian Birdstone\n\nWith reference to Marietta Stanley, I note your statement that this girl is subnormal. We have just received a letter from the Principal with reference to this girl and he does not make any mention of her condition being such as you describe. The Principal states that there is an imbecile girl in the family, but he does not intimate that Marietta is the one. As a matter of face we inferred from the Principal's letter that Marietta is in good health and this appears to be borne out by the Medical Officer's report. The\nonly possible exception, as far as we know from the Principal, is that the girl is only five years of age and, in view of the special circumstances of this family, we feel that an exception should be made in her case and she should be accepted as a pupil, even though she is under age.\n\nThe case of Sabina David is considerably different. The information from both yourself and the Principal indicates that this girl's father is an American Indian. Her mother presumably was a Canadian Indian, but died two years ago. When all is said and done the responsibility for the maintenance of this girl rests with the father and as he is an American Indian he should be able to make arrangements for the education of his daughter. At the moment I cannot see how we would be justified in accepting her as a grant-earning pupil in the Kootenay School. There is some reference to the fact that the girl has been living with a relative, Louis Ernest of the Lower Kootenay Band. You might let me know the year in which Ernest first assumed responsibility for her maintenance. Has the girl lived with Ernest since that time and has the father contributed any amount toward her maintenance?\n\nI understand that Eva Alee, who is a pupil of the school and is now fifteen years of age, will reach the age of sixteen in December. It has always been our practice to retain such pupils in the school until the following June 30. Consequently Eva Alee should remain in the Kootenay School until June 30, 1945.\n\nThe usual application forms and certificates of health should be forwarded for the following:\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 884-10, part 5)\nNo. 306 Isaac McKie  \n\" 310 Antoine Qualtier  \n\" 0340 Annabel Louie  \n\" 0341 Florence Louie  \n\nNo. 0342 Clementine Jack  \n\" 0343 Mary Jack  \n\" 0344 Larina Swite  \n\" 0345 Eva Alee\n\nR.A.

FROM THE PRINCIPAL OF THE\nKOOTENAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File # 150-60B\n\nIn looking over Mr. Hoey's letter (155-0-10, Oct. 16, 1944), Marietta Stanley, was classed as subnormal. This is not so. Evidently, either Mr. Hoey or Mr. Irwin confused Marietta who is perfectly normal with an elder sister, Susan, who, according to the School Doctor, \"has the mentality of a child of three\". Susan is not in School.\nOttawa,\nOctober 16, 1944.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant, I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has been sent today to Indian Agent Irwin. You will note our decision regarding Sabina David. We are willing to consider further representations in her regard, but at first glance it would appear that she is not eligible for admission.\n\nI have requested the Treasury Branch to send you by air mail the cheque for the earnings for the September quarter. The regular earnings are $3624.40 and in addition we are paying the special grant of $3.75 for each pupil on the average attendance for the September quarter amounting to $319.80. As you have previously been advised, there is a special grant of $15 per pupil for the current calendar year. We have already paid you the amount due at this rate for the March and June quarters and we are including the payment for the September quarter with your September cheque. The payment for the December quarter will be handled in the same manner.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. G. Forbes,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nR.A.

Principal writes as follows: You know the rather sad case of Marietta Stanley (5), she is the daughter of the deceased Frank Stanley and of the valiantly struggling Mrs. Frank Stanley. The mother is working for a living and has to look after her half witted daughter Susan.\n\nThe Principal was eager to have Marietta admitted although she is only five years of age. Susan, the imbecile, is fifteen years of age, a harmless, useless individual who cannot be left alone, thus causing her mother a great deal of worry and trouble. The Principal feels that he would like to relieve Mrs. Stanley of the responsibility of caring for this girl if the Department would approve of her admission to the school.\n\nRegarding Sabina David, as soon as her relative Louie Ernest can be located will learn from him the date from which he accepted responsibility for her maintenance and whether or not her father has made any contributions.\n\nWith reference to application forms and certificates of health for the pupils mentioned, these will be forwarded with the School's monthly report.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 6, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MOORE\n\nRe: Lucy Swite, No. 0331, Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nThis girl was admitted to the Kootenay School on September 1, 1943.

Forbes, O.M.I., he writes as follows:\n\n\"I asked the Missionary, the girl's father and others not to let her return after the summer holidays in 1944, unless a doctor certified that she was physically fit to attend school. The local doctor had ordered her to remain in bed during her entire holidays. She returned to the school November 15 and we soon had to send her to the hospital. She left for home yesterday (December 30, 1944) but I was unable, as was the doctor at the school, to have her father take her to the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital.

In the first place, we have only received a copy. The original return should be forwarded to this office.\n\nIn the preparation of the quarterly return I would direct your attention to circular letter of December 29, 1944, a copy of which I enclose, and also the notes on the preparation of the return which appear on the back of the form. It is extremely essential that the names of the pupils should be entered consecutively according to number. If you review page 3 of the attached return, you will note that the numbers are mixed up in such a manner that is extremely difficult to check the return. Please have the names of the pupils entered consecutively according to number.

M. Barre,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nJMB/DD\nMr. Phalen,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nDear Mr. Phalen:\n\nPlease find enclosed corrected original copy of our quarterly report for the Oct. --Dec. quarter of 1945. I appreciate the direction you gave me when returning the report for correction and completion as it aided me greatly in making the report according to the desired method. As you know I have not been familiar with the compiling of these reports and there were certain points over which I was puzzled but your letter and the copy of the circular have cleared them up. I hope you find the enclosed in order but if there are still corrections to be made I will gladly accept its return and any further suggested adjustments.\n\nYour letter mentioned that with each quarterly return there should be a copy of Form IA 4II. I mentioned this to our Agent but he said that as far as he understood that form only had to be sent when there was an admission or dismissal during the quarter reported. Since we have not had either admissions or dismissals during this quarter I am at a loss to know what should be entered. You will notice on the returns certain pupils who as far as I know are reported as attending day school in the Okanagan Agency and others of our own Agency who have failed to return. Since neither have been officially discharged by the Dept. I am still retaining their names on the quarterly sheets. At your convenience I would be pleased to have the matter of Form IA4II cleared up so that in future I will know precisely what to enter thereon.\n\nNo doubt you will recall my report of Sept. last on some of the difficulties with which we were confronted here. Since then we have had some very trying times with our light, heat, and water equipment. We have had a series of breakdowns and at one time we were for three days without light, heat, or water. That, in this climate, and with several children in bed with Measles at the time, is no small matter. I would like to write you further on these and relevant matters.\n\nI am in receipt of a cheque from the dept for $3200.00 as an advance on this quarter. If this report is found in order I trust the balance will be forthcoming.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 31, 1946.\n\nDear Father Kelly:\n\nI have your letter of January 25, sending back your December quarter return. This is now accepted and shows an average attendance of 94.32. This number is 4.32 over the authorized pupilage of the Kootenay School, but I am arranging to allow supernumerary grant for these pupils and the balance of the per capita allowance will go forward shortly.\n\nForm IA 411 should accompany each quarterly return. In the event of there being any admissions or discharges during the quarter, the names and register numbers, etc., of the pupils should be entered on this form and the information contained on this form should correspond with the information given on the quarterly return.\n\nIf there are no admissions or discharges during the quarter the form should still be forwarded but marked \"Nil\". I am sending back, for your guidance, a copy of your December quarter return. If you consider that pupils 236, 261, 310, 311, 0282, 0318, 0340 and 0341 should be discharged, you should make formal application for their discharge through the office of your local Indian agent. Approval will be granted on your joint recommendation and these names can then be dropped from the March quarter return. If at any time they wish to return to the school, application can be made for their re-admission. Incidentally, if a pupil is re-admitted he or she should be given the same number as they had during their previous period of residence.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. G. Kelly, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAGENCY'S REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31st, 1945.\n\nWelfare and Training\n\nThe Kootenay Indian School under the efficient leadership of Reverend Gerald Kelly, O.M.I., has made very steady progress during this quarter. The pupils are making rapid progress in their classes, most studies, domestic science, and manual training. The tubercular patients have shown very satisfactory improvements. There has been little or no sickness in school during this quarter except for five cases of measles, one reported on December 17th and four on December 29th. Antimarial serum was used on the contacts and it is hoped that this epidemic will reach no great proportions. The pupils are well nourished and their health is carefully looked after by Sister Marion Clare. The pupils were vaccinated against smallpox, and will be vaccinated against typhoid as soon as the measles is over. The school is well supplied with milk, eggs, vegetables and fruit.\n\nThis school carries eight pupils in excess of its quota. Three Auld children, who do not belong to the reserves, will be returned home as soon as the quarantine on measles permits. However, this still leaves us short of space for twelve pupils from the Columbia lake and Shuswap Reserves who should be returned to school, not only for their own good but as a matter of discipline. This matter has been referred to the Department and I am awaiting a reply before taking any action.\n\nThe fire extinguishers requisitioned for the school were finally received, and fire drills are held as per regulations. One unscheduled rehearsal was held at 5:00 o'clock one morning when the new fireman or night watchman inadvertently pulled the fire alarm. This proved to be a good and successful fire drill. In addition to the night watchman and fireman, Rev. Father Kelly has hired a new farm manager, who has good recommendations.\n\nOn my last inspection it was noted that good work had been done in redecorating the girls play room, several chairs having successfully been re-upholstered with bright materials. Kindergarten tables and temporary chairs as well as other objects have been fashioned in the Manual Training department. The domestic science department does excellent work in cooking under the direction of Sister John Anthony and Sister Catherine Mary's sewing class produced very good work. The pantry and hallway near the Father's dining room has also been redecorated.\n\nThe situation with reference to the plumbing at the school is still bad, even though some of the toilets were temporarily repaired, flush actions, etc., are so far unobtainable. One urinal near the boys dormitory was put in working order and all taps were replaced.\nThe situation with regard to power is worse; the Lister engine has not been in operation since it was repaired having run only for two weeks; the Petters engine, which is used to pump water, recently broke down, the fuel tank being gone. It is now undergoing emergency repairs. This leaves us entirely dependent on the old Otto engine which through Father Kelly's ingenuity was \"rigged up\" to pump water. This engine consumes gasoline at the rate of nearly a gallon an hour! So that between pumping water and charging batteries which will not hold their charge, it is pounding away from morn till dark. The Petters engine should be repaired in two or three days but the present situation emphasizes the gravity of the situation with reference to the electric generating plant. As this school is my request, Mr. John Ward of the Modern Electric recently submitted a report on this situation and copies of it were forwarded to the Commissioner's office. The water pump has recently caused quite a bit of anxiety; it was leaking so badly that it had to be primed before each pumping. It is a very ancient and heavy contraption and it is feared that the base is so corroded that it may give out altogether for the time being it has been packed with oakum, but it may become necessary to call in a welder to weld on a new base.\n\nAs a result of Commissioner MacKay's visit, authority was granted to install a new sink unit near the children's dining room. This will prove to be more sanitary and a great improvement for which we feel very grateful.\n\nRev. Father Kelly has given sporting activities more meaning in this school and he has recently purchased skates and toboggans which the children are enjoying.\n\nJ.M. Barre,\nActing Indian Agent.\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, April 11, 1946.\n\nMr. J. V. Boys, Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, British Columbia.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 2nd instant and the further fact that the Principal is willing to accept him, the Department approves the re-admission of Richard Luke White to the Kootenay Indian Residential School. Please inform the Principal that when this boy's name is being entered on the return he should be given the same register number as he formerly carried.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Kootenay SCHOOL DURING January-March QUARTER, 19**\n\n| No. | NAME          | Date of Admission | Age on Admission | No. of Tickets under which School's Annuity is paid | BAND | NAME OF PARENTS AND LIVING OR DEAD (Insert L. for living; D. for dead, after name) | Father | Mother | Religion of Parents | State of Education upon entering the School | Places and period of Previous Education |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|     | NONE          |                   |                  |                                                    |      |                                                                                  |        |        |                     |                                          |                                        |\n\n**DISCHARGE OF PUPILS**\n\n| No. | NAME          | Date of Discharge | Age on Discharge | PERIODS IN THE SCHOOL | STATE OF EDUCATION | Trade or Industry Taught and Proficiency in it | REMARKS UPON DISCHARGE REASONS FOR SAME |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 236 | Luke White    | Oct '47 15        | 9 1              | nil                   | Grade 7            | Farming (fair)                                | Allowed to return home                 |\n| 261 | Leonard Louis | Jan '48 13        | 7                | nil                   | Grade 5            |                                               | Accept on farm                         |\n| 310 | Antoine Lautier | June '48         | 9                | nil                   | Grade 2            |                                               | Attending day school in Okanagan agency |\n| 311 | Josephine Lam | June '48         | 9                | nil                   | Grade 2            |                                               |                                       |\n| 329 | Louise Lautier | June '48         | 14               | nil                   | Grade 6            | Home Economics                                 | Reported as attending day school       |\n| 6318| Mary P.

V. Boys, Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nWith reference to form #411, which accompanied\nthe March quarter return for the Kootenay Indian Residential School, you may inform the Principal the Department approves the discharge of pupils numbered as follows:\n\n|   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|\n| 236 | 310 | 0282 |\n| 261 | 311 | 0318 |\n\nYou are also requested to direct the Principal's attention to the fact that pupil #0293, who entered hospital on March 19th, was allowed full grant, while pupil #267 is shown as having entered a Preventorium on February 1st, and for whom 31 days grant was requested. Allowing grant up to 30 days for a pupil in hospital, as in the case of pupil #0293, was correct and pupil #267 should have been allowed 61 days instead of the 31 days shown.\n\nPupil #278 was allowed home on March 15th, and as the quarter ends March 31st, only 16 days should have been deducted instead of 30 as shown on return. On the June quarter return, this pupil should be shown as having returned to school on April 15th, and if he attends school regularly in the June quarter, he should be shown in residence 91 days, or the full quarter, as the full 30 days absent was deducted on the March return. At the same time, make a notation in the remarks column to the effect that the boy returned to school on April 15th.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, May 13th, 1946.\n\nJ. V. Boys, Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your report respecting the Kootenay Indian Residential School, for the month of April, 1946, I wish to inform you that the names of Sabina David and Lizzie Cole do not appear on the Kootenay Quarterly Return. Our records show that Sabina David was shown on the September quarter return, 1944 under school number 0346, but her name was omitted on the December quarter return, and school number 0346 was not used until September 1945, and was given to Gertrude Batiste.\n\nPlease advise if the above mentioned children are now attending Kootenay Indian Residential School, and if so, what school numbers have been allotted them.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Sabina David and Lizzie Cole,\nKootenay Residential School.\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 13th, your file 155-0-10, concerning the above-named pupils at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I wish to advise as follows:\n\nSabina David: This child, aged 10, was born in the USA but has been living with Louis Ernest at Lower Kootenay Reserve, Creston, B.C. Louis Ernest and wife wish to adopt Sabina, and it is hoped that this legal process will be completed in the near future. I do not know why this child was at one time shown on the attendance roll and given a number, only to be dropped later, for she has been in constant attendance at the school so far as I can ascertain.\n\nElizabeth Alec: This child, for some reason referred to in our office records as Lizzie Cole, comes from Penticton, B.C. I do not know why she has never been shown on the records or given a number. She is 16 years of age and will conclude her schooling at the end of the current school year.\n\nI have consulted the Principal, Father Kelly, as to the above two pupils and he informs me that he has continued to carry them as extra pupils in exactly the same manner as his predecessor, without being enlightened as to the necessity for the procedure.\n\nJ.V. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 14th, 1946.\n\nMr. J. V. Boys, Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, British Columbia.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo we have further checked our file, and wish to advise you that (a) the original application of Sabina David was forwarded in October 1944, and the Department approved her admission to the Kootenay Indian Residential School, in a letter to Mr. A. Irwin, at that time Indian Agent for Kootenay, British Columbia. The number given this pupil was #0346.\n\n(b) It is believed that an application for Elizabeth Alec was submitted in October 1944, but her name given on the form was Eva Alex, and was shown on the Quarterly Return as #0345. Incidentally, this is the only child on the return shown as over 16 years of age. Formal approval of admission was sent to Mr. A. H. Barber, Indian Agent at Vernon, British Columbia, in a letter dated the 17th of October, 1944.\n\nKindly check with the Principal, to determine that these are the two children referred to in your letter of the 28th of May, 1946.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nFurther to my letter of May 28th and your reply of June 14th, file 155-0-10, I wish to report further in the matter of the undernoted pupils at Kootenay Indian Residential School, after discussion with the Principal.\n\nSabina David At one time shown on school attendance sheet under #0346 but dropped from return of December 1944. We have a letter from you on file in this office requesting the reason for this discharge, but our files contain no reply to your letter. It was shortly after this date that my predecessor, Mr. Irwin, left this Agency. #0346 is now Gertrude Baptiste. I would suggest that Sabina David be reinstated under a new number.\n\nElizabeth Alec This girl, formerly referred to as Lizzie Cole, is not to be confused with Eva Alex, #0345, though they both come from the Lower Okanagan. Coming from the Okanagan Agency we have no family records in this office and I now find that when he told me Elizabeth was 16, Father Kelly, School Principal, was in error. The child's correct age is 14, so she may be expected to continue in school for another two years. I have made an intensive but unavailing search of the files at this office seeking some clue as to why this pupil has been carried at the school but not shown on the roll. It has been an unfortunate practice of both my predecessor and the former Principal to discuss several topics in a single letter thereby making accurate filing impossible.\n\nPerhaps you may see fit to accept Elizabeth Alec, assigning her a school number.\n\nJ. V. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 2, 1946.\n\nMr. J.V. Boys, Indian Agent, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 19th, the Department approves the assigning of new numbers to the following:\n\nSabina David and Elizabeth Alec.\n\nThe Principal should assign the numbers in the usual way and the names should be included in all future quarterly returns.\n\nBernard F.

While it is true he is not a full-blooded Indian, I would like to try to have him accepted. If you think it advisable would you consider signing the enclosed application forms and forwarding them to Ottawa. I doubt if he would have been accepted a few years ago but my present experience is that the Department is somewhat more lenient in such cases now. During the past year I was able to take in two 'aliens', Elizabeth Alec from Penticton, and one who was half American from Creston.\n\nIf they will accept Bertram I feel it would give him a chance as he is a rather backward child. If you would be good enough to explain the circumstances of his case to the Department, I would appreciate it very much.\n\nWith sincere thanks,\n\nI remain,\n\nTruly yours,\n\nG. F.

Although he has never been entered as a member of the Penticton Band, a brother and sister of the same parents were. He is entered on the rolls of the Colville (U.S.) Agency.\n\nThis child's mother died during its infancy, since when he has been brought up by Mrs. Holding, who lost her Indian Status on her marriage to a white man, a sister of Angus Alex, the child's father, living in the city of Penticton. She is a decent and respectable woman and has the child's welfare at heart. She had him attend the Penticton Public School for two years. However, the boy is much undersized and handicapped by badly crossed eyes, and has had a pretty rough time and does not fit in with the white boys at all.\n\nIn the interest of the child and in consideration of Mrs. Holding, who is very cooperative with this office and the church, I would recommend that Department authorise this child's admission to the Residential School, on condition that he is not to be considered as a member of the Penticton Band at this time.\n\nThis child also attended the Penticton Day School for a time but only as a favour on the part of the teacher who was aware that he was not on the Band Roll. He is, of course, Indian in every way and I expect, legally is an Indian of the Colville (U.S.) Agency, where his father belongs. However, it will be much in the child's interest if the Department will approve the attached application.\n\n(Alfred H.

With the exception of No's 297 and 0298, I feel sure that the usual form re. discharge was filled in with the June Quarter. However in case it was overlooked I am attaching a letter requesting the discharge of those who on that date were of age to be discharged.\n\nIn regard to the two numbers mentioned above, No. 297 failed to return to school after the Summer Vacation. As he is from Fort Nelson district I understood that he was this year attending a day school. As regards No. 0298, her name was overlooked when making the Sept. quarter. She is here at school and will appear on the forthcoming report. Trusting this will clear up any difficulty in the matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nTruly yours,\n\nG.F.

If a pupil returned to school September 15th he is entitled to sixty-two days plus sixteen, thus seventy-eight.\n\nIn the \"Remarks\" column of the September Quarterly Return, it is noted that you have made an entry opposite the names of the above mentioned pupils \"Returned Late\". In order to adjust this return, it will be necessary for you to forward the exact date on which the pupils returned to school.\n\nIncidentally, the December Grant will go forward this week and any adjustment arising from the above will be deducted from the March Quarter Return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Though not full blood Indians both he and his wife, the former Mary Gravelle, were accepted as pupils at this school some twelve and fifteen years ago. They are not living within reach of a day school and if accepted by the Dept. they would be glad to send their children here. From present indications our enrollment will fall short of our quota this year and I would be willing to have these children with us. Would you mind taking the matter up with the Dept. so that we may have their ruling on it as soon as possible.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(sgd) G. F. Kelly, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter from the Rev. Father Kelly, Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, requesting authority to admit Sally May Phillips and Sadie May Phillips of Flagstone to his school.\n\nThe father of these children, Douglas Phillips, is part Indian, was born adjacent to the Tobacco Plains Reserve and attended our Residential School some fifteen years ago. The mother, formerly Mary Gravelle, is the daughter of Ambrose Gravelle, a member of the Tobacco Plains Band, Kootenay Agency, who also attended our Residential School some years past.\n\nAs these children are more Indian than white, and as school facilities are not readily available to them and there is room for them at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I would recommend that their admittance be authorized if at all possible.\n\nJ.

Barber, Indian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Barber:\n\nPlease find enclosed application for admittance to this school of two children from your agency, Fredrick Swite and Wilfrid Squakim. Would you please complete these and send them to Ottawa. There is a rather queer circumstance regarding Wilfrid Squakim. As you will notice he is not yet six years of age but his mother was very anxious to have him come. I understand that the grandmother of some of the relatives have been taking care of him. While she was pleased to have him come and asked me personally if we could take him she was reluctant to sign the admission papers so Father Collins sent them to me as is. Perhaps you could add a note to this effect or if she is within contact explain the necessity of having these papers signed.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nVernon, B.

She is in very poor health and it is in the interest of the child that she be admitted to the Residential School and approval is recommended.\n\n(Alfred H.

Dunn,\nSuperintendent.\n\nJSD:FSB\nMEMORANDUM - Mr. W. S. Arneil:\n\nRe: Admissions to Residential Schools.\n\nI refer to Mr. Sampson's letters of December 5 and 7 concerning the above. You will note from his letter of December 5 that six children have been withdrawn from the Provincial School at Enderby and admitted to the Kamloops Residential School without reference to the office of the Superintendent of the Okanagan Agency. The home conditions of these children do not require their enrolment at a Residential School. In addition his letter of December 7 shows that children who should be attending the Inkameep Indian Day School have been admitted to the Kootenay Indian School without reference to him.\n\nIn the case of the six children admitted to the Kamloops School, these admissions, in addition to involving an unwarranted expenditure of public funds, have denied accommodation to children who should be in the Kamloops Residential School either because home circumstances require that the children be given institutional care or because there is a lack of Day School facilities on the Reserve.\n\nIn the case of the two children admitted to the Kootenay Residential School, you will recall an interview in your office with the Principal in which you specifically requested that he draw no children from the Inkameep Reserve as we were most anxious to get the Inkameep School running on a sound basis.\n\nTo my mind these are shocking examples of lack of cooperation on the part of the church authorities and I feel there must be a definite statement of policy by the Department with regard to the admission of children to Residential Schools if these institutions are to fill the function expected of them. These regulations should\nrequire that (1) no child shall be admitted to a Residential School without reference to the Superintendent of the Agency in which the child resides and (2) should a child be admitted without reference to the Superintendent no per capita grant will be paid for that child.\n\nIn addition to the above statement of general policy, in these two cases I recommend that these pupils be discharged from the Residential Schools at the close of the present term and be re-admitted to the schools they should be attending, effective January 1, 1951, and that no per capita grant be paid to Residential Schools for these children for the current quarter.\n\nR. F. Davey,\nRegional Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nVernon, B.C.,  \nDecember 7, 1950.\n\nAttn. R.F. Davey, Esq.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Comm'r. for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRe: Admissions to Kootenay Indian School.\n\nAdmission forms for Dorothy and Albert Louie of Osoyoos Band are attached hereto, for forwarding to the Department.\n\nThese admissions have been recommended only because the children have already been in school for most of the term so far, and it is impractical to transfer them to the local day school mid way through the term. It would also deprive the School of the grant for these pupils.\n\nThe children should be attending the Inkameep Indian Day School on Osoyoos I.R. No. 1. The parents asked me during the summer if the Inkameep school would be open and said it was their intention to send them to that school. I assured them it would be operating and we were anxious that the children attend. The first word I had of their admission to Kootenay Indian School was the arrival of the admission forms in late November.\n\nR.H.G.

M. MacKay, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Admissions to Residential Schools\n\nI attach hereto a memorandum dated December 8th from our Regional Inspector of Schools, Mr. Davey, together with a copy of a letter dated December 7th from Indian Superintendent Sampson, with application forms attached for admissions to residential schools.\n\nIt will be noted from Mr. Davey's memorandum that the eight children affected were admitted to residential schools without reference to the Agency office and further that it is considered the home conditions of these children were satisfactory and that adequate provision existed for their education locally. In the case of the five Jones' children and the Beatty boy from Enderby Reserve, it will noted that they have attended Enderby Public School for periods ranging from three to nine years.\n\nLeaving the financial aspect aside, I feel perhaps the most regrettable feature is the fact that eight other Indian children are being at present deprived of any education at all. I have in mind that we could readily have supplied eight other pupils to these residential schools from Douglas Lake, Fountain or other Reserves where the children have at present no opportunity to attend any school. I concur with Inspector Davey in his recommendation and should appreciate advice concerning this matter at your convenience.\n\nThe other applications attached are recommended for approval.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n**ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT: Kootenay SCHOOL DURING: October - Dec QUARTER 1947**\n\n| No. | NAME          | Date of Admission | Band       | Name of Parents and Living or Dead (Insert L. for living, D. for dead, after name) | Religion of Parents | State of Education upon entering the School | Places and period of Previous Education |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|     |               |                   |            |                                                                                  |                     |                                             |                                        |\n| 359 | Albert Louis  | 16-10-50          | 13         | Enkameya                                                                           | R.C.                | Nil                                         | Inukwe Bay School - 4 mos.             |\n| 0401| David Louis   | 16-10-50          | 11         | Enkameya                                                                           | R.C.                | Grade 5                                     | Inukwe Bay School - 1 yr.              |\n\n**DISCHARGE OF PUPILS**\n\n| No. | NAME          | Date of Discharge | Periods in the School | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge Reasons for Same |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|     |               |                   | Years Months Days     | On Admission       | Trade or Industry Taught and Proficiency in it |\n|     |               |                   |                       | On Discharge       |                                        |\n| 10320| Elizabeth Ignatius | 5-12-50           | 8 4 4                | nil                | Grade VI                                |\n|      |               |                   |                       |                    | Home Economics Doctor's Recommendation |\n|      |               |                   |                       |                    | Fair                                    |\n\n**NOTE:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 884-10, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nJanuary 13, 1951.\n\nMr. J.S.

He left the school two years ago and now wishes to resume his studies, and if possible, go on the High School next year. He is one of our better characters, and his behaviour was excellent during the two year's absence from the school. He is of average intelligence. On the advice of Father Kelly, I took him back. In cases like this is it necessary to submit a new \"Application for Admission\"?

Dunn,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nCranbrook, B.C.,\n\nWith reference to the September Quarterly Return for the Kootenay Indian Residential School we have not received the necessary application for admission for pupil # 371 Felix Abel consequently his admission to the school has not been approved. The Principal has claimed twenty-six days grant for this boy, however as his admission to the school has not been approved the per capita grant on the September Quarterly Return for him is being disallowed. It would be appreciated if you would arrange to have the necessary application prepared and forwarded to this office for consideration and advise the Principal that it will be in order to include this boy's name on the December Quarter claiming per capita grant for the December Quarter and twenty-six days for September. The necessary explanation should be shown in the Remarks Column.\n\nThe Principal has shown # 0345 for Margaret Jack. Our records indicate that this pupil's number is 0343. The Principal has shown 0353 for Martina Pierre. Our records indicate the register number for this girl is 0355. Please advise the Principal to amend his copies of the Return.\n\nThe Principal has claimed fourteen days grant for pupil # 0370 Merle Gravel and indicated that this girl was admitted to this school on September 4th. It is evident that either she entered the school late or was truant, consequently we are disallowing any grant for her until the matter is clarified. Please instruct the Principal that it will be in order to claim fourteen days grant or whatever grant is entitled to the school on the December Quarterly Return indicating in the Remarks Column.\nthe exact date for claiming the number of days. It will be in order for the Principal to claim the usual per capita grant for the December Quarter on the same Return.\n\nThe Principal has claimed seventy-two days for pupil # 348 indicated in the Remarks Column that she was admitted to hospital on September 10. Please bring to the Principal's attention our circular stating that the school is entitled to hospital grant of thirty days in such cases. We are allowing the school ninety-two days grant for this pupil. The Principal has neglected to show the dates pupils 355 and 356 returned from their vacation and hospital respectively and claimed less than the prescribed number of days in the quarter for each of the two pupils.

A former pupil who has been attending Flagstone Public School Merle requested re-admission to enable her to attend the Cranbrook High School.

A reservation had been made for Sebastian to leave Vancouver via C.P.R. on November 5th, but on the afternoon of November 4th, we received a telephone call from the Boys' Industrial School advising that a routine examination prior to discharge from the school indicated that Sebastian had an enlarged heart, and the doctor recommended specialist treatment and advised again transporting the boy by airplane to Cranbrook. The Industrial School had no explanation for the fact that this condition had not been diagnosed on previous occasions, but we did not feel that he should be sent to the Kootenay School until such time as further examinations can be made by a heart specialist. Consequently, it was necessary to cancel arrangements made for the admission of Sebastian to the Kootenay School.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nNovember 17, 1952\n\nMr. M.G.

These plans had all been undertaken with the full co-operation of Ronald's grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. William Baker, who have cared for the boy since infancy.\n\nThe family was visited yesterday and advised at that time that they had changed their minds about sending the boy to Cranbrook as they felt it was too far for him to go. They seemed quite aware of the consequences that they would have to take if the boy became ill, but they still continued to refuse to carry out the plan of school admission; consequently, this boy will not be admitted to the Kootenay School as previously arranged.\n\nW.S.

Father G.F. Dunlop, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian School,\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nDear Father Dunlop:\n\nThe Department has recently instructed that the enrolment of Indian children at residential schools be reviewed. In looking over the list for Kootenay School, I find that there is no justification for the following children to be attending:\n\nJean and Arthur Parker\nViolet, Winifred, Ethel & James Thomas\nGrace, Margaret, Clementine & Roy Jack.\nArbelle Felix.\n\nThe parents of these children have been informed that you are being asked to discharge the children as of June 30th, 1953. Arrangements are being made to send them to local day and public schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nSuperintendent,\nOkanagan Indian Agency.\n\nS:CM\nKootenay Indian School\nUnder the Direction of the Oblate Fathers\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nAugust 20, 1953.\n\nMr. Philip Phalen Supt.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nMcFarland Bldg.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phalen:\n\nPlease find enclosed a letter I received from Superintendent Sampson a few weeks ago.\n\nMay I point out that with the exception of the Parker children, there is no justification for holding back the other children listed. The Thomas children and Arbelle Felix are from Enderby. This Reservation has no Catholic day school. It is true that the Jack family belong to the Penticton Band where there is a Catholic day school. However, Mr. Jack has had steady employment elsewhere for several years. It seems unreasonable to ask him to give up steady employment and return to the Penticton Reservation in order that his children attend the day school there.\n\nI have a letter from Mr. Jack in my files specifically asking me to take this matter up with the Department on his behalf. In this letter he explains his situation, and is most anxious that his children return to this school.\n\nI am most anxious to have these children attend this school again. Anything you can do concerning this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. P. Dunlop, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nAugust 27th, 1953.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver 2, B.C.\n\nRe: Kootenay Indian Residential School\n\nFurther to my letter of August 24th concerning the discharge of certain children belonging to the Okanagan Agency from the above named residential school, I have now received a letter from the Principal with which he encloses a letter he has received from Mr. Sampson. I am forwarding herewith copies of these two letters.\n\nIn view of the concern which you have had about the enrolment at the Kootenay School, and the correspondence which you have had with Mr. Sampson concerning this matter, I feel that Mr. Sampson's action in writing to the Principal without consulting you was unnecessarily hasty.\n\nI shall appreciate having your recommendation as to what action should be taken with regard to the discharge of the children who Mr. Sampson feels should be released. It is felt that you should also inform Mr. Sampson that he should not arrange for the discharge of children unless he has departmental approval for so doing. In this connection, you might draw Mr. Sampson's attention to Section 10 of the regulations with respect to residential schools. The use of Superintendent in this section refers to the Superintendent of Education, as indicated in the definition given in Section 2.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nTo enable this file to be made available to researchers it has been necessary for IAND officials to exclude some material in accordance with Cabinet Directive No. 46 of 7 June 1973.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 884-10, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE TO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\nSEE CURRENT VOLUME\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 884-10, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10 Volume 6455)\n\nFile 884-11, part 2\nKootenay Agency - Kootenay Residential School -\nVocational Training - Supplies - Accounts -\nInstructors' Salaries\n1932 - 1941\n\nFile 884-11, part 3\nKootenay Agency - Kootenay Residential School -\nVocational Training - Supplies - Accounts -\nInstructors' Salaries\n1941 - 1948\n\nFile 884-14, part 1\nKootenay Agency - Kootenay Residential School -\nLivestock - Accounts\n1925 - 1944\n\nFile 884-17, part 1\nKootenay Agency - Kootenay Residential School -\nCadet Corps Band Set - Accounts\n1929\n\nFile 884-23, part 1\nKootenay Agency - Kootenay Residential School -\nDeath of Pupils.\n1935 - 1950\n\nFile 885-1, part 1\nCowichan Agency - Kuper Island Industrial School -\nGeneral Administration\n1888 - 1917\n\nFile 885-1, part 2\nCowichan Agency - Kuper Island Industrial School -\nGeneral Administration\n1918 - 1945\n\nFile 885-2, part 1\nCowichan Agency - Kuper Island Industrial School -\nQuarterly Returns\n1946 - 1950\n**GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA**\n\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, BRITISH COLUMBIA**\n\n**Kootenay AGENCY**\n\nTo...Rev.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 155-0-11, dated February 28, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, December 11, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Kootenay Indian Residential School on the 21st ultimo.\n\nIt appears from this report that Mr. Barry discussed with you the qualifications of the present manual training instructor. He further reports that you told him you might be able to obtain the services of a trained manual training instructor from the Cranbrook Provincial Schools.\n\nThe Department considers that this latter arrangement would be preferable to retaining the present manual training instructor, who appears to be insufficiently qualified for the position.\n\nMr. Barry also reports that there is a possibility of obtaining the services of a blacksmith to instruct the boys in general farm blacksmithing, including the shoeing of horses. The Department considers that instruction of this kind would likely be very useful to the boys attending the Kootenay School.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you what action you intend taking in connection with the above matters.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Michael Murphy, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian Res. School,\nCranbrook, B. C.\n\nPP/O'M.\nThe Manual Training is at present under the care of a young man, Mr. Patrick Grant. The only qualification that Mr. Grant would appear to have is the fact that he was for four years at the Vancouver Technical School. He is certainly not the kind of Instructor we require in the Indian Residential Schools. I understand that he wants to leave, does not care for the work, etc., or at least so I am informed by the Principal.\n\nThe Manual Training Shop has been previously reported upon by me. It is some 24 feet by 36 feet with six large double benches. There is a good blackboard, and the building is heated by a wood burning stove. It was not very tidy when I visited the place. I suggested that the shavings and small pieces of waste wood be burned and not left about on the floor. I made a point of asking the instructor about the condition of the tools. He was not very definite but appeared to consider them in a satisfactory state. I consider that they are in anything but a satisfactory state, and I suggested that he have the boys learn to keep the tools properly, and now proceed to sharpen them Etc. The three or four tools that I examined at random were in a very bad state indeed, half moons out of chisels, etc.\n\nIt would appear that twenty-one boys in two classes of twelve and nine are taught for two half days from November to March and I expressed the fact that I was not very well satisfied with this work and the Principal told me that there was a chance that they might obtain the services of a TRAINED MANUAL INSTRUCTOR from the Cranbrook Provincial Schools for a weekly visit on Saturdays. This would be a splendid arrangement, and I would ask that the Department insist on some such change at the earliest possible moment. The Indian Agent would no doubt be able to arrange this matter for the Department. He is I believe in agreement with me in the matter, which I have talked over with him in broad outline.\n\nThere also appears to be the possibility of obtaining the services of a blacksmith to instruct the boys in general farm blacksmithing, including the shoeing of horses. I certainly agree with the Indian Agent that this is the sort of instruction which would be of the very greatest use to the boys when they leave school. I would ask the Department to also communicate with the School and the Indian Agent with regard to this activity, which I wish to very strongly recommend for this school. The question of the starting a shoemaking shop is being left to next year, as I wish to have the boys instructed in the above first.\nTHE KOOTENAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nCRANBROCK, B.C.\n\nDec. 23rd, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. MacKenzie,\n\nYour letter of December 17th-(185-0-II), came to hand in due time.\n\nRe Manual Training: We shall make arrangements at once with the Instructor of Manual Training in Cranbrook Provincial Schools, to take charge of our class of Manual Training immediately after the Christmas holidays.\n\nRe Blacksmithing: We have among our hired men, a man of expert blacksmithing experience and we shall see to it that our boys are instructed in general farm blacksmithing and horse-shoeing in particular, during their residence at our school.\n\nIn general we shall make every effort to carry out in our school the aim of the Department.

It is considered that the manual training instructor should have the pupils clean up the room previous to dismissal of the class.\n\nThe Inspector also comments as follows regarding the work of the manual training class:\n\n\"There are dozens of places in the school where the Manual Training Class could carry out repairs, mending floors, fixtures for the classrooms, etc. I suggested to the Principal that the boys, under their Instructor could carry out numerous repairs without cost to the Department. If they are unable to do this the present system had better be changed. I think there has been too much time spent in foolish little models like the work done in Provincial Schools.\"\n\nThe Department agrees with the above remarks, and the matter should be drawn to the attention of the Principal.\n\nPlease let me know the name of the manual training instructor at the Kootenay School. In Mr. Barry's report he states the name is J. S. Manson, but it is noted that the voucher forwarded monthly from your office shows the manual training instructor's name as J. Cullen.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nThe Manual Training is now under the care of J. S. Manson, the Manual Training Instructor of the Cranbrook Schools. This is in accordance with my own recommendations as stated in my last report.\n\nThe Manual Training Shop is some 24 feet by 36 feet with six large double benches. There is a good blackboard. The building is heated by a wood-burning stove. When I visited the shop it was very untidy, shavings on the floor. I am certainly very surprised to find that any trained teacher of Manual Training would leave the place as I found it. The Principal explained that the school was at fault and that the shavings should have been gathered up in the afternoon following the class. I do not agree and consider that the Manual Training instructor, or in fact any teacher, should have his class clean up the room previous to dismissal. As this matter of an untidy Manual Training Shop was reported last year, I would ask that the Department take the matter up through the Indian Agent, who will of course have a copy of this report. It was not mentioned to Mr. Irwin at the time, owing to the fact that there were so many other points to be discussed. The tools, reported in poor condition last year, have been, I understand, overhauled and repaired. Numerous missing parts have been replaced. They were locked up and I was unable to see them.\n\nI am not very well satisfied with the work being done here in Manual Training, though I admit it is an improvement on that of last year. There are dozens of places in the school where the Manual Training Class could carry out repairs, mending floors, fixtures for the classrooms, etc. I suggested to the Principal that the Boys, under their Instructor could carry out numerous repairs without cost to the Department. If they are unable to do this, the present system had better be changed. I think there has been too much time spent in foolish little models like the work done in Provincial Schools. This is clear from the attached Manual Training Report handed to me at the school.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOFFICE OF\nINDIAN AGENT\n\nGranbrook, B.C.,\nDecember 4, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 155-0-11 of November 6th and in reply to state, as I did in my report for the month of October, that I am in full accord with Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Kootenay Indian Residential School and have brought the subject matter of your letter before the principal, who has promised to see to it that more work of a practical nature such as referred to in your letter will in future be undertaken by his boys under the guidance of their manual training instructor.\n\nThere is no doubt that quite a lot of the repair work around the buildings might be handled in this way, which would have the worth while effect not only of saving money for the Department, but of giving the boys the practical training they require.\n\nThe name of the Manual Training Instructor is Brother J. Cullen and the Mr. J. S. Manson referred to by Inspector Barry is supposed to take the classes on Saturdays only for which he is paid at the rate of $5 per day from Mr. Cullen's cheque.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAI/SH\nKootenay Indian Residential School\nCranbrook, B.C.\nDecember 31, 1936.\n\nAndrew Irwin, Esq.\nIndian Agent\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nTo the Services of an Instructor of Manual Training\nfor the quarter ending December 31, 1936.\n\n$120.00\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nI have received the payment of $120.00 for Services\nas Instructor of Manual Training at the Kootenay Indian\nResidential School for the quarter ending December 31, 1936.\n\n[Signature]\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo: Rev.

S. Manson who is the Provincial manual training instructor in Cranbrook and comes out to the school each Saturday. The Principal complains about the trouble of transporting the instructor to and from Cranbrook weekly. I believe the Department's grant for manual training at this school is being wasted.\"\n\nPlease discuss the above report with the Reverend Principal and let me know what steps you consider could be taken to make the manual training more effective. Is it possible to secure a qualified manual training teacher to replace Mr. Manson? It is understood, of course, that his services should be retained until you have reported further to the Department and our decision has been given.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nKootenay Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n7th January 1939\n\nMr. A. Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Irwin:\n\nI was very much surprised at the rather severe criticism of our Manual Instructor by the School Inspector, Captain Barry.\n\nMr. Manson has been for years the Instructor in the Public School of Cranbrook. As such he is thoroughly qualified, and were he not, it is surprising that the Provincial School authorities have been satisfied during all this time. Mr. Manson has been carpentry instructor here in the Kootenay Residential School for many years. Is it only now apparent that he is useless and that the money paid by the Department for a Manual Instructor is being wasted?\n\nCaptain Barry considers this money as being wasted. I wonder if the following construction works by the Indian boys of this school testify to waste. They have been and are still being taught the correct handling of tools. They have been and are still being taught blackboard drawing. During the past two and a half years they have repaired many articles of furniture; they have made several cupboards, and a few farm gates. They have constructed snow shelters on the girls' side and the boys' side of the school to protect the children from falling icicles from the roof. Moreover the boys have been the main workers in the erection of a three car garage last year, and at present are constructing a new poultry house. They are also engaged in making two fire doors on the stair-way landings leading to the dormitories.\n\nNo doubt it would be far better and more convenient if we had a resident manual instructor. I fail to see how we can do better, or how we can obtain a first class manual instructor on $400.00 a year. No doubt there are a few carpenters around who might do, but who have no technical school.\nI have only words of praise for Mr. Manson, our Manual Instructor. Considering the short time at his disposal I think he has done excellent work with the boys under his charge.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.J. Collins, M.S.\nPrincipal\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your 155-0-11 of December 14th, with reference to a statement by Mr. Inspector Barry in his School report of November 9th and 10th, to the effect that the services of Mr. J. S. Manson, as Manual Training Instructor at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, should be dispensed with.\n\nIt is, doubtless, true that a full time resident Manual Training Instructor would be preferable to a part time Instructor. If, however, financial limitations make this hope impossible then, in my own humble opinion, we are extremely fortunate to have Mr. Manson and, if any doubt is entertained by the Department as to what the Reverend Principal thinks of the man and his work, the enclosed letter, with which I fully agree, speaks for itself.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.

It was impossible to save anything from the Blacksmith Shop. We certainly could have saved more tools and flooring, had I allowed the boys to enter the burning Building (they volunteered to do so) but I knew that the Department would disapprove of my taking a risk in this matter. Those men named, have brought the tools out of the Building, and some of the Boys carried the tools to safety.\n\nA fact which I would ask you to draw to the attention of the Department is, that while he could have saved tools belonging to himself, and to the Oblate Fathers, our Carpenter left them in order to save all tools possible belonging to the School.\n\nAnother point is, that immediately after coming here, I had the Blacksmith Shop cleared of a number of cardboard boxes, papers and rags. I also had a large pile of rubbish burned or removed from within fifteen feet of the Carpenter shop.\"\n\nThe Tools Saved:\n\n1 Figure 4 Miter Box.\n1 only Steel Framing Square.\n1 \" Common Square.\n1 \" Wood Rasp.\n1 \" Saw Set\n2 \" 6 point 25\" Rip Saws.\n2 \" 8 \" Cross Cut Saws.\n1 \" 9 \" Ditto.\n1 \" Key Hole Saw.\n2 \" Iron Clamps.\n4 each, 3\" and 12\" wood clamps.\n60 Lbs approximately, 2\u00bd\" Finish nails.\n3 Auger Braces.\n2 only, 30/36 window sashes 2 ft.\n2 only Draw Knives.\n1 \" Halround 2\" Chisel.\n1 \" 1\" Chisel.\n2 only 12\" Back Saws.\n15 only Jack Planes.\n1 \" Jointer Plane.\n1 adjustable 45\u00b0 Plane.\n1 only Yankee Drill.\n4 \" Nail Hammers.\n1 \" Wood mallet.\n6 \" Try Squares.\n1 \" Large Screw-driver.\n1 \" Small Ditto.\n1 \" Oil Stone.\n1 \" Grind Stone.\n28 only 8\" Chisels.\n17 \" Ditto.\n3 \" 8\"\n2 \" 1\u00bd Halround chisels.\n\nTools Lost:\n\n3 only Coping Saws.\n4 \" Wood clamps.\n3 \" 48\" Ditto.\n15 only Drawing Boards.\n1 set, flat chisels.\n22 only Mortise Gauges.\n24 only calipers.\n1 only wood level.\n1 Figure 4 Miter box.\n4 only wood rasps.\n1 \" Nail Puller.\n3 \" 10 point 20\" Saws.\n1 \" Key-hole saw.\n1 \" Hacksaw.\"\nTOOLS LOST\n\n1 only. 4\"Chisel.\n1 \" Draw Knife.\n10 Rolls 500' Scuten Paper.\n100 Lbs. approximately.

Classes are being held in a former chicken coop, but there is not sufficient light and there are various other disadvantages as you know.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the Blacksmiths Shop was burned at this particular time, as the boys could have learned a good deal of useful blacksmithing during seeding operations, mending broken implements etc., All this work has to be done in Town.\n\nWould you please ask the Department for materials to re-build both Shops? With their Instructor, the boys can do the building as part of their training.\n\nThe Carpenter's shop measured 28'x26' and had as foundation a cement wall rising 3' above the ground. The walls, lumber, ran up another 3' to the roof which had an 8-12 pitch. A building of the same dimensions would be very acceptable; an earthquake some years ago damaged part of the foundations, but this can be repaired and the same foundations can be used.\n\nMaterials required to re-build the Carpenter Shop:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| 132 Lineal Ft. 2x6 (Sills) |          |\n| 152 \"                 | 2x4 (Plates) |\n| 21 Pieces             | 2x4-10 Studs |\n| 14 \"                  | 2x4-12 (End studs) |\n| 14 \"                  | 2x4-14 \"     |\n| 40 \"                  | 2x6-16 Joists |\n| 40 \"                  | 2x6-10 Rafters |\n| 1200 Sqr.

It measured 26'x16'. Materials required for a new shop which would be built by the boys as part of their training, would be as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| 168 Lineal Ft. 2x6;   |          |\n| 32 Pcs 2x4-8          |          |\n| 40 \"                  | 2x4-12   |\n| 14 \"                  | 2x4-16   |\n| 1540 Sqr.Ft.

One floor was laid before the fire occurred. The Flooring for the other Dormitory and the Scutan paper were lost. Only the mails were saved. The Flooring was stored in the Carpenter Shop, which seemed a safe place.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned........... G.

Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School regarding the tools owned by the Manual Training Instructor and the Oblate Order lost when the Manual Training shop was destroyed by fire:\n\n\"I do not know whether you saw my report on the fire. In this report, I pointed out that, in order to save as much of the Government owned tools as possible, tools belonging to the carpenter and to the Oblates were deliberately sacrificed. As it was the carpenter, Father Murray and an Indian who were in the building and saved the tools, they could easily have saved the carpenter's and the Oblates' tools. If it is at all possible, Mr. Reifferscheid and Father Anthony would greatly appreciate being reimbursed for their loss. I enclose a list of these tools. Would you please return it as it is the only one I now have?\"\n\nIt is highly doubtful if the Department would accept responsibility in a case of this kind because of the principle involved, nor am I prepared to recommend replacement of personal property from public funds. The matter, however, is being referred to the Department, as the Rev. Principal would no doubt wish me to do so.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

The clue to the mystery appears to lie in the word Kootenay. In the other schools of which I have been in charge, the grant is paid for the twelve months, and so, naturally I expected that the case was the same here. I would submit that there are very good reasons either for the grant to be given for 12 months, or that the Department pay a Carpenter to make necessary repairs during the holidays. Naturally, if the Manual Trainer or the Carpenter did not work during the entire two months, the grant would cover only the days he worked. Last summer, the Manual Trainer worked steadily. You will recall that the Department supplied us with Flooring for the four dormitories, and that just before the floor was laid in the first dormitory, fire destroyed the rest of the lumber. The Department kindly supplied more flooring, but this did not come in time for the boys and their Instructor to lay the remaining floors before the holidays. There were holes in the floors, nails sticking out, splinters etc., so that especially if one had to get up at night, there was danger of injury. During the holidays the Manual Trainer did this, and other work.\n\nWhen the Commissioner was here, I took him around to show him some urgently needed repairs. I forget the expression he used before we started out, but it indicated that he had inspected the school before, and knew how poorly it had been constructed. I showed him the basement floor (dining room for employees and children, long corridors, recreation halls, kitchen, pantries, etc., which sinks and rises as you walk...\non it, bulges in places etc. It should all be taken up and re-laid. Most of the flooring could be saved. The metal roof, (to save money for the Contractor I suspect) was put on with 1\" nails instead of 2\" nails and part of it is loose. All should be re-nailed. I thought that it was due to the building settling, but am told that it was due to an earthquake some years ago; that there are cracks in the cement walls of the building as well as in the foundation of the barn. There are also crevices between the cement walls of the main building which let in the cold and draughts. You, Mr. Doucet, and the Inspector and Commissioner agreed that the barn should be re-shingled. Then, I do not think that I exaggerate when I state that practically all the windows of the building are loose and let in the cold. We have also a Blacksmith shop and a Pig Pen to build, the Carpenter shop and two buildings occupied by employees and their families to complete, besides ordinary repairs.\n\nIn a word, we cannot catch up with the repairs during the school year, although the Manual Trainer with some boys and Father Anthony, an expert Carpenter, with boys, are busy during the year. May I point out that Father Anthony receives no pay for his work? I might add that I have been unable to pay the Sisters since June, 30th and that the Auditor remarked that I and the Disciplinarian had taken no salary. If the Department would agree to put this building and other buildings into shape so that the Manual Trainer would have only manual training and ordinary repairs, I would be quite satisfied with a grant for ten months.\n\nAnother point. Our pupilage has been cut from 90 to 83. This is only one of the things which, as I see it, hits a smaller school much harder than a larger one. Recently, someone said that compared\nwith the Kamloops school I was lucky; they had to maintain such a large staff, had lost the grant for so many more pupils than I etc. Well, suppose that the Kamloops school or any School of its size has a staff of 18, then, as they have at least three times as many pupils as I, I should have a staff of 6. Neither the Department nor I would be satisfied with that. We have seven Sisters, not to speak of the Principal, Boys' Disciplinarian, Mechanic, Manual Trainer, Farming Instructor and Father Anthony. A big school needs one Disciplinarian for the boys and so does a small one. The same is true with regard to a Manual Trainer, Mechanic, Farm Instructor, Disciplinarian for the girls, Matron, Nurse Principal etc.\n\nIt will now be realized why I inherited a debt of about $5200.00 and why I was not the first to be in the same boat. Thanks to $3500.00 from the Oblate Fathers I can carry on. As you know, the Oblate Fathers' farm is used for the benefit of the school. I cannot pay them for the hay, grain, vegetables etc.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned G.

Forbes, O.M.I., Principal, Kootenay Indian Residential School, dated December 19, 1941.\n\nIt seems to me that, in comparison with some other schools, the pupils are not as bright as we would like to have them. Perhaps it would be truer to say that we seem to have a larger percentage of dull pupils than some other schools have.\n\nThe Department sent a Mr. Doucet here and we were under the impression that a course in manual training was to be sent us. We waited for this and, as it did not come, we have had the boys work with the manual trainer and with Father Anthony, an expert carpenter, building a carpenter shop, remodelling and repairing a dwelling house, laying floors and making odd repairs.\nOttawa, December 26, 1941.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nIn your letter of the 19th instant you refer to manual training at the Kootenay Residential School. While it is true that Mr. Doucet visited your school some months ago, it was only with the intention of ascertaining what was being done. May I point out that the residential schools in British Columbia have received preferred treatment in regard to vocational training as compared with other Indian residential schools throughout Canada. With the exception of British Columbia, no funds are available either for paying for manual training instructors or providing tools and materials. We have to depend on the schools themselves to do this.\n\nThe vocational training plan which Mr. Doucet has outlined is being tried in residential schools in the province of Alberta for the current academic year, and it is not our intention to introduce this into British Columbia schools at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend George Forbes, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES**\n\nFile No. 155-0-11\n\nDecember 16, 1941\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Kootenay Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 12-415\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

Such was not the case. I meant simply to state that I had understood Mr. Doucet to say that his career would be used in this school. I realize that special consideration has been given to B.C. schools in this matter.\n\nConsideration has been given to B.C. schools in this matter.\n\nAnd that, in my case, the Manual Training grant has not only been raised 20% but that a grant will be made for the summer months so that necessary repairs can be made.\n\nFather Anthony, a competent carpenter, is building the carpentry shop with the help of some of the boys. The Manual Trainer is giving his attention to other boys. Fr. Anthony has just notified me that our former Manual Trainer ordered shingles for only one side of the shop so that he forgot 3500' of shingles. This surprises me as the former Manual Trainer was a competent & conscientious man. It is true that he was quite ill when he made out the estimates.\n\n(Signed) [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 884-11, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nand that, on that account, he had tendered his resignation.\n\nThere was no trouble with the Indians at Christmas. They had earned about $7000 on his Reserve, St Mary's, selling Christmas Trees but they were paid a few weeks before Christmas and, so, all were without the wherewithal to celebrate our Christmas eve.\n\nI have just asked the Indian agent to apply for the discharge of a girl admitted in September. She has been a very good girl, although coming here at 14 was hard, and we are sorry to see her go. It is a case of home conditions - I hope that her parents will profit by the lesson.\n\nWith every best wish for the New Year,\n\nYours Truly,\nG. Forbes O.M.D.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 2, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nOn December 30 purchase order No. 10581 was placed with the Singer Sewing Machine Company, 424 Portage Avenue, Winnipeg, for two sewing machines for the Kootenay Residential School. A copy of this purchase order was sent to you on January 5.\n\nWhen the order was placed the firm was instructed to forward their account to you in order that you could certify it and return it to the Department for payment.

The schools, to comply with the request, let us other schools did not, however, who was not, as many schools did not, wonder who was right. Some schools may have felt that the Society was interfering with matters which are exclusively in the province of the Department.

While it is true that none did not completely agree with his\nideas and omitted at Adam of his duties, I believe that he has done excellent work when raised the standard in all Indian Schools in B.C. He was deeply interested in his work and gained plenty of experience from his inspections\u2014experience from which all of us did or could have profited.

Nevertheless, I feel that on the whole the organization is doing good work.\n\nI notice that the Minister wrote the President of the organization a letter a few weeks ago, congratulating the members on their year's work and expressing satisfaction at the knowledge that a voluntary organization, without assistance from the Government, was doing so much to advance the cultural interests of the Indian population of British Columbia. I am personally of the opinion that the schools should do everything possible to cooperate with this organization. This does not mean that you should seriously interrupt your own program or incur any unnecessary expense. It simply means that when an opportunity presents itself the Department will be pleased to learn of any measure of cooperation you can extend to the Society in the organization of art exhibits or work of this character.\n\nWe were all sorry to learn of Inspector Barry's resignation.

Sept.24th,1942\n\nMr. Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook,B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs the Department has a large sum of money invested in the buildings here, it naturally expects me to see that these buildings are kept in good repair. I think that I have tried to do even more than could reasonably be expected of me and, still, I find it impossible to catch up with necessary repairs. This is due, at least in part, to the fact that whoever built this school does not appear to have done as good a job as might have been expected. A few days ago, a plumber had to tear a few boards out of a wall. I understood him to say that he found only two nails in eight pieces of V-joint. I can show you boards in a floor which appear never to have had a nail in them. Indians, who were pupils here when the school opened, tell me that the wooden floors in the basement were laid over the cement (which was to have been the floor) because the pupils dug holes in the cement floors with tin cans. It is due, also, to the fact, as it seems to me, that realizing how pressed the Department was for money, the Principals did what they could with the money granted for repairs and with whatever other money they could scrape together and, then had to put off the rest of the repairs. I think that it is my duty to suggest what should be done to prevent further deterioration.\n\nThere is no use exaggerating and saying that, if repairs are not immediately made, the roof will fall on our heads because it won't. However, it is true that, unless we tackle the problem immediately, several buildings will rapidly deteriorate.\n\nWhat should be done? As visitors come to the school or people pass by, they see the men's two buildings both of which are a disgrace. The foundations of one had rotted with the result that, although the building is only about 25 feet long, we had to raise one corner 18 inches. The shingles on this building need renewing, the building needs painting, the windows need attention, etc. A good deal of work has been done on this building already. The mechanic's residence is not finished. He and his family spent last winter in it although there is an opening, one inch or more by the width of the window, under each window. The building is not painted or finished inside or out.\n\nAs for the school, the stone steps leading to the main entrance (and used by all visitors) were not properly installed and, as a consequence, are broken, sinking, etc. As you enter the school, you notice that practically all the floors need varnishing. The treads on all interior staircases are badly worn. In places, the wainscoting is torn. The windows do not fit, green lumber having shrunk. Just how long the plumbing will hold out is hard to say. The floor in the boys' playroom needs renewing. Other floors need some repairing. Thanks to the lumber just given us by the Department, we shall have closets for the girls' clothes for the first time and partitions will be built between the Sisters' beds in their common dormitory. Other repairs are needed. When I have the facts, I will tell you of the need of replacing a rather dangerous makeshift. Before leaving this building, I should mention the two long cement sidewalks...\nleading from the gate to the main entrance. I do not know whether the Department or the School had the work done, but the job was a poor one. The walks were laid on the top of the ground and cracked and broken with the heaving of the earth due to frost. The walks do not make a favorable impression on visitors.\n\nThen, there is the barn. The two main doors in the loft, about 20 feet by ten, have been battered by the wind and only fragments remain. They and smaller doors need renewing. So do the planks on the floor of the section in which the horses are kept. As for the window panes missing, a rough guess of the number would be 100. The barn urgently needs reshingling and repainting.\n\nAnd the pig pen. We have none. There are four hovels built of rough lumber and these do not make a favorable impression on those who come to see the pigs, buy them or have sows bred.\n\nWe have no blacksmith shop since ours burned. I once saw a letter in which it was stated that the Department did not believe the teaching of blacksmithing was practical. I believe it is, I forget the man's name, he is Isidore Dick's father-in-law, but he, who learned this trade at the Cariboo School, was blacksmith at the largest ranch in the Cariboo. I employed several graduates when I was in charge of the Cariboo School, and their training in blacksmithing came in very handy.\n\nAs I stated, none of these repairs is desperately urgent\u2014except perhaps, the one I will mention in a future letter\u2014but, if we let things go, the problem will be greater.\n\nWhat do I suggest? A roundabout way of telling you is this. When, some years ago, I told an employee of the Department that $50.00 per month was hardly a just living wage for a manual trainer (provided that he was competent), I was rightly told that the Department was paying for an instructor in manual training and that, as the School used him as a carpenter, the School should pay the balance of his wages. That is reasonable. However, I do not feel that the Department can ask that I pay the balance of this man's wages and, in addition, have another carpenter on the staff when that is necessary for the maintenance of a Government-owned building. The Oblate Fathers understand our difficult position and they have done their share. In order to let the manual trainer devote his spare time to repairing the buildings here, they gave me a qualified carpenter to rebuild the carpenter shop and to build a piggery. I believe that they will supply most of the lumber as they did for another building. I nominally pay him a small salary ($40.00) and turn it back to the School. I would ask the Department to reciprocate and to pay the manual trainer a just living wage (he has two dependents, is exempt from military service and has two sons in the Canadian army\u2014one in Alaska and the other on final leave before leaving for an undisclosed place) as I do not think that, in so small a school, the Department can ask me to supply two carpenters. Of course, I could let repairs go but that is not my wish\u2014nor that of the Department. Our manual trainer is not afraid of hard work or of long hours. Some material will be needed to put this place in shape but he will save money for the Department by turning the stair treads over, etc. I understand that he has asked an employee of the Department for $100.00 per month (not too much when local Indians are making four or five dollars a day) but I think that I could keep him for $75.00. If I lose him, I cannot get another man for his present salary. Formerly, until Inspector Barry had a change, my own man came here for $20.00 per month. He stayed from 9 a.m. until 11 p.m., once a week. The resident manual trainer teaches the boys 5 days a week twice a day. It would be to my interest and to the far\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 884-11, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, a letter received some days ago from the Rev.

While I sincerely thank you for this, I think that I should add that the Government will not fail by this act of generosity - the man will do his work well & the work will be done. Of his new work, once is teaching for the Dept. (and doing well) of two boys active service.\n\nHeavy rains have made me again thankful. The Dept. recently had its roof over our furnaces & our engines renewed. If that had not been done, our engine would have been flooded.\n\nKindly overlook my forgetting your official title - I am under doctor's care (varicose veins) & no one seems able to find your letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

Basement, Dining Room, Kitchen, Sewing Room, Dormitories, Class Rooms etc., all were spotlessly clean.\n\nUnder the direction of Sister Henry, excellent progress is being made in the Sewing Room. Many useful pieces of clothing are being made. It is a training that should mean a great deal to these Indian girls in future years.\n\nThe same is true of the training received from the Dietitian in the preparing of meals; vegetables, meats, pastries etc., an excellent training that they will later need to know.\n\nDuring the past month, the boys have been busy with Father Anthony, shingling the School Barn. It is the largest barn in the Kootenays, and their job is almost completed. This is the kind of practical manual training that should prove to be very useful.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KOOTENAY INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1943.\n\nVocational Training;\n\nA very fine example of the ability of our Indian boys to absorb practical and lasting benefits from their Manual Training course, is amply demonstrated in the completion of the shingling of the roof of the school stock barn. It is perhaps the largest building of its kind in the East Kootenays. It is a job well done, for which much credit is due to the Reverend Father Anthony, and his Indian boys.\n\nThe girls too, are being well and carefully taught in the art of fashioning and carrying on to completion the greater part of their own wardrobes as well as many other indispensable articles for home use.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nJuly 4th, 1945\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nTo salary of the Instructor in Manual Training for the quarter ended June 30th, 1945, $75.00 per month..................$225.00\n\nKOOTENAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nC.

G. Forbes, O.M.I., Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nWithout mentioning it to the Department I have had our nurse give a course in home nursing to the older girls from Grade 4 up and it has proved fairly successful and I think that it should be continued and extended. This is just to warn you that I expect to ask for a little equipment in a few days.\nDear Mr. Macart:\n\nMr. R. Barre, employed here as instructor in Manual Training & Carpenter, has asked me whether I had any objection to his writing to you personally with a view to his getting a higher grade from the Department. (At his request, I wrote Mr. Barre's name to the local agent some time ago). I told him that I had no objection.\n\nThe following, sent confidentially, may give you a clearer view of the situation - so others, Mr. Barre does not appear to have given the whole story.\n\nTwo years ago, in May or June, I asked him (not quite) to do very good work for me in another school. He came here as carpenter & instructor. He replied that he would gladly come but was under contract & requested that I give a chance to his father who, as he said, was not a first class carpenter but was a good second class one. Without, however, any experience in manual training, I mentioned that the salary would be $50 per month, top after with board, etc.\n\nThe father came, while James away, & brought his wife and daughter although nothing had been paid by these two. Instead of giving him a room here, the person who was taking my place had to let him use, himself & family, an Oblate-owned house which they still use. This...\nhouse needed repairing - Daniel did the material work. Mr. B., with some help from the boys, did the work. The house needs more land for a garden - he has added to it. The family is supplied with fuel (wood) for the winter. The family is supplied with fuel (wood) for the winter. The family is supplied with fuel (wood) for the winter.\n\nThe salary was $50.00 per month, but the Dept. raised it to $75.00 per month when I pointed out the urgent need of repairs to his work. School inspectors said that Mr. Barr\u00e9 could be moved to another job at an additional salary of $25.00 per month for two months or that, with no increase in Mr. Barr\u00e9's salary, the Dept. might prefer to have the repairs done at its expense. The Dept. raised the grant and has been paying the man for two months' work whereas the former instructor was paid for only six months.\n\nAmong those to whom Mr. Barr\u00e9 spoke was, unfortunately, a man employed, some years ago, as an instructor in manual training. (I understand that the Inspector was not satisfied with him.) This man is paid to have told Mr. Barr\u00e9 what a good job he had at the Department's expense: the school can went to get him from town on Saturday mornings, after breakfast, took him home at 11:30. For the \"work\" he did between these hours, he got $5.00 per very short morning plus transportation to and from work. Why, Mr. Barr\u00e9 naturally asks himself, should he get less?\nOne answer might be that the former instructor got more than he deserved. Another might be that Mr. Barr\u00e9 has no papers or training as an instructor. At the time he accepted his work, he claimed credit to get two $500 plus house, etc., and he seems to have been able to pay off some small debts (26c, for instance) owed him upon his arrival by the person taking over place.\n\nI should add that a less economical family would not have done this.\n\nWith the present stipends of per capita grants, I do not see how the school can raise his salary. In a little over 2\u00bd years, my predecessor went into debt to the extent of $120. A few years before that, the Oblates had to assume a debt, here, of just over $100. This in April of this year, that the Oblates have taken a huge mortgage for six farms, food crops, of which is sold for which is donated to the school.\n\nI am not sure to imply that Mr. Barr\u00e9 is not worth $700 to the school or that he is incompetent either as a carpenter or an instructor. It is possible that he might earn more, at least during the war, elsewhere. It would be difficult to get anyone to get as good a man at any other place, though perhaps impossible. It will certainly have a lot of work to do and he has certainly done a lot of work so far.\n\nIt might be paying his building for his department. It might be easy advantage to increase the grant. To the department's advantage. If we were able to make a deal more, that Mr. Barr\u00e9 does; it will cost us, if we let the building deteriorate, it will cost us too much to put it in its condition as it should be in.\nI would like to start the career in manual training, which you kindly sent us, towards the end of this month. I have suggested to Mr. Barrie that he let you know what tools will be needed - or, perhaps, you will prefer to send what your experience suggests should be sent.\n\nA week ago tomorrow, I married a widower to a widow. His great grandchildren are in their 20's. Last spring I was called to administer his last sacrament to him. They removed his eye and appear to have made a new man of him.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.

Banez\nDear Mr. Doucet:\n\nIt is over two years since I have been teaching Manual Training at the Kootenay Indian School. I ardently wish it were possible for you to pay a visit to the school. There are many things that would be necessary to equip the school for Manual Training. Your visit would enable you to judge for yourself.\n\nI would greatly appreciate your support for a request to the Department. As you know, I received $75.00 a month for a year. Well, it is practically impossible for me and my family to live on this amount, considering the high cost of living. I have to use a car being six miles from the school. If you could obtain for me $100.00 a month, I would be greatly thankful and I can state that my services would be satisfactory as in the past.\n\nIn the hope that I may receive a favourable reply. I remain.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. Barre.\nOttawa,\nOctober 27, 1943.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nMr. Barre, the manual training instructor, has written a letter to Mr. Douset again urging that he be granted an increase in salary. You will recall that you wrote about this matter in September and I replied in a letter dated September 9.\n\nWhile we feel that he is receiving a reasonable salary at the present time, in view of the many other advantages that he has, at the same time I realize that if he left it would cause considerable disruption in the vocational training work and, due to present conditions, it would no doubt be difficult to replace him. Under the circumstances it has been decided to allow him $90.00 a teaching month from November 1, 1943. If you approve of this action you may so advise him. We are not writing to him direct.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. G.

This, unhappily, does not apply to the eventual pursuits of Indian boys and girls whose opportunities appear distinctly limited.\n\nThe \"manual training\" programme is not being applied with effectiveness. It appears that there is little planned organization for the use of the \"shop\" and such facilities as it offers. The building itself is very well planned and constructed but is poorly equipped. While the poor equipment is a handicap it should be utilized more completely than is apparent. The manual training instructor is untrained and not well informed as to the purposes of his position. He is a \"practical\" man who spends too much of his time doing odd jobs and too little instructing the boys. Very little has been done to follow the vocational programme as outlined and no badges have been awarded.\n\nSome effort has been made to interest and instruct some of the boys in the care of poultry and some badges have been awarded. Possibly this enterprise has not reached full effectiveness as the general conditions of the poultry pens is not good.\n\nScientific and organized interests in swine and cattle has not progressed very far. While the boys are good milkers most of their work appears to consist of chores.\n\nA garden plan has been made and the garden planted but the boys seem to have had little share in the planning. There is no pride of ownership or possession - an educational necessity.\n\nThe girl's courses are better planned and organized. Various groups rotate monthly in the sewing-room, laundry-room, kitchen, etc. The girls work well and\ncheerfully but, unfortunately, have to spend too much time in performing institutional chores such as mending, washing preparing vegetables, etc., under conditions which do not approach home experiences. While instruction is given in sewing and dress-making the instruction is severely limited and is not calculated to create interest and knowledge in desirable dressing habits. Although kitchen and laundry experiences are gained there seems to be no direct progressive teaching of nutrition, textiles, etc. As almost one hundred meals are served three times each day the difficulties in the way of tuition are apparent yet I think some directed effort could be made in giving the girls some responsibility in the planning of the meals and in teaching them food values. In fact, if the education they receive is to possess any sustained interests this must be done.\n\nThe sisters are making a sincere attempt to institute the \"badge system\" but if this system were supplemented by a good professional library and, if possible by professional training the programme would be less mechanistic.\n\nBoth boys and girls should be encouraged to wear their badges which should be presented with proper ceremony in order to emphasize pride of ownership.\n\nToo much of the so-called Vocational Training is devoted to repair and maintenance. While much of this is necessary, improved organization and professional knowledge would do a great deal to effect a progressive programme. While it is difficult to obtain skilled instructors, the teachers in charge should do more to acquaint themselves with professional objectives. Both boys and girls should have at least five hours a week of directed and objective vocational training and this should be rigidly adhered to.\n\nA definite and aggressive policy to implement the Vocational Training plan as outlined should be effected. This plan can be modified to suit conditions but the mechanistic pursuit of it is not stimulating. The children should be encouraged to win and to wear their badges and these should be awarded at appropriate ceremonies. Pride of possession and a sense of \"belonging to\" are essential in motivation.\n\n(Sgd) C.J. Frederickson.\nOttawa, July 14, 1944.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nWe are in receipt of a lengthy report from Inspector Frederickson regarding his last inspection of the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nFor your information I inclose a copy of his remarks regarding vocational training and I would appreciate your comments.\n\nWe note with regret that the Inspector thinks that the badges are not given to the winners at a public gathering. I feel that he must be mistaken in this regard because definite instructions to this effect were issued to the Principals some time ago.\n\nThe Inspector also refers to the lack of tools. It is rather difficult for us to realize this statement. I inclose for your information a copy of a list of tools which are at Kootenay. We feel, that if these are in the vocational training shop there should be sufficient.\n\nI presume that part of the difficulty is due to the fact that Mr. Barre is not fully qualified to carry out the work. I would appreciate any effort you make to have Mr. Barre consider our instructions and put them into effect more fully than he has been doing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. G. Forbes, O.M.I.,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nOttawa,\nJuly 31, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to Inspector Frederickson's report on his last inspection of the Kootenay Residential School. He criticised the vocational training programme at the school and made several other comments. For your information I enclose a copy of the Principal's reply, which makes it difficult for us to understand where Mr. Frederickson obtained the information he placed in his report.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have just received your letter, dated July 22, 1944, here at Mission where I am attending the annual retreat.\n\nMrs. Fredericks kindly gave me a copy of her report. She was greatly misinformed on certain points. Take, for instance, the awarding of badges.\n\n1. The badges awarded to the girls were presented by Mr. Inspector Coleman in the presence of Mr. Indian Agent Irwin & all the pupils. I was called out just as the badges were to be presented but I understood that Mr. Inspector Coleman made an appropriate speech.\n\n2. I myself awarded the badges to the boys, in the senior classroom, in presence of their teachers & the girls' classes in the higher grades. I did my best to say what I felt should be said.\n\nBy whom, I do not know. I have noticed the boys wearing\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 884-11, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTheir badges during the holidays & also ours of the girls doing the same. This is the only girl I have seen.\n\nAs I am away from Crowbrook, I cannot say what tools we have in the shop. Unless I am mistaken, the Inspector's meaning is that, compared to public schools, in Crowbrook, for instance, which he inspects, our equipment is far below theirs. We have only Carpenter Tools (with a few blacksmith tools) whereas the public school has tools for other branches of Manual Training.\n\nI do not expect to have Mr. Barrie at Crowbrook next term. I suppose said that he & his boys were doing a \"practical\" job (sharing being a small cottage) during the Inspector's visit. While it is true that the Vocational Course has not been followed closely, I would like to stress the fact that, in fours or fives, about 20 boys have spent 3 hours or more per week in the shop.\n\nWith regard to the implications of the note on care of poultry, I cannot agree with the Inspector. In this & all other matters involving the preparation or alteration for him, the poultry houses are cleaned on Saturdays, the dirt that comes on Saturday is as far as I can recall. The droppings are not removed daily by us or by many families as I know.\nWith regard to the garden, I told the Inspector that I had planned it so that the pupils could visit. I did not tell him that I had given lectures to the pupils (in Grade IV) on the need of a garden for the pupils (in Grade IV) on the need of a garden for Indians; on the site of a garden; on what we were going to plant, why, etc... I do not find it practical to have individual plots for each pupil \u2014 this would be practical if they stayed at the School all the time. The garden was growing in July and August, and no garden may have been the pride of ownership. However, the Inspector failed to note it that there were two gardens \u2014 one looked after by the boys and one cared for by the girls \u2014 and there was plenty of real rivalry between the two, and, in fact, a sense of ownership.\n\nMr. Fredericksen is a well-qualified man interested in his work. He wants more modern methods and more books in the School.\n\nA point to be noted is that, while there are a few exceptions, the Indians appear to be a good deal behind the Indians I knew at the Christie School, Kamloops, Williams Lake, etc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.

G. Forbes, that I contact you as regards the teaching of Agriculture in this school.\n\nI have just been appointed Principal and I am interested in giving a course in Agriculture and Animal Husbandry to the boys of this school. I would be glad to receive any information you can give me in this matter. Is there a course of study outlined by the Dept.? If so, I would be glad to have it. Any books, or pamphlets which you suggest as a guide will be most welcome.\n\nDoes the Dept give a grant to encourage the development of Vocational Agriculture among our Indians? If so, to what extent.\n\nFrom my observations to date it would seem that there is a great need for more Agricultural development here. Anything you can do to aid us in this endeavour will be highly appreciated.\n\nTrusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 13th, 1945.\n\nDear Father Kelly:\n\nReturning from an extensive trip to Manitoba and Saskatchewan I find your letter awaiting me.\n\nWe have as yet no special course in Agriculture and Animal Husbandry except the basic operations for gardening which, I believe, the school has. I am, however, enclosing another copy for your information.\n\nYou will be receiving in a short time some books dealing with Agriculture. I would suggest that you obtain copies of pamphlets issued by the Provincial Department of Agriculture. Although these books are coached in a language not readily understood by the pupils they contain valuable information.\n\nThere is no special grant given for the encouragement of Agriculture among our Indians. If, however, you have some special plan or some special recommendation I am sure that the Welfare Division would consider suggestions sympathetically.\n\nShould there be any way in which I could serve you I will be only too pleased to do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J.

Consequently we are sending the firm a cheque for $13.08 and the school should send them the balance, namely $1.04.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. Philip Phalen, Chief, Training Div.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phalen:\n\nRe: Annual Training Grant.\n\nI have not yet during this school year received any grant for annual training. No doubt this is my own fault as I was of the impression that it would be paid without a separate application for it each year. However I enquired from Father Forbes and he said I should have written for it.\n\nThis year's course has been devoted for the most part to carpentry work in the school building. In accordance with the approved kindergarten program tables have been made for the juniors to use instead of desks. A number of easels have also been made for art work. A table and benches were made for the sewing room. New doors, a masonite backing for the basins, and other repairs were done by the boys under the direction of the annual trainer. Besides such activities they have been instructed in the basic operations as outlined for the various years in accordance with the directions supplied by the Dept. Shoe repairing, painting, and some blacksmith work have also been directed by the annual trainer.\n\nI hope that even at this late date you will be able to arrange for the usual grant so that these and further undertakings may continue to receive their proper attention.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 18, 1946.\n\nDear Father Kelly:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to manual training grant.\n\nIn the past, we have made an allowance of $50.00 a teaching month towards the salary of the manual training instructor. If you have employed an instructor since September 1, 1945, you should request the Indian Agent to forward the usual voucher.\n\nThe only other grant we make in connection with manual training is for necessary supplies for the manual training class. Such grants are made on application from the Principal through the Indian agent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend G. F.

In the past we were able to participate in a grant for the teaching of manual training and I trust the same is still in order. Formerly we received fifty dollars a month for a manual trainer. However employing anyone at that rate these days is quite out of the question. When speaking to Mr. Coleman on the matter last summer he assured me that if I could get a satisfactory instructor at a reasonable wage that the grant could be increased to meet the expenditure. I think I am very fortunate in getting a man at eighty-five dollars a month and I trust the Dept. will see it in the same light.\n\nThanking you,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter enclosing communication from Indian Agent Dunn regarding the manual training instructor at the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the principal requests us to allow $85. for the month of January. On reviewing our file we find that the last request for a grant towards the salary of a manual training instructor at this school was sent to us on April 13th, 1946 and covered the period ended March 31st, 1946. Up to that date we were allowing $50. and we have not received any subsequent voucher until the recent one and consequently, it is presumed that the school did not have a manual training teacher from April 1st, 1946 to December 31st, 1946.\n\nAs you realize, the recent request is $35. more than previously allowed. It is quite possible that we should allow an amount of $85. a month but if we provide this sum at Kootenay we will receive similar requests from other schools where manual training instructors are employed.\n\nWe are allowing approximately $85. and even more at some of the residential schools in Eastern Canada for a manual training instructor's salary and I am inclined to feel that the time has arrived to increase the amount allowed the manual training instructors in the British Columbia schools.\n\nBefore making a decision on the request from the Kootenay school, I would appreciate hearing\nfrom you in regard to our proposal to increase manual training instructors' salaries. At the same time we would be glad to know by what amount you consider the manual training instructors' salaries should be increased.\n\nEnclosed is one of the usual forms which we have completed when engaging a manual training instructor. You might have the manual training instructor at Kootenay School complete and return this to us.\n\nBernard P. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAir Mail\n\nOttawa, April 15th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M.

What experience have you had in handling physical training and games for Boys? No specific training in the field.\n10. If you wish to add anything further to your application, please use this space:\n    I can give the basic training as outlined by the Training Division of the Indian Dept., have experience in general carpentry work and can direct the pupils in all the essentials of handling tools and caring for them. I have had extensive experience in the building of houses and farm out-buildings and am prepared to give direction in the essentials of same.\n\nDate: March 13/47\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Grant for Manual Training Instruction\nKootenay Residential School.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Neary's letter of March 3rd concerning the allowance for manual training instruction at the above school and forward herewith the completed form as requested.\n\nI am not in a position to make a recommendation as to an increase in the allowance already made at this school as I have not visited it and do not know the number of pupils receiving manual training instruction, nor am I in a position to say what the calibre of Mr. McKinnon's instruction is.\n\nPrevious reports on this school indicate that in the past very little manual training instruction was given to the pupils and the greater part of the instructor's time was taken up with maintenance work about the building. However, it is understood that the Department has records which show the amount of time devoted to manual training and the number of pupils receiving this instruction.\n\nWith regard to a general increase in the salaries of manual training instructors I do not believe it is possible\nto set out a policy which would be applicable to all schools as these vary greatly in size. For example, the Kamloops Residential School which has a school population of over 300 at the present time might use profitably a full-time manual training instructor, whereas the Kootenay Residential School which has an enrolment of slightly over 100 can use a manual training instructor only part-time. In the latter case the remainder of the instructor's time is usually devoted to maintenance work about the school.\n\nIt seems to me that in making allowances for manual training instruction at these schools the following factors should be taken into consideration:\n\n(1) Qualifications of the instructor.\n(2) His experience.\n(3) Number of pupils receiving instruction and the time devoted to this work.\n\nIn the absence of the Commissioner I have discussed this matter with the Inspector of Agencies, Mr. Coleman, and he is in agreement with me. However you will probably wish to discuss this with Major MacKay who is at present in Ottawa.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nOttawa, April 29th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAttention: Inspector H.F. Davey\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant. Possibly you are aware that in the Eastern part of Canada we have revised the salaries of our manual training instructors. However, we have not dealt with the salaries of manual training teachers in British Columbia due to the fact that their salaries have always been paid from the B.C. Special Vote.\n\nAt the present time we are allowing the following amounts towards the salary of the manual training teachers at Indian schools in Alberta and the East:\n\n(a) Fully qualified instructor (lay) - $150. a teaching month.\n\n(b) Fully qualified instructor (religious) - $125. a teaching month.\n\n(c) Partly qualified instructor - $100. a teaching month.\n\n(d) Part time manual training instructors with some qualifications but not professional - varying from $50. to $90. a teaching month.\n\nThe Principal of the Kootenay Residential School has requested that he be allowed an amount of\n$85.00 a teaching month. We feel inclined to allow this school an amount of $85. a teaching month towards the salary of a manual training instructor. Please let me know if this suggestion meets with your approval.\n\nUnless something unforeseen occurs, it is our intention to send Mr. Doucet to Vancouver early in September so that he can fully discuss with you the manual training programme in our schools in British Columbia.\n\nWe are forwarding circulars, basic operation sheets, report forms, badge charts, etc., that are being used in residential schools in the East. A review of these will familiarize yourself with the contents so that when Mr. Doucet meets you, you will be able to discuss the matter more adequately.\n\nWe are also enclosing a copy of a special form to be completed when a new manual training instructor is engaged.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of April 15th I wish to advise that Kootenay Agency voucher No. 122, covering manual training supplies for the Kootenay Residential School, has been returned to Mr. Indian Agent Dunn for correction.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour file 155-0-11 (WTI)\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Neary's letter of April 29th concerning the grant towards the manual training instructor's salary at the Kootenay Residential School. Inspector Davey is not familiar with the situation at this school and hesitates to make a recommendation as to the amount of grant that should be allowed in this case. However, in view of the need to arrive at a decision as soon as possible he suggests that an amount of $65.00 as suggested in Mr. Neary's letter above mentioned be allowed for this purpose, at least until he has an opportunity to visit the school, when the amount might be revised.\n\nInspector Davey also intimated that the need for qualified instructors in the residential schools of this Province is a pressing one and that the upward revision of salaries in cases where the teacher's qualifications and the time devoted to this subject warranted would probably help considerably in overcoming the present deficiencies.\n\nfor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, May 16th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.S. Dunn, Indian Agent,\nKootenay, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 17th, to Indian Commissioner Mackay, regarding the salary of the manual training instructor at the Kootenay Residential School, it has been decided to allow an amount of $85. a teaching month effective from January 1st, 1947.\n\nWe are paying your voucher No. 60 covering the allowance for the month of January and you may forward another voucher for the balance due to the end of April. Subsequently, you should forward a voucher each month as long as the present man is employed. If there is any change in the manual training instructor, we should be informed.\n\nBernard F.

The circumstances in this case are, however, somewhat unusual in that it is necessary to provide a source of power, as well as the power tools. The circular saw recommended by Inspector Davey is somewhat different from the type previously supplied to our schools, but is considered to be much safer for operation by the students in that the saw arbor has a positive tilting action which is preferable to the tilting table type.\n\nPurchase of the items listed by Inspector Davey is recommended, but if the Department considers the expenditure too large for one year, I would suggest that the jointer and drill press be deleted, in that order.\n\nD.M.

C.\n\nRe: Manual Training,\nKootenay Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to the above mentioned vocational training branch of our school and its possible direct bearing on any future housing program in the Kootenay Agency, I have attempted to formulate some constructive plan of approach to the vital subject of providing adequate homes for the Indians of this Agency and respectfully submit the following suggestion.\n\nI would concentrate on training the older boys at the school in manual training with a view to hiring a good carpenter to supervise several of these boys in a long term construction project, this trained group to build a house complete. The success of the first building project would determine the feasibility of continuing until adequate housing is provided over the entire Agency.\n\nPower tools have become a necessity in modern construction. Practically all material used in a house can be cut accurately with these tools and I would suggest that such equipment be acquired at the school to be made available for construction on the St. Mary's Reserve.\n\nI am enclosing an estimate on the cost of power tools as supplied by Parks Hardware Ltd., which in turn was supplied to them by their Vancouver Wholesale house.\n\nSome direct method of approach to the housing situation will have to be arrived at and I would be pleased to have your views on my approach, or any other\nsuggestions you may have in this connection. My observations lead me to believe that the mere providing of building materials to individual Indians for constructing homes a waste of both money and material.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\nCranbrook, B. C.\nJuly 7th, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., P. O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Manual Training at Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 23rd regarding suggestions by Inspector Davey, that he is of the opinion that a circular saw with moveable blade is more suitable for instructional purposes than an 8\" tilting table saw in respect to safety to student operators, that a jointer would possibly be of more use than a wood lathe and the possible use of electric motors in preference to the 2\u00bd h.p. gasoline engine I recommended.\n\nA Delta, tilting table saw with locking devices and saw guard should not present undue exposure to accident when set up properly.\n\nIn recommending a wood lathe, I had in mind a tool that forms the most important factor in student interest in manual training. A jointer would undoubtedly be more practical and I had hoped to add this equipment at the first opportunity.\n\nA jig saw is also important in student interest.\n\nA deep forge for welding and hardening tools is another piece of equipment I had in mind; there are many uses for such around a farm, as repairing wagons and farm equipment, shoeing horses, etc.\n\nThe above tools should be of medium heavy quality as I have in mind heavier construction than ordinarily is met in a Public school manual training.\nestablishment.\n\nThe question of power has proved difficult to recommend. If hydro power becomes available in the future our problem is solved, at present additional wiring would be necessary to connect the manual training shop with the main school. This is not altogether practical either as the main school diesel would have to operate continuously to provide power and the power so provided would require D.C. motors, which are practically unobtainable at this time. A gasoline motor and line shaft would undoubtedly prove unwieldy, but would provide an independent source of power.\n\nThe Rev. Father Kelly has already applied for a fully qualified instructor for this coming term and it would be a great stride forward if some power machinery were made available.\n\nThe B. C. Equipment Co., Vancouver, have been giving satisfactory service to many manual training schools in B. C. and could probably supply sounder recommendations in this regard.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner.\n\nFrom: Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nRe - Manual Training Equipment\nKootenay Residential School -\n\nI refer to letters from Mr. Indian Agent Dunn's letters of July 7th and April 8th covering the above mentioned school.

Equipment Co.\nVancouver, B.C.)\n\nThe above, with exception of the generator, are as prescribed for the Provincial Schools of this province. If the Department feels this expenditure is too large for one year, I suggest that the Jointer could be cut out for this year and supplied later. This piece of equipment is of greater value than the lathe proposed by Mr. Dunn.\nThe generator is recommended in place of the line shaft because of the danger involved in operating machinery by this method.\n\nR.F.

We are still without the services of an instructor but are doing all possible to rectify this situation.\n\nDuring the summer holidays, when it became apparent that we would lose the services of our partially qualified instructor, the Rev. Father Kelly advertised this position in Calgary and Vancouver papers. A suitable reply was received from Vancouver but accommodation was required for this man's wife and family. The Rev.

I note that Inspector Davey states that the five page requisition is in accordance with the suggested list published by the Department of Education in Victoria.\n\nHowever, before authorizing the purchase, we would like to be assured that all the items are absolutely essential at the Kootenay School. We would also like to know the approximate cost.\n\nCareful consideration has also been given to the request for material and other supplies for a domestic science course. Are we to understand that a special room is available so that unit instruction can be given to the girls taking the domestic science course at the Kootenay School? Has the school conducted a special domestic science course previously or are they just starting such programme.

I thought it best to write to the Mother General of the Sisters for her assurance regarding the future of Sister Paul of the Cross. Her letter gives assurance that no changes will be made for some time so I trust we could get the pottery work under way for the next school term. The Mother General expresses her pleasure at the news that the pottery work is to be started and I'm sure nothing would be done by way of appointments that would render its future untenable.\n\nI trust you will forward this reply to the proper authorities.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\"G.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Dunn:\n\nPlease find attached a requisition for material to begin our course in pottery. This is a course I have been anxious to begin for the past two years as I feel it would be very profitable to the children and can be developed into a paying industry after school days. We have on the staff, Sister Paul of the Cross, who taught this course in the Shubenacadie Indian School in Nova Scotia. She is fully competent to handle such a course as she has had many years of experience in the work as well as having received instruction from professionals in the art of pottery making.\n\nI understand that our Indian Commissioner, Mr. Arneil, is familiar with the type of work she was doing in the Shubenacadie School and any further references which the Dept. wishes regarding her ability can be obtained from that Institution. I feel that we should be making use of her ability to teach this course while she is here rather than having her talents remain unused. Last year, at the instigation of School Inspector Fredrickson, she lectured during the Teachers Convention on this subject and following that the High School in Kimberley took up the work. She has been giving them some assistance and direction. I feel that it is too bad to let another school take our rightful place in this art when we could be doing so much with it.\n\nOur local clay has been tested and found suitable for this work. You are probably aware that the Post Office building and the Hanson Block in Cranbrook are built from brick made quite near our school. There is no doubt that we have an ample clay deposit for this work and should with time build this course into something definitely worthwhile culturally and financially.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(sgd) G. F. Kelly, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nMr. W. S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B. C., P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Proposed Pottery Course, Kootenay Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter and a requisition for supplies submitted to me by the Rev. Father G. F. Kelly, Principal of our Residential School, relative to inauguration of a pottery course for the Indian pupils.\n\nWith but few exceptions our Kootenay Indians have been unable to successfully compete with white labour in local industry, being confined to farming their land on the reserves, engaging in a little trapping and, only when other help is scarce, working in the woods.\n\nTheir natural ability in arts and crafts is of a high caliber with local buckskin work recognized by expert dealers as the finest on the North American continent. It would, therefore, appear that every effort to enlarge on their natural talent should be encouraged. And if the school can assure us of the services of Sister Paul of the Cross as an instructor over a necessary period of time, I would respectfully recommend that consideration be given toward inauguration of this pottery course for the school pupils.\n\nJSD/DD\n\nEncls.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Proposed Pottery Course\nKootenay Residential School\n\nI am enclosing herewith for your information Superintendent Dunn's letter of March 25th and enclosures referred to therein, together with a subsequent letter dated June 9th and enclosures and a memorandum dated July 16th from District School Inspector Davey.\n\nI concur with Mr. Davey's recommendation that no action should be taken at this time for the inauguration of such a course, having in mind the large expenditure which will be necessary to bring the Kootenay School up to a reasonable standard.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nmh\nencls.\nJuly 29, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 21st instant, file 5-11-6, with reference to starting a pottery class at the Kootenay Residential School. We have considered the contents of the different letters which you forwarded and we feel it should be possible to start a pottery class on a smaller scale than that outlined. The beginners would not need to glaze their articles at the start but could learn to handle the clay with inexpensive tools and we believe that the articles could be left to harden naturally.\n\nIt should be possible to obtain or to make small pottery wheels so that one would be available for each pupil taking the course. This would be very inexpensive.\n\nWe are inclined to favour the establishment of the course suggested, but as intimated above, the expenditure should be kept to a minimum and if the preliminary work appeals to the pupils, we would then feel more justified in making a heavier expenditure.\n\nIf you feel that our suggestions can be carried out, I suggest that you revise your list along the lines outlined above and forward same to us for further consideration.\n\nBernard F. Heary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Manual Training and Domestic Science Equipment - Kootenay Residential School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of May 22nd, an amended requisition for manual training tools for the above mentioned school is enclosed together with a memorandum from District School Inspector Davey in connection with domestic science equipment.\n\nYou will note that the manual training equipment now requisitioned will cost approximately $170 and I would recommend that an expenditure of this amount be approved. With regard to the domestic science equipment I have not yet secured prices but estimate the cost of this equipment will not exceed $150, apart from the three bolts of dress material and the kitchen cabinet, the supply of which is not recommended.\n\nI am writing to Supt. Dunn for information with respect to the person in charge of the domestic science instruction and I am asking him to secure a tender on the construction of suitable cupboards.\n\nS. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo: Indian Commissioner for B. C.\nFrom: District School Inspector.\n\nRe: Domestic Science and Industrial Arts,\nKootenay Residential School.\n\nMr. Neary, in his letter dated May 22nd, has requested information concerning the operation of the domestic science classes at the above-mentioned school.\n\nAbout four years ago, unit instruction in domestic science was begun. On the occasion of my visit to the school, I encouraged the Reverend Principal to expand the school's activities along these lines. This has undoubtedly given rise to the requisition for additional equipment. With the exception of the request for three bolts of dress material, the items listed seem to be reasonable.\n\nIt will be noted from the attached pictures that the small room used for this instruction is not equipped with cupboards and is too small for the customary group work tables which contain equipment storage space. I therefore consider necessary the provision of cupboards, either made at the school or in the form of the kitchen cabinet requisitioned.\n\nThe Reverend Principal informs me that the utensils at present in use are borrowed from the school kitchen and that this interferes with the operation of the kitchen.\n\nR.

C.\n\nMr. J. S. Dunn, Indian Superintendent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Dunn:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 17th inst., regarding the qualifications of the Instructress of Domestic Science in this school, I wish to report as follows. The Sister in charge of this course has not a certificate in this work but has had several years of practical experience. She was cook here for three years and in a boarding school in Nova Scotia for five. Since we are receiving no additional salary grant for her work in this course it hardly seems fair to expect us to incur the expenses of a degree or extra-curriculum studies in this matter. Previous to '44 Domestic Science was taught here, as in many other places, in the school kitchen, which as we all know has decided disadvantages. During the year '44 a room was set aside and equipped in so far as the school felt able to equip it. To my knowledge no grant or requisition for material was ever received towards this project. As a result the equipment is not up to what it should be nor is there sufficient of it. However if the Dept. feels that the expenditure requested cannot be allowed under the circumstances we can very easily revert to the former practise of having the children learn their lessons in cooking in the school kitchen though I feel it would be detrimental to them.\nThe girls have taken very readily to this course and already I have seen evidences of the use they have made of it at home during the summer vacation as well as in the housekeeping of some of the graduates.\n\nAs regards the building of cupboards instead of the kitchen cabinet I have tried in vain to interest any of the local contractors in the project due to over abundance of work. However I drew up a plan of what I felt would be suitable and discussed it with Mr. Linton Lundy, who is already employed to make certain alterations in a classroom and one dormitory here. He figured that about fifty-five dollars worth of lumber and material would satisfy our needs. If an allowance for this much would be granted by the Dept. I would personally arrange for the building of same.\n\nTrusting this will clarify the matter and that we may have an early reply on our requested requisition, I remain,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n(sgd) G. F. Kelly, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nKootenay Agency,\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nSept. 8th, 1948.\n\nMr. W. S.

Scott Esq.,\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have spent the last week at the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nI find that we need some good Milch Cows very badly there. The present stock seems to be rather run down, and the Principal of the School feels that the financial condition of the School will not warrant them purchasing new stock.\n\nI am therefore, making an appeal to you for assistance in this matter. I can assure you that both Inspector Col. Pragnell, and Mr. E.H.Small, Indian Agent approve of this move.\n\nIn the past year there has been some dissatisfaction among the parents of the school children, they claiming that the children do not get enough milk, and I feel that the purchase of about twelve cows will eliminate this difficulty.\n\nTrusting that you can see your way to authorize the purchase of this stock, and so assist us in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 884-14, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose you a letter from the Reverend Father Welch referring to Milch cows for the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nIf the Department can see their way to purchase this stock, I believe it will go a long way in assisting us to satisfy the Indians, as well as being of great benefit to the children in the School.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Inspector Col. Pragnell on his last visit of inspection here, and can assure that the Col. approves of this move.\n\nOn enquiry I find that dual purpose Shorthorn cows can be purchased through the P. Burns Co., or J. R. Walkley Co., of this City ranging from $75.00 to $100.00 per head.\n\nI trust that you will give this your favorable consideration. I am.\n\nSir.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.H. Small\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, December 19, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a communication from the Very Rev. Father Welch with reference to milch cows for the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The Department expects these institutions to make replacements to stock; but, in view of the representations of Father Welch and yourself, some assistance might be given.\n\nThe Department is prepared to grant five milch cows; but I consider that the school authorities should supplement this purchase. Please explain to Father Welch and the Rev. Principal and let me have a report. You should also intimate if you can secure the assistance of an officer of the Provincial Livestock Branch or of an experimental farm, who could assist in the selection of the cows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nOttawa, December 29, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 18th instant, with general reference to the Kootenay Indian Residential School. I am pleased to note that Father Welch is doing his best to make this institution as efficient as possible. Concerning replacements to the milch cows at the school, I wish to state that on the 19th instant I wrote to Mr. Indian Agent Small, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The Department is prepared to grant five milch cows; but I consider that the school authorities should supplement this purchase.

Your lr. 29th Decr.\n\nI have consulted with the Reverend Father Lepine, the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School, re supplementing the purchase of cows.\n\nFather Lepine points out to me that they have at the present time eight very good milk cows, and if the Department will grant them five more, they consider it will be sufficient for the up-keep of the School. He pointed out to me that the School has not made any money in the last year, and it is almost impossible to get a grant from the School to buy any more cattle.\n\nI can secure the assistance of Mr. A. G. Hay, the Provincial Agriculturist, and Live Stock Expert for this District, and feel sure that his examination of the cows will be satisfactory to all.\n\nI can buy through Mr. J.R.Walkley, a Cattle Dealer here, whose price for the best milk cows will not exceed $90.00.\n\nIf the Department will consider the purchase, as intimated in your letter of the 29th December, I shall be very glad to get this underway and have Mr. Hay select the best cows he possibly can from this man's stock.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.H.Small\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, February 13, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the purchase of milch cows to supplement the number now at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. In reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase of five milch cows. You should secure the assistance of the Provincial Agriculturist and Livestock Expert for the district in selecting the cows. We note that you state the cost will not exceed $90 each.

They badly want feeding up and I examined the only stock of hay they have left on the premises, which is utterly useless for feeding purposes. I asked the Mother Superior to get some more hay in at once. I know, of course, that they are handicapped by the fact that the farm has been allowed to run down to the extent that they have practically no good hay to feed the stock from last year. I do not anticipate that this will occur again, and I sincerely hope it will not, but at the same time I drew their attention to the fact that it is necessary to keep the cows in good condition in the meanwhile.\nOttawa, May 27, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of the 11th instant, concerning the Kootenay Indian Residential School, which relates to the poor condition of the institution's stock, including those cows which have been lately purchased by the Department. I should be grateful if you would inform the Rev. Principal that the Department takes a serious view of this matter and that, if further unsatisfactory reports are received, it will make it difficult for the Department to make replacements and improvements at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Box 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nFebruary 15, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose copy of a letter I have just received from Rev. M. Lepine, Principal of Kootenay Residential School at Cranbrook. The letter is self explanatory, and the importance of having plenty of milk for the children is constantly in my mind.\n\nAs you know, until the arrival of the new Principal, there was considerable trouble over the food supply at this school, and I am given to understand that things are much better now. It, however, sticks in my mind that the Missionaries running this school should do something for themselves, and not depend entirely upon the good will of the Department. I may be wronging them, as they may be at considerable expense in straightening matters out there, but unless I see their books I cannot say. All I know is that other schools, as a whole, supply themselves with their own cows and the Department has already given this school five cows.\n\nIn order to initiate the idea of a little self help there, I think that, if I were the Department, I should be inclined to offer to give them a couple more cows if they themselves will also buy two equally good ones at the same time. It is with some diffidence that I offer this suggestion, as I do not want the school to slip back again into its old ways, as I have had trouble enough in straightening things out as it is.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo.

Fleetwood, for about $90.00 a piece. With five of them we would have a fine bunch and next year we could get a good bull to keep the milk strain flock.\n\nIs there any hope of having the permission of the Department to buy these cows?\n\nIf the matter meets your approval, please kindly use your influence with the Department about this matter.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir.\n\nYour devoted servant,\n\n(Sgd) Rev. M. Depine,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 22, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with enclosure, with reference to milk cows for the Kootenay Indian Residential School. Your recommendation, that two animals be purchased if the school authorities will buy two equally good ones at the same time, is approved and you may make the arrangements. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded to the Department for payment in due course. Please impress upon the Rev.

The expense of having supplies hauled over this distance is considerable, and on the other hand, when the transport is done by our men, the work of the farm is interrupted. This difficulty could be overcome by having a truck in connection with the school, but our circumstances do not permit us to make such a purchase.\n\nHowever, if the Depot would be willing to furnish the engine and frame, our foremen could construct the body and other parts, and it would be such a help.\n\nI must state that I have not mentioned a word about that, to the Principal of this school, as the Sisters have been about all.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 884-14, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthe transportation and wages of hired men,\nso I thought of using the privilege of addressing\nmyself personally and directly to you.\nHoping that it will not interfere with\nyour kindly help in the matter.\nHoping Mr Scott, that our request will\nbe considered favorably.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister Alphonsa of the Cross.

Please state how many cows are giving milk at the present time or are likely to freshen in the near future. You should also report regarding the general condition of the cows, also the total quantity of milk obtained each day. You should also state whether all the milk obtained each day is supplied for the use of the pupils or what disposition is made of same. Your early reply giving the information asked for is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nOwing to the tubercular condition of the children from this district, a plentiful supply of milk is absolutely necessary. Father Patterson suggests that if the Department could enable him to buy ten cows and a bull of the Shorthorn breed, suitable for both milk and beef, he would be able to do much towards restoring the health of the children at the school.\nApril 7, 1930.\n\nDear Father Grant:\n\nI wish to refer further to your letter of the 29th ultimo, concerning the Kootenay Indian Residential School. Father Patterson suggests that the Department purchase a suitable milk herd; but I find that, in 1926, four grade Ayrshire and one Holstein and in 1927, seven Jerseys were secured for this school. If this stock has been well cared for, I am at a loss to understand why replacement must now be made. You might discuss this further with Father Patterson and let me have another report and recommendation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. W. Byrne Grant, O. M. I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster,\nB.

I hope that they will remind you of a beautiful spot on the Fraser and that they will bring back to your mind pleasant souvenirs. A few days ago the play of colors on Mount Baker was most beautiful and Rev. Father Welch, who was with me, remarked \"Mr. Scott would like this\". Your visit has not been forgotten. It has been the cause of great pleasure and encouragement. I can assure you that we are grateful.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 884-14, part 1)\nDear Father Duplanil,\n\nI am much indebted to you for sending me the interesting photographs of the children of St. Mary's Mission school and of the little shrine on the hill. I value them highly as a memento of my visit to the Mission.\n\nI have seen many lovely views since I left you, but none more beautiful than that from your terrace.\n\nI had a very good trip after I left you. I took a short leave of absence and spent ten days in California.\n\nI hope you have all been well since I saw you. I shall keep the interests of the school in mind, and, if there is anything I can do for you at any time, do not fail to let me know.\n\nWith kindest regards to the Reverend Sister Superior and yourself, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. John Duplanil, O.M.I.,\nSt. Mary's Mission Indian School,\nMission City, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 834-14, part 1)\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have written you an official letter with regard to the proposed temporary alterations at St. Mary's School at Mission, but I think it advisable to drop you also a few personal lines on the subject.\n\nUpon going to New Westminster last Tuesday, I found Rev. Jno. Welch there, as apparently he had been informed of my proposed visit, as I had written to Mr. Indian Agent Daunt on the 5th giving him the information that you considered it more preferable to construct outside class-rooms than dormitories. Not having the correspondence which had taken place with regard to the alleged dangerous situation at this School, I asked what changes had taken place there during the past two years and was informed that there had been very few with the exception of the creation of a small additional dormitory for the boys and an outside class-room for the girls, a number of additional female pupils now sleeping in the old sewing room in the main building, which, as reported, is heated by hot water from the central heating plant and lighted by electricity. In view of this information, I then asked in what respect the fire hazard was greater than it had been in 1911, when I inspected the building to see if this school complied with the regulations sufficient to warrant the increased grant payable at that time, as I had a suspicion that the School authorities had been endeavouring to make you believe that the fire hazard was much greater than it really is. I pointed out to the Reverend Father and the Agent that though we knew very well that the buildings were old and ought to and could be renewed as soon as possible, but as the Department did not own the land, it would be impossible to put up new buildings at Mission until some definite arrangement had been made with the Order of Oblate Fathers about the site. I also endeavoured to get some information as to why the acclaim about the fire hazard, but could not get it. I then decided to visit the School to satisfy myself and the results of my investigation are contained in the official letter referred to.\n\nOn the way back to New Westminster, I interrogated Indian Agent Daunt as to what had taken place and he informed me that the Fire Marshall had made a very adverse report about the buildings, saying there were death traps, the fire hazard being great, and in general that they should be renewed. This report, I learned, was made by the Fire Marshall at the request of the Reverend Father Mailliard, the Principal, and I feel almost certain that this action was taken with the idea of stampeding the Department into building a new school at once.\n\nOf course\nOf course, I can not be certain on this point, but I have a very grave suspicion that such was the case.\n\nAs regards the site for the new School, Father Welch stated to me that the Oblate Fathers were prepared to deed over to the Department sufficient land for this purpose, about ten acres. I pointed out to him, however, that as our Department was paying about $450.00 annually in taxes for Lot 2, which had been deemed necessary for the growing of products for the School, a fair and businesslike proposition would be for his Order to convey the whole of this Lot to the Department for the nominal sum of $1.00, the conveyance being conditional when the land ceased to be used for school purposes, it would be reconveyed by the Department to the Oblate Fathers. By doing this, our Department would then be released from paying the taxes above mentioned.\n\nI think Father Welch will be writing you on this subject at an early date and I am, therefore, informing you as to the discussion we had on the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.H. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nI have written you a full official letter in connection with the land at Mission, but there are some points in connection with this matter which I think it better that I should inform you on personally.\n\nYou will remember in 1922 we decided to assist the Oblate Order by the payment of taxes on Lot 2, Group 3, on which the School is situated and the whole area is used for the benefit of the School. Taxes at that time were $468.50 per annum and a refund has been made to the Principal of the School annually ever since that time. The last voucher sent in by the New Westminster office was for $445.90. While I was at Mission City recently, upon making investigations with the municipal officer, Mr. Kerr, the collector, informed me that the whole of Lot 2 had been exempted from taxation by the Corporation of the District of Mission ever since 1925, and he opened up his books to show that this was the case. I immediately produced the tax receipt which the Reverend Principal had forwarded to the New Westminster office, copies of which will be found on the vouchers at Ottawa, showing that they stated definitely that this receipt was for taxation on Lot 2. The assessor was immediately sent for and he concurred in what the collector had stated with regard to Lot 2 being non-taxable, but could not give a very satisfactory explanation as to why the same situation did not exist in Lot 3. However, he stated very definitely that the officials at the School knew very well that this receipt pertained to Lot 3 and that there were no taxes collectible on Lot 2. I am surprised, therefore, that the Reverend Father Maillard, Principal of the School, has been forwarding these tax receipts on to the New Westminster office expecting the Department to pay the various amounts that we have been doing. I do not suppose you will feel like demanding a refund for these amounts and possibly it might be just as well to let the whole thing go by the board. I have, however, notified Mr. Indian Agent Daunt that should any like receipts be received from the Principal of the School for reimbursement of the amounts paid, he should not forward them to Ottawa.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. Duncan G. Scott,\n106 Lisgar Street,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. [signature]\n\nYou will note that this communication is marked \"Private\". Do not file.\n\nA.

Byrne Grant, c.m.i.\nProvincial,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nVery Rev. and dear Father,\n\nIn compliance with your request of the 16th inst., I beg to submit the following statement regarding taxes paid by St. Mary's Mission, at Mission City, B.C. Part of these taxes were refunded by the Indian Dept.\n\nThe first and second year I was in charge of Mission School I paid over $1100.00 in taxes, i.e. 10% of all our revenue. The Deputy Minister called on me during the second Summer of my incumbency. He agreed to refund part of the taxes. On the same occasion it was agreed that the Oblates were to give five acres of land for building purposes, and the Dept. was to buy some 135 acres. The Deputy Minister insisted in securing not less than 140 acres. A board of arbitration was to be appointed to set value upon the buildings, the land, the implements and the live stock. The Oblate Provincial did not know the most suitable location for school work. Later on I succeeded in getting exemption of part of the property. I fought the case with the Municipality for over a year. The taxes were such that I could not carry on the work. Then the school received only $140.00 per head, i.e. 40 cents per day per child. Food and clothes were dearer than at present and I had some ten non-paying children. After obtaining exemption of part of the school property, I continued sending the tax bill to the Indian Dept. at Ottawa, though I knew very well that taxes had been refunded on the other portion of land. We must remember that the land to be donated and to be purchased by the Dept. had not been agreed upon. Moreover the whole property was used for school purposes. We were cutting our wood on the portion of land taxes on which were refunded by the Dept. Raspberries, strawberries, loganberries and other products came from the same land. We never sold anything and we used everything for the school children. The Dept. was getting the full use of the land. There never was any kind of collusion. And no matter what may be said, there was no act of dishonesty on my nor the slightest thought of defrauding the Indian Dept. which I have served faithfully and quite successfully.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 884-14, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMission City, B.C.\n\nMarch 7th 1930\n\nTo Father E.

Father Duplanil, the Principal at Kamloops Industrial School and one from the Tax Assessor of Mission City which explain the misunderstanding with regard to the refund of taxes on some of the Oblate property now being used for the benefit of the Indian School there.\n\nI have looked into the matter carefully and have discussed it thoroughly with Rev. Fathers Nohr, Duplanil and Maillard and I think it is quite clear that they were under the impression that the Department had agreed to refund part of the taxes on the school. They considered that the fact that they had succeeded in persuading the authorities of the municipality to exempt part of the land in no way affected this arrangement and that the tax receipts sent to the Department happened to be marked for property already exempt was due to a clerical error at the Tax Office.\n\nIt is quite clear therefore that there has been no collusion of any kind or any attempt to deceive the Department.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProvincial.\nOttawa, 3rd January 1930\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 884-14, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCONFIDENTIAL.\n\nApril 11, 1930.\n\nDear Father Grant:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to taxes at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School at Mission, B.C. The Department's intention in 1922 was to relieve the school authorities of the taxes on Lot No. 2 - which lot was used solely for the purposes of the Institution. I have always understood that part of the other parcels was rented and, of course, taxes on these cannot be paid by the Department.\n\nI note the explanation which you have forwarded and I think that no further reimbursement on account of taxes at this school can be made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. W. Byrne Grant, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster,\nB.C.\nApril 12, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nI wish to refer to your private letter of December 18th, last, concerning taxes at the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School. Father Grant, Provincial of the Oblate Order, when last in Ottawa, was asked to make careful enquiries in this connection. His reply reads in part as follows: \"I have looked into the matter carefully and have discussed it thoroughly with Rev. Fathers Rehr, Duplanil and Maillard and I think it is quite clear that they were under the impression that the Department had agreed to refund part of the taxes on the school. They considered that the fact that they had succeeded in persuading the authorities of the Municipality to exempt part of the land in no way affected this arrangement.

I will ask my Deputy for Indian Affairs to get a report on the condition of the laundry.\n\nIn our new type of residential school buildings the laundry is located in the rear portion of the main building and, therefore, your suggestion that a permanent one story building might be constructed which could afterwards be attached to the main building is hardly feasible.\n\nI thank you for drawing my attention to these matters which will be sympathetically considered.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

My delay in answering it is due to the fact that I had already left for the east before it reached New Westminster.\n\nI am very glad to think that the matter of the taxes at Mission School has been settled satisfactorily, at least insofar as concerns the past. After discussing the matter with the Reverend Fathers Rohr, Maillard and Duplanil, I am firmly convinced that there was no attempt on the part of the principal of the school to deceive the Department in this matter.\n\nI may point out in passing that none of the land now being used at the Indian School there has been leased to outside parties for a number of years. The three sections as shown on the map in your files are being used for the benefit of the school. No doubt it will be possible to carry on the work of the school with less land, though I am given to understand that the wonderful health record of Mission School is due to a large extent to the fact that the children are given all the milk they can drink and the school is in a position to do this because of the extensive grazing grounds and extensive hay fields used for the benefit of the children.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Rev.)

Nine of the cows have freshened this spring.\n\nAt the present time ten cows are milking and we receive approximately twenty-five gallons of milk per day. This will be increased considerably when the pasture becomes good shortly.\n\nAll the milk is used in the school and all milk products are used in the school. The general condition of the cows is good, although they were in very poor condition when we took charge of them in December.\n\nOwing to the general ill-health of the school children it is desirable that they have all the milk that they need all the year. During the winter months we received only about four gallons per day, which was inadequate for a school having a very high percentage of tubercular children. I would like to have ten to fifteen cows milking at all times of the year. I think that if we could do this we would see a remarkable improvement in the health of the children.\n\nI would recommend the heavier variety of cattle because when the smaller Jerseys are too old they are very light for beef purposes, nor are their steers heavy enough, which is an important consideration for the school.

The total quantity of milk obtained each day is, as stated by the Principal, about twenty-five gallons, and this is supplied for the use of the pupils in the school.\n\nI regret to say that the percentage of tubercular children in the school is very high, and I feel that if a few more cows were supplied it would assist materially in combating the disease.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

Small,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 884-14, part 1)\nOttawa, May 14, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School in connection with the request made by him for the supplying of a number of milking Shorthorn cows to supplement the herd at present at the school.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department has no funds available at the present time for this purpose. Next Fall, if the milk supply becomes inadequate, the Principal should renew his request, furnishing full particulars as to the extra number of milk cows required. In the meantime, the Department advises that the school make no butter so that the children will get whole milk. The quantity of milk now being obtained has been noted and is considered satisfactory for the use of the school at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nCranbrook,\nB.C.\nIn order that a continuous supply of milk and eggs for the use of the children may be assured, the Principal has asked that the Department provide the School with ten cows of Shorthorn variety of milking strain, also one bull to take the place of the present scrub animal; also about 150 head of good laying and table strain of poultry. At present there are 17 cows and one bull at the School. Eleven cows are at present being milked yielding 12 pails which aggregate about from 28 to 30 gallons of milk per day. In order to meet freshening and other conditions, the Principal thinks that if the animals asked for can be provided, there will be fifteen cows being milked throughout the year. There would also be beef food available, which the School has not now on hand. The 80 poultry produce about 50 eggs per day. There is accommodation for from 200 to 300 birds. Barred Rocks or Rhode Island Reds are asked for.\nOttawa, June 26, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nAmong the many items in Assistant Commissioner Perry's report, there is the suggestion that 200 young chickens be supplied for the Kootenay Indian Residential School. You may make purchase of either Barred Rocks or Rhode Island Reds and forward the account, in duplicate, properly certified, direct to Ottawa for payment. No unnecessary expense should be incurred. If the supply of milk becomes inadequate at any time in the near future, please inform the Indian Agent without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

September 30th, 1930.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn a letter dated June 26th, 1930, File No. 158-0-14, Mr A.F. MacKenzie mentioned that if the milk supply for the school is inadequate, I should inform you without delay. Although the herd that we have at present has been given good care I find that they cannot produce nearly sufficient milk for the children. Five of the cattle now milking are really beef cattle and produce very little at all. Although the milk from the Jerseys is rich there is not enough to supply the school.\n\nI find that the children are much improved in general health this year and I am very anxious to maintain a standard as high as possible throughout the year. I would recommend to the Department that a suitable number be purchased to ensure a good supply of fresh milk throughout the year.\n\nTrusting that this request will meet with the approval of the Department, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nsplendid opportunity to supply the School with cows that will not only provide the milk needed for the pupils, but will enable the school to eventually have an all registered herd.\n\nI also beg to enclose herewith a letter received today from Mr. Angus Hay, Manager of the Consolidated Mining & Smelting Company's dairy farm near Marysville, giving particulars as to breeding and purchase price of a particularly fine young Ayrshire bull which I examined yesterday. I would respectfully recommend that if the Department look with favour on the purchase of the eight cows from Mr. Ogilvie-Wills, that this young bull also be purchased for the school herd.\n\nIn the event of the purchase of these cows, I beg to state that Mr. Hay, who was Resident Agriculturist in East Kootenay for several years and is an authority on dairy cattle, has very kindly offered to accompany me to Mr. Wills farm and assist in choosing the cows for the school.\n\nThe cows in Mr. Wills herd have all been bred to a bull from a very high producing strain, and at least six of his cows will freshen during the winter months.\n\nAs Mr. Wills has agreed to hold his offer open to the Department for ten days only, I would respectfully suggest that the Department telegraph me at an early date as to their decision in the matter.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. S. Ryckman,\nConstable - Farm Instructor,\nIn charge Kootenay Indian Agency.\nSir,\n\nDepartmental letter No. 155-0-14, dated May 14th, 1930.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend Principal of the Kootenay Residential School, requesting milch cows to supplement the herd at present at the School.\n\nWhen application was made to the Department early last spring, it was thought that milking shorthorn cows would best suit the needs of the school. It has been found since, however, that it is very difficult to obtain good cows of this breed, and as there are no good sires in this district, they would have to be brought in from a considerable distance.\n\nThere are a number of very fine herds of registered Ayrshire cattle in East Kootenay, and both the Reverend Principal and myself are strongly of the opinion that if additional cows are to be purchased it would be much better to have Ayrshires than any other breed. The big Consolidated Mining & Smelting Company's herd at Marysville consists principally of registered and grade Ayrshires, and the herd at the Dominion Experimental Farm at Windermere is also composed of registered Ayrshires. In purchasing Ayrshires, therefore, no difficulty would be experienced in obtaining good sires at reasonable cost.\n\nMr. Ogilvie-Wills, near Fairmont Springs, B.C., has a herd of splendid registered Ayrshires and, owing to lack of winter feed, has decided to dispose of eight cows. I beg to report that Mr. Inspector Pragnell and myself examined this herd on September 24th last and also the registration certificates, and found that the cows are all of exceptionally good breeding and in good condition. Mr. Wills offered to allow the Department to choose any eight cows from his herd at a price of $150. each. I would respectfully suggest that as good grade cows are selling for the same price in this district, that this is a\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6455, file 884-14, part 1)\nOttawa, October 8, 1930.\n\nF.

Dr. J.W. Rutledge, the only Veterinary Surgeon living in the district, has promised to examine the cows before shipment is made, but will not be able to do so for several days. In the meantime, the cows are being well cared for and the Department is assured of delivery shortly.\n\nI beg to report that Mr. A. L. Hay telephoned me on the evening of October 3rd that he would be at liberty to examine the cows at Fairmont Springs the following day, but if he did not do so then he did not think he would be able to spare the time until quite late in the fall. As I did not have time to obtain authority from the Department, I took the liberty of taking Mr. Hay to the Ogilvy-Wills farm on October 4th, and he made a careful examination of the herd and chose eight animals for the School herd. These cows are all registered and of very good breeding, and all have been tuberculin tested. I trust that my action in taking Mr. Hay to Fairmont Springs before I had authority to do so will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 23, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 1/32 of the 14th instant, with reference to the purchase of milch cows for the Kootenay Indian Residential School.

These will be forwarded to the Department at the earliest possible moment.\n\nAs at least one of the cows is due to freshen within a very short time, I thought it advisable not to delay shipment of the cattle until the certificates reached here.

As they are young, the oldest one being five years of age, many of the younger heifers, with proper care, should make good sized and most useful matured cattle as foundation stock to eventually develop for the school an all registered herd. Their breeding shows that they are from a good milking strain and should be very suitable for the purpose aimed at in furnishing rich and wholesome milk for the school children.\n\nI have been very particular in examining these cows for anything in the way of diseases or defects in their udder and I find they are in good health and apparently free from all contagious disease and udder defects. I am informed that the tuberculosis test has been applied within the past year with no reactors in the herd. Their condition as to flesh at the present time is fair, and with ordinary care these cows should winter in good condition.\n\nWhen making the examination I noticed the heifer \"Culdare's Bluebell\", that is suckling a calf at present, is in rather poor condition, and would strongly recommend that \"Culdare's Holly\", another purebred heifer some months younger and also suckling a calf, should be substituted, owing to the fact of her being in much better condition and larger, with the calf superior to that of Bluebell, indicating that she is feeding the calf either a greater quantity of milk or milk of better quality. This is the only change I would recommend in the eight cows previously selected by Mr. A. L. Hay.\n\nTrusting the above will meet with the approval of the Department, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. W. Rutledge, V.S.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that following instructions contained in your telegram dated October 8th, J. W. Rutledge, Veterinary Surgeon, accompanied me to the farm of Mr. Ogilvy-Wills near Fairmont Springs on October 24th and thoroughly examined the eight registered Ayrshire cows purchased for the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the report submitted by Dr. Rutledge, which I beg to enclose herewith, you will note that he strongly recommends that the cow Culdare's Holly be purchased instead of Culdare's Bluebell, owing to the latter being in poor condition. This was done, and I trust the action taken will meet with the approval of the Department. I beg to state that the cow Culdare's Bluebell was in much poorer condition when examined on October 24th than when Mr. Hay examined the cows on October 4th, and I am of the opinion that Dr. Rutledge acted very wisely in recommending the purchase of Culdare's Holly in her stead.\n\nI also beg to report that Dr. E. L. Stone, when visiting this Agency on October 25th, advised that the tuberculin test be applied to the school herd of cattle and that the barn be examined and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Arrangements have been made with Dr. J. W. Rutledge to have this done within a day or two.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S.

It is noted that these cows are of a fine type, and should prove good foundation stock to eventually develop a registered herd at the school. It is also noted that they are in good health and apparently free from all contagious disease, having received the tuberculin test within the past year. In view of Dr. Rutledge's recommendation, the Department approves of the purchase of the cow, Culdare's Holly.\n\nI have also your letter of the 28th ultimo, enclosing the registration certificates for five of the eight cows purchased. It is considered that these certificates should be kept on file by the Principal of the school, and they are returned herewith. You will be good enough to hand them to him. When the certificates for the other three cows are received, they should also be handed to the Principal.\n\nThe Department is pleased that a good selection of cows has been made. It is hoped that the school staff will take proper care of them. As soon as you have received accounts covering the cost, you should attach them to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department, in order that payment can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Eight new cows are on their way to the school, approved by the Veterinary Surgeon, and mostly expected to freshen between now and the new year. There will be a good milch supply this winter. The school has sufficient feed. I warned the Agent to have the barn and old herd inspected before putting the new ones in and saw the V. S., who undertook to do it and to direct any measures necessary to prevent possible contamination of the new cows. The stable will probably have to be disinfected and whitewashed. The stockman looks good and the Principal is interested.

S. Ryckman, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested by you, and also being directed by Doctor E. L. Stone when in Cranbrook, I visited the Kootenay Indian Residential School on October 30th and again on November 2nd, to apply the Tuberculin Test to the herd of twenty-eight cows at that place. I am pleased to say that the test showed the herd to be free from tuberculosis, there being no reactors.\n\nI also examined the barn and premises, and would recommend a few alterations. I have suggested that the yard be cleaned up and the manure drawn away.\n\nThe barn, which was painted inside a number of years ago, should be repainted, as it would be much better than to apply whitewash. Also, there are some alterations that are necessary in the barn, as they are short of stall room for the cows. There are six box stalls situated at one end of the barn where pigs and young calves are now being kept. I would suggest that these be removed and cow stalls put in their place. This would be more satisfactory as it is most unsanitary to keep pigs in a cow barn. I would also suggest that if pigs are to be kept a piggery should be built that would be suitable for the purpose.\n\nThe fencing around the barn is in bad shape; the posts are rotten and the wire is down.\n\nI am pleased to say that the live stock at the School farm is in very fine condition, the pigs, poultry and cattle are thrifty and in good health, and the new cows add considerably to the appearance of the herd.\n\nTrusting this will meet with the approval of the Department, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. W. Rutledge, V.S.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/c-8776.pdf", "olmocr-version":
