Snowy clouds gathered in the sky, and the sun set behind the hills, and crowds gathered in the streets, but only abated during the day. Night came, and the moon rose, but the clouds still lingered above, and the stars twinkled in the sky. The wind howled, and the trees swayed in the gusts. The air was cold, and the people huddled together, seeking shelter from the elements. The weather was harsh, and the people were forced to seek warmth wherever they could find it.\n\nThe next day dawned bright and clear, and the people emerged from their shelters, eager to begin their day's work. The streets were busy, and the shops were bustling with activity. The people were determined to make the most of the day, despite the harsh weather.\n\nThe story continues...\nA REMINISCENCE\n\nof the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThe Martyr's Body Brought\n\nto Brandon by Mr. Hume.\n\nThe Terrible Affair in God's\n\nPresence.\n\n(Washington Star.)\n\nThe President's body was brought to Brandon last night by Mr. Hume, who had been engaged in the service of the late President. The body was placed in a casket and carried to the Brandon Hotel by a party of prominent citizens. The body was then placed in a hearse and driven to the Brandon Cemetery. The body was then placed in a vault and will be interred there.\n\nTHE TORONTO STORE\n\nSELLING OUT.\n\nLEAVING BRANDON.\n\nA GRAND CLEARANCE SALE now going on, and to continue until the whole stock is disposed of.\n\nOver $10,000 worth of Dry Goods, Groceries, Watches, Fans, Hats and Caps, Boots and Shoes, Groceries, etc., will be offered at half price and below cost.\n\nAs an extra bonus, all customers will receive a free gift valued at $50 or more.\n\nOur Whole Stock must go at any price.\n\nHeaps of Dry Goods\n\nTo select from: Large Stock of Pants and Knitted Socks for Women and Men.\n\n30 pieces Dress C-shirts, all sizes and prices.\n\n20 pieces Ladies' Blouses, all sizes and prices.\n\n25 pieces Yarns, all shades and prices.\n\n45 pairs Fine Caps and Mittens, $2.50.\n\nA large assortment of Ladies' Blouses, Gloves, Corsets, Tie Collars, Silk and Cotton Stockings.\n\nAll Wool Blankets, from $1.00 to $5.00.\n\nA large assortment of Ladies' Blouses, Gloves, Corsets, Tie Collars, Silk and Cotton Stockings.\n\nCAR LOADS OF CROCEERIES,\n\n10 lbs.

They are no longer tolerated. At a recent dinner party a gentleman wore them at table. It is a curious thing that they have been in use for a long time past, but nobody twenty years ago thought of wearing them at dinner parties. When they first came into fashion, they were considered unsightly without their aid, and now that they are worn, they are bound to be seen even in the most polished circles. The brass knuckles are made of heavy metal and amount of skill which now characterizes the art of making them. They are not only extremely useful, but also very effective. They are made in various sizes, from the smallest to the largest, and are worn on the fingers. They are made of brass, and are very durable. They are worn on the fingers, and are very effective when used properly.\n\nTHE WALLPAPER EMPORIUM.\n\n48 Cases Latest Designs in Wall Papers\n\nAT PRICES YOU CAN'T BEAT.\n\nSpecial prices for hotels, wholesale and retail.\n\nWM.

F. Burt, seconded by Mr. Spence, that this successful meeting, surpassing all expectations regarding the question at hand, will be held at the home of Mr. John A. Macdonald, commemorating the fact that, in view of the advantages of political life, it is the duty of every man who has an interest in the City and County of Brandon, by grasping this opportunity to elect a friend, and thus assuring a true friend to represent them at every calling.\n\nIt is therefore resolved that the Brandon Conservative Association hereby appoint a delegate to attend at the detention to be held next week at the home of Mr. John A. Macdonald, at the City of Brandon, for the purpose of forming a club eighteenth of December instant.\n\nAfter this resolution had been read by Hon. D. M. Wainwright, it was moved by Mr. Smith and seconded by Mr. John A. Macdonald, that this Club should be known by the name of the Conservative Association of the County and City of Brandon, and that a calling card be sent to every house in the City and County to be delivered at the office of the Tory. This motion was carried by unanimous vote.\n\nThis will be a great carnival of an eco-patriotic nature, and the most enthusiastic spirit will be manifested by those present.\n\nIt was further resolved that the Club should raise enough money to purchase a band, as the Union Band is doing, and that they should be able to make an arrangement with Bertoni to supply them with a band, at a cost of five cents per member each year.\n\nThat these resolutions be acted upon forthwith.\n\n---\n\n**ANTI-FAT**\n\nAlderman McCollins this week returned from his southern tour, visiting New Orleans and many other points east and south.
