We believe that the provisions of the Act, as it comes up, will be quite satisfactory. Of course there are those who will object on principle, and there will be a large number of electors kicking who will object as a matter of course. No doubt there will be raised objections on the ballot not being introduced, but we hold that in a district such as this, where there is a very large proportion of the electorate consisting of the taxable population of a town which has hitherto been in force in the Territories. The provision requiring a deposit of $100 to be made by candidates will have the effect of deterring many of the rascals from forcing themselves on the electorate. The first election will take place at such time as the Lieutenant-Governor may appoint, and the question is now probably fixed for May or June. We have not yet heard the names of any gentlemen nominated as probable candidates in our district, except that Mr. Hughes has tendered his name to the Northwest Council, who it is rumored intends offering himself for election in Prince Albert division. Should Mr. Hughes be a candidate, he will have our warmest support, as we believe that no man could be more fitted to represent us than he. It may be objected that he is a government official, and therefore cannot be elected. We are, however, glad to inform you that he is legally disqualified on that account, and is answer to the objection we would point out that for many past years he has been the Governor's private secretary, but has never been officially appointed to that position, and he will do so only through political influence. We can ill afford to object to him on the score that he is a government official, as a reference to the records of the Northwest Council will show that he has been a member of the council for several years, and a good deal in the councils' defense of the interests of this district. We trust that Mr. Hughes will be able to secure a seat in the legislature, and Mr. Hughes whether he will be in the field or not, we will certainly try our best to assist him in his endeavors. The district has been fairly divided, and the division should meet with the approval of all interested. A number of people appear to think that the name of Prince Albert should have a representative in the legislative assembly, but this is not the case. In fact it would be almost impossible to divide the district in any other manner than that in which it has been done by the party of common consent. Other objections are raised, and each prospective candidate would doubtless have preferred some other division. Instead of finding fault with the division, they should believe in the election, that they may be sure of an election, to look around and select the best men in the several districts as their representatives. We intend taking an independent stand, and doing everything in our right to support those whom we believe to be the best qualified for the position, and we hope that Dominion party voters will not be allowed to come into the way.\n\nTHOS.
