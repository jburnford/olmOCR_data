Accordingly he ordered by General Middleton that the troops of the North-West were divided into three flying columns, and a base for transport of supplies was established on the Canadian Pacific Railway line. The first column, consisting of General Middleton's own troops, took up their head-quarters at Fort Qu'Appelle. The second column, under Lieut.-Col. Otter, started from Swift Current. The third column, under Major-General Strange, took their post at Calgary. The base for transport of supplies was placed at Swift Current, under Major-General Laurie. Other corps were sent along the Canada Pacific Railway, where they met at a moment's notice for no particular circumstances demanded.

Strange had 300 men and fought Big Bear with his brave scouts. He surrendered to the commandant, who was killed by Prince Albert local commandant. Eleven loyalists were killed. The police retreated to Carlton, which they burnt, and then went on to Prince Albert.\n\n**Fish Creek**, April 15.\u2014This was the first engagement between the first driving column commanded by General Middleton and the rebels. Our scouts were fired at by Indians and half-breeds and waited for the column, which arrived. The firing lasted for several hours. Volunteers killed, 10; wounded, 48.\n\n**Cut Knife Hill**, May 3.\u2014Col. Otter, with 300 men, met up with Battleford for 33 miles and fought Pound-Maker with 600 horses for several hours, inflicting heavy loss. Otter retreated in good order, having killed 12 and wounded 10. The force during thirty hours marched seventy miles and fought several hours with the Indians.\n\n**Batoche's**, May 9 to 11.\u2014This engagement was the second one between Col. Otter's column under General Middleton and the half-breeds and Indians led by Gabriel Dumont, and was the most serious since the beginning of the campaign, as Batoche's was considered, and was in fact the stronghold of the rebels. On May 9th we had 12 killed and 50 wounded. The following telegram from General Middleton relates briefly the facts.\n\n\"We had an engagement with the enemy on Monday. I received a message from Riel saying: 'If you massacre our women and children, we will massacre our prisoners.' I answered him that I would keep them in a safe place until it was done, but I will not fire at it.\" I sent a message to our own guard, and when I saw a chance, ordered a general advance. Our men responded nobly and were splendidly led by their officers.\"\n\n**Colonel Strachan** drove the enemy out of their rifle pits at the point of the bayonet, and afterwards forced his way across the plain and seized the houses, of which we are now masters.\n\nOur men bivouacked on Monday night on the field of battle. In the heat of the action Riel sent another letter, stating that if we did not give up our prisoners, by sunrise the prisoners would be killed. The letter came too late, the advance being already ordered. The prisoners were given up, and the enemy were driven back in time to kill them. Our loss is five killed and fifteen wounded. The enemy sustained great loss.\n\nMay 30.\u2014Strange's reconnoissance in force with Big Bear. Strange had 300 men and fought Big Bear with his brave scouts. He surrendered to the commandant, who was killed by Prince Albert local commandant. Eleven loyalists were killed. The police retreated to Carlton, which they burnt, and then went on to Prince Albert.\n\n**THE COMMISSARIAT**\n\n\"An army crawls on its belly,\" is the military adage employed to show the intimate connection between military and commissariat supplies. Supplies suddenly springing into a war 2,000 miles away from the chief centres of population, found herself without even the barest skeleton of either an hospital branch or a commissariat branch, or a transport service. Food for 5,000 men had to be prepared. The whole army of technicians, from surgeons and ordnance officers who wait upon the troops had also to be supplied. There was no Government depot of food supply. There was not even a stock of tents, tacks, etc., ships' biscuit stores. The weather was very worst possible at the time of the year, for winter had not disappeared nor spring set in. The snow was too soft to bear heavy teams. The grass was not long enough for the use of horses and cattle. There was nothing sheltered except the tents and the prairies. When the Minister of Militia came to concert this particular phrase, he must for a while have felt that the difficulty was insurmountable, that it was simply impossible to undertake to bring together together sufficient wagons, horse teams, etc., send them off to the front to keep the fighting army well-fed. What the work is may be seen from the fact that on May 28th last, there left Calgary for Edmonton a convoy three miles long, consisting of 178 ox and Indian pony carts; 45 four and two-horse teams; and 80 double bull wagons, each hauled by ten huge oxen, conveying two or three hundred tons of supplies.\n\nFortunately the Minister of Militia in organizing the commissariat, availed himself of the help of the Hudson Bay Company. This help has been secured under the most liberal and honest conditions. The company agreed to supply all commissariat stores, including food, pay, and other requisites they had to purchase at market prices, receiving 5 per cent profit, which sum was far less than would have been required for a new organization throughout such an enormous territory. Lieut.-Col. Jackson went down to Winnipeg with a party of officers designated as the head-quarters for distributing supplies. He was assisted by Lieut.-Col. M. LaMontagne as supply officer. Subsequently Lieut.-Col. Whitehead was appointed general transport officer. All these officers worked in close cooperation with Mr. S. Wrigley, commissioner of the Hudson Bay Company at Winnipeg. His experience was most valuable in the emergency. The results are before the people. The troops, marching by forced marches, found the road always forward and ready for them whenever they pitched camp. There was a close race between demand and supply occasionally, but the Hudson's Bay Company as a commissariat has proved a success.\n\n**ARMS, AMMUNITION, Etc.**\n\nImmediately upon the force being called out for active service, the Minister of Militia issued orders for the transport to Winnipeg of a reserve supply of firearms, ammunition, accoutrements, camp equipment, to provide for any emergency, and within a period of ten to fourteen days from the time the order was received, over 1,000,000 rounds of small arm ammunition, besides a supply of artillery ammunition, projectiles, 6,000 new binders, and 1,000 sets of accoutrements (new) were delivered in Winnipeg.\n\nTo meet the requirements of mounted corps specially organized in the North-West, a supply of Cooks, arms, ammunition, Winchester rifles, etc., were also sent forward to Winnipeg. The shipments of war material, camp equipment, clothing and necessaries continued to be made from time to time to meet all possible demands, until the quantities of small arm ammunition, accoutrements, reached 1,000,000 rounds, and about 2,000 rounds of artillery ammunition and projectiles, being exclusive of the small arms ammunition of 20 pounds per man issued to corps before departure to the North-west.\n\nA reserve supply of clothing, boots, socks, undershirts and drawers, grey flannel shirts, blankets, and towels sufficient for 1,000 men was also sent forward to Winnipeg with instructions with regard to the storage thereof; much of these articles had to be purchased, as the supply in stores was limited to the actual requirements of the permanent corps or schools of cavalry, artillery and infantry. Independent of this reserve, the corps were served during the campaign. Quebec was supplied with camp equipment, blankets (two per man), waterproof sheets. Boots, etc., and for caps were supplied to such corps as required them.\n\n**THE HOSPITAL SERVICE.**\n\nStill another important branch had to be prepared. The department had to provide an hospital service for the field. Dr. Bergin, M.P., was appointed surgeon-general. The whole subject was carefully studied, and in a week after his appointment he had prepared a statement of plans to be executed\u2014the Minister of Militia had studied and approved it. The following data will be interesting. A fuller account of the work that had to be done in connection with organizing this important branch was published in the *Mail* of April 1st\u2014Appointment of Dr. Bergin as surgeon-general.\n\nApril 1st\u2014Appointment of Dr. Reddick as deputy surgeon-general, and Dr. Sullivan, purveyor. Orders sent to Montreal for hospital furniture; sent to Winnipeg 8th April.\n\nApril 12.\u2014Dr. Reddick arrives at Winnipeg.\n\nApril 14.\u2014Dr. Sullivan arrives at Winnipeg.\n\nApril 16.\u2014Dr. Casgrain, Field Hospital No. 2. Dr. Reddick at Swift Current, where base hospital was established that day. Four hospitals were sent from Montreal\u2014Surgeon-Major Douglas, at Calgary; accompanying General Strange; Dr. Bell, at Clarke's Crossing; Dr. Gravely to Qu'Appelle; Dr. Wilson with first column (Middleton). Sick soldiers in Winnipeg were placed in civil hospital.\n\nApril 25.\u2014Base hospital was transferred from Swift Current to Moose Jaw.\n\nApril 26.\u2014Medical staff except deputy surgeon-general, surgeon-major Casgrain, surgeons Bell, Gravely, Powell and Pelletier are relieved this day; eight dressers and two orderlies also discharged. Red Cross Ambulance Corps of Toronto, under Dr. Nuttess, accepted 14th April, and sent to Battleford, where they arrived in good condition brought in from fight with Pound Maker.\nDEPARTMENT\n\nOF\n\nMILITIA AND DEFENCE\n\nOF THE\n\nDOMINION OF CANADA.\n\nREPORT\n\nUPON THE SUPPRESSION OF THE REBELLION IN THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES, AND MATTERS IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, IN 1885.\n\nPRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT.\n\nOTTAWA:\n\n1886.\nTo His Excellency the Most Honourable Sir Henry Charles Keith Petty-Fitzmaurice, Marquis of Lansdowne, in the County of Somerset, Earl of Wycombe, of Chipping Wycombe, in the County of Bucks, Viscount Calne and Clynstone, in the County of Wilts, and Lord Wycombe, Baron of Chipping Wycombe, in the County of Bucks, in the Peerage of Great Britain; Earl of Kerry and Earl of Shelburne, Viscount Clanmaurice and Fitzmaurice, Baron of Kerry, Lixnaw and Dunkerron, in the Peerage of Ireland; Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George; Governor General of Canada, and Vice Admiral of the same, &c.\n\nMy Lord,\u2014\nI have the honour to forward to Your Excellency the accompanying Report on the suppression of the recent insurrectionary movement in the North-West Territories, and upon matters in connection therewith, which is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be, my Lord,\n\nYour Excellency's most obedient servant,\n\nADOLPHE P.

CARON, K.C.M.G.,\nMinister of Militia and Defence.\n\nSir,\u2014The following pages contain all possible information that could be obtained by this Department, on the subject of the rebellious outbreak which occurred in the North-West Territories in March, 1885.\n\nIn consequence of the suddenness of the call to arms, the efficiency of the Department of Militia and Defence, not at all anticipating so great and urgent a demand, was very severely tried. What would have been, comparatively speaking, an easy task, had the financial resources of the Department permitted the constant expenditure necessary to provide for unusual emergencies, became on this occasion a very arduous and trying one. The exertions of every official in the Department were heavily taxed, and I am proud to be able to report the alacrity with which every employ\u00e9 did his utmost to assist in improvising what was absolutely required at the moment.\n\nAdditional clothing and equipment of the Force for the campaign had to be immediately provided. A commissariat system for operations in the North Western wilds, far from the ordinary sources of supply, had to be established, also Medical Service and Ambulance Corps for the field. Purchases were forthwith made of such articles of equipment as were deficient in our stores and contracts were entered into for a large amount of clothing. Stores of all kinds were forwarded with the utmost despatch to Winnipeg, for distribution at the required points.\n\nThe difficulties experienced in transporting Troops and supplies at that season of the year through a wilderness can be readily imagined; particularly owing to the gaps of unfinished road on the Canadian Pacific Railway line east of Port Arthur, over which the Troops had to march, as appears by the reports of the Officers engaged. On referring to the map forming a frontispiece to this report, some of the difficulties with which we had to contend will become apparent. The respective localities from which the Troops were\ntaken, and the line of their route to the disturbed district, are plainly shewn. The valuable information which it contains further illustrates the difficulties which the campaign was undertaken and successfully carried out.\n\nWithin one week from the date when the orders were given, a large force, including Field Artillery, was concentrated in Winnipeg, from the remotest parts of the Dominion; while, at the same time, local forces were being organized in Winnipeg, Calgary and elsewhere. The alacrity with which volunteers presented themselves from all parts of Canada for the service of the Crown, and in the cause of law and order, is indeed very creditable to the country.\n\nI have much pleasure in calling attention to a letter received soon after the outbreak of hostilities (it having been transferred to this Department by direction of His Excellency), from Mr. George W. Grant, late Lieutenant in the Governor General's Foot Guards, enclosing the following patriotic declaration, to which thirty-nine signatures are attached:\n\nCHICAGO, March, 1885.\n\n\"We, the undersigned subjects of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, at present resident in the United States of America, learning with regret of the outbreak of a rebellion in the North-West Territories of Her Majesty's dominions, beg most respectfully to notify Her Colonial Representative of our willingness to aid in the suppression of the same, and will cheerfully answer to the call for duty, should our services be required.\n\nIn thus tendering our services, we wish to shew our deep sense of loyalty and devoted attachment to Her Majesty.\n\n\"God save the Queen.\"\n\nTo the signatures appended hereto, in many instances, rank formerly held in the Active Militia of Canada is added; and when it is further observed that this is but one of a number of such offers received, both officially and personally, directly and through the medium of friends, it may reasonably be claimed: firstly, that those who have passed through a period of service in the ranks of our Militia never forget their military life and training; and, secondly, that, even as residents of the great and prosperous Republic, they are far from forgetting the flag to which they owe allegiance.\n\nThe march of our Troops, divided as they were into three columns, can be easily traced on the map which forms a frontispiece to this Report.\n\nThe plans of Batoche, Fish Creek, Loon Lake and Cut Knife Hill, where the different engagements took place, with the views of the several localities, will prove of great interest, as also the facsimile of a plan, in red ink and pencil, that was found among the papers of Louis Riel, the Rebel Chief.\n\nThe creation of a Medical Staff and Ambulance Corps was entrusted to the\ncare of Surgeon-General Bergin; and it is a pleasing duty to note how perfectly this service was improvised and carried out in all its details. The thorough efficiency of our Hospitals at the needed points, and the system of Ambulance Corps on the field, merited and received from all quarters the highest appreciation. Dr. Bergin's Report is annexed (Appendix No. 5).\n\nThis short and decisive campaign was necessarily an expensive one, as will be seen from the following statement of expenditure by the Department of Militia and Defence on account of the Rebellion:\n\nExpended from April to 30th June, 1885........... $1,697,851.32\n\" from 1st July, 1885, to 30th April, 1886... 2,753,733.06\n\nTotal expenditure up to 30th April, 1886......... $4,451,584.38\n\nThe result of the campaign, successful and creditable though it has been in the highest sense, is not without its mournful list of dead and wounded.\n\nKilled or died of wounds at Fish Creek....... 10\nWounded there.................................. 40\nTotal............................................. 50\n\nAt Batoche, killed.............................. 8\nWounded........................................ 46\nTotal............................................. 54\n\nAt Cut Knife Hill, killed....................... 8\nWounded........................................ 14\nTotal............................................. 22\n\nAt Loon Lake, wounded........................ 3\nTotal reported killed......................... 26\n\" \" wounded................................. 103\nTotal casualties............................... 129\n\nThe above figures include only those actually killed or wounded by the enemy's fire, and do not shew the casualties on the line of march, or cases of illness or disease contracted from exposure or other causes, nor do they include the fighting at Duck Lake between the Rebels and the Mounted Police, in which twelve were killed and twelve wounded. Taking into consideration the number of men actually engaged, our losses in dead and wounded are very heavy, showing how fiercely the struggle was carried on upon both sides.\n\nThe losses on the Rebel side were heavy, and are doubtless only partially represented by the following figures, which are mentioned in the various Reports:\n\nAt Fish Creek the Major General reports that the Rebels had 11 killed or died of wounds, and 18 wounded. In the four days' fighting at Batoche, 51 were reported to him as killed, and 173 wounded. In Lt.-Colonel Otter's report, eight Indians are mentioned as killed at Cut Knife, though this of course does\nnot even approximately represent their losses. One or two Indians are also reported by Major General Strange as shot by men of his column.\n\nInstructions were given, upon the return of the Troops, for the investigation, by Boards of Officers in the several Military Districts, of the many claims for compensation of the wounded and of those who have sustained the loss of relatives killed in battle. Some few of these claims still remain unsettled, through necessity of further investigation before the passing of the requisite Orders in Council, or other unavoidable cause; but arrangements have been made in order that, pending their settlement, those who have been incapacitated from earning their livelihood by wounds received or illness contracted or otherwise, shall be temporarily provided for.\n\nWith the return home of our Troops, there came upon the Department an entangled mass of War Claims of all sorts. This necessitated the creation of a Commission, to undertake the very arduous task of enquiring into and reporting upon all such demands. The Commission first assembled at Winnipeg, and subsequently resumed its sittings in Ottawa, accomplishing a great deal of work, and enabling the Department to equitably adjust a great number of claims of small as well as large amounts. The Report submitted by the Commission, before closing its operations, together with the Reports from time to time upon the respective cases, is herewith published (Appendix No. IV) and will be found both thorough and minute, the greatest care having been taken to arrive at a fair settlement of all just claims against this Department.\n\nThe number of claims investigated up to the 25th of February was...........1,308\nThe total amount claimed was................................. $3,289,878.04\nReductions were made by the Commission, amounting to ............. 351,998.16\nClaims have been paid to the extent of.............................. 2,918,024.03\n\nTrusting, Sir, that the Department over which you so ably preside may long be spared from such sudden and urgent calls to duty, and especially that insurrectionary attempts may never again mar the fair page of the Dominion's history, I hope that any future emergency, from whatever quarter the danger to the peace and safety of Canada, or to the honor of the Empire may arise, will find the Department of Militia and Defence as zealous and devoted, and\u2014permit me to add\u2014as efficient, in proportion to its financial resources, as it has proved itself upon the occasion which has formed the subject of the present\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. EUG. PANET, Colonel,\nDeputy of the Minister of Militia and Defence.\nAPPENDIX No. 1.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT BY MAJOR-GENERAL SIR FREDERICK D. MIDDLETON, K.C.M.G., C.B., COMMANDING THE MILITIA OF CANADA UPON THE MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, IN 1885.\n\nOTTAWA,\nDecember 30th, 1885.\n\nSIR,\n\nThe campaign in the North West having been successfully carried out, and the Force broken up, I beg to be allowed to lay briefly before you, for the information of His Excellency the Governor General and yourself, a general report of the work done. I have already had the honor to submit to you my own despatches and those of Major General Strange and Lt.-Col. Otter, concerning the several engagements of the several Columns with the enemy; but as not the least difficult and harassing part of the campaign was the marching, and as this was admirably performed by all three of the Columns, I wish to be allowed to bring this part of the campaign more particularly to your notice, and would venture to point out in advance that, considering the weather, the long distance, the difficult rivers to pass, with inadequate means for so doing, and the fact that the troops engaged were all what may be called untrained citizen soldiers and officers, who had hurriedly left their homes, their offices, their desks, their farms, etc., at the call of duty, I think that the marching connected with this campaign will compare favorably with that of the Regular Troops of any country.\n\nAs you are aware I received my orders from you on the afternoon of the 23rd March last, and I started that evening for the North West with my A.D.C., Captain Wise, \"The Cameronians.\" We arrived at Winnipeg on the morning of the 27th and left for Qu'Appelle the same evening with the 90th Battalion, about 260 strong (one company having left the night before). The Winnipeg Field Battery not being completed with horses left on Saturday morning and arrived at Qu'Appelle late that night.\n\nThe 28th, 29th and 30th were devoted to arranging for Transport and Commissariat, with the able assistance of Mr. Bedson and Captain Swinford, 90th Regt., who I severally appointed Chief Transport Officer and Chief Commissariat Officer, and in forming a small body (30) of Scouts under Captain French, late N. W. Mounted Police.\n\n30th.\u2014I was able to send forward to Fort Qu'appelle, 18 miles to the front, half my little force under Lt.-Col. Houghton, D.A.G.\n\n31st.\u2014Lord Melgund joined me and was appointed Chief of the Staff.\n\n2nd April.\u2014Moved off with remainder of Force to Fort Qu'Appelle, I halted there for four days to enable the 90th Battalion to fire blank and ball ammunition, as I found that many of the men had never pulled a trigger.\n\n6th April.\u2014Marched with whole Force en route for Batoche, the Rebel stronghold. As this was our first regular march, and the road up the north bank of the River Qu'Appelle was very steep and in very bad order, the snow beginning to melt, I only made 11 miles and camped for the night, which turned out fearfully cold, the thermometer during the night fell tremendously, and at\nsunrise it was 23\u00b0 below zero, and all the tent pegs had to be cut out of the ground with axes next morning.\n\nApril 7th.\u2014Marched 18 miles.\n\nApril 8th\u2014Halted to enable Lt.-Col. Montizambert and \"A\" Battery of Canadian Artillery, consisting of 2 guns and 100 men, to join my force. Weather still very cold.\n\nApril, 9th.\u2014Marched 21 miles and halted at Touchwood Hills. Here I received the sad news of the Frog Lake massacre.\n\nDirected Major General Strange, late R. A. (whose services had been placed at my disposal by the Minister), to assume command of Force in the Alberta District, with general directions to move to Edmonton, and so on to Fort Pitt, where I should probably meet him.\n\nApril 10th\u2014Marched 23 miles and halted 2 miles short of the Salt Plains. 40 men of C. School, under Major Smith, accompanied by Major General Laurie, joined me here with a telegraph operator and repairer. On the march I had a meeting or, as it is called in this part of the country, a \"Pow-wow,\" with the Indian Chief Day Star and his people at Indian Farm. They, of course, expressed the greatest loyalty, and received the usual present of tea, tobacco and flour.\n\nApril 11th.\u2014Marched 19 miles and halted at Swinford, in the middle of the Salt Plain. It was not quite so cold, but the roads were in terrible order, and the Infantry, in spite of all my care, had constantly to wade up to their knees, sometimes almost to their waists. We had to carry wood for our cooking, and no large fires could be made to warm the men in consequence. The water was strongly impregnated with alkali, and could only be drunk when made into tea.\n\nApril 12th.\u2014Marched 20 miles and halted at Wise, 22 miles from old Humboldt.\n\nApril 13th.\u2014Marched to Humboldt, a distance of 22 miles. From this place Messrs. McDowell and Bedson left for Prince Albert, having gallantly volunteered to do so for the purpose of communicating with Col. Irvine, Commissioner N. W. M. P. there. I may here state that though according to the report of some Scouts who had come in there was great danger in this undertaking, they having been chased by Riel's Scouts and Indians, these two gentlemen got in safely to Prince Albert and afterwards rejoined me. General Laurie also left in the morning of this day to go back to Swift Current and there assume the duties of Commandant of the Base, it being necessary to establish one there for the forwarding of Lt.-Col. Otter's Column, which I had ordered to proceed to that place with the intention of his moving from there to Clarke's Crossing to join me in the attack on Batoche, and with a view to Swift Current eventually becoming the general base for the two Columns.\n\nApril 14th.\u2014Column halted to give the Royal Grenadiers under Lt.-Col. Grasett, and Major Boulton with a body of irregular mounted Infantry, a chance to catch us up. Captain Haig, R.E., from Halifax Garrison, joined me here and was appointed Assistant Quarter Master General to the Column, in which capacity he did me excellent service.\n\nApril 15th.\u2014Marched 23 miles.\n\nApril 16th.\u2014I pushed on myself with a small party, consisting of 1 gun, A Battery, 40 men of C. School in carts, and 20 of French's Scouts to Clarke's Crossing, 35 miles off, fearing that the Rebels might anticipate our arrival and seize the scow and wire rope used there for ferrying. We had a\nterrible march on this occasion in the face of a regular blizzard of wind and hail, and reached the Crossing however in good time, and found it all secure. The rest of the Force marched about 17 miles and halted.\n\nApril 17th.\u2014Main body marched 18 miles and arrived at Clarke's Crossing at 11 a.m.\n\nApril 18th.\u2014Halted. I sent Lord Melgund out with Major Boulton and his Scouts to reconnoitre towards the enemy. They returned in the evening having captured 3 Indians of White Cap's, the American Sioux Indian's Band. Lt.-Col. Grasett and 10th Regiment Royal Grenadiers, about 250 strong, of all ranks, joined my Force this day, making up my strength in round numbers to 800 men of all arms. This regiment had come through the gaps and made remarkable good marching to catch up my Column.\n\nApril 19th.\u2014The scow and rope for ferrying were put in order, after a great deal of hard work, by the troops under Captain Haig's direction. Messrs. Bedson and McDowell returned from Prince Albert via Humboldt having met with no adventure on the road, thus showing that the reports of the different Scouts as to the dangers they had encountered on their journeys were, to say the least of it, rather highly-colored.\n\nCaptain Doucet, of the Canadian Militia, who had been appointed my Second Aide-de-Camp, joined me here, having come on from Humboldt with the above named gentlemen. This young officer, a graduate of the Royal Military College Kingston, was unfortunately badly wounded at Fish Creek, up to which time he performed his duties to my complete satisfaction.\n\nApril 20th.\u2014Owing to the alarming reports from Inspector Morris, at Battleford, as to the imminent and immediate danger that post was exposed to, I had felt it necessary to direct the Column under Lt.-Col. Otter to march direct on Battleford, instead of to Clarke's Crossing, from whence I had intended him to move his Column along the west side of the South Saskatchewan while I moved along the east side to attack Batoche. Had I been able to carry out this movement the taking of Batoche would have been much easier, and more effective; and I regret it the more as afterwards I found out that this imminent and immediate danger of the situation at Battleford had been tremendously overstated.\n\nI now determined to divide my small Force and move down both sides of the river, owing to the apparently correct information I had received that Riel's force only numbered about 400 men all told, and the knowledge I possessed that Lt.-Col. Irvine had over 200 men under him at Prince Albert. I commenced crossing over my left Column, sending over French's Scouts and half of Boulton's Mounted Infantry by the two scows which were now in working order. The second scow I procured from Saskatoon, the settlers of which place willingly gave it up for the public service. I would here beg to draw attention to the work done by the troops to enable me to cross this Column, the scow had to be made watertight, the wire rope spliced, taken over and anchored to the other side, a platform and windlass erected on near side, to stretch the rope, oars had to be made with axes, wharves constructed, roads built down the steep banks to the water edge, which was completely blocked by enormous blocks of solid ice imbedded in the thickest and stickiest of mud, the river running rapidly at the rate of 4 miles an hour, and all this had to be done in very cold weather.\n\nI determined to put my wire rope on board the large scow, which would\nfloat down the river between the two Columns and thus be available for securing reinforcement to either Column if required.\n\n21st April.\u2014Left Division completed its crossing and camped on the west side of the river. The Left Column consisted of:\nThe W.F. Battery, under Major Jarvis.\nThe 10th Royal Grenadiers, under Lieut.-Col. Grasett.\nFrench's Scouts, under Capt. French.\nThe whole under command of Lieut.-Col. Montizambert, R.C.A., with Viscount Melgund as staff officer.\n\nI had under my command in the Right Column:\nA Battery, R.C.A., under Capt. Peters.\nC Company, I.S.C., under Major Smith.\n90th Battalion, W. Rifles, under Lieut.-Col. MacKeand.\nBoulton's Scouts, under Major Boulton.\n\n22nd April.\u2014Halted to complete the arrangements connected with the division of the Forces above mentioned, including night and day signalling.\n\n23rd April.\u2014Marched to McIntosh's Farm, a distance of 18 miles, on the road to Gabriel Dumont's Crossing.\n\n24th April.\u2014Marched for Gabriel Dumont's Crossing, met and engaged the enemy at Fish Creek. Copy of despatch forwarded herewith, marked Appendix \"A.\"\n\nPart of Western Force, the Royal Grenadiers and Winnipeg F. Battery crossed to eastern side. Camped on the river close to Fish Creek.\n\n25th April.\u2014Buried the dead. The remainder of the Western Column crossed to the eastern side. Their crossing, which was effected by means of the scow which I had floating down the river between the two Columns, was carried out under similar difficulties to those described as occurring at Clarke's Crossing.\n\n26th to 30th April.\u2014I remained encamped at Fish Creek, waiting for the arrival of the steamer Northcote which was coming down with supplies, 2 companies (100 men) of the Midland Battalion and one Gatling gun.\n\nI proposed removing my wounded in the steamer to Saskatoon, the settlers of which place had most thoughtfully and kindly offered their houses and their attendance to the wounded.\n\nDuring this time I constantly reconnoitred towards the enemy with my cavalry; but only on one occasion did we come across the enemy's Scouts near Gabriel Dumont's Ferry. About five or six of them had been just sitting down to their dinner in a deserted house, but unfortunately they must have caught sight of my party and they bolted (being all mounted) and with such a start that we were unable to catch them.\n\nDuring this time also we captured a good many cattle and ponies, mostly the property of the Rebels, but some had been stolen from the whites. Most of the cattle were slaughtered for the use of the camp.\n\nMay 1st.\u2014Having found that the Northcote was not likely to arrive for seven or eight days, acting on the advice of the Brigade Surgeon, Dr. Orton, 90th Battalion, I had ordered some days before that waggons should be made ready to carry the wounded back to Saskatoon. This was done most excellently by making use of the hides of the slaughtered cattle under the able management of Mr. Bedson, the Transport Officer, and on this day the wounded left with an escort for Saskatoon via Clarke's Crossing and arrived safely at their destination and were most kindly and well treated by the settlers of Sas-\nkatoon, who, as before stated, had volunteered their services and the use of their houses.\n\nMay 2nd to 4th.\u2014Nothing of importance occurred, with the exception of a mounted reconnaissance I made to within four miles of Batoche on the 4th, when some of the enemy's scouts were driven in.\n\nMay 5th.\u2014Steamer Northcote arrived at last, bringing, besides the stores and troops, Lieut.-Col. Van Straubenzee, who had come to join my force via Swift Current. I appointed him my second in command.\n\nNews received to-day of Col. Otter's engagement with Poundmaker at Cut Knife Creek. Copy of despatch forwarded herewith, marked Appendix \"B.\"\n\nMay 6th.\u2014Prepared for marching, and the Northcote was made defensible against musketry fire under the direction of Capt. Haig, R.E., A.Q.M.G., as I intended that it should take part in my intended attack on Batoche and perhaps draw off some of its defenders from my front. I placed on board Major Smith and 35 men of C. School; Capt. Wise, my A.D.C., who was wounded in the foot, and Mr. Bedson. Lieuts. Eliot and Gibson, Royal Grenadiers and Lieut. H. J. Macdonald 90th Battalion, also were on board being all on the sick list.\n\nMay 7th.\u2014Marched to Gabriel Dumont's Ferry and halted, the steamer anchoring there also. My force was now numerically 850 strong, consisting of A. Battery R.C.A., and one Gatling, Winnipeg F. Battery, 1 C. Co., Royal Grenadiers, 90th Battalion, 2 Cos. Midland Battalion, Boulton's Mounted Infantry and French's Scouts. Reconnoitred towards the East of my Camp.\n\nMay 8th.\u2014As I had received information that there were several bad and difficult spots on the river trail I marched the Force to the East, and then struck across the Prairie, striking the main trail from Humboldt to Batoche, at about 9 or 10 miles from Batoche, and camped. I then rode forward with a small party of scouts to within about two miles of Batoche, seeing nothing but one scout of the enemy who disappeared at once.\n\nMay 9th to 15th.\u2014The events of these days have already been brought to your notice in my despatch of the taking of Batoche and capture of Riel. Copy of which forwarded herewith and marked Appendix \"C.\" and CI.\n\nMay 16th and 17th.\u2014Force crossed the South Saskatchewan at Guard-du-puis, crossing by means of the two steamers.\n\nMay 18th to 19th.\u2014Marched to Prince Albert, 35 miles distant.\n\nMay 20th.\u2014Arrived at Prince Albert.\n\nI found a large body of Mounted Police here and a body of Volunteers, amounting in all to about 300 men, under command of Lieut.-Col. Irvine, Commissioner N. W. M. P. We were well received by the inhabitants, and I was presented with an address. The town, which is a straggling one running along the south bank of the North Branch of the Saskatchewan, had been hastily and imperfectly fortified at different points, but, as the ground about it was all clear, it must have been all along tolerably safe from attack, as the Half-breeds and Indians are not in the habit of attacking even slightly protected positions on a level plain without cover. In point of fact, I believe no attempt was made against it, even by Scouts, during the whole affair.\n\nThere was not much chance of any attack being made from the river, and no attempt had been made to protect the town on that side.\n\nMay 22nd.\u2014Left for Battleford on the steamer North-West with half my\nForce, the rest to proceed partly by steamer and partly (the mounted men) by trail.\n\nMay 23rd.\u2014As we were proceeding a canoe pulled out and a Mr. Jefferson, an Indian Instructor who had been taken by Poundmaker, accompanied by an Indian, boarded us. He was the bearer of a letter from Poundmaker, which read as follows:\n\nEAGLE HILLS, May 19th, 1885.\n\nSir,\n\nI am camped with my people at the east end of the Eagle Hills, where I am met by the news of the surrender of Riel. No letter came with the news, so that I cannot tell how far it may be true. I send some of my men to you to learn the truth and the terms of peace, and hope you will deal kindly with them. I and my people wish you to send us the terms of peace in writing, so that we may be under no misunderstanding, from which so much trouble arises. We have 21 prisoners whom we have tried to treat well in every respect. With greetings.\n\n(Signed) POUNDMAKER.\n\nTo M. General MIDDLETON,\nDuck Lake.\n\nI sent him a letter in answer, of which the following is a copy:\n\nPOUNDMAKER,\n\nI have utterly defeated the Half-breeds and Indians at Batoche, and have made prisoners of Riel and most of his Council. I have made no terms with them, neither will I make terms with you.\n\nI have men enough to destroy you and your people or, at least, to drive you away to starve, and will do so unless you bring in the teams you took and yourself and Councillors, with your arms, to meet me at Battleford on Monday, the 26th. I am glad to hear you have treated the prisoners well and have released them.\n\n(Signed), FRED. MIDDLETON,\nMajor General.\n\nMay 24th.\u2014Arrived at Battleford. Found Lieut.-Col. Otter here with his column, and the Mounted Police, under command of Inspector Dickens, N. W. M. P., who, having abandoned Fort Pitt, had arrived here and taken over command from Inspector Morris. The new part of the town is prettily situated between the North Branch of the Saskatchewan and the Battle River, smaller than Prince Albert, and scattered along the river at some distance from the bank. Some part of it is on the other side of the Battle River, and that part only was molested by Poundmaker's Indians, who burned and pillaged some of the houses before the arrival of Lieut.-Col. Otter. The other part was surrounded by beautiful clear open turf land, and was never attacked by any Indians during the whole time of the trouble, the stores having been left with goods in them, which were not touched. The only weak spot was the Police Barracks, which was situated near a large coul\u00e9e and was also hastily and imperfectly fortified, and where all the inhabitants were collected; this, however, was never attacked during the trouble.\n\nMay 25th.\u2014Parade of all the troops in celebration of the Queen's Birthday.\nMay 26th.\u2014Had \"pow-wow\" with Poundmaker and his people, who came in about 1 p.m., and in accordance with orders made prisoners of him, his principal chiefs, and the murderers of Tremont and Payne.\n\nMay 28th.\u2014Lt.-Col. Van Straubenzee and remainder of column arrived at Battleford.\n\nMay 29th.\u2014Received news of Major General Strange's affair with Big Bear, his despatch concerning which has been already forwarded to you. Copy forwarded herewith, marked Appendix \"D.\"\n\nMay 30th.\u2014Sunday. Left Battleford for Fort Pitt with all my column, in 3 steamers, with the exception of the mounted men, who went by trail on the South bank, leaving Lt.-Col. Otter with his column to garrison the place.\n\nJune 1st.\u2014Arrived at a point 6 miles short of Fort Pitt, and received news from General Strange, who was camped about 12 miles off.\n\nThis news was brought by Captain Dale, who was acting Brigade-Major to Major-General Strange's Force, and he gave me also the welcome intelligence that on his way down to meet me he had come across the Reverend Mr. Quinny and his wife and some Half-breeds, who had made their escape from Big Bear's camp in the confusion caused by Major-General Strange's attack at Frenchmen's Butte.\n\nJune 2nd.\u2014Landed and rode with a small escort to General Strange's camp. Found that Big Bear and his party had gone off to the northward and that Strange had sent Major Steele of the Mounted Police to find and follow up his trail.\n\nHaving been informed that the trail taken by Major Steele was not passable for teams, Major-General Strange expressed a wish to take his Force by the Onion Lake trail toward Frog Lake. This I agreed to. I then went over the ground of Major-General Strange's late affair. I found that the Indians had made a good many rifle-pits in their position, but they were not all well placed, some of them being too far back on the Plateau.\n\nThe gully below us was full of broken and sound carts, harness, old bedding, blankets, cooking pots, flour, bacon, etc., showing that the Indians had made a hasty retreat during the night.\n\nReturned to camp, which had been formed on the bank of the river, where the steamer had stopped.\n\nJune 3rd.\u2014Left camp with all the mounted men, viz., Boulton's, Herchmer's, Brittlebank's (Late French's) and Surveyor Scout's\u2014about 225 in all, with Major Short, Captain Peters and Lt. Rivers and 25 artillery and 1 Gatling and 150 infantry, being 50 per cent. of each Regiment, Royal Grenadiers, 90th Battalion and Midlanders, under command of Major Hughes of the Middleland Regiment, all the Infantry being in carts. Marched to Strange's camp. Raining hard all day. Found Major General Strange at his old camp, his Force having marched for Frog Lake.\n\nJune 4th.\u2014Heard at 2 a.m. of Major Steele having caught up the rear of Big Bear's party crossing a ford and having killed five of them. Major General Strange started to catch up his Force; and I myself started at day break with my Force, to follow up Big Bear's trail after Major Steele.\n\nThe first part of the road was terribly bad, owing to muskegs, but we managed to get the Gatlings, and even our teams through, which, however, were lightly loaded.\n\nOn our march we passed the body of an Indian Chief, half-buried, who had been killed in the affair with Major-General Strange, mentioned above.\nWe passed also what had evidently been a halting place of the Indians in their flight. There were carts left with food, and some furs hidden about.\n\nJune 5th.\u2014Halted, and as I heard such bad accounts of the trail ahead, we set to work to make \"travois\" after the Indian fashion, and sent in to Fort Pitt for some pack-saddles that my indefatigable Transport Officer had had made for me. I also resolved to send back my Infantry under Major Hughes; they had marched well and cheerfully, bearing all the annoyance of muskets, &c., with great good humor, but I felt that they would keep me back in marching and, much against their wishes, I ordered them to return and sent for the other Gatling under Lieut. Rutherford, B. Battery.\n\nDuring the day the wounded Mounted Police man was brought in from Major Steele's party, who I then heard was retiring toward me and was camped not far off. I rode out along the trail, and found Major Steele camped some 6 or 7 miles ahead; I told him where Major-General Strange's Column was, and directed him to join it. He informed me that he had pressed on, having been informed that Big Bear had only 50 fighting men with him, and had come up with a part of Big Bear's party who had apparently been left behind to pack up the camp; that he had engaged them, killing several, but that the rest had escaped across a ford to an island, and that as he did not think himself strong enough to follow them, having counted 73 camp fires at the camp they had passed, he thought it best to retire. He told me his horses were mostly played out, not having had much to eat, and that his officers, Captain Oswald and Lt. Coryell and the non-commissioned officers and men had all behaved admirably. He had three men wounded, of whose pluck and endurance he spoke highly. In the evening my A.D.C. informed me that Major Steele and his force were very anxious to turn and go with me, and so I gave him permission to do so, ordering him to send his worst used-up horses and men back to Fort Pitt, his wounded having already gone back. The mosquitoes and flies were very troublesome and the weather was hot, being still in the woods. While here received news that Mr. McKay and some scouts of General Strange's Column who were sent off to scout for Big Bear's trail\u2014had come across and brought in to my camp at Fort Pitt, Mrs. Delaney, Mrs. Gowenlock and five Half-breeds, who had all been prisoners with Big Bear and two Wood Crees who had helped them to escape.\n\nJune 6th.\u2014Left Travois Camp (as we named it) early; picked up Steele's party, crossed Red Deer River, and camped at 6 p.m., after a march of about 25 miles, still in the woods, and mosquitos and bull-dog flies very troublesome.\n\nKnowing that the information concerning roads, etc., was not always to be depended upon I kept our teams, bringing with them the travois and pack-saddles, in case we should require them; and though we had some difficult country to pass, muskets, etc., we managed to get our teams along all right. The method I adopted for overcoming the difficulties of the trail was to send a mounted party in advance with axes, and when they came to a bad part or a stream they bushed it or bridged it, and so we lost very little time. The Surveyor's Scouts were very useful for this duty, which they performed admirably. Having come to the conclusion, from what I had heard, that Big Bear and his braves were getting disorganized and might scatter or turn, I sent off, before leaving Travois Camp, orders to Lieut-Col. Otter at Battleford to take a force across the river and move on to Jack Fish Lake and patrol to the north-west on Squirrel Plain; and to Lieut-Col. Irvine commanding the Mounted Police.\nat Prince Albert to cross a mounted party at Carleton, and patrol towards Green Lake, so that, with Major-General Strange moving on Beaver River by Frog Lake, my party moving northwards, it would be hard for Big Bear to get away.\n\nHere I determined to leave our tents, as I found them an impediment.\n\nThis place became a second depot, the first being a little this side of Travois Camp.\n\nJune 7th.\u2014Marched at day-break, reached the scene of Steele's affair, about 25 miles from our camp of the previous day. Found one dead Indian near the camp. We camped on the high ground above the Indian camp and crossing-place to the so-called island. This became No. 3 Depot.\n\nFrom the high ground we could see that we had before us a large lake, which one of the Half-breeds with us said was called Loon-Lake. This lake, though a large and important one, is not shown in any of the maps we had with us. I forward with this a map of the lake and two free-hand sketches of it, plates XIV, XV and XVI, all drawn by my A.Q.M.G., Captain Haig, R.E.\n\nBefore starting I sent back scouts to Fort Pitt, with orders to the Midland Regiment, under Lieut-Col. Williams, to march to Frog Lake to re-inforce Major-General Strange.\n\nJune 8th.\u2014Marched early, crossed at the Ford. I followed Big Bear's trail, and found that we were on the mainland, and not on an island, and after marching about 5 miles over a very hilly trail we arrived at what we afterwards called the Narrows, where we found that Big Bear had crossed a deep stream by means of rafts of wood, bits of which we could see on the other side.\n\nOn our way here we passed on our right apparently another lake, and on the land between the two, over which the trail ran, we found another of Big Bear's camps, with, as usual, furs, carts and food and arms lying all about and 3 dead bodies partially buried, one being recognized as that of a chief, who had evidently been killed by Major Steele's party.\n\nThis made 5 five dead bodies, which was all we could find, though I had particular search made everywhere, as I was afraid that Big Bear might have killed some of the prisoners.\n\nWe always found traces of the white prisoners in all the camps we passed, boxes, torn photographs, bits of colored wools, twisted and tied on the bushes, and sometimes scraps of writing stating that they were all right.\n\nHalted close to the Narrows in the afternoon. Set to work to make a raft to take over the saddles and clothing, and swam the horses across, leaving all the teams, gatlings and 25 N.W.M. Police on this side of the water; moved on a half mile and bivouacked on a ridge; evident traces and signs of Big Bear's having camped in the same place within 48 hours. Just below where we halted we found the body of an Indian squaw, apparently in a kneeling position. It was found that she had a piece of raw-hide round her neck, and that she had apparently committed suicide.\n\nThe dog of Mr. Delaney, who had been killed at Frog Lake, was by her side. We afterwards heard that this woman had suffered from some disease in her feet, and as the Indians were obliged, at this spot, to abandon the few remaining wheel-carriages they had kept up to this time, and were all obliged to go on foot, this poor woman decided to kill herself sooner than become a prisoner, as she was maliciously told that we should kill her.\n\nHere I was met by the unpleasant news that the trail of the Indians went through a muskeg that was apparently impassable to us.\nI rode forward myself with my staff, and made an essay, but soon sank to my saddle-girths, and with difficulty got out again.\n\nWe found, just where the trail struck the muskeg, a cart overthrown and all its contents spilled about, and numerous instances of the same kind showed us that Big Bear was closely pressed and getting desperate. I determined to halt and reconnoitre all about to see if we could pass this terrible obstacle as we were surrounded by water.\n\nJune 9th.\u2014Two or three mounted men managed with immense difficulty to get across the muskeg, and found traces of the camp of the Indians, who had apparently gone north towards the Beaver River, as it was known to them that there was a large supply of flour there, and it was evident from the quantity that they had dropped and left in their flight that they must be running very short of food. Some of the old scouts told me that I might perhaps get across the muskeg with the loss of half my horses and perhaps some men, and as, besides, I did not think it judicious to risk leaving an obstacle (which would get worse by use) between us and our supplies, and as I felt that Big Bear would be hard pressed, and would probably be forced to give in, I reluctantly resolved to return to Fort Pitt and communicate with Major-General Strange, who would be getting near the Beaver River; and the circumstance which reconciled me to giving up the pursuit of Big Bear at this moment was the fact that we knew that the prisoners had not been killed up to this time, and that, perhaps, Big Bear, finding himself checked whichever way he turned (as he could not go much further north), might give himself and the prisoners up, which actually occurred.\n\nJune 10th.\u2014During the day before Captain Peters, R.C.A., had managed to construct a sort of bridge across the Narrows, which enabled us to recross more quickly than we had crossed, as the men walked over carrying their saddles and blankets, the horses being driven over as before, and we started on our return to Fort Pitt and bivouacked after a long march of 25 miles, Mosquitoes troublesome.\n\nJune 11th.\u2014Started early, and after a fatiguing march arrived at Fort Pitt at 7 p.m. The Reverend Mr. McKay had brought in Mrs. Gowanlock and Mrs. Delaney, who were safely on board the steamer. Found a mail awaiting us. Weather was fine but windy at night.\n\nJune 12th. Heard from Major General Strange, at Beaver River, that some Chippewayan Indians had come in to give up their arms. Big Bear's whereabouts still uncertain, but I fancied he was north of the Beaver River, and hoped to make use of the Chippewayans to find him. Gave orders for all the mounted men to be ready to move at daybreak.\n\nJune 13th.\u2014We marched to Frog Lake, a distance of about thirty-five miles, and halted near the camp of the Midlanders under Lt.-Col. Williams. I went over the village, which had been completely destroyed. A party of Major-General Strange's Force had buried some of the dead found there, and Lt.-Col. Williams completed the sad task, putting up very pretty little crosses and pieces of wood, on which were cut, as far as they could learn, the names of the poor victims.\n\nJune 14th.\u2014Marched early, and arrived at the H.B. Post at 6 p.m., after a long march of about thirty-five miles. Terribly annoyed by mosquitoes and flies.\n\nJune 15th.\u2014Marched early, and after about ten miles we arrived at 11 a.m. at Major-General Strange's camp at the Catholic Mission on the Beaver River.\nMajor-General Strange and myself here had a \"pow-wow\" with some Chippewayan Indians who had been with Big Bear, somewhat unwillingly, I believe, and had left him, either before or at the time of Major-General Strange's affair with him, bringing with them their missionary, Father LeGoff, a good and worthy man who had been taken prisoner by the Indians. After some talk we arranged with Father LeGoff that two of these Indians should be sent off down the river to find out where Big Bear was.\n\nJune 16th.\u2014Rode about the country, which appeared good for cattle, of which these Indians possessed several head. Capt. Palliser reported his arrival.\n\nJune 17th.\u2014Started with my A.D.C. Lt. Freer and Mr. Hayter Reid and two others for Cold Lake; about fifteen miles off. We had to swim our horses across the Beaver River and found two or three bad muskegs on the other side, and were terribly troubled by mosquitoes. We found Lt.-Col. Osborne Smith at Cold Lake with his men, the Winnipeg Light Infantry, and also found that the Reverend Mr. McKay had gone with two Indians in a canoe to see if he could hear anything of Big Bear. Returned to camp at the Catholic Mission.\n\nJune 18th.\u2014Mr. Bedson, my Transport Officer, arrived in camp with letters and some rations for us, and in the evening the two Indians returned with news that the Macleans and the rest of the prisoners had been released, and were travelling by Loon Lake to Fort Pitt. Gave orders for my mounted party to move off at day-break on the return to Fort Pitt, and directed Major-General Strange to collect his Force and join me at Fort Pitt.\n\nJune 19th.\u2014Started with Mr. Bedson at 3 a.m., leaving the mounted men to come in by two marches. I reached the Landing, a distance of 50 miles, at 6 p.m., and got on board a steamer there, reaching Fort Pitt at 10 p.m. Mr. Bedson made arrangements to go out on my old trail to Loon Lake to meet the prisoners, taking with him food and clothing for them. I stopped at Frog Lake on my way, and directed Lieut.-Col. Williams to march his Regiment with as little delay as possible back to Fort Pitt.\n\nJune 20th.\u2014Received a letter from Mr. Bedson, saying he had heard from the prisoners; that he was going on to Loon Lake, and would probably be in on the 22nd.\n\nJune 21st.\u2014Had Divine Service, weather fine, but stormy at nights. I inspected the site of the Police Barracks which had been occupied and strengthened by the small detachment of Mounted Police, under Inspector Dickens. Most of the buildings had been destroyed, but some few had been left, and had been made stronger by some of Major General Strange's Column. I found the post placed in a very dangerous position, as far as defence was concerned. It had doubtless been placed where it was, on account of the Hudson Bay store being there, and was conveniently situated as regards the river, being on a level piece of ground running back about 100 yards to a plateau of some extent, with light wooded patches and some water, there being bushes and light timber on the slope connecting the plateau and the level ground on which the barrack was situated about half-way between the river and the commencement of the plateau, so that an enemy could keep up a fire on the post in tolerable safety from the light woods on the top of the plateau, and an enterprising enemy could even keep up a fire from the bank of the river; moreover, from the formation and nature of the ground towards the plateau, I have little doubt but that Indians might have been able to fire burning arrows on to the buildings, which were all of wood.\nJune 22nd.\u2014Mr. Bedson arrived in camp with the prisoners all safe. Needless to say they were all very thankful to be again among white people.\n\nWith Batoche taken and the prisoners there released, Riel and most of his councillors, and Poundmaker our prisoners, Big Bear and his band flying, disorganised and broken up, and all his prisoners released, I began to issue orders and make preparations for the breaking up of the whole Force, which had done its work so well, and by the 3rd of July, the last of the troops at Fort Pitt were embarked in the steamers for their homeward journey, except the Winnipeg Light Infantry, under Lieut.-Col. Osborne Smith, whom I directed to remain there to receive the arms of some Indians whom I had ordered to come in to Fort Pitt, and to remain himself there with his regiment, until further orders, as a garrison.\n\nThe day before we left Fort Pitt, the late lamented Lieut.-Col. Williams was taken ill with what was supposed to be a chill, and sent on board one of the steamers, but he gradually grew worse, and, in spite of the extraordinary efforts and care of the medical men of the Force, he died on Board, on the morning of the 4th. We landed the body with all military honors, and after the burial service had been read by the Chaplain, it was sent to Swift Current for transmission to Port Hope.\n\nThis sad event threw a gloom over the whole Force, by whom Lieut.-Col. Williams was greatly honored and liked, and effectually damped the pleasure with which the Force was returning home, after having successfully carried out the object of the expedition. By his death I felt that Canada had lost one of her best men and that I myself had lost a warm and sincere friend.\n\nOn the 26th I had received information that Big Bear's band had broken up. I sent off orders for Lt.-Col. Otter and Lt.-Col. Irvine to return to their Headquarters, and on my way down the river I received the following telegram from Inspector Gagnon, N. W. M. P.:\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, July 3rd.\n\n\"Major-General Middleton,\nCommanding N. W. Field Force.\n\n\"Big Bear, and one of his councillors, prisoners here; arrested at Carleton, yesterday, by small detachment of Police.\n\nS. GAGNON.\"\n\nLt.-Col. Otter's Column had captured a few of Big Bear's party, Lt.-Col. Irvine some sixteen, and Dennis's Scouts caught seven.\n\nThis completed the success of our campaign, and proved that the movements of my different columns had had the desired effect of completing the disorder caused among Big Bear's band by the attack of Major-General Strange at Frenchmen's Butte. From the foregoing report it will be seen that the Force under my own immediate command, between the 27th March and the 15th July, had five days fighting, marched 575 miles, went by steamer 1000 miles and by rail 325 miles.\n\nThe marches were made under the greatest difficulties of weather, muskegs, woods, etc., including the crossing of a broad swift river, with very precipitous wooded banks, three times, and numerous smaller streams.\n\nWith reference to the marches, etc., of the other columns I forward herewith the reports of those of Lt.-Col. Otter, marked E. & F.; and of that of Major-General Strange, marked G. I desired Lt.-Col. Irvine, Commissioner N. W. M. P. to send me in a report of his march to Green Lake, but as he has not done so I am unable to forward it.\nNothing could have been better than the conduct of all the troops, both officers and men, engaged in this short but eventful campaign; but as it is impossible to name every one in a despatch I must, in accordance with military usage, confine myself to bringing to your notice the names of those who, from their rank, appointment or special service, are in my opinion deserving of such mention, and it will not be out of place if, in this despatch; I again record those already brought to your notice, and to whom my thanks are due for the zeal they displayed and for the services they so cheerfully rendered, together with others not before-mentioned.\n\n**PERSONAL STAFF.**\n\nLt.-Col.

Mr. Gordon,\n\nI have already sent in to the Controller of the N.W.M.P. the names of those officers of that Corps who came under my personal command whom I desired to mention as having done excellent work during the campaign and to whom my thanks are greatly due; viz.:\n\nLt.-Col. Herchmer.\nMajor Steele.\nInspector Perry.\nInspector White Fraser.\n\nThe other Corps and Regiments, viz.:\n\n- Cavalry School Corps.............. Lieut.-Col. Turnbull.\n- Gov.

Major Watson.\n\nand those officers who performed the duties of transport officers, though not lucky enough to be engaged, all performed their arduous duties equally well.\n\nIt would be hardly right for me to conclude this, the last of my despatches, without alluding to the great civility and assistance I received from Sir Alexander Galt, K.C.M.G., who was President of the Galt Steamer Navigation Company on the Saskatchewan; from Mr. Egan, Managing Superintendent of the C.P.R. at Winnipeg; and from Mr. Wrigley, Chief Commissioner of the H.B. Co. The Postal authorities, Mr. MacLeod of Winnipeg especially, took great trouble in maintaining our mail service.\n\nFrom the Telegraph authorities I received very great assistance, and notably from Messrs. Gisborne and Dwyer. The operators sent did most excellent service, in fact without the telegraph wire I could have hardly carried out the campaign. The operators not only did their work thoroughly, but evinced in some cases marvelous coolness and courage. I cannot, unfortunately, give the names of those who particularly came to my notice, but the operators at Troy, Fort Qu'Appelle, Clarke's Crossing and Battleford had very hard work.\n\nIn connection with telegraphy I beg to record the particularly good service rendered by Mr. Slack Wood, who was my chief operator during the whole campaign. The risks he ran constantly in going along the line by himself were very great, and his pluck was only exceeded by his extreme professional ability.\n\nMy thanks are due to Mr. MacDowell, of Prince Albert, and Mr. Hayter Reid, Assistant Indian Commissioner, who were with me for a short time, for the advice and assistance they so readily gave me; and I desire further to bring to your notice the name of Sergeant Back, of the Winnipeg Cavalry, who was\nmy orderly throughout the campaign; he remained close to me through both\nthe actions, where he was of assistance in carrying and transmitting orders, and\nalso accompanied me on all my fatiguing and trying rides in pursuit of Big-\nBear.\n\nIn concluding, I trust I may be allowed to think that the country has\nevery reason to be proud of the conduct of its Volunteer Militia, in this, its\nfirst essay in arms, unassisted by regular troops, and it has equal reason to be\nproud of the Department which called out, equipped and transported to the\nscene of action, from distances varying from 300 to 3000 miles, this force, and,\nwithout failure in commissariat or transport, enabled the Officer commanding\nto carry out, under exceptional circumstances, a successful campaign in less\nthan 4 months.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRED.

TO THE REPORT OF THE MAJOR GENERAL COMMANDING.\n\nNORTH-WEST FIELD FORCE,\nHEAD QUARTERS, FISH CREEK, May 1, 1885.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to state for the information of His Excellency the Governor General and yourself the following particulars of the engagement between my force and that of the Rebels, on the 24th of April last, which I have been unable to do before, except by telegraph, owing to having so much to do in reconnoitring, getting up supplies and making arrangements for the movement of the Troops in the other parts of the North-West Territory.\n\nI had previously informed you of the division of my forces, and on the morning of the 23rd both columns advanced on the two sides of the river, with the scow moving down between them. We halted about 18 miles down the river, my column near the farm of a settler named McIntosh, the other in a line with us on the other side. After a quiet night we started on the morning of the 24th at about 7 a.m., with the usual military precaution.\n\nMounted Infantry scouts spread out well in front, with support of Mounted Infantry, under Major Boulton, about 200 yards in rear. An advanced guard of the 90th Battalion about 300 yards in rear of that, and the main column about 200 to 300 yards in rear of the advanced guard.\n\nThough I had not been led to believe that the Rebels would not come so far to the front to attack us, still I was aware of the existence of a rather deep ravine or creek about 5 or 6 miles ahead, consequently I was on this occasion, with the support under Major Boulton, accompanied by Captain Haig, R.E., A.Q.M.G., and my two Aides-de-camp, Captain Wise and Lieut. Doucet, and Mr. MacDowell attached to my staff. On approaching some bluffs, just as the left advanced scouts were circling round, we suddenly received a heavy fire from a bluff and some ground sloping back on our left, which fire was luckily too high to do mischief, having been evidently fired in a hurry, owing to the approach of the left scouts. Major Boulton instantly ordered his men to dismount, let loose their horses (two of which were immediately shot) and hold the enemy in check. This was done by them most gallantly\u2014the flankers and files in front falling back on the main body. I sent Captain Wise back, with orders to bring the advanced guard and main body, which was soon done, though in going with the order Captain Wise's horse was hit by a shot from the bluffs on the left. The advanced guard on arrival extended and took cover in the bluff nearest us, and, as the main body came up, two more companies of the 90th were extended, the Rebels advancing up out of the ravine into which, however, they again speedily retired and a heavy fire was exchanged; but having sent a party round to the house on the enemy's right, the enemy gradually retired along the ravine, while our men advanced slowly to the crest of a deeply-wooded part running out of the main ravine. In this former ravine a small party of the Rebels made a stand, in what we found afterwards to be some carefully-constructed rifle-pits. These men were evidently their best shots\u2014Gabriel Dumont being amongst them, but were, so to speak, caught in a trap. A great number of their horses and ponies being in this ravine, and, what is said to be very unusual, were tied up\u2014thus showing\nI am informed, that the Rebels were pretty confident of success\u201455 of these horses were killed. These men were gradually reduced in number until, from the position of our men, it was almost impossible for them to retire, and they continued to fire at intervals, doing a good deal of mischief. Captain Peters, with great pluck and dash, led the dismounted men of \"A\" Battery, supported by a party of the 90th under Captain Ruttan, and gallantly attempted to dislodge them, but they were so well covered and were able to bring such a heavy fire on the party advancing without being seen, killing three men, two artillerymen and one of the 90th (the body of one artilleryman was afterwards found within 8 or 10 yards of their pits) that I resolved to leave them, contenting myself with extending more of the 90th in front to watch them, and sending some shells into the bluff now and then. Lt.-Col. Houghton, my D.A.G., in taking orders got mixed with this party and advanced with them, shewing great pluck and coolness. I would here beg to notice the pluck and coolness displayed by other officers (especially Captain Drury) and men of \"A\" Battery in running their guns up by hand to the edge of the ravine and the opposite gully afterwards, 3 of the men being wounded. In the meanwhile, having seen the part of the 90th extended, as above mentioned, I galloped across to the right, having previously sent my two As.D.C there with orders to get \"C\" half company and two companies of the 90th extended. On arrival there I found that the enemy was in force, trying to turn our right, having set fire to the prairie as the wind was blowing towards us. About this period Captain Drury of \"A\" Battery threw a shell into a house, some distance off, where some Rebels were seen congregating and set it on fire. The Rebels at this time advanced under cover of the smoke out of the ravine, which extended across our front, and the firing was tremendously hot, my A.D.C Lieut. Doucet, and several men being hit. Our men were forced back here a little at first, but soon rallied and advanced steadily, holding their own and taking cover well, until, using the enemy's own tactics, we fairly drove them back, bluff by bluff, and they retired altogether, going off as hard as they could. I may mention here that their attempt to drive us back by setting fire to the prairie proved a failure, though at one time it looked awkward, but I sent for a party of teamsters who soon beat it out, notwithstanding they were for a short time under fire.\n\nBy about 2 p.m., the enemy had disappeared and all firing ceased, except from the men in the ravine, who seemed by their voices to be reduced in number, and whom I endeavored to reach by means of the guns from the opposite side of the ravine, I think successfully, from the amount of blood found afterwards in the pits and a dead Sioux found near there. To return to the action of the left flank\u2014on re-crossing to them I received a bullet through my fur cap from one of the men in the rifle-pits, who had made several attempts to hit me before, and whom I have reason to believe was Gabriel Dumont himself, and who a few minutes after, being obliged to recross with my A.D.C Capt. Wise, shot from the same place his horse and threw him. Shortly after, I am sorry to say, while looking over the brow of the ravine to see if the enemy were still there, Captain Wise received a shot in the foot. I found the firing reduced to the men in the ravine, the rest of the enemy having retired in confusion.\n\nDuring the action a messenger from the left column arrived, asking if they should bring troops across, and I directed the 10th Grenadiers to be brought over, which was done by means of the scow most expeditiously, one\ncompany with Lord Melgund arriving about 1 o'clock p.m., and two other companies under Lt.-Col. Grassett later on, with two guns of the Winnipeg Field Battery, under Major Jarvis. As the affair was nearly over then, I contented myself with extending a company of the 10th on the right centre to assist in watching the ravine where the enemy's rifle-pits were, the other companies being on the extreme right in support and ultimately remaining there until the wounded were removed to the camp-ground, which had been selected in the meantime. I would here beg leave to draw particular attention to the crossing of these troops who, though luckily not required, might well have been. To fully appreciate the rapidity with which this was done, in spite of the difficulties that existed, the river must be seen: wooded heights on each side 100 feet high\u2014at bottom, large boulders encrusted in thick sticky mud\u2014a fringe of huge blocks of ice on each side, a wretched scow carrying about 60 men at most, pulled with oars made with an axe, and a rapid current of about 3 or 4 miles an hour, were the obstacles that were surmounted by dint of determination and anxiety to join with and aid their comrades.\n\nMeanwhile a sort of Zareba had been formed by Mr. Bedson and Mr. Secretan of a few wagons, where the Doctors formed their temporary hospital and carried out their functions skilfully, coolly and quietly under the able superintendence of Brigade-Surgeon Orton, 90th Battalion. A little after finding the firing had ceased and the enemy fled, except the two or three whom I left there for the reason above mentioned and as a thunder storm was coming up\u2014having removed the dead, and sent off the wounded, we pitched camp amidst a severe thunderstorm in an open spot close to the scene of the fight, which had been selected by Lord Melgund, as above mentioned. I append an official list of killed and wounded, which I regret is so large, but which is not larger than might be expected, considering the circumstances under which we were attacked, and the fact that not a man in the force but myself had ever before been under fire. Moreover I had only about 350 men in action and I estimate the enemy at about 300. As regards their loss, all we actually found on the field was three dead Indians; but I am confident they must have sustained a tolerably severe loss, as they would not have abandoned so strong a position, and one, from the amount of food we found in the different houses, they evidently expected to occupy for some time. Moreover, after crossing the creek; the trail was so situated, as regards numerous bluffs, running at right angles to it, that they could have impeded my advance with a very few men. I am afraid I shall have to stay some days in my present camp, until I can send my wounded to the rear. All my troops, officers and men, behaved well, and my thanks are due to all of them and to their several commanders: but I beg to mention by name those officers who came especially under my personal notice, and to whom my great thank are due, viz: Captain Haig, R.E., my A.Q.M.G.; my two As.D.C., Captain Wise and Lieut. Doucet, who gave me great help and assistance. Major Smith, \"C\" Company, I.S. Corps. Major Boswell and Captain Buchan, of the 90th Battalion, who were of great help to me in holding the right and eventually forcing back the enemy under a very heavy fire. Major Boswell was hit in the heel of his boot, and Captain Buchan's horse received a shot. Major Boulton's coolness and firmness in checking the enemy at the commencement of the engagement, was remarkable, and deserves great praise. Messrs. Bedson and Secretan, also, were of great assistance in forming a Zareba of waggon round the place selected by the Medical men for their temporary hospital, which was almost under fire of the enemy. My thanks are also due\nto Brigade-Surgeon Orton, 90th Battalion, for the excellent arrangement made by him for attending to the wounded, and removing them to our new camp. The men employed as ambulance men also performed their duty well, not hesitating to bring away the wounded under fire. I cannot conclude without mentioning a little bugler of the 90th Regiment, named William Buchanan, who made himself particularly useful in carrying ammunition to the right front when the fire was very hot; this he did with peculiar nonchalance, walking calmly about crying: \"Now boys, who's for cartridges?\"\n\nAnd also herewith a rough sketch of the scene of the action drawn by my A.Q.M.G., Captain Haig, R.E.\n\nFRED.

I find from papers captured at Batoche yesterday that the number of the Rebels at Fish Creek was 280 under Gabriel Dumont, that they had intended to let me enter the ravine or crest, and then destroy us, taking me prisoner, and holding me as a hostage to assist them in making terms with the Government at Ottawa. Their scheme was defeated by my having my scouts so far in advance, which obliged them to fire on them, and thus disclosed their position. I also find now that the Rebels had 11 killed or died of wounds, and 18 wounded at Fish Creek.\n\nFRED MIDDLETON.\n\nOFFICIAL LIST OF KILLED.\n\n\"A\" Battery.\nGunner G.H. de Manolly. Gunner W.

Middleton, Com'g Militia of Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that having learned on the 29th ult., from my scouts, that a force of Cree and Stoney Indians, numbering about two hundred men, were camped near the reserve of the former tribe, some thirty-eight miles from here, and subsequently that Poundmaker, the Cree Chief, was hesitating between peace and war, the latter eventuality depending upon his being able to obtain assistance from Big Bear's tribe, I felt it necessary that definite action should be taken in order to make Poundmaker declare himself and prevent a junction of the forces of the two chiefs.\n\nI determined on a reconnaissence in force, and left Battleford on Friday, the 1st inst., at 2 p.m., with the following troops, viz.:\n\n- 75 Mounted Police, of whom 50 were mounted, Captain Neale.\n- 80 \"B\" Battery, R.C.A., Major Short.\n- 45 \"C\" Company I.S.C., Lieut. Wadmore.\n- 20 G.G. Foot Guards, Lieut. Gray.\n- 60 Queen's Own Rifles, Captain Brown, including the Ambulance Corps of same Regiment.\n- 45 Battleford Rifles, Captain Nash.\n\nOne Gatling gun and two 7-prs. belonging to Police, the latter being selected as more easy of transport than the 9-pr. guns, and a train of 48 wagons to carry men, rations and stores.\n\nHalting at 8 p.m. I waited nearly four hours until the moon rose, and then pushed on through the night, reaching at day-break the enemy's camp, which was seen on the higher of two hills, partially surrounded by a wide ravine, with a large creek running through it. Crossing the creek our advanced guard, the Scouts and Police, were almost at the top of the lower hill before our presence was discovered, and the general alarm sounded; hardly had our scouts gained the crest of the hill when the advanced part of the enemy was met, who opened fire upon our men with vigor\u2014the Police immediately extended on the brow, and the guns, supported by \"B\" Battery, were pushed forward into the same line, opening fire with shrapnel on the camp. The Indians, who had evidently been taken by surprise, very quickly gathered themselves together, and attempted to surround us; so large was their force that it required the whole of ours to be placed in the fighting line to meet the attack. Taking advantage of the cover afforded by the many small coulees and ravines surrounding our position, a most vicious and determined cross-fire was poured in upon our men, which at first proved most destructive, owing to carelessness in exposing themselves. Soon, however, we followed the example of our foes, and made the most of any cover that was obtainable, and in point of accurate shooting quickly demonstrated our ability to cope with them.\n\nThe disposition of our force was as follows: In the centre of the front line, and just behind the brow of the hill, was the Gatling, flanked on either side by a 7-pr. brass gun, all under the personal supervision of Major Short, ably assisted by Captain Rutherford. The support of these guns consisted of the Garrison division of \"B\" Battery. Immediately to the rear, resting in a\nslight declivity, were the horses of the Police and the wagon train; these were so well placed by Capt. Neale that only two casualties occurred through the day, viz., the loss of two horses, one of the wagon train and Captain Rutherford's charger. On either flank of the artillery were the Police. To the right and right rear was \"C\" Company and detachment of Guards. To the left, lying on the lower ledge of the hill, and extending nearly to the creek, was the Queen's Own; and protecting the right rear and ford was the company of Battleford Rifles. The positions thus described were, with some slight changes, retained by these corps more or less throughout the action.\n\nShortly after the fight became general, a rush was made by the enemy for the Gatling, but was sharply repulsed by a party from the Police and Artillery, gallantly headed by Major Short, and four Indians killed.\n\nThe trail of one of the guns now unfortunately gave way, rendering that valuable arm practically useless; excellent practice was, however, made by the other guns, assisted, whenever opportunity offered, by the Gatling; the other gun shared a similar fate later in the day.\n\nOur men had now fairly settled down to their work, and in the most cool, collected and praiseworthy manner went about forcing the enemy to abandon their numerous points of advantage and cover.\n\nThe right rear, which took in the ford, was menaced, and a part of the Battleford Rifles, under Captain Nash, assisted by individual men of \"C\" Company, Governor's Guards and Q.O.R. with Constable Ross (Chief Scout) of the Police, undertook to clear the coulee at that point; this they did most effectually, capturing four ponies whose riders were shot by them.\n\nA similar duty had now to be performed on our left rear which was entrusted to parties of the Queen's Own and Battleford Rifles, and proved one of the sharpest brushes of the day. The enemy's fire here was, however, only partially subdued, as there remained a few men whom neither bullets nor shells seemed to reach, and who were only dislodged at the end of the day by sending Ross with his scouts by a long detour to the rear and flanking them.\n\nAt eleven o'clock, that is, six hours after the beginning of the engagement, our flank and rear were clear, but the position we occupied was not tenable over night, while both guns were practically useless through broken trails, and the wounded required proper attention. Further, the object of the reconnaissance had been accomplished, inasmuch as he had declared his intentions, but Big Bear, or at least his men, had effected a junction before my arrival, as the number of the enemy was fully five hundred fighting men, including some fifty Halfbreeds.\n\nI therefore concluded to withdraw and return at once to Battleford in case a counter-attack might be made on that place\u2014placing the Battleford Rifles on the opposite side with one of the maimed guns, the wagons, dead, save Pte. Osgoode, G. G. F. Guards, whose body had rolled into a deep ravine, and could not be recovered, and wounded were taken safely over the creek, followed, in turn, by the various corps from their respective positions. A few of the enemy, on perceiving our withdrawal, followed to the edge of the ravine, but were quickly driven back by the Gatling, under Major Short, which brought up the rear and two rounds from the 7-pounders with the Battleford Rifles, under Capt. Rutherford, both of which rounds had to be fired with the gun bound up with rope and splints to keep it together. The crossing was effected without the slightest loss, and the enemy failed to follow.\nalthough, had they done so, much delay and loss of life might have been entailed upon us, as the country was favorable to them.\n\nToo much praise cannot be given to the officers, non-commissioned officers and men engaged throughout the whole action for their admirable coolness and gallantry; the circumstances were most trying to raw troops who, without sleep or breakfast, found themselves opposed to a cunning and determined enemy, thoroughly acquainted with the ground, adopting a new style of warfare and in numbers nearly double.\n\nWhere all behaved so well it is difficult to select those deserving of special mention, but I should not be doing my duty did I not bring to your notice the names of a few whose conduct came under my especial observation:\n\nMajor Short, R.C.A., by his plucky charge, already mentioned, no doubt saved the Gatling, and throughout the day proved himself the beau ideal of an officer. He seemed to bear a charmed life as he coolly stood in the front lines working his guns.\n\nLieutenant Oscar Pelletier, 9th Battalion, attached to \"B\" Battery, R.C.A., was wounded early in the action, whilst gallantly encouraging his men in the face of a hot fire.\n\nSergeant-Major Wattom, N.W.M. Police, was another whose brilliant example and dogged courage gave confidence and steadiness to those within the sound of his voice.\n\nConstable Ross, N.W.M. Police, our chief scout, was always ready to lead a dash or take his place in the skirmish line, in fact, he seemed everywhere and at the proper time.\n\nLieut. Brock, Q.O.R., most pluckily led the party to clear our left rear, and Sergeant McKell. Ptes. Acheson and Lloyd at the same Corps distinguished themselves by assisting the wounded to places of safety in the face of heavy fire, Pte. Lloyd himself being wounded in this duty.\n\nThe Ambulance Corps of the Queen's Own was particularly prominent in answering the numerous calls from the front for assistance, many times having to traverse ground that was raked by the enemy's fire.\n\nBrigade-Surgeon Strange, I.S.C., and Surgeon Lesslie, Q.O.R., rendered willing and valuable assistance to the wounded both on the field and in the temporary hospital that was established in the wagon laager.\n\nTo my personal staff, Lieut. Sears, I.S.C., Brigade Major and Captain Mutton, Q.O.R., Brigade Quarter Master, I owe many thanks for their boldness, promptness and assiduity in executing the orders given them.\n\nIn Lieut.-Col. Herchmer, N.W.M. Police, I had a most valuable assistant; and not only in the action of Saturday but throughout our march from Swift Current to Battleford, he displayed the most sterling qualities of a soldier; while the men of his command have time and again proved themselves as invaluable to my force.\n\nAttached I beg to hand you an official list of the dead and wounded, with the causes of their death and nature of wounds.\n\nAll the wounded are, I am glad to say, doing well at the time I write.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

TO THE REPORT OF THE MAJOR GENERAL COMMANDING.\n\n(Copy.)\n\nNORTH-WEST FIELD FORCE,\nBATOCH\u00c9, May 31, 1885.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have the honor to give you the particulars of the fighting on the 9th, 10th and 11th and the action on the 12th at Batoche, for the information of His Excellency, Lord Lansdowne, Governor General of the Dominion of Canada, and yourself. As you are aware I left my camp at Fish Creek on the morning of the 7th, having brought my left column across the river to join my right column, and having been joined by Lt.-Col. Williams, commanding the Midland Regiment, with two companies of that Corps, and a Gatling gun with Captain Howard, late U.S. Army. My force was then composed of:\n\n- \"A\" Battery, 2 guns, 86 officers and men.\n- Winnipeg Battery, 2 guns, 40 officers and men.\n- One Gatling gun.\n- 10th Royal Grenadiers, 210\n- 90th Regiment, 254\n- Detachment Midland Regiment, 81\n- Boulton's Mounted Infantry, 65\n- French's Scouts, 28\n\nTotal\u2014724\n\nThe Infantry I formed into a brigade and placed it under Lt.-Col. Straubenzie, who had joined me at the same time as Lt.-Col. Williams and the two companies of the Midland Battalion. I had also caused my A.Q.M.G. Captain Haig, R.E., to put the steamer \"Northcote\" (which had come down with stores to my Camp) in a state of defence, by means of lumber, bags of oats, etc., and having placed the \"C\" Company Infantry School on board her, under command of Major Smith, I directed her to drop down the river and anchor for the night at Gabriel's Ferry, communicate with me there, and to drop down next day, so as to be abreast of Batoche about 9 o'clock a.m., by which time I calculated I should be ready to commence my attack, and they were then to create what diversion they could in our favor, if possible to break the wire of the Batoche Ferry, and if they found they could not steam back, they were to continue on to the Hudson's Bay Crossing, south of Prince Albert.\n\nWhat was actually done by the steamer you will find described in the report of Major Smith \"C\" Company Infantry School; forwarded herewith. I may add that beside the \"C\" Company, Captain Wise, my A.D.C., whose wound would not allow of his accompanying the force, Lt. H.J. MacDonald of the 90th who was ill, and Lieuts. Gibson and Elliott of the 10th Royal Grenadiers suffering from rheumatism, with Dr. Moore and Mr. Pringle of the Medical Staff, Mr. Bedson, my chief transport officer, his clerk Vinen, and four scowmen were also on board, some of whom, as will be seen by Major Smith's report, performed valuable service.\n\nOn the morning of the 8th, having heard that the trail along the river to Batoche, was not good, and had some dangerous places on it, I marched out to\nthe eastward, and then to the north-west, and struck the regular trail from Humboldt to Batoche about 9 miles from Batoche, and camped there for the night. As soon as I had selected the spot for the camp I pushed on with some of Boulton's Mounted Infantry to within 4 miles of Batoche, without meeting any resistance, merely seeing two of the enemy's scouts, who fled on our approach, and I then selected a good spot to camp in the next day, in case I found it necessary to fall back from Batoche. On the morning of the 9th I left my camp standing, and advanced on Batoche. We arrived without hindrance to a spot within about \u00bd mile of the new Catholic church, just where the trail strikes the river bank, before turning down to Batoche. There were 3 houses between us and the church, where a number of men were seen, who fled, on two or three shells and some rounds from the Gatling being fired at them, and we advanced slowly towards the church. From a house just the other side of the church a white flag was being displayed, and I rode up to it, and found three or four Catholic priests in it, with some sisters, and a number of women and children, apparently Half-breeds. Having reassured them, I advanced cautiously, extending my Infantry and pushing back the enemy until we reached the crest of hill, which enabled me to bring the guns down, and shell the houses of Batoche, which were visible from a spot just below the crest. As the houses were of a light construction, and not very large, not much damage was done, and just then, as some shots came from across the river from a bluff along the bank, and as the spot the guns were in was completely exposed to this fire, I directed the guns to retire, and as they were doing so suddenly a very heavy fire was opened from what we afterwards found were some rifle-pits in a bluff just below where the guns had been, but which was stopped by a rattling fire from the Gatling, which was splendidly handled by Captain Howard, ably supported by Lieut. Rivers, \"A\" Battery. After some time, finding that the fire of the opposite side was again commencing, and also from the rifle-pits, and that a horse has been killed and a man hit belonging to the Gatling; I directed Captain Howard to bring his Gatling back, which he did without further loss, and the wounded man was brought in at great risks by my A. D. C. Captain Freer, \"B\" Company Infantry School, and Gunner Coyne, of \"A\" Battery. I then went off to the right of my extended line behind the church, and found the men holding their ground, but exposed to a fire from a bluff with a newly-made grave in front of it railed in with wood. I then ordered the Gatling round to try and silence their fire, which it did at first, owing probably to the novelty of this weapon, as regards the enemy; but shortly afterwards the enemy's fire was renewed, and we afterwards found that they were firing from carefully-constructed rifle-pits, which completely covered them from any fire. During this time Captain Peters, \"A\" Battery, had endeavored to drive the enemy out of the pits from whence had come the fire which caused me to retire the guns, with a portion of the Garrison Artillery of \"A\" Battery School, but the fire was too hot, and they had to retire, leaving a wounded man behind. On my returning to that part of the attack, and hearing of this, I advanced a part of the Midland Battalion down a coulee or bluff on the left, between the cemetery and the church, with orders to keep up a hot fire, so as to distract the attention of the enemy from the spot where the wounded man was lying, and also directed a part of the 90th and 10th, who were lying down in advance across the trail, to do the same, and sent down a party of the Garrison Artillery with a stretcher to bring the man back, which they did without hesitation; and to my great satisfaction.\nthey succeeded in bringing him back, without losing another man, which was what I feared, but unfortunately the man himself was dead. Our dead and wounded were temporarily placed in the church, were they were attended to by the Medical men, assisted by the Roman Catholic Sisters who kindly did all they could to help the doctors. As it was now becoming late, and I saw that, though holding our own, we were not likely to make any advance that day, it became necessary for me to decide as to where I should camp for the night, and, taking into consideration the enormous importance at that time of not even appearing to retreat even so short a distance as to where I had selected a spot for my camp I resolved to send for my tents and baggage and camp where I was, though there was no good place for it. I accordingly sent back for that purpose my second senior transport officer, Mr. Secretan, who succeeded in bringing all my old camp equipage and teams, in a remarkably short time, and having formed a Zareba with them, I then ordered the advanced parties to be gradually withdrawn, which was done very creditably, as some of the enemy followed them up, probably thinking at first that they were retreating. They were however, speedily undeceived by receiving a heavy fire from the Zareba, and though a few of them kept up a desultory fire for a short time, as darkness fell they retired, but not before, I am sorry to say, killing 2 of our horses and wounding one man in the Zareba. The piquets were then posted, a slight trench made round the Zareba, and the rest of the men lay down with their arms lining the four sides of the Zareba, each side being under the charge of a Field Officer with so many sentries on each face, who kept watch whilst the others slept, and so the night passed in quiet. The casualties this day were as follows:\u20142 men killed, one officer and 9 men wounded.\n\nMay 10.\u2014After an early breakfast I moved out the Infantry; and took up position as advanced as possible, but the enemy were in greater force than the day before, principally, as I expect, on account of the steamer having passed down the river, and held the ground about the cemetery, and also some pits which they had made during the night, just below the crest, where the Gatling had been in position the day before. Some of the enemy also had got into position at the end of a point, running out below the cemetery, and altogether we had lost rather than gained ground as compared with yesterday. I still felt it was good practice and training for my men, who were being taught, by somewhat painful experience, the necessity of using their enemy's tactics, and keeping themselves under cover. Moreover, I knew that we could afford the ammunition which (in a sort of skirmishing fight like this) was wasted on both sides, better than our adversaries, besides giving confidence to my young soldiers, some of whom, the Midland detachment, had as yet not received their baptism of fire. During the morning I had the two guns of \"A\" Battery shelling a house on the opposite bank and some bluffs where some of the enemy were seen, and in the afternoon the two guns of Winnipeg Battery shelled the cemetery, which was in possession of the enemy, and some rifle-pits from a bluff on right front of my camp. In the evening, as before, I withdrew my advanced parties, who were again followed by the enemy, but I had some shelter trenches made in front of the camp, about 200 yards in advance, in which I had a party of infantry, and on the right front some more pits nearly flanking the enemy's advance, in which I placed some men of the 90th, armed with the Martini-Henry. As the enemy approached they were received with a heavy fire from these trenches, which quickly drove them back, and though one of the enemy fired, apparently with a long-range rifle, into\nour camp, little damage was done, only one horse being touched, and his fire was speedily silenced from our camp, and again we had a quiet night. In retiring this evening the men were much steadier, and during the whole day we had one killed and five wounded, showing that the men were improving in their fighting. The weather being luckily fine as we were bivouacking, not liking to put up tents when so many horses were in the Zareba.\n\nMay 10.\u2014The Land Surveyor's Scouts, 50 strong, under Captain Dennis, joined my force in the afternoon.\n\nMay 11.\u2014Having heard that there was a fine piece of prairie ground which overlooked the houses of Batoche, and having sent our parties of Infantry to take up the old positions, I started off to reconnoitre the prairie ground, taking with me Boulton's Mounted Infantry and the Gatling. The trail to this ground went right through our camp, but as I thought it probable, that the enemy might have some rifle-pits to defend it. I regret to say that as I was leaving camp, one of the priests, Father Moulin, was brought in on a stretcher, wounded in the left thigh by a Winchester bullet fired from the cemetery by the Rebels, through the garret of the priest's house; it was luckily a flesh wound, and he was put in a hospital tent, and will go down to Saskatoon with our wounded. I took a slight detour and came on to the prairie ground a little east of the trail. I found it was a good large plain of irregular shape about two miles long and 1,000 yards in the broadest part, with a sort of slight ridge running down the centre and some undulations. We saw a good many men moving about on our left front, and fired 2 or 3 rounds from the Gatling, at the same time lining the crest of the ridge with some of Boulton's men which soon drew a pretty smart fire from the edge of the bluffs running parallel to the ridge, which we soon saw was defended by a series of rifle-pits. Leaving this party to hold the enemy, I galloped along the prairie to the northward with the men of the Mounted Infantry, and, seeing two of the enemy's mounted scouts, gave chase, but they got off into the woods, and we lost sight of them. Having pulled up myself I was returning towards the other party, when I caught sight of a man coming out of a bluff on foot, and gave chase, and on coming up found it was an Indian without arms, who said he was a priest's man, but who eventually turned out to be a Rebel who had been fighting against us. After firing for some time at the pits, I retired the force in good order and regained the camp. Here we found that we had regained all our lost ground owing to my feint on the enemy's left, which had drawn a good many of the enemy from their right to repel what they feared was a general attack, as, owing to the lay of the ground, the enemy could not see what my force was. Some of the Midland Battalion, led by Lieut.-Col. Williams, gallantly rushed to some rifle-pits beyond the cemetery, and drove the Indians, who had been left on their right out of them, capturing some blankets and a dummy which had been used to draw our fire. In the morning one gun of \"A\" Battery shelled the cemetery and pits near the church. In the afternoon I brought up two guns of Winnipeg half Battery to a spot held by the Midland advanced party, near the cemetery, from whence they were able to see to shell a house on the opposite side of the river, which was flying Riel's white flag, with some design on it, and about which a great many people were moving. The range was a long one and the material of the house so light that not much harm was done, but the people all dispersed at once and seemed to take to the woods. During that afternoon some few shots were fired from the opposite bank, but the fire was kept under and silenced by a\nparty of men posted on the ground overlooking the river on the left of the camp. In the evening my advanced parties were withdrawn to the camp as usual but the enemy hardly pursued at all; there was no firing into our camp, and our casualties of the day consisted of four wounded all very slightly. This showed that my men were becoming more at home in this mode of warfare, and though as yet we had not made much progress I resolved, to use a historical expression, \"to peg away\" until I succeeded in my object of taking Batoche, which I was sure I should do. During the day the men left behind to protect the camp and the teamsters added to the slight parapet and trenches already made, and made a traverse across the South side of the Zareba, which would have effectually prevented any shot from doing mischief in the camp.\n\nMay 12.\u2014This morning I took the whole of the mounted men in my force, about 150 men, one gun of \"A\" Battery and the Gatling, and, taking the same circuit as yesterday, took possession again of the piece of basin, and extending my force as much as possible and again engaged the rifle-pits in front of us, firing also shell and the Gatling. In the middle of our firing I saw a man riding towards me, waving a white flag. I rode forward to meet him, and found it was a Mr. Ashley, a surveyor, one of the men who had been made a prisoner by Mr. Riel. He told me he had just come from Riel, who was apparently in a great state of agitation, and handed me a letter from him in which he said, apparently referring to our shelling the houses, that if I massacred his women and children they would massacre their prisoners. I at once wrote an answer, saying that I was most anxious not to injure women and children, and that if he would place them all in one spot, and let me know where it was, I would take care that no shot should be fired in that direction. Just then another prisoner, a Mr. Jackson, came up on foot, with another white flag and a copy of the same letter above alluded to. He announced his intention of not returning, though I suggested to him that the other prisoners, among whom was his own brother, might be massacred if he did not return. However, he said they would not be touched for that, and that he was not going back, so I left him to his own devices. The other prisoner, Mr. Ashley, acted in a very different manner. He said he should go back, on the chance of being yet able to assist his brother-prisoners. He told me that they were all kept in a dark cellar, whenever anything unusual occurred; that they were all now confined in the cellar with a tremendous weight of stones on the trap-door, and that he had been taken out with Jackson especially to bring this message. Accordingly he returned with my message, and I then drew my force gradually off and retired to camp in good order, having, as I afterwards found out, convinced the enemy that I intended attacking by that way. I regret to say, however, that one of the Surveyor's Scouts was killed, having been shot through the head while lying with the rest of his troop in a bluff on our left. On regaining the camp I was much annoyed at finding that, owing to a misconception of my orders, the advanced parties had not, as I directed, been sent forward to hold the regained position and press forward, as I drew the enemy from their right by my feint; but I am now inclined to think it was a fortunate thing that they had not, for I believe the total silence and absence of fire from my left only strengthened the belief of the enemy that I was going to attack from the prairie ground. After the men had had their dinners they were moved down to take up the old positions and press on. Two companies of the Midland, 60 men in all, under Lt.-Col. Williams, were extended on the left and moved up to the cemetery.\nand the Grenadiers, 200 strong, under Lt.-Col. Grassett prolonged the line to the right beyond the church, the 90th being in support. The Midland and Grenadiers, led by Lt.-Cols. Williams and Grassett, the whole led by Lieut.-Col. Straubenzee, in command of the Brigade, then dashed forward with a cheer and drove the enemy out of the pits in front of the cemetery and the ravine to the right of it, thus clearing the angle at the turn of the river. During all this time a heavy fire was kept up from the other side of the river, which annoyed our advance. This was kept down as we best could by a few of the Midland Regiment in pits on the bank of the river, and one company of the 90th Regiment was sent to support Lt.-Col. Williams on the extreme left. The Midland Regiment and Grenadiers kept pushing on gallantly, led by Cols. Straubenzee, Williams and Grassett, until they held the edge of the bluffs, surrounding the left part of the plain, where the houses were. Just before this a most promising young officer, Lt. Fitch of the Grenadiers, was killed. At this period one of the Winnipeg Battery guns was got into position where it could shell the houses on the plain, but after two or three rounds it was disabled and a gun from \"A\" Battery took its place, and fired a few rounds, but not much damage was done, as the houses were not brick or stone. During this time I advanced the 90th so as to prolong the line of attack, and eventually brought down the Surveyor's Scouts, Boulton's Mounted Infantry and French's Scouts, and dismounting still further prolonged the line on the right. The Gatling was now ordered up in front of the 90th to take the houses in flank, which was gallantly done by Lt. Rivers, \"A\" Battery, and Capt. Howard, and after a few volleys a general advance was made, with rattling cheers, and the whole of the houses were taken, the prisoners released, and the position virtually captured. It was at this period that the late lamented Capt. French was killed by a shot from the ravine, while looking out of the window at Batoche's House. This officer's loss was keenly felt and mourned by the whole force. He had been with the force from the commencement, and he was always ready for the front, and his cheerfulness and good humor was proverbial and had a cheerful effect on the whole camp. I had already brought Capt. French's name to your notice in terms of strong commendation. A company of the Grenadiers was sent along the river on our left up to the house of the rebel Champagne, and a company of the 90th was sent well forward on the right, as a few desultory shots were fired from a ravine there, and by evening all firing ceased, and I sent up to the camp for the men's blankets and food, and we bivouacked for the night around the buildings. We found a large camp of women and children, natives and Half-breeds, on the bank of the river below Batoche's House, and a good many camped round our bivouac for the night, some remaining where they were. On inspecting the scene of action after it was over, I was astonished at the strength of the position and at the ingenuity and care displayed in the construction of the rifle-pits, a good idea of which can be gained by reference to one of the sketches by Capt. Haig, R.E., A.Q.M.G., forwarded herewith. In and around these pits were found blankets, trousers, coats, shirts, boots, shoes, food, oil, Indian articles of sleep, one or two damaged shot-guns and one good rifle. It was evident that a detachment of Rebels had lived in these pits, day and night, and it was easily understood, by an inspection of them, how perfectly safe the holders of these pits were from the fire of our rifles, and especially from the Gatling and artillery. These pits were also judiciously placed as regards repelling a front attack, but by attacking their right (which was their weakest point) and driving it in, we turned and took in reverse all their entrenchments, along\nthe edge of the prairie ground, and thus caused a rout which ended in a \"sauve qui peut.\" As it was getting dark, and my men were tired out, I did not attempt to pursue. We found 21 of the Rebels dead on the ground in the vicinity of the houses, and two dead men on the river bank below the cemetery. Also 5 wounded, of whom two were belonging to Riel's Council, two of whom were also amongst the killed. I regret to say that, as far as I can learn, Riel and Dumont have escaped, having gone off together, on our gaining the clear ground of the settlement, but I shall follow them up as soon as I learn the direction they have taken, which at present is a matter of doubt, some saying they have crossed the river, and others that they have not. I myself am inclined to think they have not crossed.\n\nMay 13.\u2014The Half-breeds were continually coming in with white flags to give themselves and their arms up, some by themselves and some with the priests. I have a list of the worst of the Rebels, and I dismiss those not in it, with a caution to return to their houses, and a warning that if hereafter any charge is brought against them they are liable to be arrested. I have now 13 prisoners, two of them being members of Riel's Council. I may remark here that among Riel's prisoners released by us was a Half-breed who looked like a white man, by name Albert Monkman. He stated that he had been made prisoner by Riel, because he suspected he was getting disaffected, which he said was the case. But I received evidence which so clearly showed that this man was deeply committed to the rebellion, and that his change of idea originated most probably from discovering that he was on the wrong side, that I arrested him also. Heard this afternoon that Riel and Dumont were on this side of the river. The Catholic priest reported this morning the following loss of the Rebels, in the 4 days fighting:\n\n1st day, 4 killed and 5 wounded. 2nd day, 2 wounded. 3rd day, 3 wounded. 4th day, 47 killed, 163 wounded. Total, 51 killed and 173 wounded.\n\nMay 14.\u2014Marched for Lepine's Crossing. Having halted for dinner, I received information that Riel was somewhere in the vicinity, so determined to make for Guardapuis or Short's Crossing, which was some miles nearer, and camp for the night.\n\nMay 15.\u2014I sent out parties of mounted men, under Major Boulton, to scour the woods. In the afternoon two scouts, Armstrong and Hourie, who had been sent out with Boulton and had moved away by themselves, came upon Riel who gave himself up, producing my letter to him in which I summoned him to surrender and promised to protect him until his case was considered by the Canadian Government. The scouts brought him into my camp, and I made a prisoner of him, as you are aware. Before bringing to your notice the conduct of the whole force, and the names of those officers whose duties during those four days, on account of their rank or appointments, necessarily brought them more prominently under my personal notice, I would here beg to be allowed, in justice to the gallant little force under my command, to draw attention to its actual strength and weapons, about which there seem to be some strange misconception not only in the English press, but even in that of the Dominion. In one of the English papers, I am represented as having been waiting at Fish Creek for reinforcement, of having asked for 1,000 more men, and as having been reinforced by the Midland Regiment, and as having fought with 1,000 men and arms superior to the enemy. The real facts\nof the case being as follows: I was waiting at Fish Creek, as you know, to get rid of my wounded, and get oats up, and not for reinforcements. Only 100 men of the Midland Regiment reached me then under Lt.-Col. Williams, and as I had lost, killed and wounded, nearly 60 men, and had to put 35 men on board the \"Northcote,\" my actual reinforcement was 5 men. As regards the actual number of men engaged out of my total force of 724 officers and men, owing to having to leave 100 men to protect my camp, leaving wounded and sick men, cooks, ammunition carriers, assistants to ambulances, etc., I was only able to bring 495 men into the engagement, and this included the artillery and Gatling which, owing to the nature of the position, were not able to do so much damage as the Infantry. So that with about 400 men we drove with heavy loss of force (taking the lowest estimation) 600 Half-breeds and Indians, many of them armed with long-range rifles, and who were considered the finest and best prairie fighters in the country, out of a strong position, carefully selected and entrenched by themselves. After this I need say no more concerning the conduct, during the engagement, of the whole force.\n\nFrom my second in command, Lt.-Col. Straubenzie, I received every assistance, and on the 12th his leading of his brigade was beyond praise. Lt.-Col. Houghton, D.A.G., showed great coolness under fire, and was in command of the Zareba during the action of the 12th. Capt. Haig, R.E., my A.Q.M.G., was very useful to me, and cool under fire; he is a most energetic and willing officer, and has been of much service to me all along, especially in rendering the Zareba safe from the enemy's dropping fire, and all other work requiring an engineer's knowledge. Lt.-Colonel Lord Melgund, who was my chief of the staff for some time, was also of great service while with me on the 9th.\n\nCaptain Young, of the Winnipeg Field Battery, Brigade Major, has done most excellent service throughout the campaign, and is deserving of great praise for the way in which he performed his staff duties. I selected him to take charge of Riel from the time he surrendered, and while he was in camp. Capt. Young slept in the tent with him and afterward conveyed him safely to Regina. My A.D.C., Lieut. Freer, 38th Regt. \"B\" Company School of Infantry Instruction, deserves great praise for the way in which he performed his duties, while continually exposed to the fire of the enemy. I have already brought to your notice the gallant way in which he went to assist in withdrawing a wounded man under the fire of the enemy. The conduct of Lt.-Cols. Montizambert, Commanding Artillery; Williams, Commanding Midland Regiment; Lt.-Col. Grassett, Commanding Grenadiers, and Major McKeand, Commanding 90th Regiment, was everything I could wish. Lt.-Col. Williams and Lt.-Col. Grassett came prominently to my notice from the gallant way in which they led and cheered their men on the left, rush by rush, until they gained the houses on the plain, the former having commenced the rush. The field officers of the different Infantry Regiments, Major Smith and Hughes, Midland, Major Dawson, Grenadiers, and Major Boswell and Acting Major and Adjt. Buchan, 90th Regt., are equally to be commended for their behavior on this and the other days. Major Smith, \"C\" Company Infantry School Corps, was doing excellent work on board \"Northcote\" under very trying circumstances, ably assisted by my other A.D.C., in spite of his wound, and Mr. Bedson, as will be seen by Major Smith's report. Major Jarvis commanding Winnipeg Field Battery and Capt. Drury, \"A\" Battery, two guns, did excellent service during the 4 days' work as well as the Gatling under Lt. Rivers, \"A\" Battery, in fighting which arm Capt. Howard, late U.S. Army, the instructor:\nin the use of the weapon, showed great gallantry and cool courage. Capt. Peters, as usual, was well to the front, covering the guns with the dismounted portion of \"A\" Battery. Lieut. Disbrowe, attached to \"A\" Battery, whom I placed in charge of the ammunition from the commencement of the march, was particularly useful and deserves great praise. Major Boulton, commanding the Mounted Infantry, who is an excellent officer full of resources, and who had been of the greatest service to me from the time he joined my force, displayed his usual coolness and courage, and on the 12th was of great use on the right by the way he disposed and led his men. Capt. Dennis, commanding the Surveyor's Scouts, did excellent service, and deserves great praise for the way in which he handled his men. Capt. French, commanding Scouts, whose loss we all deeply deplore, displayed his usual dash and courage. Great praise is due to Brigade-Surgeon Orton and his subordinates for the excellent way in which the attendance and care of the wounded men was carried out.\n\nThanks are also due to the Rev. D. M. Gordon, of the Presbyterian Church, who joined the 90th at Fish Creek Camp, and was with them during the fighting at Batoche, and the Rev. C. C. Whitcomb, Church of England, who joined the Grenadiers on the 16th of May, for their attention to the spiritual wants of the wounded and the rest of the troops. I forward herewith sketches of the position by Capt. Haig, R. E., my A.Q.M.G.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRED. MIDDLETON,\nMajor General, Com'ding N. W.

MIDDLETON,\nMajor-General, Com'ding N. W. Field Force.\nAPPENDIX C.1 TO THE REPORT OF THE MAJOR GENERAL COMMANDING.\n\n\"BATOCH\u00c9, 13th May, 1886.\n\nFrom Captain and Bt.-Major Smith, Commanding \"C\" Co. Infantry School Corps.\n\nTo Major General Middleton, Commanding Canadian Militia.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that in accordance with Field Force Order No. 1, of the 6th inst., I, on the 7th instant, proceeded with the detachment of \"C\" Company Infantry School Corps, present under my command (2 Officers and 31 N.C.O. and men) on board of the steamer \"Northcote,\" and in the afternoon dropped down to Gabriel Dumont's Crossing, where we anchored and remained till the morning of the 9th.\n\nIn addition to \"C\" Company there were on board, Mr. Bedson, Chief Transport Officer, Capt. Wise, A.D.C., wounded at Fish Creek; 3 sick Officers, viz., Lieutenant Hugh J. Macdonald, of the 90th, and Lieutenants Elliot and Gibson, of the Royal Grenadiers; Doctor Moore and Mr. Pringle, of the Medical Staff; several men of Supply and Transport Service, a newspaper correspondent, and several residents of the country, who, under protection of the Troops, were returning to their homes. All these were pretty well armed, and were able to bring about 50 rifles into action. (Two large barges loaded with supplies were in tow). After embarking I found that the vessel had been partially prepared for defence, but not, as I considered, sufficiently: so the 8th was employed in adding to the defences by piling up sacks of oats, boxes of meat, etc.\n\nEarly on the morning of the 9th we prepared to move, and all on board were assigned to their positions. Mr. Bedson was in charge of the boat and supplies, and from him the Master took his orders, and I took the general command of the Troops on the main deck. The Master was instructed to anchor a little above Batoche. He was aware that a wire cable was stretched across the river at that place, and he knew that there was a danger of its catching the boat, and he was warned to be on the lookout for it.\n\nA little after 6 a.m. we moved down stream to a point about 2 miles above Batoche, when finding that we were likely to reach that place before the hour named by you, 8.00 a.m., we anchored, and at 7.40 again moved on, and immediately afterwards the boat was fired upon from both banks of the river. For a time we did not reply, but the Rebel fire soon became hotter, and we commenced both independent and volley firing, and this we continued without intermission till some distance below Batoche, partly to keep down the opposing fire, and partly to lead the enemy to believe that our force was much larger than it really was. As we passed Batoche the fire was specially heavy, and I heard a crash as if a portion of the upper deck had been carried away. About two miles below that place the Rebel fire slackened, and I ordered the \"cease fire,\" and shortly afterwards we came to anchor. I then learned that the smokestacks and the steam-whistle had been swept down by the Ferry cable, and were lying on the deck; that the Master and the Pilot, who had both been in the wheel-house, were in a state of great trepidation; and that\nMr. Pringle, of the Medical Staff, and Vinen, a transport officer's assistant, had been wounded. Finding that we were so far down the river, I asked the Master why he had not followed his instructions, when he explained that, owing to the heavy fire, he could not manage the boat, and got on the cable before he was aware of it. I then directed him to go up stream again, but he objected that that was impossible as, the smokestacks being gone, there was danger of setting fire to the vessel, and, besides, that it was unsafe for him to go into the pilot-house. Steps were at once taken to repair this damage, and two short stacks, made from one, were got into place. That being done the next difficulty was the pilot-house. The steersman positively refused to go into it. We then persuaded him to set his carpenter at it. Material was carried up, and the carpenter was on the house, at work, when several shots came from the west shore, one of which hit him in the ankle and imbedded itself in the foot, and we found that some of the enemy had crept along the west side of the river, and, under cover of the bank, fired on every man who shewed himself on board. This put an end to the work, for, as the Master told me, it was impossible again to induce his crew to come on deck. The steam-whistle having been carried away, we were left without our means of signalling to the Troops on shore; the boat authorities would not undertake to replace it, so volunteers were called for, when private Coombes of \"C\" Company and one of the boat hands volunteered to put it up, and this they did successfully under a fire from the banks, and without, I am glad to say, any injury to themselves. In the course of the afternoon Mr. Bedson learned that one of his men had acted as a river pilot and that he would be willing to take the wheel. Accordingly we proposed to the Master that this should be done; but we were again met with objections, and after some talk we concluded that the proposed Pilot would not be able to work satisfactorily with the Engineer, so, after consultation with Mr. Bedson and Captain Wise, it was decided to remain in our present position all night, and await possible communication from you. Strong guards were then placed and every preparation made to meet any possible attack from the shore. During the night the enemy continued to fire on the boat from both banks, but we abstained from replying. On the following morning, Sunday, Mr. Bedson and I again urged the Master to move. He still pleaded the weakness of the pilot-house, but finally, with great reluctance, said that he would do so if we would make it bullet-proof. Mr. Bedson then set his men to work, with the assistance of my men, material was got up, and, in the course of the afternoon, the wheel-house was made satisfactory to the Pilot. During all this time firing from the shore continued at intervals, but as our men worked from the inside, they were not seen, and were in danger only from chance bullets. The question then was, shall we go up stream or down? We were anxious to go to Batoche. The Master said that he could not with safety go up with the barges in tow, and that he was getting out of wood and must take on more before he could remain anywhere long. We then decided to run down to the Hudson Bay Ferry, leave the barges there, take on wood and sufficient supplies for the Column, and return at once to Batoche. About 6.30 p.m., under a fire from the shore, we weighed anchor and proceeded down the river a few miles, and at dusk anchored for the night. At day-light next morning we again moved, but had little more than started when we ran on a sand bar, and were delayed some three hours. Finally, without any further mishap, we reached the Hudson Bay Ferry about 3 p.m. Here we found the steamer \"Marquis.\" She had arrived from Prince Albert that morning, and Mr. Bedson having decided to-\nbring her up the river, in company with the \"Northcote,\" steps were at once taken to complete her outfit and make her more defensible; and I directed Mr. White-Fraser, commanding the Mounted Police at that post, to send an officer in charge of her with as large a force of men as he could spare from his command. This he did, and himself proceeded in charge. My orders to both boats were to start up the river at dawn next morning but, owing to delays of one kind and another, it was 8 o'clock before we got off. On the way up the steering apparatus of the \"Marquis\" became damaged, and the \"Northcote\" had to take her in tow. This made our progress very slow, but without any further accident we reached Batoche about 8 p.m., just too late to take part in the splendid victory of yesterday.\n\nBefore closing this report, I beg to call your attention to the zeal and energy shown to Mr. Bedson on this occasion; his services were valuable in the highest degree; also to the support and advice which I received from Captain Wise, your A.D.C. His coolness and courage were remarkable. Notwithstanding his wound, he persisted in remaining in the cabin, the most exposed part of the boat, and his example did much to give confidence to all on board. The other Officers also were very active and vigilant, the N.C.O. and men worked to my entire satisfaction, and the civilians on board, except the crew, took part in the fight with a zeal which could not be surpassed.\n\nOur weakness lay in the fact that the Master, Pilot and Engineer were aliens, and that the crew were civil employees, and not enlisted men.\n\nThe wounded\u2014I am glad to say that their injuries were not serious\u2014were sent on from the Ferry to Prince Albert by waggon.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. SMITH, Capt. and Bt.-Major,\nCommanding \"C\" Co. Infantry School Corps.\"\nAPPENDIX D. TO THE REPORT OF THE MAJOR GENERAL COMMANDING.\n\nCAMP FORT PITTS, May 28th, 1885.\n\nTO MAJOR GENERAL MIDDLETON, Commanding,\n\nSIR,\n\nOn the morning of the 25th, from intelligence received from Captain Oswald, advanced scout, that the ruins of Fort Pitt were still burning, with a force of Indians in the neighborhood, I pushed on the first ten miles and reached Fort Pitt without opposition. I sent Scouts in every direction. The Reverend Canon McKay and the Reverend John McDougall crossed the river with Scouts; they reported tracks made by white women's feet, and found slippers. I immediately made preparations to cross the river. Next day I received information that Major Steele, commanding advanced Scouts to the east or north side of the river had been fired upon about ten miles distant from Fort Pitt, two Indians were killed, and their ponies captured; one of the Indians wore the Queen's medal, and is said to be the headman who commenced the outbreak at Saddle Lake. Meanwhile I had sent Major Perry with twenty Police to reconnoitre south side of the river. He is still absent. I subsequently received a report from Major Steele that the Indians were in force on his front; the Scouts counted one hundred and eighty-seven lodges. I immediately marched with all the troops at my disposal after leaving a company of the 65th to fortify and protect what remained of Fort Pitt, with the camp equipage and stores I left behind. Mustering 195 rank and file Infantry, twenty-nine Cavalry, and one gun\u2014wishing to advance quickly\u2014I used all the available wagons to carry Winnipeg Light Infantry detachment and sent 65th detachment by river on flat boat. On reaching Major Steele and his Scouts, I carried the wagons and advanced four miles and a half, and found the enemy occupying a very advantageous position, and signalling for reinforcements. I immediately attacked and drove them from their position without loss on my part. Major Steele with the North-West Police and Scouts under his command, carried the position on the left with the assistance of one company of Infantry of the W. L. I.: The field gun, under Captain Strange and Sergeant O'Connor, N. W. M. P., and manned by a detachment W. L. I., made excellent practice. I was not able to wait for the junction of the 65th who left the boats and advanced with alacrity. I followed the enemy's trail until darkness was approaching through a terribly thick and difficult country, where I could scarcely find space to corral the wagons and horses. The Force, being without tents, bivouacked under arms without camp fires.\n\nAt daybreak on the 28th I again moved forward, finding numerous traces of recent trails joining the Indian forces from every direction. About 7.30 a.m. I found the enemy occupying an impregnable position in the forks of the Red Deer and Little Red Deer, presenting a salient with natural glacis crowned with brush and rifle-pits along the crest. The Red Deer River, which expands into a muskeg, covering the front and flanks of the position which extended about three miles. I deployed the little force at my disposal, throwing forward Major Steele, W. M. I., dismounted, and Scouts, and 65th detachment under Colonel Hughes and half W. L. I. extending on their right,\nremaining in reserve. Colonel Osborne Smith commanding reserves. Major Hutton, Alberta Mounted Rifles, covering right flank, the gun under Captain Strange and Sergeant Owen made excellent practice silencing several rifle-pits. I corralled the waggons in rear. Finding the direct attack in front impracticable, I ordered Major Steele to retire his men, mount, and make a detour to endeavor to turn the enemy's right flank while occupying their attention on the front. While being absent for some time, he returned and reported the enemy's position extending for a mile and a half, with a muskeg in front impassable for his men, the enemy's position being about three in extent and defended, the Scouts informed me, by at least six hundred men, some of whom crept through the wood around me and opened fire upon the waggons corralled in rear. The Teamsters, however, under Captain Wright, 43rd Regiment, remained steady under fire. I judged it advisable to retire to more open ground. This was carried out by the Forces with perfect deliberation, the gun, under Captain Strange, firing until the last moment, the enemy's fire dying away almost; the return being covered by Major Steele's men, dismounted, we were not molested. They retired to open ground six miles distant, where they corralled the waggons and turned out the horses to graze, and cooked provisions for the men. Our loss is very slight, considering the fire we were under, the men taking excellent cover:\n\n65th Battalion:\n\nPrivate Le Mai, shot through the lungs.\ndo Margotte, wounded seriously, but not dangerously.\nConstable J. McRea, N. W. M. P., shot through the leg.\n\nAll the troops did their duty to my entire satisfaction. Thanks are specially due to Brigade Major Dale, Major Steele, Commanding Cavalry, and Colonel Osborne Smith and Colonel Hughes, Commanding Battalions, Captain Wright, Supply Officer, Major Boulton, Commanding Bridging Party. Surgeon Pennyfather made arrangements for the Field Hospital.\n\nT. B. STRANGE, Major General,\nand Colonel Commanding Field Force.\nAPPENDIX E. TO THE REPORT OF THE MAJOR GENERAL COMMANDING.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 26th May, 1885.\n\nFrom Lieut.-Col. Otter,\nCommanding Battleford Column N. W. Field Force.\n\nTo Major-General MIDDLETON,\nCommanding Militia of Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward you a report of the Force under my command from 9th April to 24th May.\n\nIn accordance with instructions received by your telegram of the 11th April to proceed: \"from Swift Current to Battleford, either by steamer or trail, with as little delay as possible,\" I at once formed a Column from the troops enumerated below.\n\nN. W. Mounted Police (1 gun) under Lieut.-Col. Herchmer.............................. 50\n(25 mounted.)\n\n\"B\" Battery R. C. A., Major Short (2 guns)................................................. 113\n\"C\" Co., I. S. C., Lieut. Wadmore............................................................... 49\nG. G. Foot Guards, Captain Todd..................................................................... 51\nQueen's Own Rifles, Lieut.-Col. Miller............................................................ 274\nScouts.................................................................................................................. 6\n\nTotal of all ranks................................................................................................. 543\n\nLeaving Swift Current on the 13th April, the march to the Saskatchewan Ferry, 25 miles, was accomplished by 3 p.m. of the next day\u2014only one steamer (\"The Northcote\") was found there, and as she was unable to transport all my men and stores down the river, I was obliged to take the alternative, viz., the trail, the other steamers expected had not then left Medicine Hat.\n\nBetween waiting for stores and waggons, and a heavy wind, which prevented the steamer from ferrying, it was the evening of the 17th before the Column had crossed the river.\n\nAt 1 p.m. of the 18th our march began in earnest, the train was a long one, for in addition to twenty-five days' rations, twenty days' oats, ten days' hay and four days' wood, I took waggons enough to carry the greater part of the Infantry.\n\nThe waggon train (200) increased the strength of the Column to 745 officers and men with 450 horses.\n\nThe distance covered the first day was only twelve miles, every one being new to the work; camping at 5 p.m. a larger or corral was formed of the waggons in the form of a square, with the horses in the centre, the guns and tents on the outside of the several faces of the square, this plan was adopted each night throughout the march.\n\nEach day's march began at 5.30 a.m., a halt being made for two hours at noon, and resuming again until 5 p.m., the Scouts and Police covered the front of the Column by day, while at night the camp was protected by outlying pickets.\n\nNo unusual occurrence took place during the march, and at 5 p.m. of the 23rd the whole Column arrived within three miles of Battleford, notification being sent to the garrison of our proximity. Scarcely had we camped than a large fire was seen in the direction of the town, and Lieut.-Col. Herchmer, with the police and Scouts, immediately went forward to ascertain the cause. It was found to be Judge Roleau's house which had been fired by a party of Indians, who retired on the approach of our party after shots had been exchanged.\nThe distance from the Saskatchewan Ferry to Battleford, 160 miles, was made in five and a half days; the presence of sufficient waggons to afford relief to those marching no doubt greatly assisted our progress, but the great anxiety of all ranks to press forward to the aid of those shut up in the Battleford Barracks was the principal incentive.\n\nAs waggons were unloaded of their stores they were sent back to the Ferry for use in the regular transport service.\n\nI have great pleasure in reporting the universal good conduct of the several Corps, and the desire at all times shown to perform the duties imposed upon them with punctuality, order and cheerfulness.\n\nI also wish to bring to your notice the efficient services rendered by the mounted detachment of the N.W. Mounted Police under Captain Neale, by Captain Mutton, Q.O.R. Brigade Quarter Master and Supply Officer, Lieut. Sears, I.S.C. Brigade Major and Mr. A.N. Armit; the Transport Officer.\n\nTo Lieut.-Col. Herchmer, N.W. Mounted Police, whom you placed upon my Staff, I am under many obligations for his ever-ready assistance and advice. To his energy and knowledge of the country is greatly due the successful issue of the march.\n\nOn the morning of the 24th the camp was moved near Government House, opposite to Battleford, and I took over the command from Inspector Dickens.\n\nThe garrison as taken over consisted as follows:\n\n- N.W. Mounted Police, Inspector Dickens .................................................. 43\n- Battleford Rifle Company, Captain Nash .................................................. 45\n- Home Guards, Captains Wyld and Scott .................................................. 134\n\nbesides which, men, women and children, to the number of 365, were living within the Barrack Square.\n\nOn the 26th, 27th and 28th I had entrenchments thrown up around Government House under the superintendence of Major Short, R.C.A., and Lieut. Sears, I.S.C., in order to secure it as an outpost, but on the 29th I sent Lt.-Col. Miller with three Companies of his Battalion to occupy the town, issuing orders at the same time for the inhabitants who were living in the Barrack Square to return to their homes.\n\nOn the 1st May the reconnaissance to Cut Knife Hill was made, a report of which has already been forwarded to you.\n\nOwing to the quantity of stores which now began to arrive from Swift Current, and the difficulty and delay in crossing them over the Battle River on the only means at hand, viz., a small scow, I was obliged to order the construction of a bridge at a cost for material and labor $550. I trust my action in this may be approved, as the time and expense saved (the ferry being a private one) has more than paid for its erection.\n\nFinding the inhabitants unwilling to return to their houses, as they did not consider the Force already sent over a sufficient protection, I moved the remainder of the Column across the river on the 8th, with the exception of one Company of the Queen's Own Rifles which, under Captain Brown, was left in occupation of Government House.\n\nA camp of the Force was formed on a common, south of the Barracks, strong outlying pickets being posted at night to give assurance of protection to the inhabitants and settlers who now moved into the town or tents adjoining the Barracks; large fatigues were employed in cleaning up and burning the refuse and litter in and about the Barrack Square, the consequence of its long occupation by so many people.\n\nParties were sent out to bring in hay, oats, etc., from the deserted reserves and settlers' farms.\n\nPatrols were daily sent up between the rivers, to the south on the Swift Current Trail to keep open the communication for supplies and to the South West; while the Scouts, of whom I had only eight, were pushed still further forward in search of information respecting the enemy. With these few Scouts it was very difficult to watch so large an extent of country properly, and both men and horses...\nwere taxed to an undue degree in the duty. On the 8th, one of my Scouts was captured by the Indians, about 30 miles from Battleford.\n\nIn all the duties the original Garrison took their share with zeal and alacrity. On the 12th May the Scouts reported Poundmaker as having moved from his last camp, presumably (as they thought) towards Sounding Lake in the South-west, but as the Prairie had been fired for miles to cover his whereabouts nothing definite was learned by them of his intention.\n\nEarly the next morning the Scouts were sent off in the direction of Sounding Lake, with orders not to return until some certain information could be obtained of the enemy's movements, they evidently failed to pick up the right trail in time, for on the 14th a supply train of twenty ox, and three horse teams was captured on the Swift Current trail, 15 miles from Battleford, at eight o'clock in the morning by a mixed party of Indians and Half-breeds, and later on the same morning a patrol of 9 men of the Police, under Sergeant Gordon, was attacked near the same place by about twenty-five Indians and obliged to retire, with a loss of one killed, Constable Elliot, and one wounded, Constable Spencer.\n\nOn the 16th the Scouts sent out on the 13th returned and reported having followed up the Indians' trail from their original camp to the Red Pheasant Reserve, which is 25 miles south-east of here.\n\nThe Indians were moving east, no doubt to join Riel, not having heard of your decisive victory at Batoche. This report was sent you by telegram, and your orders duly received and carried out.\n\nOn the 20th May the Rev. Father Cochin, a Roman Catholic priest, Chas. Bremner, and two others, who had been prisoners with Poundmaker, accompanied by the teamsters captured on the 14th inst., came into Battleford with a letter to me from the Indian Chief, which stated that he had just heard of Riel's defeat and wished to make terms. I sent back the priest with a message to the effect that you only could treat with him, and that pending your arrival I would agree to a cessation of hostilities.\n\nOn the 24th you reached Battleford and assumed command.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nW. D. OTTER, Lieut.-Col.,\nCommanding Battleford Column.\nAPPENDIX F. TO THE REPORT OF THE MAJOR GENERAL COMMANDING.\n\nBATTLEFORD, 7th July, 1885.\n\nFrom Lt.-Col. OTTER,\nCommanding Turtle Lake Column, N. W. F. F.\n\nTo Major-General MIDDLETON,\nCommanding Militia of Canada.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have the honour to report that in obedience to a telegram received from you on the 7th June with instructions \"to take as strong a force as possible and patrol the Squirrel Plains N.W. of Jack Fish Lake, to cut off Big Bear should he retreat in that direction,\" I formed a Column from the Corps below named:\n\n\"A\" Battery R.C.A., Captain Drury, with two guns ........................................... 30\n\"C\" Company I.S.C., Lieut. Wadmore ................................................................. 40\nG.G. Foot Guards, Captain Todd ............................................................................. 45\nQueen's Own Rifles, Lieut-Col. Miller .................................................................... 245\nScouts, Lieut-Sears, I.S.C ....................................................................................... 25\n\nTeams for the transport of supplies and baggage to the number of 42 under the charge of Mr. Armit, accompanied the Force.\n\nNo mounted men being available at Battleford, except five of Boulton's Mounted Infantry, I was obliged to hurriedly organize what few men could be got together as a Scout Corps, attached to which were Boulton's men, and place the whole under the charge of Lieut. Sears, I.S.C., my Brigade Major.\n\nOn the 8th the Column crossed the North Saskatchewan on the Steamer Baroness, and on the morning of the 9th began its march. The weather being very hot I adopted the plan of marching from 4 to 9 a.m., resting during the day and resuming again from 4 to 9 p.m.\n\nThree days brought us to Stoney Creek, about 55 miles from Battleford and three miles from the south end of Turtle Lake. From here we scouted the west and east sides of the lake and patrolled the plains for three days.\n\nOn the 12th our party of Scouts captured five ponies, some flour and bacon from a couple of Indians on the west side of the lake; the men escaped into the woods, but had no doubt formed a part of Big Bear's band; in fact, later on, they were captured and acknowledged to the fact.\n\nOn the 14th two Scouts came upon a camp three days old about 15 miles from the north end of the lake, the trail bearing N.E. In this camp a brush case marked \"W.J. McLean, H.B.Co.\", was found, and the camp had been composed of about 40 lodges. As this trail was through very heavy woods, the approach to it being the same description of country, I was unable to pursue with Infantry with any chance of overtaking the party.\n\nThe next day, however, we moved eastward as nearly parallel as possible with the enemy's trail, as far as Stoney Lake, from which a party was sent through the woods in a northerly direction to endeavour to find it again, but in this they were unsuccessful.\n\nOn the 16th Scouts were sent to Birch Lake, 20 miles east of Stoney Lake, who came upon a band of about 150 Salteaux Indians (non treaty) under Chief Yellow Sky. On going out to see them I found forty-three head of cattle and four horses, the property of settlers, in their possession, these I took from them; but as the Indians had no arms beyond a few shot-guns, and had not been on the war path\nI allowed them to go to Jack Fish Lake, as they wished, with the exception of five men who were implicated in the theft of cattle. No information could be got from this band concerning Big Bear, although I strongly suspected they knew something of his movements.\n\nOn the 19th I sent a courier to Col. Irvine, who returned next day with news of having seen several Indians in the vicinity of Pelican Lake, who barred his further progress. On the same day as the courier left another party was despatched to the north between Stoney and Birch lakes, which succeeded on the 21st in picking up the continuation of the trail found on the 14th; but very much reduced, moving easterly.\n\nThe next day Lieut Sears, with nearly all the Scouts, left for Pelican Lake. Sending a few to follow up the trail of the Indians, he took the remainder towards Pelican Lake to head them off. The column was moved still further eastward to Birch Lake, that being a good camp ground and a convenient base.\n\nOn the 24th, I went to Pelican Lake. Here I learned that the bush trail had been lost, the Indians separating and covering it up. Sears had been up to the South end of Green Lake, and finding Col. Irvine's Scouts gave them all the information he possessed; returning, he came upon Col. Irvine and his main body east of Pelican Lake, on the Carlton trail, to which place they had just arrived from Green Lake in search of supplies.\n\nSears with his Scouts remained in the neighborhood of Pelican Lake for a day or two longer, and then returned to camp, on the 27th, with five Indians from Big Bear's band, whom they had captured. These prisoners reported Big Bear as still in the Pelican Hills on the west side of the lake of that name, and that Little Poplar with a few lodges had gone South, intending to cross at the Elbow into the Eagle Hills. This information agreeing with conclusion arrived at by our own Scouts, Lieut Sears started again on the 27th, with a party of ten, and two of the prisoners as guides. Little Poplar's trail was struck, but five days old, and too far ahead for the now worn-out ponies of our Scouts to overtake, while Big Bear's trail, although looked for for three days, could not again be traced.\n\nThe conclusion come to was that Big Bear, who was almost alone, covered his own trail until reaching that of Little Poplar, and, watching his chance, quietly followed it some days behind.\n\nReceiving your order, on the 28th, to return to Battleford if no chance of catching Big Bear, I marched from Birch Lake on the afternoon of the 29th, leaving a part of my Scouts still in the Pelican Hills, and reached the river on the evening of the 1st July at 8 o'clock.\n\nI have again great pleasure in reporting the admirable conduct of the Corps under my command; most of our marches were in a rough country, the heat was great, and the flies most annoying, yet all exhibited the greatest good-humour and steadiness.\n\nTents were very seldom used.\n\nMy thanks are due to Lt.-Col. Montizambert, R.C.A. and Lt.-Col. Miller, Q.O.R., for their advice and assistance, always freely given, also to the officers commanding Corps who, by their ready willingness, set an example which was eagerly followed by those under them.\n\nThe energy displayed by Lieut Sears, in charge of the Scouts, was most commendable; always ready for work which taxes both the mental and physical powers of a man to their utmost, and entails no end of discomfort and hardship, he never seemed to tire or lack interest in the task given him.\n\nI must also place on record the valuable aid afforded me by Captain Mutton, Q.O.R., Brigade Qr.-Master and Supply Officer, and Mr. A. N. Armit, the Transport Officer. These gentlemen were constant and devoted to their respective duties.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nW. D. OTTER, Lt.-Col.,\nCommanding Turtle Lake Column.\nAPPENDIX G. TO THE REPORT OF THE MAJOR GENERAL COMMANDING.\n\nREPORT OF OPERATIONS OF ALBERTA FIELD FORCE FROM MARCH, 1885, TO JULY 2nd, 1885.\n\nON BOARD STEAMER NORTH WEST.\nJuly 4th, 1885.\n\nTo Major-General Middleton, C.B.,\nCommanding Canadian Militia.\n\nSir,\n\nIn accordance with instructions I have the honor to submit the following report:\n\nOn receipt of the news of the Insurrection, which was immediately followed by the removal of the N.W. Mounted Police to join Colonel Irvine, I was requested to preside at a public meeting called at Calgary to organize defence.\n\nNames were enrolled for a troop of Scout Cavalry for the District and an Infantry Home Guard for the town of Calgary.\n\nThese offers of service were sent to the Minister of Militia, and I received a telegram from him requesting me to act.\n\nA second meeting was notified for the following Saturday, to arrange for the selection of officers and other details. I was not present at that meeting, being compelled to return to my ranch on business.\n\nThere appears to have been a division of opinion at that meeting, but the next day the report that the Blackfeet were marching on Calgary caused an alarm that modified the opinion of those who held divided counsels. Major Hatton secured the names of some previously given, and obtained those of others, and submitted the offer of a Cavalry Corps to the Minister of Militia, which was accepted as the \"Alberta Mounted Rifles.\"\n\nI was surprised to find that not only were the settlers in the District absolutely without arms, but that the cow-boys and ranchmen, a class never heretofore without arms; had, though surrounded by Reserves of well-armed Indians, relied on police protection and the proximity of the railway.\n\nThe former had to be withdrawn at the first note of alarm, and the latter itself required protection as the only hope of obtaining help from the East.\n\nThe cow-boys, partially armed as they were, could not be withdrawn from the cattle district in the heart of the Indian Reserves, offering to Indian raiders, horses, and cattle, both transport and supply, that would enable an Indian rising to be prolonged indefinitely, or secure a ready sale of plundered stock by allies across the U.S. Frontier.\n\nThe High River ranch, represented by Captain Jenkins, late Rifle Brigade, Mr. Smith and others; the Pine Creek settlers, represented by Mr. Goodsell; the M.C. Ranche and Bow River Settlers, under Mr. J. Christie, M.C.R., formed mounted patrols.\n\nHaving received a telegraphic order from Major-General Middleton to assume command of the Alberta District, I communicated with Captain Cotton, N.W.M.P., commanding at Fort McLeod, and Captain Stewart, who acted energetically in raising Ranch Cavalry, to patrol to Medicine Hat and Frontier.\n\nCaptain Cotton placed Fort McLeod in a state of defence as a refuge for families from the neighborhood, stationed couriers between McLeod and Calgary, and assisted me by every means in his power, sending at my request, a fieldgun with a picked detachment of N.W.M.P. under Inspector Perry to join the Column. I\nwas preparing by Major-General Middleton's orders to march on Edmonton, where\nthe settlers had flocked, abandoning farms in the neighborhood as far as Victoria\nand Beaver Lake.\n\nFrom these districts I received messages imploring assistance, the Indians\nhaving risen, destroying farms, and plundering all food supplies from the Red\nDeer, Battle River, Peace Hills, Beaver Lake, Saddle Lake and Frog Lake where\nthey had committed atrocious murders.\n\nThe Department of the Interior having allowed me to avail myself of the\nservices of Captain Hamilton of the N. W. M. P., and the Minister of Militia\nhaving authorized me to apply to Mr. Hardisty, H. B. Co., by the assiduous efforts\nof these gentlemen I was enabled to collect transport and supplies.\n\nThe Scout Cavalry, so necessary to a Force feeling its way through 600 miles\nof difficult country, was organized by Major Steele, N. W. M. P., who with 20\npolice formed a nucleus to which was added the Scouts under Captain Oswald\nand the Alberta Rifles under Major Hatton.\n\nThe supply of arms, ammunition and saddlery was a great difficulty and cause\nof delay. The demands on the Militia Department from many quarters simultane-\nously were, no doubt, difficult to meet; Winchesters required for Cavalry were not\nin stock and could not at first be secured.\n\nOn the 10th April I received a telegram from the C. P. R. Agent at Gleichen\nthat the employees were leaving their posts, and refused to remain unless protected\nby troops. The men on C. P. R. construction in the Mountains had also struck\nwork, and Major Steele and his Detachment were detained to protect C. P. R. stores.\nThe same day a Detachment of as many of the Alberta Mounted Rifles as could be\narmed and equipped were sent to guard the Railway and watch the Blackfoot\nReserve at Gleichen.\n\nOn the 12th the 65th Battalion of Voltigeurs arrived at Calgary. They were\nencamped and occupied with drill and target practice until sufficient transport could\nbe collected for advance of even half the Regiment.\n\nA portion of the camp equipage having been left behind, Col. Ouimet obtained\nleave to return and complete arrangements and more fully to explain the situation\nto the Minister of Militia. He subsequently rejoined his Battalion and rendered\ngreat assistance by maintaining the line of communication and supply at Edmon-\nton, as well as providing for the safety of Lac la Biche district.\n\nOn the night of the 14th an attempt was made to run off Major Walker's horses\nclose to Calgary, and his men were fired at. I issued orders to guards to fire on\nparties attempting depredations.\n\nAn attempt was also made by a few Crees from the Blackfoot Camp to run off\nhorses from the M. C. C. Ranche. They fired on the Ranche Home Guard, one of\nwhom returned the fire, and dropped an Indian from his saddle, who was carried\noff by one of his comrades. The marauders abandoned the horses, which were\nrecovered.\n\nSubsequently a band of the M. C. C. horses were stampeded into a slough and\n13 were smothered. This is a common method to secure unbroken horses among\nIndians. Complaints were also made of Bloods killing a steer of J. G. Baker's, and\nthe Sarcees killing stock belonging to Mr. Livingstone.\n\nChief Crowfoot though, perhaps, personally sincere in his professions of loyalty,\nwas unable to control all the young-men of his tribe, and the Bloods, Blackfeet and\nPiegan, joined by U. S. Indians, would no doubt have risen had the troops sus-\ntained a reverse.\n\nUnder the circumstances it was inadvisable to denude the cattle country of\ntroops, and an order was, therefore, sent to Lt.-Col. Osborne Smith, commanding\nWinnipeg Light Infantry, to leave Detachments at Crowfoot and Gleichen, to\nguard the C. P. R. and watch the Blackfoot Reserve as well as Trails from the\nNorth, relieving Detachment of Alberta Mounted Rifles. A Company under Capt.\nValency was also marched to Fort McLeod, to compensate for the Detachment\nN. W. M. P. who had marched with a field gun to join the Column under my com-\nmand.\nThe settlers from the Red Deer River, under the Revd. Mr. Gaety and Mr. Beatty, brought in their families to Calgary, reporting their houses and stores raided by Indians. I issued a few stand of rifles to the refugees and they returned to Red Deer with the escort of a party of 15 Scouts under the command of Lieut. Coryell.\n\nThe Rev. John McDougall of Morley offered his services with four Stonies. He pushed through to Edmonton to assure the settlers that I was advancing with all possible speed.\n\nThe Indians of Ermine Skin and Bobtail's Bands, whose reserves bordered the line of march, had already plundered the H. B. Stores and missions, but subsequently expressed repentance, through Father Scullen, who had courageously remained at his post among them.\n\nFather Lacombe also volunteered his services and accompanied the Rev. Mr. McDougall. These gentlemen warned the Indians that their only chance of pardon for past offences lay in future good conduct. Lieut.-Governor Dewdney also communicated with them through Father Scullen.\n\nSoon after arrival of the 65th an unusually severe snow-storm for this time of year still further delayed the collection of transport and the advance of Lieut.-Coryell's party, seven out of ten of whom became snow blind.\n\nOn the 17th the W. L. L., under command of Lieut.-Col. Osborne Smith, arrived and encamped at Calgary.\n\nThe next day, carriage being detailed for Capt. Valency's Company W. L. L., they marched for Fort McLeod, with detachment Alberta Mounted Rifles as Scout escort under Lieut. Lander.\n\nPreparations being complete for transport for 15 days' provisions and forage for Right Wing 65th Regiment, under Col. Hughes, and Major Steele's Scout Cavalry being reported equipped, the Force was ordered to march on the following day, the 20th.\n\nOrders were given to Lieut.-Col. O. Smith (who remained in command at Calgary, as Major-General Strange accompanied the first advance) to push forward the Left Wing 65th Regiment as soon as practicable under command of Major Perry, N. W. M. P., with police detachment and field gun. Col Osborne Smith, with remainder of his Battalion, and Alberta Rifles, under Major Hatton, to follow as soon as equipped. The saddles for this corps were long in arriving, and when they did arrive were found to be unserviceable, and were condemned by a board of officers. Nevertheless they had to be patched up and used in default of others. Col. Osborne Smith lost no time in carrying out his instructions and following by rapid marches.\n\nOn the 20th April the advance force, under my personal command, composed of 4 Companies 65th Battalion, 160 strong, under Lieut. Col. Hughes, and Major Steele's Cavalry, consisting of 20 N. W. M. P. and 40 Scouts, with Major Dale, late Madras Fusiliers, as Brigade Major, &c., Lieut. Strange, A.D.C., Captain Wright and Staff Sergeant Rum, 43rd Regiment Transport and Supply, Mr. Allon, Head Waggon Boss, now left Calgary.\n\nThis small force had to guard a long line of 175 waggons and carts, which at times unavoidably extended a distance of 1\u00bd to 2 miles.\n\nThat it reached its destination in safety is, I believe, due to the precautions taken, and especially the careful scouting of Major Steele's force, as a handful of Indians could have easily stampeded horses not carefully guarded, and inflicted heavy loss on a force of 160 Infantry trying to guard a convoy of such magnitude, marching with difficulty through the swamps and forests north of Red Deer.\n\nThe teamsters were unarmed, there being no arms available for them at Calgary. The waggons were corralled in a circle every night, and out-posts placed according to the character of the ground.\n\nThe train occupied some time in crossing the Bow River and camped at Nose Creek.\n\nOn April 21st marched and camped at McPherson's Coulee, when a heavy snow-storm came on making it difficult to find the trail.\nThe snow-storm continued the next day, but the march was not delayed in consequence.\n\n22nd.\u2014The Column camped at Scarlett's that night.\n\n23rd.\u2014On the following day the march was resumed, the force camping 6 miles south of Low Pines.\n\n24th.\u2014Reaching the Forks the next day and the banks of Red Deer River the day after, the 25th; on arriving at Red Deer the river was found much swollen.\n\nThe heavy swamps through which the waggons had in some cases even to be dragged by the men, the horses finding no footing, severely taxed the energies of the 65th, who, however, worked cheerfully.\n\nBy raising waggons and staying up on bolsters the river was successfully crossed on the 26th, a few carts only being swept away by the strength and depth of the stream, but all were subsequently recovered, though the provisions they contained were damaged. As the bush was too dense for Cavalry to scout with any effect the 65th were first pushed across and advanced in extended order searching the woods, Indian signal fires showing that our movements were closely watched. The Cavalry, under Major Steele, forded subsequently.\n\nOn the 27th marched and camped at Blindman's River. A pioneer bridging party, consisting of picked axemen of the 65th, under Captain Wright, 43rd Regiment and 3 scouts Cavalry, under Sergeant Borrowdaile, were sent in advance, doing excellent service, bridging creeks, corduroying and bushing muskegs, and in some places cutting fresh roads through the woods.\n\nOn the 28th the march was again continued, and on the 29th Battle River was the camping-ground. Here I was met by Father Scullen with Ermine Skin and Bobtail. I did not shake hands or receive the Chiefs, but gave them to understand through Father Scullen, that their treatment by Government would depend on their conduct for the future. The Rev. Father Lacomb, Mr. and Mrs. Glass and Mr. and Mrs. Nelson also came into camp, the latter reporting their property had been plundered by Indians, the H.B. agent reporting the same.\n\nThe force reached Pipestone Creek on the 30th, and on the 1st May crossed the Saskatchewan with the waggon train, and entered Edmonton, camping near the H.B. Fort.\n\nOn the 2nd, the flat boats being built, as had been previously arranged through the Rev. J. McDougall, were inspected, and it was found that no time had been lost. Extra hands were secured, through Mr. McDougall, H.B. Factor, including all skilled carpenters and the Volunteers under Captain Stiff, which body had done good service in garrisoning the H.B. Fort until my arrival. Troops not employed on fatigue unloading stores were at Target Practice. The Cavalry horses, being only partially broken, had also to be steadied to the sound of firing.\n\nSupplies which had arrived by waggons had been unloaded and placed in H.B. Mill by bank or river for transhipment to scows when ready.\n\nExtra supplies and forage were obtained by Captain Wright, Supply Officer, as speedily as possible, but there was a very small stock of provisions in Edmonton, H.B. Co. Factor McDougall reporting that he anticipated a famine in the district, and also far north, so many H.B. Co. stores having been raided and communication with northern points interrupted, orders were sent to H.B. Co., Calgary, for further supplies.\n\nTransport was reorganized, part being sent back to assist Major Perry, and the remainder prepared for the forward march of Major Steele's Cavalry and two companies 65th Regiment, under Capt. Pr\u00e9vost, towards Victoria.\n\nConsiderable delay was caused on the evening of the 5th when Major Steele's Column was preparing to move, by the Teamsters refusing to advance without arms, but the difficulty was eventually overcome by promise of some on arrival at Victoria, beyond which place the Teamsters positively refused to go unarmed. Arms, having been telegraphed for before leaving Calgary, were expected.\n\nMajor Perry arrived on the 5th with remainder of Left Wing 65th Regiment (having left half a Company at Red Deer), 9 pounder gun and party of 20 men,\nN.W.M.P. His teams crossed the river and unloaded on bank ready for transhipment to boats. One Company of the 65th was ordered to Garrison Fort Edmonton and one Fort Saskatchewan, where only 10 police remained under Major Grisbach. The Artillery ammunition having been 12 years in store at McLeod it was necessary to try it, which was done. It proved serviceable. 65th Regiment at skirmishing drill on the 6th and the remainder of the transport was arrayed, part to return and assist Lt-Col. Smith, the balance to proceed with remainder of 65th to Victoria.\n\nOn the 7th one Company of the 65th marched to Battle River and half a Company to Peace Hill Farm. Arrangements were made for the completion of the defences of Fort Edmonton, calkers and boat builders attached to the garrison of Fort Edmonton.\n\nOn the 8th Lt-Col. Hughes with the remainder of the 65th marched towards Victoria, and on that day and the following the defences of Fort Edmonton were completed, shelter trenches dug and balance of supplies and forage drawn in.\n\nLt-Col. Osborne Smith and the Winnipeg L.I. with the Alberta Rifles and a further convoy of stores arrived on the 10th May; and on the following day the W.L.I. and Alberta Rifles carried on target practice. The whole of the troops under my command being recruits, and the horses or the Cavalry being unused to fire, it was necessary to utilize by target practice and drill any spare time while boats were being built and supplies collected.\n\nChief Factor McDougall rendered me every assistance, but it was difficult to obtain reliable boatmen and pilots. I was compelled to discharge the first set hired, they allowing the boats to sink for want of baling. Half-breeds were the only men acquainted with the river, and their friends established such a scare as to the certainty of the boats and men in them being destroyed by fire from the banks, that it was difficult to obtain boatmen, and I regret to state that a letter forwarded to me by Lt-Col. Osborne Smith, condemning the construction of the boats together with request for a board to try experiments on the penetration of flour sacks, the only means available for the protection of the men in the boats, and finally a request to be allowed to condemn a large proportion of the ammunition issued to the troops, increased the difficulties of the situation and caused delay. The protest against the boats was met by ordering a board to assemble and take evidence of experienced H.B.Co. navigators and boat builders; the penetration of flour sacks was relegated to hostile bullets, and the objectors to the quality of the ammunition advised to retain their fire for short ranges.\n\nOn the 12th board assembled and reported boats fit, but some few additional ties were added, and the troops held in readiness to embark. The transport wagons and all horses, except six horses for the gun team, were sent forward to Victoria under escort of detachment N.W.M.P.\n\nA Half-breed of Labucan settlement having been reported as lately returned from Poundmaker's camp, and letters from Riel's camp produced, the Half-breed was arrested by Capt. Constantine, W.L.I., and subsequently another implicated by the examination of the first as in communication and sympathy with Riel was also arrested. Major Grisbach, with Major Hatton's troops, was ordered to the Labucan settlement to make further arrests considered necessary, but this was not effected.\n\nOn the thirteenth a stormy gale postponed the embarkation of the troops, but all stores, &c., were embarked so as to afford a maximum of cover to the troops from plunging rifle fire from the commanding banks of the river. Loopholes were cut so as to allow elevation and utilize the fire of the troops on board.\n\nThe next day, 14th, Major General and Staff with W.L.I. and supplies embarked and dropped down the river with 9 pounder gun and horses in 5 scows, Scouts in canoes leading the advance. A ferry boat, formerly in use at Clover Bar, had been purchased, with wire rope, windlass and appurtenances. The ferry boat gave command of both banks, enabling the forces to be thrown across and operate on either side of the river, as might be found necessary.\n\nThe land force moving by the north bank of the river, keeping communication open by the Scout Cavalry as far as practicable, so as to endeavor to effect a junc-\ntion within striking distance, and yet not so close to the enemy as to jeopardize the embarkation. The Force under my command proceeding eastward and the Battleford Column westward until we should open communication and attack from both sides either Poundmaker or Big Bear, or both united, as the case might be.\n\nThis plan I submitted to you and obtained your approval.\n\nPassed Fort Saskatchewan on the morning of the 15th, when I landed and inspected Fort. There was heavy snowstorm last night and this morning. Landed half-breed prisoners, whom I handed over to Major Grisbach, N.W.M.P., and dropped down river, the men working willingly at the sweeps to increase the speed of the boats.\n\nReached Victoria next day, the 16th, and disembarked, having to await arrival of Major Hatton with remainder of Cavalry. Boat with horses sank at starting, but was raised and brought on, the horses being swum across the river and sent overland.\n\nPecan, chief of Crees, who had resisted attempts of Big Bear to induce him to join rebellion, sent in messenger requesting interview, as one of his men killed one of Big Bear's emissaries, and he dreaded reprisals.\n\nOrdered Fort Victoria to be placed in a state of defence; and settlers who had abandoned farms coming in I enrolled them as a home guard under the Rev. Mr McLachlan, Methodist Minister, who offered his services.\n\nOn the 17th messengers came in from Pecan and through the Rev. J. McDougall, as interpreter, I enquired whether he would spare any of his men as Scouts. Major Steele with Scout Cavalry moved out to Saddle Lake. The following day Pecan came into camp, and after an interview with him, he replied that he must consult his band, as to whether he should assist us. Troops occupied in drill and constructing anchors for boats.\n\nHeavy rain on the 19th. Report from Major Steele that advanced party of Scouts under Lt. Corryell had not been heard from and must be short of provisions. Report of their capture, but not authenticated. Waiting for reply from Pecan and news of Major Hatton.\n\nPecan came into camp on the 20th and reported that his people would not accompany us as Scouts, Major Hatton's Cavalry also having been reported close to the force, left Victoria; the 65th embarking in flotilla, W.L.I. Cavalry and Artillery by land.\n\nHaving camped at Vermillion Creek, on the night of the 21st, Saddle Lake was reached next day. That evening Lt. Corryell returned with Scouts and party of Cavalry sent to get communication with boats, reported that 65th outposts had opened fire on a few Indian Scouts near the bank. Sergt. Borrodaile and Scout Scott volunteered to go to Battleford in canoe, and open communication with Col. Otter's Force. They were sent. Major Hatton's Cavalry rejoined on the 23rd at the camp at Dry Rump Creek, which was reached that day.\n\nThe Force camped at Moose Hill Creek on the 24th and arrived at Frog Lake on the 25th, where the murdered bodies found were hastily buried. As report came in from Captain Oswald, commanding Advanced Scouts, that Indians were near Fort Pitt and that he required immediate assistance, I pushed off at once with Major Steele's Cavalry and Major Perry's detachment with Field Gun, leaving Col. Smith to follow with W.L.I., at the same time sending orders to 65th to drop down by boat parallel to us. Having started after noon we reached Pitt the same evening.\n\nOn the 26th fatigue parties were at once detached to clean out the two buildings remaining and put them in a state of defence as depot for stores.\n\nAs the whereabouts of Big Bear's band was not known, whether a junction had been formed with Poundmaker, Scouts were sent in every direction. Major Perry with 20 Police accompanied by Canon McKay and Reverend J. McDougall as Scouts, were ferried across the river. They reported trail shewing late passage of river with carts opposite Fort Pitt. They found tracks of white women's feet and slippers and what appeared evident signs of the McLean family having been taken over.\nImmediate steps were taken to stretch the wire rope across the river to pass troops. Half-breed Scouts were sent further east across the river to make sure that Big Bear had not crossed and turned in that direction, and Major Steele's Cavalry were sent west on our side of the river to reconnoitre.\n\nThey followed a heavy trail which first went west and then north circling round about 30 miles. It brought them after night fall within 3 miles of Pitt on the river bank. Here they were fired on by the enemy's Scouts and one Indian killed, who wore the Queen's medal, being the headman who started the outbreak at Saddle Lake; and two ponies were captured.\n\nOn receiving this intelligence from Major Steele on the evening of the 27th and that the enemy were in his Front, and that the Scouts had counted 187 lodges, I immediately marched with all the troops at my disposal, leaving a Company of the 65th under Captain Giroux to fortify and protect what remained of Fort Pitt. Camp equipage and stores I left behind, marching without tents. I had only 3 days' rations, no supplies having reached me since I left Edmonton, and the Force was on reduced rations.\n\nMy Force consisted of 197 Infantry Rank and File and 27 Cavalry and one 9-pounder M. L. R. gun. Wishing to advance quickly I used all available waggons to carry W. L. I. detachment and sent 65th detachment down river in flat boats to effect junction within striking distance of enemy. On reaching Major Steele I corralled the waggons under Captain Wright; I could not spare a guard to leave with them, but the Teamsters were mostly armed.\n\nAdvancing about 4 miles I found the enemy occupying a very advantageous position on a thickly wooded ridge from which they were signalling. I immediately extended and attacked and drove them from the position without loss on our part. Major Steele with N. W. M. P. and Scouts under his command carried the position on the left with the assistance of one Company W. L. I. The remainder of the W. L. I., under Col. Osborne Smith, were extended to the right. It was difficult to maintain a connection with such a small Force in the dense bush in which we found ourselves. The 9 pounder gun had to follow the trail and made good practise. As the enemy shewed themselves on the hill, I was not able to wait for the junction of the 65th who, however, left their boats and advanced with alacrity on the first sound of the firing, leaving their uneaten dinners behind them.\n\nI followed the enemy's trail, until darkness was approaching, through very dense wood and difficult country, where we could scarcely find space to corral the waggons and horses.\n\nAfter scouting a short distance in advance, the Force bivouacked round the corral, without tents, under arms; extinguishing camp fires after cooking, and posting a circle of sentries and picketing the horses.\n\nThe 65th had no blankets, great coats or rations, having left everything in the boat, and their comrades in the W. L. I. had little to share with them.\n\nAt day break on the 28th I again moved forward towards Frenchman's Butte, finding numerous trails joining the enemy's Forces from every direction. About 6.30 a.m. we found the enemy occupying an apparently impregnable position, presenting a salient hill, forming a bare glacis slope, entirely exposed to fire from rifle pits, in thick bush extending along the crest. The creek expanding into Muskeg covered the front and flanks of the position, which extented about two miles.\n\nHaving reconnoitred to the edge of the creek without being fired on, as the enemy wished apparently to draw us into an ambuscade, I returned to the crest of the hill and brought up the gun which opened fire and quickly drew a heavy response, and I deployed the small Force at my disposal, throwing forward Major Steele's Police and Scouts dismounted down the hill to a fringe of willow brush near the edge of the creek. The 65th, under Lt-Col. Hughes, with two Companies W. L. I. under Major Thibeauveau, extended on their right. The two Companies W. L. I. under Lt-Col. O. Smith on the hill in support, Major Hatton, Alberta Mounted Rifles, covering right flank where the wood was thickest.\n\nThe field gun under Lt. Strange and Sergeant O'Connor, N.W. M.P., did good work silencing some of the rifle pits, and changing its position to enfilade im-\nsuccession each face of the hill and rifle pits. It was subsequently ascertained that six at least of the enemy were torn by shells which exploded in the pits.\n\nThe waggons were corralled close in rear of the fighting line, the only space available in the dense bush with which we were surrounded.\n\nConsidering direct advance impracticable across the Creek, swamp and open places in face of the fire, from which my men were already beginning to suffer, I rode down to Major Steele's position in the willows and he reported it was impracticable for his men to cross. Constable McKay was here wounded.\n\nI then ordered him to withdraw, return to his horses and make a detour under cover of the bush to our left to see if he would turn the enemy's position.\n\nMeanwhile the extended Infantry kept up a slow but steady fire to occupy the attention of the enemy. I had very little gun ammunition, only 22 rounds common shell remaining, though the fire had been purposely slow and steady.\n\nAfter some time Major Steele reported that the enemy's position extended about a mile and a half, and that he could find no way of turning it, reporting their strength at probably six or seven hundred. I sent, therefore, an order for him to return. Subsequently he informed me that he could have crossed his men on foot, if he had a Company of Infantry to guard his horses. I had not Force available that I could have detached for such a purpose.\n\nBy this time Major Hatton reported the enemy on our right, circling round our rear and firing into the corral, which I ordered to be retired out of fire. This was done steadily by the Teamsters under Captain Wright. Major Dale, Brigade Major, directing Major Hatton to cover the retirement in rear and flank.\n\nLt.-Col. Osborne Smith expressed his opinion as to the hopelessness of further advance, there being no space on the opposite side to maintain ourselves should we succeed in reaching it, with the handful of men at our disposal.\n\nI did not think it advisable to sacrifice more men for more than doubtful results as I was hourly expecting reinforcements from Battleford, or an advance from that direction in the enemy's rear, when a complete capture could have been effected, which it was impossible for me to accomplish. I was more impelled to this course as I was assured by Major Steele that the Half Breed guides were confident that the enemy would not evacuate the position unless surrounded, as there was a lake in rear and pasture for their animals.\n\nThe wounded men, Privates Le Mai, shot through the body, and Marcotte seriously but not dangerously wounded of the 65th Regiment, and Constable McKay, N. W. M. P., were brought up from the foot of the hill by the stretcher party and attended to by Surgeon Pari and the Rev. Father Prevost, of the 65th Regiment, under a smart fire. They were put into the ambulances and quietly moved to the rear. The retirement was carried out deliberately, the gun firing to the last moment, and Major Steele's Scouts extended dismounted in rear, a small party of whom were stationed to watch the enemy's movements, who on their return reported that about 20 of the enemy had come down into the valley as they were leaving.\n\nI retired to open ground about six miles distant where the waggons were corralled, the horses turned out to graze, and the men allowed to cook, the 65th had had but little food or rest since leaving their boats the day previously; they had further to march down to their boats before night fall.\n\nOn reaching the river the boats could not be found as the Pilot on hearing the sound of firing dropped behind an Island for concealment. Lt.-Co'. Osborne Smith also urged a return to Pitt, as his men were suffering from want of tents during the rainy weather which then prevailed, so after a couple of hours rest I moved on to Pitt, which was about 5 miles distant, where I could better dispose of the wounded and get the communication shortly expected from Battleford.\n\nAll the troops did their duty steadily to my entire satisfaction. My thanks are specially due to Major Dale, Brigade Major, Major Steele, commanding Cavalry, Lt. Col. Smith & Hughes, commanding Battalions, Capt. Wright, Transport Officer, Lt. Strange, A. D. C., and Surgeon Pennefather, who made arrangements for the field hospital, and Surgeon Pari.\nAfter my arrival in Camp I sent two couriers in canoes to look for 65th barge and push on with despatches for General Middleton. They encountered steamer coming up from Battleford with supplies but without reinforcements, for which it returned at once.\n\n29th May\u2014Captain Dudley Smith's Company W. L. I. arrived with provisions from Edmonton by scow. Half-breed Scouts under orders given to Major Steele were ordered to watch the enemy. He subsequently reported that this duty had been negligently performed.\n\n30th May\u2014Marched east from Pitt towards Frenchman's Butte and camped, sending out Scouts.\n\n31st, Sunday.\u2014Held divine service, very heavy rain. Scouts report Indians in vicinity of Camp, but Major Steele considered their information unreliable, he however still holding to his opinion that the enemy had not evacuated their position.\n\nJune 1st\u2014Cavalry were sent out in a body under Major Steele to reconnoitre, small bodies of Scouts being unwilling to go, and found the enemy's position abandoned. The whole force then pushed on on Big Bear's trail, camping about two miles north of his old entrenchment; over 300 rifle pits and trenches were counted, and an admirable ambuscado found arranged, had we carelessly followed their trail which lead through a ravine flanked with rifle pits on the left of their position.\n\nJune 2nd\u2014Examined trails and found seven converting into two. Message from General Middleton that he would be in camp with reinforcements. Fatigue parties collecting waggons, flour, tools, etc., left by Big Bear.\n\nMajor Dale brought released prisoners into camp, Revd. Mr. and Mrs. Quiney, Messrs. Cameron, Halpin and Dufresne and five Half-breed families.\n\nOrdered Major Steele with Cavalry to follow what appeared to be Big Bear's trail with McLean family.\n\nMr. McKay, H. B. Co., with 10 Alberta Mounted Rifles and Scouts followed other trail and released Mrs. Gowanlock and Delaney and other prisoners, taking them with about 36 of Big Bear's band as prisoners into Fort Pitt.\n\nJune 3rd\u2014Major Gen. Middleton arrived in Camp. Infantry moved out, on Onion Lake trail, that followed by Steele reported impracticable for waggons.\n\nJune 4th\u2014Steele's courier arrived 2 a.m., reporting engagement, 3 wounded, Sergt. Fury, N. W. M. P., and Scouts Fish and West. I have forwarded Major Steele's despatch.\n\nAs you determined to follow Steele with Cavalry, I followed with Infantry, reached Camp, at Stoney Creek, and marched to Frog Lake, which I reached on the 5th.\n\nJune 6th\u2014Marched and camped at Duck Lake. Scouts reporting Indians at H. B. Co. store. I pushed forward with 15 Cavalry, reached store, 6 miles from Beaver River. I secured 80 bags of flour and some bacon.\n\nWas followed by 65th and W. L. I. marching by night. The 65th handled the 9 pounder and horses through an almost impassible muskeg with cheerful alacrity.\n\n7th June\u2014Infantry arrived in the morning at H. B. store when I pushed on with Cavalry for Beaver River, finding 100 sacks of flour. Anticipating your orders I advanced and seized it as Big Bear was making for it. Found trail of Chippawayans having just crossed river. They had carried canoes to other side, but I had orders from you not to cross river.\n\nOn the 8th the Infantry arrived, and strong pickets were posted to watch river bank and Chippawayan trail, through the woods from the East.\n\n9th\u2014Priest, Father LeGoff, arrived in camp, having been prisoner with Big Bear. I sent him back with order to Chippawayans to come into camp and surrender unconditionally and lay down arms. If not complied with in 24 hours that every house on reserve except mission would be burnt. Father Pr\u00e9vost accompanied Father LeGoff. The Chippawayans came into camp and surrendered their arms within the given time; 33 men surrendered with rifles and guns, the women and children came into camp after. Some were employed as Scouts, 2 sent down river in canoes to report any signs of Big Bear crossing, one Co. W. L. I. posted at H. B. store to guard flour and watch trail.\nOn the 10th Midland Battalion, under Lt.-Col. Williams, ordered to join my Force. Sent him orders to watch trail round Frog Lake.\n\n11th.\u2014Court of Enquiry ordered to examine the Chippawayan prisoners. Found 8 guilty of being ring-leaders and inciting to rebellion, the whole had fought against us.\n\n14th.\u2014Gen. Middleton having abandoned Big Bear's trail, brought his Cavalry to our camp, Capt. Constantine with 4 men volunteered to follow Chippawayans' trail till it met that of Big Bear and send information, but running short of provisions he had to make for Fort Pitt.\n\n15th.\u2014Major Steele and Cavalry Regiment obtained permission for Lieut.-Col. Smith to cross Beaver River with 100 men, to endeavor to cross Cold Lake with Chippawayan canoes, to reach Lac des Isles, where it was thought Wood Crees would rendezvous, or Big Bear attempt to move north.\n\n16th.\u2014Commenced cutting wood along Chippawayan trail towards Loon Lake.\n\n17th.\u2014Major Steele's Cavalry patrolled to Duck Lake.\n\n18th.\u2014Scouts brought word that McLean and family with Wood Crees were at Lac des Isles, and was anxious to surrender and release prisoners.\n\n19th.\u2014Gen. Middleton left for Fort Pitt, Major Steele returned, Canon McKay with provisioned canoes to bring in McLean's family, but Gen. Middleton sent for them by other route to come to Pitt. During stay at Beaver River 2 boats and one scow were built and another scow commenced in case of an expedition being started down the Beaver. Remained at Beaver River expecting surrender of Wood Crees, order to return to Fort Pitt, and left on 24th for Frog Lake Crossing. 65th Regiment marched 35 miles in one day, embarked for Fort Pitt in steamer, remained at Fort Pitt till Force was broken up. 65th embarked for Montreal by steamer via \"Lake Winnipeg.\" W. L. I., except 50 men returning to Winnipeg, remained at Fort Pitt under Lieut.-Col. Smith.\n\nCavalry under Major Steele marched for Calgary via Edmonton, N. W. M. P. remaining at Fort Pitt.\n\n9 pounder gun joined Col. Herchmer. Commanding Staff embarked for Winnipeg.\n\nWhen all ranks did their duty it seems invidious to select, but it is manifest that the success of a general is mainly due to his staff and commanding officers.\n\nI therefore beg especially to bring to notice Major Dale, late Madras Fusiliers, Brigade Major and Quarter Master General. The supply officers and transport at the base and with the Force Captains Hamilton, N. W. M. P., and Wright, 43rd Regiment, vigorously seconded as they were by Lt.-Cols. Ouimet and Amyot, commanding respectively at Edmonton and Calgary, and by Messrs. Hardisty and McDougall, H. B. Co.\n\nMajor Steele and his Cavalry were the eyes, ears, and feelers of the Force, and their spirited pursuit of Big Bear crowned with success the long and weary march they had protected and to a certain extent guided. The Reverend J. McDougall and Canon McKay were, from their large and intimate knowledge of the country, usefully connected with this Force.\n\nThe steady endurance of the Winnipeg L. I., under Lieut.-Col. Osborne Smith, and the cheerful alacrity of the 65th, under Lieut.-Col. Hughes, each happily illustrated the military instincts of the two warlike races composing the Dominion of Canada.\n\nThat the 9th Battalion were not more actively employed in no way detracts from the honor due to soldiers who did their duty at their appointed posts.\n\nHad a larger force been available to protect my base, and the 9th deployed on the slope of Frenchman's Butte, beside their comrades of the 65th, the campaign would have been materially shortened, and the result more satisfactorily decisive.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\nT. BLAND STRANGE, Major General\nCommanding Alberta Field Force.\nAPPENDIX No. 2.\n\nREPORT ON ORGANIZATION OF COMPANY AND ERECTION OF STOCKADE AT YORKTON.\n\nOTTAWA, 20th January, 1886.\n\nTo The Adjutant-General of Militia,\nHead Quarters, Ottawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that, under authority of orders, as per margin, I left Ottawa for Yorkton, Assiniboia, North West Territories, on the 3rd April, 1885, and arrived at Winnipeg on Monday, 6th April, 1885; remained there as long as was needed to procure and take over the 100 stand of arms and 5,000 rounds of ammunition authorized to be issued.\n\nOn the 10th April, 1885, I left Winnipeg for Broadview, a station on the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the point at which one leaves the Main Line for Yorkton; where a further detention was occasioned by the non-arrival of the arms and ammunition. During said detention at Broadview having ascertained that the country to be traversed was in a very unsettled condition, I enlisted as many men as could be found at Broadview, as an escort for the arms and ammunition, and swore in the teamsters of the five teams that had been sent from Yorkton for transport, and purchased four small tents and provisions for the march. The arms and ammunition arrived on Saturday night, and on Sunday morning, the 12th April, 1885, after issuing 20 rounds of ammunition and a rifle to each man, we started across the Prairie for Yorkton. Our march was tedious, owing to the condition of the ground at that season of the year, and the well-known slow pace of the oxen. The first day we marched about 14 miles, and encamped at night on this side of the Qu'Appelle Valley. I formed the wagons into a corral, and, having detailed a guard, and posted sentries, we remained there for the night. Started early next morning, about 5.30 a.m., and marched across the Qu'Appelle Valley, and made altogether during the day about 25 miles, and so we continued until reaching Yorkton, on Wednesday night, the 15th April, 1885. Yorkton is situated at Section 12, Township 26, Range 4, West of 2nd Meridian. The settlers, composed of some 180 families, are scattered all over the country. I at first occupied the mill, but from its insecure position, being overlooked with high ground, covered with brush, I at once chose another spot, and pitched tents on higher ground, in the open, placing arms and ammunition under a guard in the Land Office. On the Saturday following my arrival, a great number of the settlers came into Yorkton. I addressed them, and nearly 40 men at once enlisted. I then proposed building a log house and stockade, and the settlers promptly came to my assistance, and with their own teams hauled logs 11 feet long by 1\u00bd foot in diameter, distances varying from 7 to 18 miles, giving their time, labor and teams. FREE, the result being that a fine stockade was built, a description of which is here given, as published in the Toronto Mail of the 25th July, 1885.\n\nA NORTH-WEST STOCKADE.\n\nThree town lots, making an area of 150 feet square, were presented to Major Watson by the Yorkton Farmers' Colonization Company. The settlers brought in logs 11 feet long by a foot and a half in diameter, from distances varying from seven to twenty miles, using their own teams, and giving their labor gratis. The estimated number of logs used in the stockade was somewhat over 2,400. A ditch 3 feet deep was dug around the square. Frost was in the ground about 1 foot 6 inches from the surface, necessitating the cutting of the soil with an axe\u2014a tedious and laborious work, cheerfully and willingly done. The logs were sunk in the\nground three feet deep, leaving clear eight feet above the earth. These logs were placed close to one another, in many cases having to be trimmed. At corresponding angles bastions were formed, commanding the front and side face, and also the rear and side face of the stockade. Inside was erected a solid earth embankment (four faces and bastions) composed of cut sods, four feet six inches in height, and four feet six inches in breadth, forming a tread, and affording ample protection to a man firing from the standing position, as also a rest for the rifle. Loopholes were cut in the stockade, so as to enable the men to take advantage of the best position for cover and effective firing. The tread also enabled the men to look over the stockade, and fire over it if necessary, and also enabled the sentries at night to keep a sharp and vigilant look-out. In front of the gate was built a curtain, formed at an angle, thus preventing the enemy from making a direct rush on the weakest point of all stockades, the gate, and forcing them to separate into two parties, bringing them under direct fire from the front face of the stockade. This curtain was faced with logs on the front and side faces, and filled in with earth\u2014dimensions, 4 feet 6 inches high (lowering towards the point), 30 feet by 20 feet. Around the four faces of the stockade a ditch was dug 6 feet broad by 4 deep, adding to the height of the stockade, and making it 12 feet above the bottom of the ditch.\n\nInside the fort a well was dug some 43 feet deep, and a splendid brick oven built, capable of baking bread for over a hundred men; also two log houses and a guard room, the latter just inside the gate. The dimensions of the log houses are as follows:\u2014One of them 18 feet by 16 feet, 10 feet high, used as barrack room; another 20 feet by 18 feet, 16 feet high, not completed, with four protruding corners loopholed, affording complete cover to eight men, and enabling them to keep a good lookout and fire over the stockade, commanding each and every face; the larger log house was for families in case of attack. The magazine was about the centre of the fort, to the left rear of the Commanding Officer's tent. The men's tents were pitched in lines at regular intervals, with streets between. The Sergt.-Major's and Sergeants' tents were on the right of the magazine. The men's tent for meals was a large one, close to the temporary cooking-house, erected out of lumber lent for that purpose by the Colonization Company and settlers.\n\nThe Fort is called Fort Watson, after the Officer commanding the Force.\n\nOn the 20th April, 1885, two Indians, members of Little Bones' Band, from Leech Lake, came into camp, and on the following day the whole Band were encamped across the White Sand River in the brush. The Chief intimated his desire to see me, and the next day held a pow-wow opposite my tent, asking for provisions, and assuring me of their good feeling and loyalty. I gave them tobacco, tea and pork. Subsequently they again came in, asking for more provisions, and almost demanding them from myself and settlers. I positively declined, and told them they could not expect a repetition of such favors, and that their proper place was on their reserve. I at once communicated with the Lieut.-Governor who informed me that Little Bones and his Band lived by hunting and were well behaved. Almost immediately they commenced stealing cattle, and raiding the settlers (many of them have since been tried and convicted at Regina); I then detailed 25 men under Drill Instructor Gardiner, on the 26th May, 1885, to proceed to the Indian Camp, some 16 miles distant from Yorkton, and, having read the Lieut.-Governor's proclamation (which I received in the meantime), to order them to their reserve, informing them also that, after said notice, if off their reserve, we should treat them as Rebels. Owing to the cool and determined action of Drill Instructor Gardiner in carrying out my orders, a collision, which at first seemed inevitable, was avoided, and the Indians, obeying the proclamation, moved to Devil's Lake. I wish here to place on record the great service Drill Instructor Gardiner has been to me; he has since been appointed Riding Instructor at the School of Mounted Infantry, Winnipeg, and I am certain that his soldier-like bearing and conduct, will gain, as I hope it may, for him, speedy promotion.\n\nThe majority of the men composing the Force were homesteaders; their\naptitude for learning drill, their ready obedience, their amenability to discipline, coupled with their splendid physique, hardihood and knowledge of the country, convinced me that no better material for soldiers could be found, and confirmed the idea that Canadians are specially adapted, from their early habits and training, for the duties of a soldier on Active Service.\n\nI am proud to say that the conduct of each and every member of the Force was exceptionally good.\n\nIn obedience to orders from Head Quarters I dismissed the men from further duty on the 8th June, 1885, returning arms and ammunition, tents, &c., &c., into store at Winnipeg.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

MACPHERSON, Lt.-Colonel,\nDirector of Stores and Keeper of Militia Properties.\n\nThe Deputy of the Minister of Militia and Defence,\n\nOttawa.\nAPPENDIX No. 4.\n\nPRELIMINARY REPORT OF THE COMMISSION ON WAR CLAIMS.\n\nOTTAWA, 25th February, 1886.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Commission appointed first by you on the 21st day of August, 1885, and subsequently confirmed by the following Order in Council, passed on the 15th October:\n\n\"Certified copy of a Report of a Committee of the Honorable the Privy Council, approved by the Honorable the Deputy Governor in Council on the 15th October, 1885.\n\nThe Committee, on the recommendation of the Minister of Militia and Defence, advise that Lieutenant Colonel William Hayes Jackson, Deputy Adjutant General of Military District Number One, Lieutenant Colonel Edward A. Whitehead, Retired List, and Honorary Lieutenant Colonel William Henry Forrest, District Paymaster and Superintendent of Militia Stores, Military District Number Seven, be appointed, under the provisions of the Act 31 Victoria, cap. 38, intituled: \"An Act respecting Inquiries concerning Public matters,\" Commissioners to investigate all claims arising out of the late Rebellion in the Northwest Territories, and which may be chargeable to the Department of Militia and Defence, viz: for Transport Supplies, Salaries, and all other claims incidental to these services, and that a Commission do issue under the provisions of the said Act, conferring on such Commissioners the power of summoning before them any party or witnesses, and of requiring them to give evidence on oath, orally or in writing (or on solemn affirmations, if they be parties entitled to affirm in civil matters), and to produce such documents and things as such Commissioners deem requisite to the full investigation of the matters into which they are appointed to examine.\n\nThe Committee, on the same recommendation, advise that Mr. Edmund Burnham Holt, Second Class Clerk in the Department of Militia and Defence, be appointed Secretary to the said Commission.\n\nJOHN J. McGEE,\nClerk Privy Council.\n\nLieut. Col. Peebles was added to the Commission by Order in Council on the 17th November, 1885.\n\n\"Certified copy of a Report of a Committee of the Honorable the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the 17th November, 1885.\n\nThe Committee, on the recommendation of the Minister of Militia and Defence, advise that Lieutenant Colonel Adam John Laing Peebles be appointed,\nunder provisions of 31 Vic., Cap. 38, in place of Lieutenant Colonel Edward A. Whitehead, as one of the Commissioners named by Order in Council of the 15th October, 1885, to act as one of such Commissioners during the investigation of claims connected with the Transport of Stores and Supplies in the Northwest Territories, such transactions having been directly under the management of Lieut. Col. Whitehead.\n\nJOHN J. McGEE,\nClerk Privy Council.\n\nTo the Honorable the Minister of Militia and Defence.\"\n\nBy your orders Major George Guy, Paymaster North West Force, acted as a member during the absence on leave of Lieut.-Col. Whitehead.\n\nThe Commission assembled at Winnipeg on the 7th September (but had been gathering information and making arrangements from the 21st August), and have held one hundred and thirty-five sessions up to 25th February, 1886, covering a period of one hundred and eighty days. During their continuance in the North West, their offices were kept open daily (Sundays included) until nearly midnight. After having obtained all the information available at Winnipeg, the Commission adjourned, and re-assembled at Ottawa on the 7th January, 1886, and proceeded to adjust the claims of the Hudson's Bay Co., considering and submitting proposals for basis of settlement of the large claims presented by the C. P. Railway for conveyance of Troops and stores, and especially over the unfinished portion of the road, between Biscotasing and Port Arthur, a distance of 461 miles, where much of the work had to be done with teams; and, further, to take up and report upon the numerous claims which had accumulated during adjournment.\n\n1308 Claims received and filed, amount to $700,514.08. In addition the Hudson's Bay Co. accounts amount to $1,737,032.64, and the Canadian Pacific Railway to $852,331.32, making a total of $3,289,878.04. Claims have been reported upon amounting to $3,270,022.19. Recommended for payment $2,918,024.03. Rejected $139,850.19. Deducted as over-charge $212,147.97,\u2014making a total reduction of $351,998.16.\n\nThe respective reports submitted from time to time are herewith embodied, showing action taken on the various numbers, together with your remarks thereon.\n\nThe Commissioners having gone to the North West shortly after the outbreak of the Rebellion, where they served in various capacities in connection with the forces, remaining in the country some eight or nine months (some of whom had spent considerable time in the country previously), having cognizance of almost all matters relating to Pay, Transport and Supplies, without desiring to appear egotistical, feel the knowledge thus gained enabled them to judge intelligently on almost every claim presented. In addition to this, evid-\nence was gathered in various ways: witnesses examined orally, in writing, upon oath, and by declaration, every effort having been made to deal justly with all; and, where a doubt existed, it has invariably been given in favor of the claimant.\n\nThat the recommendations will give satisfaction to all it cannot be expected, as persons who present excessive or doubtful claims are sure to be more clamorous than the honest dealer. It cannot be denied, however, the people generally in that part of the country adhered to the time-honored practice of getting all they possibly could out of the Government.\n\nDuplicate claims were frequently presented (inadvertently, no doubt,) necessitating much vigilance in their investigation. In all probability, it was to guard the country against excessive charges, and irregularities, the Commissioners were appointed.\n\nIn submitting these Reports, we do so with the consciousness of having dealt liberally towards all.\n\nIt may not be out of place to state here that, whilst it is a subject for universal regret that the Government's valuable acquisition of the great North West should have been convulsed by an uprising, the country has reason to be congratulated upon the fact that, whilst the loss in men and money is to be deplored, still, for the magnitude of the work done, both have been perhaps the lowest on record: and that the amount so expended in the North West Territories has gone to our own people, and will be expended mainly in improving and beautifying their homesteads and enhancing their value; and there must be a modified satisfaction in the feeling that since the money had to be expended, it has not been entirely lost, but has gone to assist a new and struggling population, and to give an impetus to affairs generally in the North West.\n\nWe have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour most obedient servants,\n\nW.

Beatty, $16.75.\n\nThis Corps was organized under special written authority from the Honorable the Minister of Militia and Defence. The members were sent from Ontario at the public expense, consequently they should be returned to their homes in the same manner. The respective claims for expenses appear reasonable\u2014payment recommended. Cheque to be issued for total amount to Capt. J. S.

These instructions have been carried out, and the claims paid, after making necessary reductions.\n\nW. C. No. 20.\u2014M. & D. Case A. 2023.\u2014T. J. Sproule, Winnipeg, claim for making Latrines for Montreal Garrison Artillery, Lt.-Col. Oswald commanding, amounting to $55. All the circumstances in connection with this case were fully considered, and it was decided to recommend payment of $15 only, being the estimated value of the material used. This is in accordance with a special agreement made with Lt.-Col. Oswald, who should, therefore, pay the balance.\n\nApproved.\u2014A. P. C.\nW. C. No. 21.\u2014M. & D. A.2206.\u2014This is a claim from the Officer Commanding 90th Battalion, Winnipeg, to cover cost of underclothing, boots, necessaries, etc., etc., for 292 N. C. O and men at $2275 = $6,643, and 24 officers at $100 each $2,400. It appears that this Corps was ordered to take the field without having been provided with these articles by the Department. The Commission are of opinion that Corps ordered on service should be fully provided by the Government. After comparing prices paid for similar articles supplied other Corps, it is recommended that the following sums be granted each N. C. O. and man, through the Commanding Officer in full of the claim, viz.:\n\nMaking a total of $13.95 per man and amounting to $4,073.40.\n\n| Item                          | Quantity | Cost |\n|-------------------------------|----------|------|\n| Fur Cap                       | 1        | $1.60|\n| Pair ankle-boots              | 1        | $2.25|\n| Under shirts, 60c.            | 2        | $1.20|\n| Towels, 25c.                  | 2        | $0.50|\n| Pair long boots               | 1        | $3.50|\n| Flannel shirts, $1.25         | 2        | $2.50|\n| Pair socks, 30c.              | 2        | $0.60|\n| Brush, fork, knives, spoon    |          | $0.60|\n\nThe claim of $100 per each Officer does not appear to be admissible, and cannot be recommended.

No. 12\u2014M. & D. A.2281\u2014The Northwest Transportation Co., for transport of Halifax Battalion, $15,907.53. There appears to be considerable overcharging in this claim. It has been ascertained that the regular 2nd-class fare between Port Arthur and Sarnia is $8, and 25cts. for meals. The commission consequently deem it right to make a reduction of $1 in the passage fare for each man and 10c. for each meal; there being an overcharge in number of 8 men for meals, at 35c., the sum of $2.20 is deducted; and 18 sergeants being charged for as officers, a reduction is made to bring this item down to the rate chargeable for N. C. O. and men. Total reduction on this claim, $719.20; the balance, $15,188.33, is recommended for payment.\n\nApproved\u2014A.P.C.\n\nW. C. No. 22\u2014M. & D. A.2198.\u2014H.

No. 24.\u2014M. & D. A.2062.\u2014The Winnipeg and Western Transportation Co., for service of Steamers \"Northcote,\" \"Northwest\" and \"Marquis,\" &c., amounting in all to $63,841. This claim enquired into most minutely. After having heard the statement of Capt. Swinford, Secretary-Treasurer of the Company, and gathered from him that the Steamers \"Marquis\" and \"Northwest,\" although actually secured by the Government on the 12th April, 1885, did not enter the service till the 13th May, and it being well known that all the boats were frequently laid up for several days at a time, it would appear but reasonable to make a deduction for, at least, the fuel saved during the idle period. All circumstances considered, the Commission are of opinion there should be a reduction equivalent to the value of fuel for 30 days each for Steamers \"Marquis\" and \"Northwest\" (30 cords for the former and 25 cords for the latter per day at $2.50 per cord), which was the quantity consumed according to the statement of the Secretary-Treasurer, who also placed the cost of fuel at $2.50 per cord; the reduction on Steamer \"Marquis\" at $75 per day being $2,250; and on Steamer \"Northwest\" at $62.50 per day being $1,875 in all $4,125. It may be noted that the reduction has been made on the lowest valuation of the fuel; that nothing has been taken off for saving and wages of men not employed during that period, and no count taken of the fact that, owing to the lowness of the water after the 13th May, for many days the boats were unserviceable to the Government.\n\nRegarding the item $950 for damage sustained by Steamer \"Northcote,\" there are no proper certificates of survey, etc., in support of the claim; it is therefore struck off, pending the production of said certificates. The Commission recommend payment of the balance, amounting to $58,766. See Supplementary Report, of 6th November.\n\nW. H. JACKSON, Lt.-Col., D. A. G.,\nChairman.\n\nW. H.

As the officers of this corps drew subsistence, forage and pay for horse, under terms of a special written agreement of organization, amounting to $2.75 each per day during the period covered by these claims, all items for subsistence are struck out, amounting to $160.90; the balance, $279.37, is recommended for payment.\n\nApproved.\u2014A.

A Provisional Cavalry Force of the strength of 150 Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers and Troopers can be formed in the District named, having as its northern boundary High River, its eastern, Medicine Hat, and its southern, the International Boundary Line, of the above strength, upon the following basis:\n\n(1) Each Officer, Non-Commissioned Officer and Trooper to supply his own horse and horse appointments (Mexican), consisting of bridle, lariat and saddle and saddle blanket.\n\n(2) The uniform of Officers to be that of an undress Cavalry Officer,\u2014supplied at their own expense.\n\nThe uniform of Non-Commissioned Officers and Troopers to consist, during their provisional enlistment, and whilst undergoing their preliminary drill, of their own serviceable western apparel, with perhaps some additional inexpensive distinctive equipment supplied by Government.\n\n(3) The arms to consist of 1 revolver, Mounted Police pattern, or any other serviceable revolver in their possession.\u20141 Winchester Carbine or other serviceable carbine or rifle in their possession.\u20141 cartridge belt, with knife attached, M.P. pattern (a limited deficiency in arms to be supplied by Government, but the conditions of enlistment to require them furnished by the men.)\n\n(4) Blankets, 3 per man, of North West Mounted Police weight and quality.\n\n(5) Each Officer, Non-Commissioned Officer and Trooper to be allowed $0.50 per day for rations.\n\nCamping utensils to be furnished by Government of the description and number required on the trail.\n\n(6) The forage per horse to be allowed at the rate of $0.50 per day.\n\n(7) The pay-for horse to be at the rate $0.75 per day.\n\n(8) Pay of Officers to be that of the respective rank of Canadian Cavalry Officer, with extra allowance of $0.50 for rations, and $0.50 for forage per day.\n(9) The pay of Non-Commissioned Officers to be that of North West Mounted Police Non-Commissioned Officers, viz.:\u2014Sergeant Major $1.50, Sergeant $1.00, Corporal $0.90.\n\n(10) The pay of a Trooper to be that of North West Mounted Police Constable, or $0.75 per day.

STEWART.\n\nCAPTAIN STEWART,\nRangers.\n\nAuthority is given to raise four (4) Troops of \"Rocky Mountain\" Rangers, on basis and conditions contained in report submitted by Captain Stewart to me.\n\n28-3-85.\n\nADOLPHE P.

Inasmuch as other corps similarly organized were allowed claims of a like nature, it is considered right that this claim be admitted, although not coming strictly within the agreement of organization.

Although not a duly authorized matter, is looked upon as a judicious expenditure, as it is within the knowledge of the Commission that occasional presents of this sort were necessary to keep the Indians quiet; it is therefore recommended for favorable consideration.\n\nTo be forwarded to Department of Indian Affairs.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. C. No. 40.\u2014Mrs. Philom\u00e8ne Beaupr\u00e9, for value of ammunition taken possession of by orders of Major General Strange, $70.50. This party persistently sold ammunition to the Indians, notwithstanding the repeated warnings of Major General Strange. See his remarks attached. Claim rejected in accordance therewith.\n\nSee Supplementary Report, of 24th February.\n\nMr. Beaupr\u00e9 was warned by me not to keep ammunition, as he had been selling to Indians, as reported to me on good authority. He stated he had none to me, and I ordered Major Hatton to search his store. He then produced that handed to Major Hatton on 7th April, saying he had no more. I knew he was lying and ordered his store to be again searched, when the ammunition received by Major Lewis was found, and Beaupr\u00e9 had, in spite of my orders, ordered fresh supplies of ammunition by C.P.R. He should forfeit the ammunition in question, and serve a term in the Penitentiary. I decline to recommend payment, and request he may not be paid.\n\nT. B.

With regard to Pay list No. 1, $5,357, this Corps was organized under special agreement, and on authority of Major General Strange. The men to supply horses; equipment and outfit pay to be $2.50 per day with rations and forage. The Rocky Mountain Rangers, formed in almost the same part of the Territory, received the same pay, but provided their own rations and forage, consequently Steele's men\nhad an advantage equal to at least one dollar per day. The fact that these men had after a little over three months' service accumulated cash amounting to $15 per month, with horse and expensive saddlery outfit (some of the saddles alone costing $50) paid for out of their earnings, shows that the rate of pay allowed per agreement was very liberal indeed; consequently this claim for extra or additional pay cannot be recommended.\n\nPay list No. 2, $190.44, is recommended to be paid in full, through Major Steele.\n\nPay list No. 3, $321, is also recommended for payment in full.\n\nApproved.\u2014A.

No. 47.\u2014St. George Snow Shoe Club, Winnipeg, for damage to judges' stand, fencing, etc., by 9th Battalion whilst camping on the ground, $28. As Lieut. Bate made a personal inspection of the place, and estimated the damage at $20, it is recommended that $20 be paid in full settlement of the claim.\n\nApproved.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. C. No. 48.\u2014Benjamin Gannon for bonus, $20. As this man was evidently in the employ of the Government as a teamster, at $8 per day, it is considered that the question of granting a bonus for extra service should be left for the consideration of the Honorable the Minister of Militia and Defence.\n\nRejected.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. C. No. 49.\u2014Captain Constantine for pay as Brigade Major, $54.63. Major-Genl. Strange previously stated that Major Dale performed the duties of Brigade Major, and no other Staff Officer was employed, Major Dale having been paid accordingly. The number of Troops under Lt.-Col. Smith were too small to warrant the appointment of such a Staff Officer. The claim cannot, therefore, be recommended for payment, and is rejected.\n\nRejected.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. C. No. 51.\u2014J. C. Skelton for driving Dr. Rolph, $35; being duly certified to is recommended for payment in full.\n\nApproved.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. C. No. 52.\u2014A. Chisholm and D. Taylor, Battleford, for drawing water, $124 each, in all $248 for August. It was estimated that there were only\nabout 175 men at this station; 4 puncheons of water a day would be more than sufficient, and rations of wood would be about $\\frac{1}{2}$ cord daily. The Commission are not aware that any stores were arriving at or being dispatched from the station; if any, it would be only small quantities, not requiring the permanent employment of two teams. Inasmuch as the people of Battleford have been fed for some time past at the Government expense, it is considered right to make a reduction of $1 per day on each account, in all $62; the balance, $186, is recommended for payment, solely because certified to by Lt.-Col. Otter, who should be instructed to reduce this expenditure.\n\nKeep this back for present.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. C. No. 53.\u2014For transport of Engineer White from Moose Jaw to Battleford, $140. The Company employing Engineer White rented their boats to the Government at a very heavy rate per day, were paid whether running or not, and the crews were to be furnished by the Company. This does not, therefore, appear to be a just claim, and cannot be recommended; it should be paid by the Company owning the boats. Claim rejected.\n\nRejected.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. H.

No. 59.\u2014A. McDonald; oats and hay for horses of Steele's Troop, $192. Having ascertained that the usual charge is $1 per day of 24 hours, it is deemed right to reduce the price charged to that rate; total reduction $60.50.

Having been paid already by Dr. Roddick for eleven days' service, he is entitled to claim for only 42 days, instead of 53, at $2 per day, consequently the claim is reduced by $11.55, and the balance, $84, recommended for payment.\n\nApproved.\u2014A.

Major Dale, who acted as Brigade Major and Staff Officer with Major-General Strange's column, states that the last engagement took place on the 28th May and there was no necessity for the employment of these men on extra scout duty after 15th June, consequently it is deemed right to make a reduction of $499.50. The balance, $1,239.50, is recommended for payment.\n\nKeep in abeyance for present.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. C. No. 81.\u2014E. Robb, loss of waggon, $100. This claim is reduced $80.

Doubtless the professional services and past military experience of Surgeon Pennefather were very valuable to Major-General Strange, but the Commission do not consider that the strength of the Force was sufficient to warrant the appointment of a Principal Medical Officer.

No. 115.\u2014Steele's Scouts, Troopers and Teamsters, consisting of 39 Vouchers, claiming compensation for horses killed and injured, and disposed of as follows, viz.: Vouchers Nos. 2 to 9, Troopers Patton, Fitzgerald, Miller, Steele, Young, Hayes, McManus and W. T. Owens; Nos. 11 to 13, Scott, Belden and Hursell; No. 15, Alley; Nos. 18 to 25, Walters, Rodgers, West, Benoit, McFarlane, Frankowen, Martin, Rodway and Hudson; Nos. 27 to 29, Milne, McQuarrie and Petrie; No. 31, Huston; Nos. 38 to 40, Ibbotson, Coryell and Wilson; Nos. 33 to 37, Teamsters Bennie, Fraser, Thomas, Brewster, Sibbald, and Munro. Rejected. With regard to No. 9, Trooper W. T. Owens, in which a claim is also made for a balance\nof pay, it is remarked that he has apparently received all that he is entitled to, and still has his horse, which will no doubt be all right after a rest. He is not entitled to compensation for his horse under the Regulations and Orders. With regard to Nos. 33 and 37, these are teamsters who were in receipt of an exorbitant rate of pay per day, and are, therefore, not considered to be entitled to compensation for loss or injury to their horses; Voucher No. 10, Trooper Garant, horse shot, $100 is recommended to be paid in this case, being the full amount allowable under Par. 1004 R. & O.; Voucher No. 16, Trooper Oke, as a special case, $25 is recommended to be paid to this man to defray the expense of going to and returning from Red Deer to bring back his horse; Voucher No. 26, Trooper Bell, $8 is recommended to be paid to this man to reimburse him the amount expended for care of his horse at Peace Hills; Voucher Nos. 14, Hunt, 30, Cole, and 32, Lynes, are held over for further information.\n\nApproved.\u2014A.

With regard to No. 1, $111.75, as fifty cents per day was the rate originally agreed upon by Major-General Strange, and as General Middleton looks upon this work as skilled labor, according to his note attached to claim, it is recommended that fifty cents per day be allowed to each man, irrespective of rank; $63.25 is, therefore, deducted, and the balance, $48.50, recommended for payment on completion of the Pay lists, and this only as a special case. Pay lists Nos. 2 and 3, $721, and $167.50. These appear to be for legitimate work of soldiers, as intimated by General Middleton on previous Pay list, and as contemplated by Par. 873 R. & O. These claims are consequently rejected.\n\nPut before Minister when in Winnipeg.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. C. No. 118.\u2014Mulholland Bros., supplies, 92nd Battalion, $34.61.

At the end of May, when you cancelled the contract with the Company, I asked Mr. Wrigley to give me an inventory of subsistence on hand and in transit for the N.W.F. Force, so as requisitions would cover the anticipated supplies, which list I never received. The invoice of $8600.87 will not be required for the troops for several months, and the H.B. Company have a trade for these goods and should take them to account. At the same time if you have an understanding with them, as they state, you will kindly advise me your instructions.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. A.

Recommended for payment in full.\n\nApproved.\u2014A. P. C.\nW. C. No. 138.\u2014Boyd & Crowe, use of scows, etc., $5,914.20. The item for ferriage 527 tons of supplies at Charles Crossing, charged at 25 cents per cwt. (100 lbs.), $2,635, is reduced to 75 cents per ton (2,000 lbs.) = $395.25, as the whole of the labor was performed by the troops, and the rate for ferriage, according to the license granted by the Northwest Council, and as charged at Saskatchewan Crossing, does not exceed 75 cents for a two-horse team and waggon. The item for three barges, which should be more appropriately called scows, carried away by high water, valued at \u00a35,500, is considered inadmissible, and is struck out entirely. The item for two scows furnished to Dr. Roddick to convey wounded soldiers to Grand Rapids, $1,000, is reduced to $250, that is $125 each, which is considered full value. The item for lumber, etc., $447.20, is totally disallowed, as the lumber was no doubt used for repairing the scows, which still remain the property of the firm. The item for ferriage of 62 teams and waggons across rivers, $5 each, $310, is reduced to 75 cents per team and waggon, $46.50, which is considered quite sufficient for this service, in accordance with the rates previously quoted. Total reduction on claim, $5,200.45; the balance, $713.75, is recommended for payment.\n\nApproved.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. H. JACKSON, Lt.-Col., D. A. G.,\nChairman.\n\nE. A.

No. 139.\u2014Regarding statement and account current with the Hudson's Bay Company, No. 10, laid before the Commission: the Commission are of opinion that Armit's position, under Lieutenant-Colonel Otter, did not appear to be one that would influence him in connection with his contract for teaming, which was simply for the supply of teams by the day, and particularly as he had nothing to do with certifying as to the time or services of the teams employed; he also appears to have rendered very valuable services to Lieutenant-Colonel Otter's column. As to supplying the drivers with rations and the horses with forage, although the contracts with the Hudson's Bay Company, Armit and Kelly, and other contractors for the supply of teams by the day, did not stipulate that rations and forage should be supplied by the Government, it appears that the service could not have been performed unless the Government did provide them; and it was so understood when the engagements were made.\n\nW.

No. 58.\u2014This is a claim for a team and a horse ordered by Captain Normandeau to replace others left by Colonel Smith. It seems the team was for Normandeau's own private use and the horse was for Sergeant Duchesnay. They should pay this bill themselves. McDonald says one of his horses was taken away, and he has not been paid for him. It seems Normandeau took the horse to Edmonton. The horses were fed at Government expense. McDonald, who is a most reliable man, furnished the horses in good faith, thinking that Normandeau had authority, but finds now that he had not.\n\nHe is willing, if the Commission entertains his claim, to accept $201.50, which is $6 a day for the team and $2.50 for the horse, and will run his chances of getting paid for the horse taken away by Normandeau.\n\nA.

At the same time, I believe, his horses were rationed by the Mounted Police while in camp at Regina. He also was served with forage in passing through Winnipeg, and received sufficient forage to take him to Montreal on his return; he, therefore, should refund to the Department the ninety-one dollars ($91.00) which he had no right to claim and vouch for.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

It appears the agreement was based on the capacity of the Steamer \"Northcote,\" which has a net tonnage of 290.65, while the several vessels furnished by the Northwest Coal and Navigation Co. have a capacity as follows, viz.:\n\n| Vessel       | Capacity |\n|--------------|----------|\n| Baroness     | 201.63   |\n| Alberta      | 85.72    |\n| Minnow       | 15.57    |\n| 6 Barges     | 500.00   |\n\nTotal: 802.92 tons\n\nDivide this by 3, gives 267.64 tons average, or 23.01 tons less on each steamer (with the proportion of barges) than the \"Northcote,\" which would make a reduction of $60 per day for 31 days (the first month's service), amounting to $1,860, on this first item, $23,250. In recommending this reduction, the great difference between the cost of the barges and the steamer \"Northcote\" has not been taken into consideration. The balance, $21,390, is recommended for payment.\n\nThe 2nd item of six days for the same vessels up to 16th May, inclusive, $4,500, is subject to a similar proportionate reduction as made on the previous item, viz.: $60 per day, amounting to $360, leaving a balance of $4,140, which is recommended for payment.\n\nThe 3rd item for two steamers and two barges, from 17th May to 31st July, 75 days, $45,000. The services of the Steamer \"Minnow\" and three barges being dispensed with, reduces the capacity by 265.57 tons, leaving a net tonnage of 537.35, which still leaves the two remaining steamers and three barges 22 tons per steamer and proportion of barges short of the \"Northcote,\" or a reduction of $258 per day from the original charge of $750 for the 3 steamers and 6 barges, making a reduction on this item of $10,350, or $19 per day on each steamer less than the original charge of $250 for 75 days, in the account appearing charged at $300 each, showing value per day of each steamer at $231 instead of $250, leaving a balance on this item of $31,650, which is recommended for payment.\n\n2nd account for $6,129.33. First item, $732.40, is recommended for payment in full.\n\nSecond item, $109.33, for transport of 5 horses and 2 wagons from Medicine Hat to Swift Current and return, which were brought down for the purpose of conveying supplies to Steamer which Major-General Laurie would not permit; consequently it is evident Major-General Laurie provided all necessary transport in connection with the Steamer by teams employed by Government. This item, therefore, does not appear to be a fair charge against the Department. Rejected.\n\nThird item, A, claim for one large barge lost, $1,000. At the time for which this claim is made the river suddenly rose from 12 to 15 feet, causing much damage and destruction to property. As this was beyond the control of the Government and a risk all Navigation Companies must assume, it does not appear to be a fair charge against the Department. Rejected.\nFourth item, B, for loss of one large barge, $1,000. A copy of letter from Major H. R. Smith, Midland Battalion, who was in command (attached to the papers) shows that both Steamer \"Baroness\" and barge were in danger of being destroyed from the manner adopted in towing, consequently he ordered the barge to be left for the safety of both.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nAs Officer commanding the River Escort from Swift Current Crossing to Lepine's Crossing, it affords me much pleasure to bear warm testimony to the kindness and courtesy shown by Captains Davis and Bessell and the Officers generally of the \"Baroness\" and \"Alberta\" to the Officers and men under my command. Every effort was used by all concerned to secure a speedy and safe passage between the points above named, and no pains were spared to make us all as comfortable as the excellent accommodation of the boat would permit.\n\nIn regard to the barge left behind above the Elbow: This was done by my orders, it having become apparent to me that it was in hourly danger of being destroyed, besides very seriously impeding the speed of the \"Baroness.\"\n\nAs I was carrying ammunition to the front, time was valuable, and I found it necessary to assume the responsibility of leaving the barge behind.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nI remain, yours very faithfully,\n\nHENRY R SMITH,\nMajor Midland Regiment.\n\nE. T. Galt, Esq.,\nManager N. W. C & N. Co.\n\nA letter under date of May 8th, 1885, from the Honorable the Minister of Militia and Defence, to Sir Alexander Galt, attached, says: \"They shall be at the risk of the Government as to any damage occasioned by navigating them.\" The Commission respectively submit this guarantee was intended to cover damage by the enemy or by our own Troops, but not against natural obstacles of navigation. It may be further stated that, in our recommendation of payment for services rendered by the \"Flotilla,\" this barge was included for six days after she was disabled, which would probably pay about one-third of the original cost, consequently this item is rejected.\n\n5th item, C, for loss of one medium-sized barge, $600. This loss occurred by the ordinary dangers of navigation, and does not appear to be a fair charge against the Department. Rejected.\n\n6th, three items, D, damages to Steamer \"Baroness,\" $325; \"Alberta,\" $125; \"Minnow,\" $25, in all $475. The claimants furnished their own captains, pilots and crews. As these damages were incurred by the dangers of navigation, or inefficiency of the pilots, the claims do not appear to be a fair charge against the Department; in any case they were more than compensated by being paid for the full period. Rejected.\n\n7th item, E, cost of putting steamers out of river to repair damages, $1,000. It appears these boats are always drawn out of the river at the close of navigation, consequently these ways would have had to be constructed in any case, as stated by Sir A. T. Galt, when giving explanations before the Commission. Rejected.\n\n8th item, F, one York boat destroyed, $150; one life boat, $250. The officers of the \"Marquis\" were responsible for the proper management of the vessel, consequently this would be a claim against the Company owning that steamer. Rejected.\n\nG, one old York boat, sunk and lost at Demi-charge Rapids, $30.\n\nThere is no claim from the owners of this boat, it is therefore rejected.\n\n9th item, H, two tarpaulins lost on sunken barge, $170. No effort appears to have been made to recover these tarpaulins by the officers of the boat, consequently it cannot be a fair charge against the Department, and is rejected.\n\n10th item, I, meat and eggs for wounded, $162.60. Recommended for payment in full.\n\n11th item, K, use of extra barge for ferrying at Saskatchewan Landing, $450. This barge was one of the six under pay with steamer, and, when the others were\nlost, included in the calculation in making up the tonnage with the two remaining steamers. Rejected.\n\nAfter having compared the tonnage capacity of the steamers of this Company with that of the \"Northcote,\" the Commission were desirous of ascertaining the relative capacity by foot measurement. Mr. Ed. B. Able, Surveyor and Measurer of Shipping for the Department of Marine, came before the Commission and explained fully the capacity of the respective vessels, also stating the \"Northcote\" had been improved since the certificate of Registration was given by having her cylinder increased from 14 inches to 18 inches in diameter. He also stated the \"Baroness\" had greater capacity for conveying freight on her deck, but for a mixed load of freight and troops the \"Northcote\" had the advantage.\n\nThe Commission are of opinion, after taking into consideration the great difference between the \"Alberta\" and \"Northcote,\" that the average capacity of the two vessels as compared with the \"Northcote,\" respecting tonnage, is as near correct as possible.\n\nThe Commission respectfully suggest that Major General Middleton's opinion might be taken as to the services rendered by these vessels.\n\nTotal claim $78,879.33.\n\nLess deductions $17,804.33.\n\nLess paid by Department on account, $51,000.00\u2014$68,804.33.\n\nBalance recommended for payment $10,075.00.\n\nW.

No. 227.\u2014Major Jarvis, Command Pay, $137.50. The whole Command at Prince Albert during the period appears to have been less than 100 men, consequently this claim does not come within the meaning of the Royal Warrant regulating Command Pay; in any case, if authorised, $1.25 per day, the same as allowed Commandants of Royal Schools of Gunnery, would appear ample. The Commission respectfully suggest that the claim be referred to the G. O. C. Should this be paid, of course, many similar claims will be presented.\n\nI concur with the Commission, and I think it would be advisable to settle that $1.25 should be the sum allowed for similar case.\u2014F. M.\n\nGeneral's concurrence and suggestion as to pay of $1.25 approved.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. C. No. 228.\u2014P. Th\u00e9au, sick horse, $20.

M.\n\nApproved.\u2014A. P. C.\nThe Commission wish to note that, in recommending payment of 4-horse teams, at $12 per day; and 2-horse teams at $8 per day, they are governed by the agreement between Major-General Strange and the teamsters, the same rates having been paid at the time on other trails; but these prices were subsequently reduced.\n\nW.

This claim was closely examined, and it was agreed to deduct charges amounting to $11,651.50, and to recommend for payment the balance of $9,417.50, as per detailed statement attached to claim. So far as the Commission can ascertain, it is customary to send the boats of this Company from Selkirk to Grand Rapids, and await arrival of steamers plying on the North Saskatchewan; consequently, no allowance for demurrage can be granted.\n\nApproved.\u2014A.

Under these circumstances the claim cannot be recommended for payment, but it is respectfully suggested that the matter be submitted for the consideration of the G. O.

No. 301.\u2014Ross & Riddell, transport 7th Fusiliers, Clarke's Crossing to Moose Jaw, $1,615 ($125 is for one day's additional service). Amount deducted for numbers of teams overcharged, $90; the balance, $1,525, is recommended for payment.\n\nThese teams were ordered by Mr. Sinclair, contractor, Clarke's Crossing, from Ross & Riddell, Moosejaw. In my opinion the claim of this sub-contractor should not be to this office, but to the Contractor Sinclair, as this may be a duplicate claim for the same service. As these teams were not engaged by me, but directly by Sinclair, I cannot certify to the claim.\n\nF. JOSEPH DIXON,\nLieut., C. M., Staff Officer Supply & Transport.\n\nTwenty-five (25) teams were ordered from Ross & Riddell, Moose Jaw, and sent forward by me under instructions received by telegraph from Major Bell, Transport Officer, Qu'Appelle, to transport the 7th Battalion from Clarke's Crossing to Moosejaw, subsequently recalled by me on account of telegraphic order from Major Bell advising me that he had sent transport for the same purpose from Qu'Appelle. I warned Major Bell by telegraph that a claim would be made if I recalled the teams, and he replied that he would pay for the time out, under these circumstances. I certify to twenty-five (25) teams for one (1) day at $5 each, $125.00.\n\nF. JOSEPH DIXON, Lieut. C. M.,\nStaff Officer, Supply and Transport.\n\nApproved.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. C.

As these men and their families depended in great measure upon subsistence furnished by Government, and were embodied to defend their own homes, it is considered they have been amply paid already, and this claim cannot therefore be recommended. Rejected.\n\nClaim rejected.\u2014A. P. C., M. M. & D.\n\nW. C. No. 266.\u2014McNeil Bros., meals, $18. Recommended for payment in full.\n\nApproved.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. C. No. 267.\u2014F. Fields, hire of saddle horses, &c., $18.50. This is not a claim against the Department. See Mr. McGibbon's letter, attached. Rejected.\n\nThis claim of Field's I cannot pass. The buckboard was sold to Col. Amyot complete for $400\u2014horse and harness.\n\nThe Police claimed the cushion as soon as they saw it, and Field failed to prove that it was his, when sold to Col. Amyot. Instead, therefore, of asking for payment, he actually owes the Department a cushion.\n\nThe hire of 2 horses and the bridle have no connection with it that I know of, and the account therefore must not be entertained.\n\nA.

Oswald and Sergeant-Major Wilson that the horses belonging to Troopers West, Owens and Oke, were taken over or sold by the Government auctioneer, consequently it is now recommended that the sum of $100 be paid to each of the said troopers, being the full amount allowed under R. and O., Par. 1004, and that payment in the case of\nOwens (W.

Major Walker was a teamster and contractor, and as such received large sums from the Government.

CARON,\nMinister of Militia and Defence,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your favor of the 26th inst.\n\nI reported fully to the Commission on the 19th October on Costigan's claim, and I quote the concluding paragraph of my report.\n\n\"I consider they (teamsters Convoy No. 8) have all been paid what was promised them and which was well understood, and as a proof of this, more than half of the Convoy, especially the half-breeds, never made any remonstrance, but accepted their vouchers without any difficulty, knowing perfectly well that they had only carried out their part of the bargain.\"\n\nI engaged most of the men myself, and Mr. Ellis the balance, but no such pledge was given as Mr. Costigan indicates, and I am pretty certain Mr. Ellis will give no such declaration, and if he does give Mr. Costigan one, he had no authority to make any such bargain.\n\nThe thing is absurd, on the face of it, as I was most anxious that our orders be strictly carried out to prevent delays and goods from being stolen on the way.\n\nI enclosed you a letter received at the time, that Mr. Costigan was himself to blame for delay getting away from Edmonton, by him and some of the teamsters getting drunk.\n\nThese are the very men now claiming extra time which they were guilty of causing themselves. I consider Mr. Costigan has no just claim and it should be rejected.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nALEX. McGIBBON, T. & S. O.\nEdmonton, 19th June, '85\n\nT. & S. Officer\nMcGibbon,\nCalgary.\n\nSir,\n\nI would call your earnest attention to the irregular manner in which Costigan brought in his train.\n\nIt was impossible to check the contents of each waggon as started from Calgary as the loads had all been altered en route, so a receipt in aggregate was given. I would also point out to you that he only handed in 170 lbs oats at this place.\n\nThe contents of each waggon were carefully noted on arrival here and the whole added up.\n\nThe day he arrived he allowed a number of his teamsters to leave their work and get drunk. He himself was under the influence of liquor, and considerable delay and trouble was incurred in getting him and his train started to Calgary.\n\nI would recommend him to be discharged and a strict enquiry made as to the conduct of the teamsters en route as there is good reason to believe that great waste and wilful damage has been done to the stores on the way.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Hamilton, T. & S. Officer.\n\nJ. A. Ouimet, Lt-Col.,\nCommanding Edmonton District.\n\nW. C. No. 383.\u2014M. & D. A. 2337.\u2014Captain J. V. Dupuis, 9th Battalion. Letter of explanation regarding cause of delay in transport at Red Deer River. This docket not being required for further reference is returned to the Department.\n\nTo Sir A. P. Caron,\nMinister of Militia,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nAt the request of Mr. John R. Costigan, Supply Officer, in an expedition from Calgary to Edmonton, in which I had the command of the military escort, I make it a duty to inform you that the delay which occurred in the convoy to Red Deer was uncontrollable.\n\nThe first cause of our delay was the excessive height of the water; and at the place where we had to cross, the strong current made the metallic cable of the raft to break twice, which cable connected the two shores. It was only after many days of hard work that the cable could be repaired and the trip continued.\n\nThe whole was made under my knowledge and under my personal orders; Mr. Costigan, therefore, must not be held responsible for said delay.\n\nWith the assurance of my distinguished consideration,\n\nCAPTAIN J. V. DUPUIS,\n9th Battalion, Voltigeurs.\n\nW. C. No. 94.\u2014M. & D. A. 2445.\u2014E. H. Cot\u00e9, cleaning arms, $75. Reported on 21st September. This claim has been paid through the H. B. Co. On further inquiry from Mr. McGibbon, supply officer, who was at Calgary at the time, it is ascertained that these arms were issued to teamsters and returned by them in very bad condition. In order to save them from ruin it was necessary that this cleaning should be done, consequently it is a fair charge against the Government. When this claim was previously reported on, the Commission were under the impression that the arms cleaned belonged to the 9th Battalion.\n\nStand.\u2014Put before me in Winnipeg.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW.

In reply I beg to state for your information, that Staff-Sergeant Potts was appointed at Ottawa to act as Lt.-Col. Lamontagne's supply sergeant in the North West. After that officer's departure, he was retained in this office as orderly. With reference to pay and allowances I would state that his pay was increased by authority from 90c. to $1 per diem and 40c. allowance per diem \"in lieu\" of subsistence; an allowance was also made in money \"in lieu\" of new clothing. On being relieved from duty here, five days' pay and allowance was given him, so, altogether, I do not think Sergeant Potts has any just cause of complaint.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

Hire and loss of small boat, $25, for which Lieut.-Col.

I would have replied to your memorandum before, but was waiting to see Lieut.-Col. Williams before doing so.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWM. HUDSON, Capt. R.

No. 312.\u2014M. M. & D. A. 2480.\u2014Report of a Board of Survey appointed at Fort Pitt, N. W. T., by Lt.-Col. Osborne Smith, C. M. G., Commanding W. L. Infantry, to examine and report upon canned meat at that station.\n\nIn addition to the sworn testimony of Mr. B. Gordon attached (to which special attention is called) the Commissioners have made personal enquiry as to the liability of such meat to deteriorate by exposure, and find that it is not uncommon when exposed to sun or other considerable heat, for a certain percentage to become damaged, or slightly damaged, next the cans; if this outer surface is carefully removed the other parts do not often appear affected; but, if the outer surface is mixed up with the whole contents, in cooking, or otherwise, it would not be palatable, and probably not wholesome. Armour & Company and Plankington & Armour (the same people, but in different cities) have a high reputation as manufacturers of these goods, which appear to demand a higher price than those produced by other manufacturers.\n\nIn the early part of April last rumors were in circulation as to the dangerous quality of these meats. After a consultation between the Commissioner of the H. B. Company and Lt.-Col. Jackson, D. A. G., Principal Supply Officer, it was decided to have samples examined by J. Edward Wright, jun., public analyst, Inland Revenue Department, at Winnipeg, (copy of report attached). The Commission are therefore of opinion that great precaution was exercised in the selection before forwarding; that the meats reported upon by the Board on 18th July were bad there appears to be no doubt; but, as the stores had been transported, first many hundred miles by rail, then many hundred miles by waggon, and probably exposed\nto the sun for weeks or months, and as this is the only apparent complaint from\nthe whole force, the case appears exceptional, and ought not to reflect upon the\nManufacturers or Contractors.\n\nThursday, 29th October, 1885.\n\nRE CANNED MEAT SUPPLIED TO TROOPS.\n\nW. C. No. 312.\u2014M. M. & D., A. 2480.\n\nDeposition under oath of Mr. B. Gordon, Manager Grocery Department of the Hudson's Bay\nCo., Winnipeg.\n\nI went to the United States to purchase, and all over Eastern Canada to different canning-\nestablishments. I consider Plankington & Armour and Armour & Co. superior to any others.\nWe could have bought other brands of corned beef from five to fifteen cents per dozen less than\npaid to Armour & Co. or Plankington & Armour.\n\nI have handled these goods for six or eight years in this country, and never had a complaint\nabout them before.\n\nI have seen cans that have been exposed to the sun for some time tainted on the outside.\nThere is a quantity of the same goods purchased at the same time now in store here. Mr. Buchan-\nan with some gentlemen, I think representing the Winnipeg Light Infantry, had a can opened\nin the store about the end of August, and took it, being in good order; of course it is liable to\nbecome bad by exposure to sun or great heat of any kind for a length of time. I think goods of\nthis brand are the best that can be got in the market.\n\nB. GORDON, Manager Grocery Department,\nHudson's Bay Company.\n\nLABORATORY INLAND REVENUE.\nWINNIPEG, 7th April, 1885.\n\nJ. WRIGLEY, Esq., Commissioner,\nHudson's Bay Co.\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed find my report on six samples of canned corn-beef received from the firm you\nrepresent and submitted to me for examination. I shall proceed with the analysis of the other\nsamples if you deem it necessary, but obtaining such pleasing results on this number of samples,\nI do not advise or suggest further work, unless it is your express desire.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have given up the appointment of Commandant, consequently have no present official connection and cannot take up any work where the papers have not been sent in. I think, however, if you would at once communicate with Dr. Roddick, you may be able to get it settled, as I left a memo for him at Moose-Jaw.\n\nIt is a pity you have left the matter unattended to so long. It could have been disposed of if you had sent it to me when I was doing duty. Is not your figure as now named rather high? I thought it was $90, but I am only speaking from memory, $70 for buckboard and $20 for harness.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. W. LAURIE.\n\nW. C. No. 453.\u2014P. Miller, teaming $54, and $88, in all $142.

C.\n\nSTONEWALL, 27th October, 1885.\n\nSir,\n\nYours of the 20th inst. to hand, and in reply\u2014My Company was equipped in Winnipeg. When uniforms and underclothing were issued, in April last, I gave orders, and saw them carried out, that each man in the Company should tie up his civilian clothing with such underwear as he did not require in a bundle and put tag on, with his name and address.\nI got two large cases, had the clothes packed in same and addressed and shipped by freight to A. B. Mitchell, Reeve of this county, who, on receipt, had the cases stored in a building owned by county at Stonewall. On the arrival of Company home the parcels were delivered and receipt taken for them by the clerk in charge of building.\n\nWhen packing cases in Winnipeg, I kept number of parcels with names going into each case.\n\nMr. Cockerill's name appears as having sent one parcel in case number one; his name also appears on clerk's book as having receipted for one parcel on the 25th of July. He reported to me then that some of his clothing was gone. I had no time then to look into it and told him then that anything missing had likely been taken by mistake by some of the men and no doubt would be sent back; but as nothing has been returned, anything gone out of parcel must have been stolen at Winnipeg.\n\nI have delayed answering your letter wishing to see the sergeant in charge of men when parcels were delivered to them. When he returns I will let you know what Cockerill at that time said was missing from his parcel.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. J. JACKSON, Capt.,\nD.

No. 397, Wm. R. Sinclair, transport of supplies per contract, $52,153.80. The conclusive evidence of Mr. Murphy (late shipping clerk at Clarke's Crossing) goes to prove the freight on the steamer covered the original receipts from Clarke's Crossing, which receipts were returned to Sinclair, and thereby cancelled, and the Steamer Bills of Lading signed by him. A copy of this evidence is attached to claim, as also a statement showing in detail the weight of supplies received by Mr. Sinclair and the weight delivered at destination (Battleford). By this it is shown that there is a shortage on oats delivered of 163,553 lbs, at 2c. per lb = $3,271.06, which is deducted from the account; also $3,079.93 for forage and rations used by him (see detailed account attached); total reduction, $6,350.99; the balance, $45,802.81, is recommended for payment.\n\nApproved.\u2014A.

No. 473.\u2014M. M. & D. A. 1953.\u2014Andrew Thompson, Toronto, for damage to Schooner \"M. L. Brock,\" by Troops at Port Munro,\u2014original claim, $629.83, subsequent claim increased to $849.43.\n\nThe Commission carefully considered the whole correspondence. The letter of Joseph Cochran, dated September 24th, 1885, to John Ross establishes the fact that the vessel had been left with stern ports and hatches open during the winter, allowing a large quantity of snow and ice to accumulate in her hold. This was cleaned out, under the supervision of Mr. Cochran, by employees of the C. P. R., stoves being procured from various places to use for the purpose; he also states that the stove in the forecastle was broken and unfit for use at that time. Mr. John A. McDonald's letter, dated 23rd October, to the Minister, states that two pairs of blankets were taken from the Captain's room, and the bed-clothes in the forecastle were used; as no inventory had been taken the claim must have been made up from memory. The Schooner was frozen in, consequently the Troops could not have injured her bottom, so as to necessitate her going into dry-dock for repairs. After considering all the circumstances it is believed the vessel had been left open all winter, was much out of repair, and would, under any circumstances,\nhave required to be hauled out and refitted before being used. No doubt the old sail could have been repaired and sold for a large sum. Giving the benefit of all doubt to the claimant, it is recommended that the sum of $245.50 be paid as full compensation, made up as follows:\n\nApproved.\u2014A. P. C.\n\n18 pairs blankets, at $3.50 ................................................................. $66.50\n9 mattresses destroyed, at $2 .............................................................. 18.00\n1 pair signal or side lights ............................................................... 25.00\n1 anchor light .................................................................................. 5.00\nLamp chimneys and dishes broken .................................................... 5.00\nHatch covers, and canvas cut ........................................................... 8.00\nMain sail (\u00bd cost of new) ................................................................. 73.00\nBulk-head destroyed ........................................................................ 45.00\n\n$245.50\n\nW.

With regard to the company Pay Lists No. 1 and 2, it is recommended that payment be made on the following basis, in No. 1 Pay Lists (amounting to $542.75) the pay of each man, according to rank, be reduced to the rates allowed for Infantry Companies, and in Pay List No. 2, for mounted men (amounting to, 5501.25), the rates be reduced to those allowed to Cavalry Corps, and further that the ten men employed on special courier service (whose names and time of service appear on list attached to No. 2 Pay List) have their pay made up to $2.50 per day (to cover all pay) for such time as they were actually employed on the special courier service.

C. No. 24.\u2014M. & M. and D. A. 2062.\u2014The Winnipeg and Western Transportation Co., for services, $62,891.00. Referring to previous reports of 10th September and 3rd October, the Commission having since taken evidence upon oath, have arrived at the following conclusion.\n\nThe Steamer \"Northcote\" entered Government service on the day of leaving Medicine Hat, 7th April, and as deposed by Mr. W. R. Talbot, the Purser, unloaded all Government stores at Prince Albert on 3rd June, after which she proceeded on the usual business of the company, making 58 days in Government service, $250 per day, $14,500.00.\n\nThe Steamer \"Northwest\" entered the service on 12th May the date Captain Sheets and crew took possession of her at Prince Albert (vide Captain Sheets' sworn testimony), and was employed up to the 12th July, when she arrived at Grand Rapids, with the returning troops, making 62 days in Government service, at $250.00 per day $15,500.00.\n\nThe Steamer \"Marquis\" entered the Government service the day she left Prince Albert, on 1st May (as shown by telegrams from Lt.-Col. A. G. Irvine, N. W. M. Police and Superintendent Perry, N. W. M. Police), and was employed up to 12th July, when she arrived at Grand Rapids with the returning troops, making 73 days in Government service, at $250.00 per day = $18,250.00, making the total value of services rendered by the boats $48,250.00, and for transportation of baggage by tramway at Grand Rapids, $141.00. The claim is thus reduced $14,500; the balance, $48,391.00, is recommended for payment.\n\nApproved.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. H. JACKSON, Lt.-Col., D. A. G.,\nChairman.\n\nW. H. FORREST, Lt. Col.,\nMember\n\nEDMUND B. HOLT,\nSecretary.\n\nIn certifying the correctness of the rate of contract and recommending payment, I was guided by the voucher of service signed by Major General Sir Fred. Middleton; it now turns out that this voucher was only meant to be a retainer.\n\nE. A. WHITEHEAD, Lt.-Col.,\nMember:\n\nWINNIPEG, Thursday, 29th October, 1885.\n\nDeposition of Captain James Sheets, Winnipeg, under oath, Commander of \"Northcote\" and \"Northwest.\"\n\n1 Q. Where were boats \"Northcote,\" \"Marquis\" and \"Northwest\" wintered last winter?\n   A. \"Northcote\" wintered at Medicine Hat, the \"Northwest,\" at Prince Albert, and the \"Marquis\" four miles above Prince Albert.\n\n2 Q. When was the \"Northcote\" put in the water this spring?\n   A. On the 6th day of April.\n\n3 Q. When was the \"Marquis\" put in the water this spring?\n   A. I do not know. I did not get round to Prince Albert till 12th May, the \"Marquis\" was there with Troops on at Hudson's Bay Landing, about 3 miles below Batoche. \"Marquis\" was sunk about 10th or 11th April, and raised again.\n\n4 Q. When was the \"Northwest\" put in the water this spring?\n   A. I was not there and don't know.\n5 Q. What was the average date or time for opening of Lake Winnipeg.\nA. Near the 1st of June; it was opened in May, from 1st to 10th June usually.\n\n6 Q. Do these Steamers run in conjunction with the Lake Steamers?\nA. Yes, the boats on the North Branch do. The South Branch opens about 27th March or 1st April; North Branch about 9th or 10th April.\n\n7 Q. At what date were the steamers \"Marquis\" and \"Northwest\" ready for freighting this season?\nA. They were ready about 11th April, they had steam up then. I was not there, but the Captain told me so.\n\n8 Q. How soon after were they in the service of the Government?\nA. On the 12th April, Mr. Bedson said so.\n\n9 Q. Did you go for the steamers \"Marquis\" and \"Northwest\" about the 7th May last from Clarke's Crossing?\nA. About 12th May I took some of the men with me, about 10 or 12 men were working on the \"Northwest.\"\n\n10 Q. Could they have been used for any other service before the opening of Lake Winnipeg?\nA. Oh, yes, they did local traffic, that is on the North Branch.\n\n11 Q. How long were the steamers lying idle after the 24th May?\nA. Sometimes would lay 2 days at Fort Pitt and were moving about up and down, carrying Troops and anything else they were wanted to do, laid up 2 or 3 days at a time, sometimes one day.\n\nJAS. SHEETS.\n\nWINNIPEG, Friday, 30th October, 1885.\n\nEvidence under oath of Mr. Walter R. Talbot, late Purser steamer \"Northcote.\"\nTook goods for Mr. Sinclair; don't know how the goods came to Telegraph Coulee. I came from Battleford on steamer \"Northcote,\" and they were there then.\n\nThey were not moved by boat from Clarke's Crossing to Telegraph Coulee, not that I am aware of. They came over land, as I understood. The goods shipped from Clarke's Crossing to Battleford via Telegraph Coulee were taken on board steamer at Telegraph Coulee. I don't know why Sinclair signed these receipts; only my signature was necessary. The receipts, I suppose, were given with a view of securing Murphy, supply clerk.\n\nCaptain Sheets joined the steamer Northwest about 11th or 12th May. Met the steamer \"Marquis\" at Hudson's Bay Landing, at which time Captain Sheets left the \"Northcote\" and went overland to Prince Albert, a distance of 18 miles, to take command of the \"Northwest.\"\n\nThe \"Northcote\" went out of the Government service some time in June. I think about the night of the 16th June.\n\nThe \"Northcote\" left Prince Albert to go to Grand Rapids on 3rd June. All the Government stores were left at Prince Albert at that time. It takes about five days to go from Prince Albert to Grand Rapids.\n\nW. R. TALBOT.\n\nREPORT.

No. 487.\u2014M. M. & D. A. 2596.\u2014Lt.-Col. A. McKeand, 90th Battalion,\nfor guard on arms, etc., $248. Caps, boots, etc., $6,643, and officers' kit, $2,400. Command pay, $150. Loss on Life Insurance Policy, $765.10. Item No. 1,248, pay of four men for mounting guard over arms, etc. Cavalry, Field Battery, and 90th Battalion at Winnipeg, from July, 1884, for 62 days, at $1 per day, each man.\n\nA correspondence seems to have taken place between Honorable John Norquay and Sir John A. MacDonald on the subject which resulted in the guard being mounted by order of Lt.-Col. Kennedy in the absence of the D. A. G.; this service appears to have been performed in good faith, and payment in a great measure has been made to the men from the regimental fund as explained by Lt.-Col. McKeand, to whom it is recommended the amount be paid in full;\n\nItem No. 2, $6,643 and $2,400.\u2014Claim for allowance of money in lieu of kit for officers, N. C. O. and men.

McKeand explained that the Life Association of Canada had sold out to a Company in New York and this Company cancelled the Policy on hearing of his exposure to danger while in command of the 90th battalion; a telegram attached to the papers signed by John Cameron, manager, dated Hamilton, June 18th, 1885, addressed to Alfred McKeand, Winnipeg, notifies forfeiture on account of incurring risk without permission.\n\nLt.-Col. McKeand states that his friend with whom he left his private business failed to notify the Company in accordance with what he supposed to be the condition on the Policy. The Policy would have matured about 1890 or 1891; about $650 had been paid on it and $234.90 returned, shewing an apparent loss of $415.10. The Commission are of opinion that the matter should be settled between the Claimant and the Assurance Company, and cannot be made a claim against the Government. Rejected.\n\nW. H.

Costigan to be allowed extra time, I beg to report as under:\n\nIn order to prevent pilfering on the route, and delay on the way, I stipulated that the teams were to be kept together as much as possible, and the time allowed to make the trip to Edmonton and return to Calgary was (24) twenty-four days, and if they made a second trip from Red Deer to Edmonton, twelve days to be allowed.\n\nThe only stipulation given was that if men or horses were attacked by an armed force the Government would be responsible, but not otherwise; and any delay beyond twenty-four days would not be allowed; that the contingencies of the route were well known to them, and unless they loaded up on these conditions they could retire and allow others to go.\n\nThe teams were loaded up and dispatched as soon as possible. It is well known that such a large number of waggons and carts could not ferry the river all at one time, nor in fact all in one day, so that it was necessary to carry out the orders not to separate, that those who got over the river first should wait until the others got across, and then move on altogether under the escort.\n\nWhen these teamsters returned they were at once furnished with their vouchers for the time, as agreed upon, and they got their vouchers paid at the Hudson's Bay Co.\n\nI consider they have all been paid what was promised them, and which was well understood, and as a proof of this, more than half of the same convoy, especially the Half-breeds, never made any remonstrance, but accepted their vouchers without any difficulty, knowing perfectly well that they had only carried out their part of the bargain.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nALEX.

No. 237.\u2014I. G. Baker & Co., freighting supplies by bull or ox teams, $15,480. A letter under date of April 1st, 1885, from J. G. Baker & Co., to the Honorable the Minister of Militia and Defence, offering ox-teams at a certain rate per day, appears to be the document containing what purports to be the agreement, although there is nothing to show acceptance by the Minister.\n\nNo. 1. Account, $1,260.*\n\nNo. 2. Account, $11,070.\n\nNo. 3.\u2014Account, $1,800. If the Honorable the Minister considered the letter above referred to a contract, and he ordered the teams into the service, as stated, the three accounts amounting to $14,130 appear to be regular, and are recommended for payment in full.\n\nNo. 4. Account, $1350. There is nothing to show that these six teams left McLeod or arrived at Calgary on the contrary, Mr. McGibbon states in his report, attached to the claims, that they were not reported to him; had they been so reported they would have been loaded at once; it is evident, therefore, no service was rendered, consequently this account cannot be recommended, and is rejected.\n\nPayment approved.\u2014A.

A. P. CARON,\nMinister Militia,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nWe will furnish you twenty-four ox-teams, consisting of two wagons and twelve head of cattle each, at Fort McLeod and proceed at once to Swift Current via Medicine Hat.\n\nEach team will transport from ten to sixteen thousand pounds, according to the state of the roads.\n\nIt will take ten or twelve days to reach Medicine Hat, and if you are in a hurry for them when they reach that point, you can have them brought to Swift Current by rail. We will place the teams subject to your orders from time they leave McLeod and will charge you ($15.00) fifteen dollars per day for the use of each team, including drivers from the time they leave that point until they return.\n\nWe will also furnish you beef at (6) six cents per pound gross, provided you require one-hundred head or more and can have them delivered at any time.\n\nWe have a large stock of provisions at Fort McLeod if any required.\n\nVery respectfully,\n\nI. G. BAKER & CO.\nWINNIPEG, 13th November, 1885.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to submit the following report regarding the claim of I. G. Baker & Co., for the bull teams, viz.:\n\n1. Claim ........................................ $1,260.00\n2. \" ............................................ 1,107.00\n3. \" ............................................ 1,809.00\n4. \" ............................................ 1,356.00\n\n$1,5480.00\n\nNo. 1.\n\nIt seems is for time occupied on an order received early in April, but which was countermanded, and the time 3\u00bd days for 24 yoke is charged for.\n\nI have knowledge of the transaction, but I was told that the orders came direct from Ottawa.\n\nNo. 2.\n\nWhen I arrived in Calgary these (9) teams were there, some of them being used hauling supplies from the Depot to the Fort. I had them all loaded up for Edmonton, but, owing to the want of an escort, the train did not start until 30th May, when it left for Edmonton with 69,692 pounds freight, which was as much as they could take, owing to the bad state of the roads. The amount of this freight, at 8 cts. a pound, would be $5575.36; but Baker & Co. charge according to an agreement they told me they made in Ottawa, from the day they started from McLeod till their return to the same place.\n\nThe team returned from Edmonton to Calgary, 12th July.\n\nNo. 3.\n\nThese teams (8) arrived from McLeod in the end of May, and were at once loaded up for Red Deer, taking 81,168 pounds, at 4 cts., $3246.72, for which a voucher was granted to J. G. Baker & Co., and which was paid by the H. B. Co. The claim of $1800 is for the time taken to come from McLeod to Calgary and return.\n\nNo. 4.\n\nAppears to be a claim for (6) ox-teams coming from McLeod to Calgary and return. This team did no work. It was not reported to me or I would have loaded it at once, but I never heard of its being in Calgary until I saw this account.\n\nI would remark that no rations were furnished to these teams or the drivers, and that they delivered the goods at Red Deer and Edmonton in splendid condition.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nALEX. McGIBBON.\n\nLieut.\u2014Col. JACKSON, D. A.

Although this Corps consisted of only two troops, a Paymaster has been allowed for, to look after payments; Major B. would appear, therefore, to have been placed on no worse footing than any other Corps. Rejected.\n\nW. C. No. 597.\u2014John Balsillie, for pay, etc., as Chief Accountant, Transport service. This claim has been already reported upon. See Report 3rd October, W. C.

Peebles, Superintendent of Stores, Winnipeg, for difference between pay of rank and allowances and pay as Superintendent of Stores, $1,066.50.\n\nThe Commission can testify to the continuous important and arduous duties performed by Lt.-Col. Peebles, and think he will be underpaid by receiving sufficient increase to come up to pay of rank, without allowances, which is only equal to the\npay of his clerk; it is therefore recommended that $3.50 per day be paid, making a reduction on claim of $237.\n\nW. C. No. 599.\u2014Hope Hay, pay for services and horse-hire for Boulton's Corps, $91. Recommended for payment in full. Notwithstanding Major Boulton requests that payment be made to him, it is recommended that the cheque be made to the order of Hope Hay, and sent under cover to Major Boulton.\n\nA. P. C.\n\nW. C. No. 115.\u2014Sergent Stiff, Steele's Scouts, horse taken $150. It appears by Captain Oswald's letter and proceedings of Board, attached to claim, that the horse was taken over by the Government at Fort Pitt. Captain Oswald states he paid McCouley $150 for the horse, and deducted amount from Stiff's pay, and as the same officer has handed $20 to the principal Pay Officer on account of Government it is recommended that the amount of this claim $150, and $20, in all $170, be paid to the Hudson Bay Co., to cover advance made by them to Sergeant Stiff and not charged in account.\n\nA.

As there were 2 Troops of Boulton's, 1 of French's, 1 of Dennis Corps, making 4 Troops to look after\u2014equal to a Regiment of Cavalry in Canadian Militia\u2014it would appear reasonable that a Surgeon should be allowed.

C.\n\nIn connection with the above Report, the Commission now desire to say that after having heard a large amount of evidence under oath on the subject of freighting and contracts, they are of opinion that John Stewart had no interest or collusion with Officers of the Transport service, or contractors to the detriment of the Government. As this payment has been withheld for several months, doubtless causing inconvenience and loss to Mr. Stewart, the Commission would most respectfully recommend payment without further delay.\n\nW. H.

O. C. authorized an increased number of men, the following articles were also supplied: 30 pairs of winter boots, 12 waterproof coats, 30 duck blouses (double-breasted), 30 pairs cloth trousers, 40 forage caps and 4 towels, thus showing the men were liberally supplied for the very short service, and as the articles were not of a military pattern they have been retained by the men.

C. No. 459.\u2014Hudson's Bay Co., for rent of buildings at Edmonton, $500. Several hundred dollars having been spent in repairing the building by the Government, and being now rented to the North-west Police; and Mr. Strachan having examined the property and reported the facts, it is considered $50 per month is sufficient remuneration; $250 is therefore deducted, and the balance, $250, recommended for payment.\"\n\nApproved.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nThe Accountant of the Hudson's Bay Co. having written upon the above award, under date of 23rd November, 1885, requesting that his letter be forwarded to the Department, which is herewith enclosed, the Commission desire to say Mr. J. K. Strachan, who has lived in this part of the country for some years, and who was sent to clear up the stores at various points on the Edmonton Trail and handsome over to the Indian Department, has sufficient knowledge of the value of property to ensure respect for his opinion. He states the large amount of repairs put upon an old dilapidated boat-house, to convert it into a hospital, and charged against the Government, leaving the building in good condition for the N. W. M. Police, now in possession, are of sufficient value, with the $50 per month awarded, to cover full rental of the property. A considerable sum has also been awarded for cleaning up the premises after the Troops evacuated. Prospective damages cannot be entertained by the Commission, as it is generally understood the stagnation in trade and the unsettled state of the country were such that, had it not been for the influx of troops and expenditure by Government, business transactions would have been merely nominal. The Commission cannot therefore make any further recommendation in the case.\n\nW. H. JACKSON, Lt.-Col., D. A.G.,\nChairman.\n\nE. A. WHITEHEAD, Lt.-Col.,\nMember.\n\nW. H.

White spotted mules, about 5 years old. They paid $640 for mules, harness and waggon. The bargain was $600 for mules and harness. It was cash and part note at six months.

Reid, Robt. Sinclair and James Sinclair, late of the Yorkton Militia. I have the honor to state for the information of the Commission that I did not recommend payment of the sum of $13.75 to John F. Reid for meals supplied men sent out to protect his home and property, as I, at the time, considered the charge excessive. Since then, I have made enquiries and my Acting Quarter-Master Sergeant informs me that, in obedience to my orders, rations were issued to the men detailed for this duty for one day, but, owing to circumstances, the men had to remain in the neighborhood for two days, hence the charges as they were at J. F. Reid's house, and he supplied the meals. As regards paying the men named, I should like to see it done, and not only the four named, but others as under, viz.: Color Sergeant H. B. Tydd, Broadview Assn., 1st to 17th June, at 75 cts. per diem .......$12.75\nActg. Qr.-Mr. Sergeant J. M. R. Neelie, P.O.

Welbury, Yorkton Asso., 1st to 13th June, at 75 cts. per diem ......................... 9.75\n\nI stopped the pay of these Non-Commissioned Officers and men for June, as per pay list for that month, on account of stores lost; but, considering the nature of the duty these men had to perform, and that the articles were lost whilst on actual service, if possible I should be pleased if the Commission favorably entertained their claims.\n\nThe amounts so deducted have been placed through Lieut.-Col. Jackson, D.A.G., to the credit of the Department of Militia and Defence.\n\nI herewith return the papers sent to me.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nT.

Perry was in command of a Detachment of Mounted Police, as was his duty, and for which he is retained in the North West Territories. There is nothing to show that Lt.-Col. Smith or Major-General Strange had authority to appoint or promote officers. In this case Mr. Perry appears to have assumed the rank of Major, which doubtless did an injustice to officers who had been appointed by the Honorable the Minister. Furthermore, the force was not sufficiently large to warrant an additional number of Staff Officers, consequently the claim cannot be recommended. Rejected.\n\nA. P. C.\n\nW. C.

Paymaster Leacock made a refund of $25 on 5th November, to cover extra rations drawn by the Winnipeg Light Infantry, purchased at Calgary and other points, and charged to the Department.\n\nIt is presumed these accounts have been paid or reported upon by the Commission for payment, consequently the money should be retained. Major John Lewis claims that $15.75 was deducted from his pay, and Captain Pillsworth claims that $12 was deducted from him in like manner, making a total retained by Paymaster Leacock of $27.75, while he refunded to the Department only $25. If these rations (butter and other luxuries) were used by the officers generally, a fair assessment should be made on all, and the two Officers above named (Major Lewis and Captain Pillsworth) reimbursed proportionately. The matter appears to be purely regimental, and does not come within the scope of the Commission, but it is respectfully recommended that the officer commanding the Corps be instructed through the District Staff to make such settlement with the officers by assessment or otherwise as will cause each to bear a fair proportion.\n\nW.

HOLT,\nSecretary.\n\nWINNIPEG, December 1st, 1885.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor, in reference to war claim No. 117 for the Winnipeg Light Infantry, as noted to me in Major Guy's letter of the 11th ultimo, under the headings:\n\nNo. 1.\u2014For boat-building $111.75.\nNo. 2.\u2014Pay List, road-making, $721.00.\nNo. 3.\u2014Road-making, $169.50.\n\nof which the first was reduced and the two latter rejected, respectfully to ask that the Honorable the Minister of \"M. and D.\" will be pleased to reconsider his decision on these claims on the following grounds:\n\n1st. That the rates were authorized, and the men employed by the immediate authority of Major-General Strange at the time commanding the Alberta Field Force.\n\nThat the rates were fixed at different amounts, in accordance with the rank of the men employed.\n\nIn the reduction, therefore, made in the first instance, beyond the fact that the parties employed would not receive the amount which it was agreed they were to be paid, it would be impracticable without knowing the causes which led to the reduction of $63.25 in this claim, properly to apportion the amount authorized, as shewn by Major Guy's letter above alluded to; I therefore returned a cheque for $48.50, which Major Guy had forwarded to me in settlement of the pay-list in question.\n\n2nd. With reference to pay-lists 2 and 3, I would respectfully point out for the Minister's consideration that the parties employed were not ordinary roadmaking fatigues, but specially detailed parties of skilled workmen who were detached from the regiment under my command and placed under the charge of a Staff Officer appointed by Major General Strange.\n\nThat although classed as road-makers they were practically bridge-builders and skilled axe men, not constructing a mere temporary road for the passage of their own regiment, but making a good and practicable road not only for the column to which their corps was attached and for supplies, but for the general purposes of the campaign.\nThat the work was most excellently performed, and proved of the greatest value for the whole force which subsequently used it.\n\nThat a serious discontent exists, in what the men employed, rightly or wrongly, consider a grievous injustice, in that they were employed by the Major-General commanding the Column at certain authorized rates and that payment is now largely reduced, in some instances, or in others wholly rejected. Under these circumstances I have deemed it my duty again to bring forward the question for consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\nW.

Much had been said through the public prints, as well as by general rumor, the truthfulness of which may be judged by the evidence, which is attached, and upon which this report is based; consequently, any errors in judgment can be corrected by reference to the papers.\n\nThe service was exceptional, and as no organization existed in the country, whose duty it was to undertake the work, the service of civilians and others, who were available, were employed, with the view of facilitating rapidity of movement, in order that the rebellion might be stamped out in the shortest possible time; consequently under the circumstances it might not be unreasonable to make considerable allowance for slight irregularities, particularly as all appeared to have been imbued with the one object of rendering every possible assistance.\n\nThat contractors, and the people generally, were exorbitant in their demands, no person need deny, but those who are wise after an event, if placed in similar positions, would not in all probability have shown a different record.\n\nThe floating rumors having finally culminated in a letter, hereto annexed, addressed to two of the Commission, containing what may be called Twenty-nine (29) charges, and as the Honorable the Minister had expressed a wish that these should be thoroughly investigated, the Commission most respectfully submit the following report on each article or charge separately.\n\n1st. The tender of John Stewart was for three (3) different trails, on the 19th May. General Laurie accepted the offer for the Moose-Jaw trail, his offer being the lowest; this contract subsequently approved by Lt.-Col. Whitehead.\n\n2nd. Major W. R. Bell appears to have attempted to induce Stewart to throw up the contract he had secured, and accept a share with Bell and others in the contracts covering all the different trails; a memorandum of this matter was signed by W. R. Bell and John Stewart, at Qu'Appelle, on 21st May. (See Exhibit R.). Stewart swears that his object in signing this paper was to get Bell to recognize the contract he had made with General Laurie but not with the intention of carrying out the terms of the memorandum. After this, Stewart frustrated the attempt to ship at Moose-Jaw in the name of Ross and Riddle, which was done while Bell was at Moose-Jaw, on the 27th or 28th May. J. L. Lewis' conversation with, and telegrams to, Stewart show an attempt was being made to secure Stewart's contract for others.\n3rd. It is admitted W. E. Jones, Chief Clerk of transport under Bell, went to Saskatchewan Landing, and shipped about 90 tons for Battleford. Bell swears this was to protect the Government, and to prevent a stoppage in the forwarding of supplies, pending the acceptance of tenders for freighting, by the tonnage system. Jones swears he went there and engaged the teams at $70 per ton, expecting he was to have the contract, which Bell had promised to get for him if possible in recognition of his services as clerk, and there is no reason to doubt Bell knew the stores could be hauled for $70 per ton as arranged by Jones, when he offered the contract to Thomas Howard at $125 per ton, less $10 for feed for teams. There is no date showing when Howard accepted this contract, or when approved by Lt.-Col Whitehead.\n\nIf Howard has not been charged for the forage, $10 per ton should be claimed on all stores freighted, and the question of charging for the forage and rations consumed during the detention of teams for about twelve days, at the Saskatchewan Landing, should be considered, more particularly as the profits have been $45 per ton, after deducting $10 for forage.\n\nThe peculiarity of this contract is, Bell wrote Howard in letter form offering him the contract at above prices; Howard accepting on bottom of letter, which was made to answer for a contract; so it appears no tender was made except Stewart's to General Laurie, which was higher than the amount paid.\n\n4th. No bills of lading appear to have been issued at Saskatchewan Landing in favor of Bell, Lewis & Co.\n\n5th. Major W. R. Bell admits he forwarded (80) teams from Qu'Appelle to Swift-Current for that contract, because the contractors there refused to release the H. B. Co. from the day rate engagement; but Thomas Howard's evidence shows there were plenty of teams there willing to work. The charges for the transport of these teams should be refunded either by Bell or Howard, Lt.-Col Whitehead having struck free transport out of the contract before approval.\n\n6th. There appears no doubt Thomas Howard made a contract which was approved by Col. Whitehead, on the 4th or 5th June; Kelly swears the negotiations closed on the morning of 6th June; Howard proceeded to Saskatchewan Landing, reaching there on or about the 10th or 11th of that month, to carry on the work; he relieved Jones, took bills of lading in his own name, and also assumed all that had been shipped by Jones; this he swears was the condition on which he took the contract. Howard also says he paid the teamsters who performed this part of the work.\n\n7th and 8th. Tenders were advertised for to be received on the 5th June; a contract was entered into between Bell and Thomas Howard, dated Qu'Appelle, 3rd June, in form of a letter from Major Bell; this, if mailed on the 3rd, could not reach Winnipeg before the evening of the 4th; in all probability this was approved by Lt.-Whitehead on the 5th, or early on the morning of the 6th, as stated by Kelly; the object being, as explained in Lt.-Col. Whitehead's evidence, to prevent any detention of supplies moving forward, and to change to the tonnage system, pending the decision of the Minister, to whom the tenders received on 5th June were forwarded.\n\n9th and 10th. John Stewart was telegraphed to by Lt.-Col. Whitehead, on 8th June, cancelling his contract. Thomas Howard and Bell and Lewis continued to freight, but not from Moose-jaw to the Elbow and Clarke's Crossing, trails which had been covered by John Stewart's contract, their contracts being from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford, and Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing, respectively.\n\n11th. There is no evidence to show that Lt.-Col. Whitehead gave a contract to a personal friend, for 20 head of cattle, without tenders, and at a loss to the Government. A contract was entered into on the tender of one J. H. Harris, for 20 head of cattle, to be delivered at Battleford, at 16c. per pound dead weight, one cent less than was being paid there by the troops under a former contract. The herd was so small, few would undertake the drive of about seven hundred miles for the amount of profits realized. $413.12 was deducted from the claim for loss in weight during the drive. Mr. H. S. Masterman, to whom the contract had been assigned, declined to accept the sum tendered, but has since consented to do so.\n12th. Bell and Lewis were paid in accordance with the terms of their contract, which was the lowest offer, and in letter form from W. R. Bell. Rates were falling daily, but no such excess as stated could have been paid, John Stewart's tender being $10 per ton higher.\n\n13th and 14th. Major W. R. Bell was a member of the firm of Bell & Lewis or Bell Lewis & Co., for a short time. His sworn evidence shows he withdrew about the 4th or 9th June, pursuant to orders from General Middleton. Lt.-Col. Whitehead certified and recommended payment, but not until after the date Bell swears he had nothing to do with the firm.\n\n15th. As before stated Bell or his clerk Jones, did superintend the shipping for Bell, Lewis & Co., from the 22nd May, to the 4th or 9th June, when C. H. Fox was sent by Jno. L. Lewis to take over the work; he appears to have made his first shipment on or about the 9th June.\n\n16th. Major W. R. Bell hired and loaded the teams for this contract during the 22nd May, and up to or about the 4th or 9th June, as before stated; there is no evidence to show rotten hay was loaded.\n\n17th and 18th. Major W. R. Bell did sign an agreement on the 21st May with John Stewart, for the purpose of sharing the profits in freighting over the several trails. Stewart swears he entered into this agreement for the purpose of getting Bell to recognize his contract with Major General Laurie, but made no further effort to carry it out, in fact declined to do so; this frustrated Bell's design. The telegrams and correspondence (Exhibits A. to R., John Stewart's evidence), particularly a note written by Bell at Moose-jaw, May 27th, addressed to \"my Dear Stewart,\" in which he says he \"has quite cleared himself with the General, and laid a foundation for a good thing,\" shows Bell was trying to manipulate the various contracts for his own benefit. These very urgent telegrams and letters passed immediately after Bell's visit to Winnipeg, about the 19th or 20th of May.\n\n19th. The evidence goes to show Bell did cause Stewart trouble about the Moose-jaw contract. A clerk was sent up from Qu'Appelle with shipping bills written in with the name of Bell, Lewis & Co., as contractors. As soon as Stewart discovered this he took steps and had it discontinued.\n\n20th. The evidence shows that John L. Lewis is one of the firm of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh, coal merchants, Winnipeg, and not an employee.\n\n21st. There appears to have been an impression Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh were the contractors, but Bell's evidence shows they were not.\n\n22nd. There is no evidence to show any person received the profits of the contract except Jno. L. Lewis. The transactions were not shown in the books of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh, although the receipts were deposited to their credit in Bank of Montreal, and chequed out by Jno. L. Lewis, who is the managing-director of the firm.\n\n23rd. Teams were sometimes reloaded at Humboldt with sufficient to make up what were left off for the use of the troops at that station, or with stores left by broken down teams. This was quite legitimate and no loss to the Government, except so far as the supplies were issued for the subsistence of the men and teams of Bell Lewis & Co., which the Commission think should have been issued at Qu'Appelle station, and conveyed by the teamsters free to the Government.\n\n24th. There is no evidence to show irregularities in the payment of teams.\n\n25th. It appears Major Bell had an interest in some of the teams, nine of which were paid for at $10 per day, to Bell personally by the H. B. Co., on Pay Roll No. 7, as shown in statement No. 4, H. B. Co. account July 6th. He also had about 20 horses and carts, but there is no evidence to show he had a silent interest in the profits of teams.\n\n26th. The teams of the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co. received $10 per day for a long period; those with General Middleton's Column until the close of the campaign. Bell's excuse for not reducing the pay of these teams was, that as the teams had to return to Qu'Appelle, before a reduction could be made, the troops would be interfered with; but as teams working at the reduced rate were constantly\ngoing to and from the front, a change could have been effected at any time without disarranging the services. As teams with the troops frequently made long halts, their work was not so laborious as those moving continuously on the trails; consequently the rate per day should have been reduced as soon as the price fell to $6.50, or at the time S. L. Bedson, transport officer with General Middleton, telegraphed, April 8th, to Bell that not more than $8 per day was to be paid for teams then being engaged (and sufficient days added to enable teams to return). On or about the 11th April, teams were engaged at $6.50, per diem.\n\n27th and 28th. About 1003 tons of hay, in addition to 49 tons not yet paid for were delivered (vide Exhibit \"A\" in evidence of William Clarke, Factor H. B. Co.). Bell says there was a written contract between Alex. McDonald, H. B. Co.'s Agent at Fort Qu'Appelle, and himself, as Manager of the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co., for 500 tons at $20 for loose and $22 for pressed and double wired. Wm. Clarke, Factor, says there was only a verbal contract; subsequently Mr. Clarke, on behalf of the H. B. Co., as agents of the Government, entered into an agreement with Major Bell, as a personal contractor, for pressed double wired hay at $25 per ton. W. L. Boyle, President of the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co., says the Company delivered less than 300 tons. As 1003 tons were delivered and paid for, not less than 703 tons must have been on Bell's private account. Exhibit \"A\" shows that he was paid by the H. B. Co. $10,732.85, Beecher says, $9,179.35; but if the Farming Co. delivered only 300 tons, Bell must have received individually fully $6,842.15 more.\n\nWm. Clarke's evidence shows $25 per ton was paid Bell for what he delivered on his personal account. As the price at Qu'Appelle was, from $12 to $15, the latter sum may be taken as the outside average, when pressed and double wired, showing a net profit to Bell of $10 per ton. Deduct 300 tons from the 1003 delivered and paid for, leaves 703 tons on Bell's private account, showing a profit of $7030; in addition the commission on the 703 tons to the H. B. Co. would amount to $908.75.\n\nBell being Assistant Transport Officer, under S. L. Bedson, his appointment having been, he says, confirmed by Field Orders, also Manager of the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co., as well as private Contractor, might, without feeling he was influenced by personal interests, deliver, receive and forward more hay than was actually necessary, causing loss to the Government, as at Clarke's Crossing, where there were several hundred tons unused and useless.\n\nCaptain H. Swinford, who claims to have been Chief Commissariat Officer at the base lines, is Secretary and Treasurer of the Winnipeg and Western Transportation Co., which may be considered a branch of the H. B. Co., or it is at all events controlled by that institution. This officer may have ordered, accepted and forwarded a greater quantity of hay and other stores than the strength of the force demanded, by not making a calculation as to quantity required per day, and not through the influence of his business connections. The loads of hay were measured in accordance with the custom of the country, and the weight of the bales frequently verified by the figures on each bale, and the railway weigh-bills (see Captain Swinford's evidence) all bear testimony to the zeal and energy displayed by these two officers.\n\n29th. So far as known no attempt has been made to prevent transport accounts being examined. Witnesses have been subpoenaed as requested or required, and every facility granted for the purpose, if possible, of arriving at the truth.\n\nAs a comparison of the cost of transport by the day and tonnage systems, the Commission submit the following as being fairly correct:\n\nQu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing, 18 days for the round trip, teams were being paid from $5 to $8 per day by the Government, $6.50 being the ruling figure after about 12th April; $7, therefore, would be an outside average, making $126 for the trip by the day, or say for one ton.\n\nThe contract freighting price was $140 per ton. As these team conveyed from one and a half tons and upwards, one ton at least should have been hauled by teams working for Government by the day, more particularly as the tonnage teams were paid by the Contractors only $4.50 per day. At this price a trip-one and a half ton\nwould cost the Contractor $81 instead of $126 for one ton, thus leaving a much larger margin of profits to Bell, Lewis & Co., who were also to provide teams at $5 per day on special service, if required.\n\nMoose Jaw to Clarke's Crossing, 14 days allowed for the round trip, at $7 per day, as the outside average, $98 for the trip by the day, say for one ton. Freighting contract price per ton, $110. Same remarks apply to the Qu'Appelle trail, except Contractor conveyed subsistence for men and teams from Moose Jaw; these supplies were charged up and deducted from Stewart's account. The Contractor was to supply teams if required for special service at $5 per day. At this price $70 would transport not less than one ton.\n\nForage and rations were supplied by the Government to teams working by the day, and $10 per ton was to be deducted from those freighting over the Qu'Appelle trail.\n\nIt appears in evidence Bell, Lewis & Co.'s teamsters drew rations and forage at each station as they proceeded. These supplies had been hauled from Qu'Appelle Station at great cost to the Government; consequently $10 per ton was quite insufficient to cover this expense. The Commission therefore are of opinion the freighting by the ton was not the cheaper to the Government.\n\nIf deductions have not been made from previous claims of Bell, Lewis & Co. for subsistence it is respectfully recommended $10 per ton be deducted for each ton transported. Amount to be deducted from pending claims, or else Jno. L. Lewis called upon to refund the amount.\n\nAfter having carefully weighed the evidence, and considered the circumstances, the Commission have come to the following conclusion:\n\n1st. Lieut.-Col Whitehead was not in collusion with Thomas Howard or other Contractors, to the disadvantage of the Government, while negotiating a contract with Mr. Howard to carry supplies by the tonnage system; on the contrary, he appeared to be acting as he thought for the purpose of reducing the expense without interrupting the service. A strong combination had been formed by Contractors to keep up prices, and all refused to cancel contract with H. B. Co., the agents of the Government, except Mr. Howard; consequently he was justly entitled to the contract; not only on this account, but because his price was the lowest, pending the acceptance or rejection, by the Minister, of the tenders advertised for and received on the 5th June. This combination was very powerful for one man to overcome. The contracts or agreements for freighting approved by Lieut.-Col. Whitehead appear to have been the lowest in all cases, but the system adopted by Bell to make offers instead of asking for tenders appears to be out of the usual course.\n\n2nd. Major W. R. Bell purchased and sold to the H. B. Co., as agents of the Government, a large quantity of hay at a very high price. Much of this hay was measured and received by himself or his clerks on behalf of the Government. He also let the contract to Bell, Lewis & Co. on 21st May for freighting. This was also in the form of a letter from Bell, by authority of Lieut.-Col. Whitehead, offering the freighting, which was accepted by Bell, Lewis & Co., and not tendered for by that firm. He was a member of this firm until about the 4th or 9th June, during which time he hired teams for the firm and looked after the freighting, assisted by his Government Shipping Clerk Jones. The General Officer Commanding at this time instructed Bell to resign his position as Assistant Transport Officer or as a Contractor; he says he resigned the latter, by withdrawing from the firm. C. H. Fox was then sent from Winnipeg by Jno. L. Lewis, to take charge of the freighting. Bell swears he never received a cent, either directly or indirectly, from the contract; he, however, received pay from the H. B. Co. for nine teams at $10 per day from 1st to the 24th May, total $2150 (see Statement No. 4, July 6th), the respective amounts for each team being receipted for by W. R. Bell. The pay for teams supplied by the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co., receipted for by H. J. Eberts, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company.\n\nThe fact of Bell having instructed men to not hire teams at less than $7 per day, with $1 added for themselves, indicates he had an interest in keeping up the\nprice (see his evidence). If Bell could engage teams at $4.50 per day to freight for Bell, Lewis & Co., and W. E. Jones could contract for freighting from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford for $70 per ton, it appears strange that these two paid Officers of the Government should not have given the Department the benefit. For Bell's personal connection with the hay contract see article Nos. 27 and 28.\n\n3rd. That the freighting by the ton was not cheaper to the Government than when teams were hired by the day. See calculations article No. 29.\n\n4th. That all teams should have been reduced in price after telegrams of S. L. Bedson, 8th April, to Bell, including those with the General Officer Commanding, allowing sufficient time to return to Qu'Appelle. As teams were constantly going to and from the front, this could have been done without inconvenience to the General or the Column under his immediate command, had Major Bell so desired.\n\n5th. Jno. L. Lewis is considered a very important witness, but the Commission have not been able to get his evidence. Mr. Lewis is a resident of Lachine, Quebec, is Managing Director of the Dominion Coal Co., Winnipeg, where he has resided several months during the past summer; but, as he has been in the United States for many weeks, is out of control of the Commission. A friend of his has intimated he will be prepared to go before the Commission, if necessary, in Ottawa; his business engagements preventing him at present returning to Winnipeg. The Commission do not consider the evidence complete without Mr. Lewis' testimony; therefore the propriety of not considering this a final report is respectfully recommended for the consideration of the Honorable the Minister.\n\n6th. In submitting this Report, the Commission would again say the service was exceptional, and the most favorable construction should be put upon all the transactions.\n\nW. H. JACKSON, Lieut.-Col., D. A. G.,\nChairman.\n\nW. H. FORREST, Lieut.-Col.,\nMember.\n\nA. PEEBLES, Lieut.-Col.,\nMember.\n\nEDMUND B. HOLT,\nSecretary.\n\nWINNIPEG, October 16, 1885.\n\nCol. JACKSON and Col. FORREST,\n\nWINNIPEG.\n\nI address this communication to you two gentlemen, and not to the Commission generally appointed to investigate the Transport irregularities, as the charges I make reflect upon Col. Whitehead, and it would be both unseemly and improper that he should sit in judgment upon charges made against himself, and I believe that gentleman would recognize this fact himself.\n\nIf the investigation proceeds I purpose examining Col. Whitehead himself as a witness, if I am allowed that privilege and permitted to have counsel there for that purpose.\n\nIf the Commission will procure the attendance of the witnesses whom I name I can prove the following facts:\n\nRe-contract from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford:\n1. That Col. Whitehead by wire advised General Laurie to give this contract to John Stewart.\n2. That Major Bell, Transport Officer, would not permit Stewart to carry out this contract.\n3. That Major Bell sent one Jones, chief-clerk in the Transport Office, Qu'Appelle, to take charge of the Saskatchewan Landing contract.\n4. That said Jones took bills of lading from a firm, Bell & Lewis, for about 90 tons of freight.\n5. That the greater number of the teams were hired by Major Bell and other Transport Officers at Qu'Appelle, and shipped to Swift Current for this contract.\n\n6. That about June 4th one Captain Howard arranged with Col. Whitehead to go on, with the above contract, and a day or two afterwards Howard went to Saskatchewan Landing, and took charge of the contract from Jones, and made receipts or bills of lading in his own name.\n\n7. That between May 22nd and June 5th (see \"Winnipeg Times\") tenders were called for to transport freight from this point and others, and the said tenders were to be in on the 5th June.\n\n8. Notwithstanding this advertisement for tenders which were to be in on the 5th June, this contract was arranged privately between the said Howard and Whitehead on the night of the 4th June, without reference to any tenders or competition of any kind.\n\n9. That Col. Whitehead on the 9th June sent a telegram to John Stewart, in these words or to the following effect:\n\n\"Your freighting contract with Gen. Laurie on behalf of the Government cancelled herewith. Minister will decide who will have contract for transport.\"\n\n10. That John Stewart was not allowed to draw after that date, but Capt. Howard continued drawing from Saskatchewan Landing, and Bell and Lewis were allowed to continue drawing from Qu'Appelle.\n\n11. That Col. Whitehead gave a contract to a personal friend of his own for 20 head of cattle without tenders and at a loss to the Government.\n\n12. That Col. Whitehead allowed Bell and Lewis to be paid their contract from Qu'Appelle at prices 150 per cent. too high, and was guilty of improper conduct or negligence in permitting this to be done.\n\n13. That the Major Bell above mentioned was the \"Bell\" of the firm of Bell & Lewis, the transport contractors, and the said Bell admitted this fact to Gen. Middleton at Regina; and Col. Whitehead, knowing that this gentleman occupied the dual position of a Transport Officer and a Contractor, improperly paid the claim made by this firm on the Government.\n\nQu'Appelle and Clarke's Crossing contract.\n\n14. That the said Major Bell, the Chief Transport Officer at Qu'Appelle, was a member of the Transport Contractors, Bell & Lewis.\n\n15. That the said Bell himself in person superintended this work for some time on behalf of himself and Lewis, neither Lewis nor any other person on behalf of the partnership being there.\n\n16. That said Bell hired the teams for this contract, and that he loaded them with rotten hay, knowing at the time that it could not be used by the teams.\n\n17. That said Bell, while a Transport Officer, made an agreement with said John Stewart in writing, to share the profits of these contracts.\n\n18. That said Bell signed another paper writing, wherein he states that he had laid the foundation for a good thing for both of them, meaning thereby that they should be able to make a lot of money out of the Government.\n\n19. That said Bell endeavored to have Stewart's contract from Moose Jaw broken up, in order that he might profit personally thereby, as he had done at Saskatchewan Landing, and with this view he got the receipts or bills of lading made in the name of Bell & Lewis. This was done before he wrote the memos above mentioned.\n\n20. That the Lewis of \"Bell & Lewis\" is one John L. Lewis, and not the partner Lewis in the firm of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh, coal merchants, Winnipeg, whom it was supposed were the contractors, although this John L. Lewis was an employee of the said firm.\n\n21. That said Bell represented that Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh were the Contractors, under the name of Bell, Lewis & Co., and such representation was untrue; said Major Bell and said John L. Lewis were the Transport Contractors.\n\n22. That said firm of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh received none of the profits of this contract, and there are no entries in their firm books relating thereto.\n23. That teams leaving Qu'Appelle for Clarke's Crossing were reloaded at Humboldt.\n\n24. That there are several irregularities in the payment of a number of the teams.\n\n25. That said Major Bell had a silent interest in the profits of many teams that were employed by the Government.\n\n26. That while the wages of many teams were reduced, those belonging to the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co., of which said Major Bell is the Manager, were retained at the old prices.\n\n27. That said Major Bell and the Government employees under him purchased hay at Qu'Appelle at $12 per ton, for which same hay the Government were charged fraudulently $20 per ton. The hay was measured simply by a tape, and the measurement or weighing was never checked or verified in any way.\n\n28. That quantities of pressed hay were purchased on the line of the C. P. R. at about $15 per ton, and the Government was fraudulently charged $22 per ton, for which frauds said Bell is responsible.\n\n29. That if I had the privilege of examining other transport accounts I believe I could prove many other irregularities.\n\nThere are several important telegrams at Qu'Appelle, Moose Jaw and Swift Current Stations and other points, that should be secured at once, as the time for preserving them will soon expire.\n\nI have stated the above charges in the interest of the Government, which has been defrauded, and if the attendance of the witnesses, whose names I shall on request give you, is procured, and also certain documents produced, I can establish the truth of my statements.\n\nI have the honor to be, Gentlemen,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJAMES ANDERSON.\n\nCOMMISSION ON WAR CLAIMS.\n\nWednesday, October 21st, 1885.\n\nMAJOR JAS. M. WALSH, called\u2014\n\nCol. Jackson\u2014\n\nQ. We have asked you to come here to obtain from you some information with regard to the transport of supplies in connection with the North West Field Force, and we wish to have your evidence upon oath?\n\nA. All right, sir.\n\nWitness was now sworn.\n\nCol. Jackson\u2014Can you tell us who compose the firm of Bell, Lewis & Company?\n\nA. A. F. Bell, of Buffalo, George L. Lewis, of Buffalo, H. E. Yates, of Rochester; that is the firm of Bell, Lewis & Yates.\n\nQ. Then there was a Bell, Lewis & Co., who had a contract with the Government for the transport of supplies; do you know who composed that firm?\n\nA. No, sir.\n\nQ. Are you not a partner in some of these Companies?\n\nA. I am one of the partners of the firm Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh.\n\nQ. There is a Lewis, of Montreal, who has something to do with that firm?\n\nA. That is John L. Lewis, Montreal, Lewis, of Buffalo, Yates, of Rochester and myself.\n\nQ. You don't know who compose that firm Bell & Lewis?\n\nA. Not unless it is our Company. We are not known as that Company.\n\nQ. Had you no interest in it?\n\nA. If it is a contract of our Company I have an interest in it; but Mr. Lewis, President, has made no return, and therefore I don't know anything about it so far.\n\nQ. Who signed the contract\u2014do you know that?\nA. Well, that I don't know, it is a thing I have not talked much to Mr. Lewis about; these kind of things come up generally at our Directors' meetings, when all these things are attended to, and it is business that he attended to and I did not make any enquiries about it, any more than the work had been done, and I supposed it was our Company did it.\n\nQ. Do you know W. R. Bell?\n\nA. Yes, but I don't know whether he had any interest in it. If it was the business of our Company W. R. Bell could not have any interest in it.\n\nQ. You are putting an \"if\" in front of it?\n\nA. I don't know, positively, whether it was our Company; our office paid the freighters; I presume it was our Company.\n\nQ. You don't know who had an interest in it?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. When do you expect to know that?\n\nA. At our Annual Meeting.\n\nQ. When will that take place?\n\nA. That won't take place until the winter sometime; our next annual meeting we will know; not till then.\n\nQ. Were you ever over any portion of the trails during the campaign?\n\nA. Yes, some of them.\n\nQ. On business in connection with the transport?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about any other contract in connection with the transport?\n\nA. No, sir.\n\nQ. If W. R. Bell is a member of that firm, what share would his be\u2014do you know that?\n\nA. I don't know; I could not tell his interest at all. I could not have any idea of it.\n\nQ. Did you hear anything about this contract when you were up at Qu'Appelle at the beginning of the season?\n\nA. No, sir; the contract that our Company is interested in, or Mr. Lewis of our Company is interested in, was subsequent to my visit to Qu'Appelle; it was after I had gone east; the first I heard of that was at Ottawa.\n\nQ. Were you looking over the ground to see what it could be done for?\n\nA. No, sir; I was there entirely under another mission.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about contracts for hay?\n\nA. No, sir.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about John Stewart's contract?\n\nA. I don't know anything about it, only rumors.\n\nQ. You know nothing about it more than that?\n\nA. No, I know nothing about it more than what I heard talked in town; I know nothing about it myself.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about any other contracts?\n\nA. No.\n\nExamined by Lieut.-Col. Forrest.\n\nQ. You have already answered that you are a member of the firm Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. What are the names of the members of that firm?\n\nA. Mr. A. F. Bell, George L. Lewis, that is one of the Lewis', and the other is John L. Lewis.\n\nQ. John L. Lewis is also a member of your Co.?\n\nA. Yes; there are two Lewis' in the firm.\n\nQ. Your firm is not known as Bell, Lewis & Co.?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Was the freighting account known as Bell, Lewis & Company kept in the books of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Co.?\nA. The accounts passed through our office, but not entered up in our Coal Company books at all, but it passed through our office.\n\nQ. When did you first hear that Mr. Lewis, your Winnipeg Manager, had taken a contract?\n\nA. I think I can tell you pretty nearly within a few days (referring to a memorandum book). It was somewhere near the 25th of June, some day near the 25th of June.\n\nQ. You claim an interest in that contract?\n\nA. Yes, sir.\n\nQ. Have you, or any of your firm, received their share yet?\n\nA. No, sir. That is, outside of Mr. Lewis, I don't think they have. If they have I don't know anything about it.\n\nQ. You are aware Major Bell and John L. Lewis stated the contractors were your firm.\n\nA. Yes, I was told they did.\n\nQ. That the firm Bell, Lewis, Yates & Company was the Bell, Lewis & Company?\n\nA. Mr. Lewis said it was a contract of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh.\n\nQ. Did John L. Lewis advise you the taking of this contract about the 25th of June?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Has John L. Lewis been paid the contract in full sometime since?\n\nA. I don't know.\n\nQ. You did not hear whether they received all their money?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. If so, has he had ample time to divide the profits among your firm had he desired to do so?\n\nA. It would not be divided; it would merely go to the profits of the concern, and at the annual meeting we would know what they were.\n\nQ. If he had intended to divide he would have told you?\n\nA. No, he might not; it would not be a division; it would merely go to the credit of the Company, and at the annual meeting we would take up the business.\n\nQ. Do you think that he would keep that information to himself until that annual meeting, and not let you know whether there had been a loss or a handsome profit? It is very likely he would have told you if he had intended to give you a share of it?\n\nA. I think we will have a share in it? I think so far as I am concerned in it.\n\nBy Col. Jackson\u2014\n\nQ. When you say a share what do you mean?\n\nA. I think if that contract is our Company's I think I will have a share in it; there is no doubt about that.\n\nQ. Don't you think there are other parties connected with it?\n\nA. I cannot say that.\n\nQ. Bell, Lewis & Company cannot be your Company?\n\nA. Bell, Lewis & Company is not our Company, but that contract, I understand, is our Company's.\n\nQ. Has been assigned to your Company?\n\nA. No; but Mr. Lewis is the manager of our Company, and a paid officer, and, as such, will have to give an account of it.\n\nBy Col. Whitehead\u2014\n\nQ. Has he power to act for your Company and make contracts for your firm?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. And will have to account for profit and loss?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nCol. Forrest\u2014I am told Mr. Lewis said this was outside your Company and you had nothing to do with it?\n\nA. No, that is not true; Mr. Lewis said he would give account of his conduct when the proper time arrived, as regards this contract.\n\nCol. Jackson\u2014Is there anything to prevent your Mr. Lewis, your manager, from taking an outside contract?\nA. Well, I as one of the firm would object to it without getting my interest? Mr. Lewis is a paid officer of our Company and his services belong to the Company.\n\nQ. That would not prevent him making a contract and taking in other partners outside the ordinary Coal business?\n\nA. He might, possibly, by taking in another partner.\n\nCol. Whiteshead\u2014Has he power under your contract?\n\nA. No, not in our business; but an outside business he might possibly have a right to, but then if that business is done under the name of our Company I would object to our Company running the risk unless our Company get the benefit of any profits.\n\nQ. Any money Lewis made out of a partnership you would have a share in?\n\nA. Any contract made under the name of our partnership\u2014I would not care what partnership it was.\n\nQ. But if he took in another partner?\n\nA. As long as our Company were the contractors I would claim an interest.\n\nCol. Jackson\u2014in this instance your Company were not the contractors.\n\nA. If our Company was not the contractor of course we will not look to Mr. Lewis, our President, but that will be a matter for our Company to look into, whether our Company played in the contract or not, and Mr. Lewis will have to answer to the Company for whatever profits were accruing by the contract. I can give you nothing more than I know about it, and Mr. Lewis is responsible to our Company for anything he has done.\n\nQ. And he is not in town?\n\nA. No, and the time has not arrived for us to know what the profits are.\n\nCol. Forrest\u2014It is very convenient to have two Bells in a firm, it makes such a fine combination?\n\nA. There is only one Bell in our firm? there are two Lewis's. Of course I don't know anything about Major Bell in this contract\u2014I don't know anything about him, and I won't acknowledge him. As far as I can understand, this is a contract of our Company, and I am going to insist on any profits there may have been going to our Company.\n\nCol. Jackson\u2014I don't know that there is anything more that you can tell us?\n\nA. That is all that I can tell you.\n\nQ. Perhaps if we had a smart lawyer we might get more out of you.\n\nA. I don't know that you could get any more, sir. I have understood all along this was a contract of our Company's, and I intend to insist on the profits being divided, and I don't acknowledge anybody else in the contract\u2014but our Company.\n\nQ. In looking over your memorandum as to the contract you might see who got the contract and who form the Company?\n\nA. I was only informed at that time that our Company had a contract for freighting and nothing more. Then I came on west and I found our Company was interested in the contract, and, as I say, it is our Company.\n\nCol. Forrest\u2014It is far better that there should not be any more than one firm interested in it, and that you should get the profit?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nCol. Jackson\u2014I don't know that there is anything else, unless you can give it to us without questions?\n\nA. If there is nothing else you want to ask, Colonel, I will retire.\n\nCol. Jackson\u2014if we think of anything else we will call you again?\n\nA. Very well, sir.\n\nFriday, November 13th, 1885.\n\nCharles Henry Fox, being duly sworn, saith as follows:\n\nTo Lt.-Col Jackson:\n\nQ. Where do you reside?\n\nA. I am of the City of Winnipeg.\n\nQ. What is your occupation?\n\nA. I am Manager of the Dominion Coal Company.\nQ. Can you tell us anything about a contract for hauling supplies between Bell, Lewis & Co and the Government?\n\nA. The contract itself I have never seen. As an employee of the Dominion Coal Company, I was sent to Troy to look after the work there. I don't know that there was a contract for that matter.\n\nTo Lt.-Col Forrest:\n\nQ. You have given your residence and occupation?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Were you in the employ of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh, or the Dominion Coal Company, and what were your duties?\n\nA. Yes, I have been continuously in their employ. The Company was first Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh, and after incorporation the Dominion Coal Company, in whose employ I have been continuously.\n\nQ. Who were the members of the firm of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh?\n\nA. Bell is F. A. Bell of Buffalo, John L. Lewis, A. G. Yates and J. M. Walsh.\n\nQ. Where do the members of the firm reside?\n\nA. J. M. Walsh lives at Port Arthur, but his residence is really Brockville; J. L. Lewis, Montreal; F. A. Bell and G. H. Lewis, at Buffalo; and A. G. Yates, Rochester.\n\nQ. Are there two Lewis's?\n\nA. There are two Lewis's. There was only one appeared in the name Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh.\n\nQ. Is John L. Lewis a member, too?\n\nA. Yes, and he is President of the Dominion Coal Company. They are both stockholders in the incorporated Company.\n\nQ. Is this Company in existence in the United States, and under what name?\n\nA. They have no business in the United States.\n\nQ. Is Walsh a member of both this firm and the American firm?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Did the firm in whose employ you are ever make a contract in the name of Bell, Lewis & Company, with the Government?\n\nA. Not that I am aware of.\n\nQ. Do you know of any contract that Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh had in respect to the North-West Transport business?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Or Bell & Lewis, or Bell, Lewis & Company?\n\nA. I don't know of any. I heard of a contract, but I never saw it.\n\nQ. Do you make periodical statements, returns or balance sheets to the different members of the firm?\n\nA. Yes, a monthly balance sheet was sent to the President and to the American firm.\n\nQ. In these statements was there any reference in respect to any of the Government North-West Transport?\n\nA. No, there are no entries in connection with it that I know of.\n\nQ. What moneys, by cheque or otherwise, have been paid to Major Bell from the Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh account, that is since the 1st of April, 1885, and on what account, and please produce your cheques, and show your entries in the books?\n\nA. On account of teams. At Troy I paid him $1000 on account. There was a balance of $482 paid in Winnipeg since.\n\nQ. Is that freighting or teaming?\n\nA. That is for teaming, 19 teams at four dollars and half a day. I paid for 19 or 20 teams at four and a half a day, amounting in all to $1,482.\n\nQ. Have any moneys been received by you on account of the North-West Transport business? Produce this account, and if you have any private memoranda produce these also.\n\nA. Personally I have no record of any moneys paid by the Government to the firm, because I was at Troy. I have no knowledge of any being paid.\n\nQ. Is there any balance due from your firm to Bell, Lewis & Company. If so, on what account is it due to them, from the Government?\nA. Bell, Lewis & Company is merely an abbreviation of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh; that being the name it is commonly called. For instance the telephone people also call us Bell, Lewis & Company, clipping off the name. They are one and the same firm.\n\nQ. Is there any dispute between John L. Lewis and the members of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh, with reference to the profits of the North-West Transport business? Did Lewis ever draw any moneys out of the firm from this source, and if so produce the cheques of the amount drawn out when he left for Montreal?\n\nA. No, he may have done so; I don't know whether he did or not.\n\nQ. You know if he drew out any considerable amount?\n\nA. I am not aware of it. There are considerable amounts drawn by Mr. Lewis and remitted to Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh, at Buffalo.\n\nQ. Did the said John L. Lewis ever give a statement of the disposition of the moneys he drew out?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Is it customary for John L. Lewis to cheque out from your firm large sums of money without accounting for them?\n\nA. It would go through the books.\n\nQ. Do you know that Bell & Lewis or Bell, Lewis & Company were a different firm for the purpose of contracting with the Government? State all you know about it.\n\nA. Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh and the Dominion Coal Company are all one and the same men.\n\nQ. Do you know that Major Bell or John L. Lewis ever received from the Government through your firm, any sum of money which was not accounted for to your firm?\n\nA. I was absent at the time it was paid, if it was paid.\n\nQ. Do you know of any correspondence with the members of your firm, or is it a rule with you to advise the members of your Company of any important business?\n\nA. No, it was not.\n\nQ. Was the firm, or any member of it, advised with reference to transporting freight?\n\nA. I have not seen the correspondence. I have been told they were consulted.\n\nQ. Have you ever had any interview or conversation with Major Walsh, and, if so, state what passed?\n\nA. Yes. I hadn't seen Major Walsh between the time I was sent to Troy and the month that I returned. He asked me what were my duties in Troy. I explained to him, the engaging of teams for transporting supplies and paying them on their return.\n\nQ. Has there ever been any fault found with you in respect to your books, statements or returns in respect to the Government transport contract by Major Walsh or any of the members of your firm. If so, what complaints were made, and what answer did you make?\n\nA. Major Walsh is the only member of the firm I have seen for about two years, and he made no objection.\n\nQ. State how you came to go West in reference to that transport business, and by whose authority, and what did you do while there?\n\nA. I went to Troy under instructions of the President of the Company in whose employ I was, with instructions to engage teams at four dollars and a half a day, and transport supplies that might be offered by the Supply Officer to Clarke's Crossing; getting a proper bill of lading to accompany the goods to be received at their destination and to pay these teams on their return from moneys that would be sent to me from time to time by Mr. Lewis, of Winnipeg. I left Winnipeg on the 4th of June.\n\nQ. Did you have free transportation when you went West and returned?\n\nA. No, I paid my fare both ways.\n\nQ. Give the date of your first journey West, and where did you go and what did you do?\n\nA. I went to Troy to fulfil the instructions I have before mentioned. I never was in Moosejaw.\n\nQ. While out West, did you see Major Bell on this first journey and where and what passed between you?\n\nA. I saw Major Bell at Troy most of the time I was there, but had very little con-\nversation with him, and that was with reference to a difference of opinion he and I held as regards the amount of food and fodder required for the teamsters and horses.\n\nQ. Also state where you went next?\nA. I went over the route to Clarke's Crossing.\n\nQ. Also state where you went next; your business and the date you took charge of the freighting contract of Bell, Lewis & Company at Qu'Appelle?\nA. The first business I did was on the 6th of June. After that I went on the road to Clarke's Crossing and returned.\n\nQ. Give the date the first load left Qu'Appelle for Clarke's Crossing for Bell, Lewis & Company?\nA. I think the first lot left on the 22nd of May. The first bill of lading dated by the Supply Officer at Troy, I remember, bore the date of May the 22nd. I remember paying that on its return.\n\nQ. Was any one looking after this transport business for Bell, Lewis & Company before you got to Qu'Appelle, and, if so, who was it?\nA. I believe there was, but I don't know into whose shoes I stepped. I was told that a Mr. Jones had something to do with it. I went into the office occupied by him and he went into the employ of some of the contractors further up the line. I never met the man personally, but I was told that he was there.\n\nQ. Was Major Bell not really looking after the Bell, Lewis & Company contract before you got to Qu'Appelle?\nA. Not that I am aware of.\n\nQ. Who hired the teams before you got to Qu'Appelle?\nA. I had been told, Mr. Jones.\n\nQ. Who gave you statements of the work, time and amounts due, and the time of teams when you got to Qu'Appelle?\nA. The teams were all engaged to make the trip in 18 days at four dollars and a half a day, which would be eighty-one dollars. That was explained to me by Mr. Lewis previous to my leaving Winnipeg. He told me that a number of teams had already left, so that I had to pay each team $81 on its return. A list of the names of these teams was left for me by, as I understand, my predecessor, this Mr. Jones, and on these memoranda I paid the returning teams.\n\nQ. How many teams were hired for Bell, Lewis & Company before you went there, and who hired them?\nA. I cannot give the exact number. I should say upwards of 100. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 100. I understand this Mr. Jones hired them. I cannot swear positively.\n\nQ. From whom did you receive the rations for the teams under your charge at Qu'Appelle, and can you give the amount drawn?\nA. The rations were served out by the warehouseman of the Transport Department, in other words, Major Bell's warehouseman, and the amount was made up according to the Government ration list, so many pounds of oats and hay per day. They were not paid for by me.\n\nQ. How many rations were drawn beyond Qu'Appelle? At what station were they drawn?\nA. Anywhere where there was a stock of provisions. The teams drawing rations would get oats to carry them to Humboldt and hay to Fort Qu'Appelle, where they would receive sufficient hay to carry them to the next point at which a Supply Officer was stationed, after leaving Humboldt.\n\nQ. Did you give orders to get new supplies at these respective stations?\nA. They got rations from the Supply Officer at Humboldt and Clarke's Crossing. The orders were not signed by me; they were signed by the man in charge of the company.\n\nQ. Can you state the number of teams hired and the number of days after you arrived there?\nA. It was fixed to make the trip in 18 days. There was a great many more engaged while I was there. I know that most of the teams only went one trip, the majority or half of them only went one trip, and the other half not more than two trips. They all made the trips in from 17 to 20 days, usually about 18 days.\nQ. Did you ever have any instructions from Major Bell with reference to the contract to Clarke's Crossing or elsewhere?\nA. No, I had none at all, except on minor matters of supplying fodder and provisions.\n\nQ. Can you produce any letters, documents or statements showing the receipt of moneys and the disposition of the same?\nA. No, I could not.\n\nQ. The moneys received from the Government for transporting?\nA. I was in Troy the whole of the time, and I know nothing about it.\n\nQ. How soon do you think it will be before Mr. Lewis will be in Winnipeg?\nA. I have heard from a letter of his that he would be in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n\nQ. Do you know one John Wood who was in the employ of the Government looking after the supply?\nA. He was in my employ as a waggon boss.\n\nQ. Did Wood take charge of any teams?\nA. He had charge of two convoys.\n\nQ. How many teams?\nA. There were nearly 100 teams in one convoy, and I think 50 or 60 in the other.\n\nQ. Did you know if these teams were reloaded at Humboldt, and did you charge full freight all the way through? Did they re-load at Humboldt, and then get paid all the way?\nA. There were three or four, or probably half a dozen loads. I have been told that, from various causes, were left at Humboldt, the weight of which was deducted from the original bill of lading of the whole convoy. I telegraphed Wood at Humboldt to re engage south-bound teams at Humboldt and load the amount of several that had been left there and send it on, or rather take it on with the north-bound convoy to Clarke's Crossing, knowing that if these goods were not delivered at their destination the Company I represented would not be paid anything for hauling them from Troy to Humboldt.\n\nQ. Was John Wood paid anything by Bell, Lewis & Company\u2014if so, how much?\nA. Lewis paid his salary at three dollars and a half a day, and we also paid for his horse; I think, one dollar and a half, making about five dollars a day, and he furnished his own horse. Five dollars a day for himself, his horse and buckboard.\n\nTo Lt.-Col Jackson:\nQ. Do you know anything of a private book in which Lewis kept these accounts?\nA. I was absent from the city at the time.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about a cheque for a large amount given by Bell, Lewis & Company to Major Bell?\nA. I don't know of any except what I paid him at Troy.\n\nQ. Do you know Col. Whitehead personally?\nA. I met him on my return from Troy once in this office here. I was sent here by Mr. Lewis once.\n\nQ. Did you ever have any conversation with him on the subject of transport?\nA. None, whatever.\n\nQ. How many days did you occupy to fulfil this contract and how many teams did you use? (Witness here promises to produce books and cheques at 3 p.m. same day, as he cannot answer this question without reference to same.)\n\nQ. Did Major Bell show any disposition to favor the convoy of which you had charge?\nA. I thought it was the reverse. I thought he was too close in matters of provisions. The only conversation I had with him was in reference to food and fodder.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nC. H. Fox, sworn:\n\nNovember 28th, 1885.\n\nQ. What is your occupation, Mr. Fox, and where do you live?\nA. I am an Accountant Manager of the Dominion Coal Company.\nQ. Give a full description in which the Government freighting accounts were kept by J. L. Lewis and what sums of money are covered therein?\n\nA. It is a book about 16 x 6 inches of about 100 pages, like a memorandum book, which it might be called.\n\nQ. What kind of cover had it?\n\nA. A paste-board cover of grayish color, I think.\n\nQ. How are the leaves ruled?\n\nA. Like a day book, one side ruled for date and the other for dollars and cents.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about the sums of money entered?\n\nA. I think the total amount is $90, some odd thousand dollars\u2014between ninety and one hundred thousand.\n\nQ. Is the book balanced?\n\nA. I think it is. It is kept balanced up to the last few entries.\n\nQ. To what transactions do the entries refer?\n\nA. In most cases the entries refer to amounts sent to me at Troy.\n\nQ. Well, then, in the minority of cases?\n\nA. There are two other cases I remember well; one is, I think, $7500; this entry appears also in the Co.'s books, drawn by Mr. Lewis personally, and at his request charged to the Farm Account; it is really a private account of Mr. Lewis's, but it happens to go through our books. There is another entry of $40,000, that is charged to Mr. Lewis also.\n\nQ. To his private account?\n\nA. Well it really appears in the memo book, it is entered to the Co.'s business. The money was chequed out of the Bank of Montreal.\n\nQ. I think you said that this money passed to the Co.?\n\nA. The transport receipts were banked to the credit of the Coal Co., and chequed out by Mr. Lewis; but the Co.'s receipts and cheques referring to the transport business were kept in the separate cheque book to prevent their becoming confused with the Coal Company.\n\nQ. Then who else received cheques?\n\nA. These are the only two entries I remember of in looking through the books, that don't pertain to money sent me at Troy; or minor items, such as telegrams in connection with the transport.\n\nQ. I think the other day you said you paid $1000 to Bell for teams that would have appeared?\n\nA. He received $1000 on account from me and a cheque for $400 odd dollars.\n\nQ. Was there any other cheque in Bell's signature?\n\nA. No, I gave him the thousand on account, and the balance was paid as per my statement.\n\nQ. What do you understand by paying that thousand dollars for teams?\n\nA. That is the list of teams and teamsters, names that we actually employed, and we paid the sums for teams on the work.\n\nQ. Did you pay Bell anything more than on the account of the teams?\n\nA. That is simply the time of teams at $4.50 per day.\n\nQ. Why didn't you pay these teamsters yourself as the others?\n\nA. My instructions were to pay them only. They were paid by Bell as the Manager of the Co.\n\nQ. Do you believe they were actually the teams of the Co?\n\nA. Yes, I know them to be.\n\nQ. Hadn't Bell a certain number of teams of his own or hired teams?\n\nA. I know of one lot that he purchased with carts that made one short trip for us, and they were represented as the private property of Major Bell.\n\nQ. Don't you know anything about teams?\n\nA. Those were only owned by the Farming Co., I understand.\n\nQ. Who owned these teams? (Pay list produced)\n\nA. I could not say who owned them\u2014I suppose W. R. Bell.\n\nCol Peebles:\n\nQ. Personally?\nA. Yes, personally.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. Where is that book at present and who has the custody of it?\nA. Mr. Perdue, of Bain, Blanchard & Mulock.\nQ. Are they Solicitors for Mr. Lewis?\nA. Yes, for both Mr. Lewis and the Coal Company.\nQ. You handed over that book to them, of course?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Had you any authority to do so?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Any more than to bring it here?\nA. Yes, I fancy I had. As the Company's Solicitors, in the absence of the officers, I take orders entirely from them.\nQ. That is on legal points?\nA. I took that to be a legal point. In fact, I asked them if I had any right to take them to any examination during their absence, and they said they would take them in custody during their absence.\nQ. Do you know of Bell being the party to that contract?\nA. No, I do not.\nQ. Was it not understood so when you went up to relieve him?\nA. I was given to understand that he had nothing to do with it.\nQ. When do you expect Mr. Lewis home?\nA. From his letters, in the course of a few days. If you wish, I will telegraph for permission to produce these books. I don't doubt but I will get permission, because I know of nothing in the book more than I have told you here.\n\nCol. Forrest:\nQ. Did you say you had a supplementary cheque book for the transport service?\nA. Yes, I introduced a separate cheque book.\nQ. Then there was a separate cheque book?\nA. Yes.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. Are you in the habit of writing on the stubs of the cheques?\nA. Yes; to prevent confusion we kept a separate cheque book. My instructions were to do that, and I have seen the stub of the cheque book.\nQ. What did Mr. Lewis intend to do with that $40,000?\nA. I know what was done with it. It was first placed to his credit with Bell, Lewis & Yates in Buffalo, and since that most of it has been used in the Coal Company's business.\nQ. Then did you know of Mr. Lewis dividing that money with the particular parties who were interested in the freighting contract?\nA. To my knowledge he is the only interested party?\nQ. As far as you know?\nA. Yes, so far as I know in the transport. Whether the Company in their next annual meeting will claim it I can't say.\nQ. When does the meeting take place?\nA. Usually on the 1st of May; that is the meeting day of the Company. It may be postponed.\nQ. The other day you stated that you drew forage and rations at the different stations for your teams?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you give a receipt for it on requisition?\nA. The requisitions were made by the man in charge of the convoy.\nQ. You were to allow $10 per ton that would have to be deducted from the trains to meet the subsistence of the men and teams?\nA. I was never made acquainted with the details of the contract.\nQ. How were supplies generally carried to the different stations on the other trail?\nA. They were there previous to my going, when the government teams were working by the day.\nQ. Had you an opportunity of seeing quantities of hay along the way?\nA. The trail was pretty well cleaned up; there was a quantity of hay at Clarke's Crossing and a quantity of oats at Humboldt.\n\nQ. In what condition was the hay at Clarke's Crossing?\nA. I should say it was useless.\n\nQ. About what quantity do you suppose?\nA. If I remember correctly, Capt. Hudson told me several hundred tons.\n\nQ. Did he say anything about stopping the conveyance of it?\nA. He gave me to understand that his instructions were to dispose of it.\n\nQ. Did he try to prevent it from being sent through?\nA. Not that I heard of. He might have through the Supply Department. He didn't mention it to me in conversation.\n\nQ. It is very evident that this hay was in excess of the requirements?\nA. Yes, at that season of the year there would be very little necessity for the hay.\n\nCol. Peebles:\n\nQ. When was that?\nA. About the last of June.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. Is there any more information you can give us about that cheque book?\nA. There is one entry that might be explained here, as it is not explained in the book. On a certain date\u2014I have forgotten it just now\u2014it says \"$10,000 handed by Major Bell.\" That ten thousand was handed by him to me at Qu'Appelle. He was in Winnipeg at the time, and carried it up with him at the request of Mr. Lewis, I presume to save express charges.\n\nQ. He merely conveyed it to you and had nothing to do with it?\nA. Yes; the entry does not explain it. An explanation should have been added.\n\nQ. Wasn't there a cheque in that book charged to Bell for either $23,000 or $25,000?\nA. I have not seen it.\n\nQ. Was there any such item in the Company's cash book?\nA. No.\n\nQ. There is no account against Bell?\nA. None whatever, with the exception of the Qu'Appelle teams and those two I have referred to.\n\nNovember 13th, 1885.\n\nDavid Elder Adams, being duly sworn, said as follows:\n\nTo Lt.-Col. Forrest:\n\nQ. What is your occupation?\nA. I am clerk and book-keeper of the Dominion Coal Company.\n\nQ. Were you in the employ of Bell, Lewis & Company and Dominion Coal Company since April?\nA. Yes, Bell, Lewis & Company and the Dominion Coal Company.\n\nQ. What are your particular duties?\nA. I have charge of the books and sale of coal.\n\nQ. Who are the members of the firm?\nA. Mr. J. L. Lewis, G. H. Lewis, A. G. Yates, Major Walsh and F. A. Bell of Buffalo.\n\nQ. Are both Lewis' members of the firm?\nA. I understand so.\n\nQ. Where do the members of the firm reside?\nA. Two, I think Mr. Bell and Mr. G. H. Lewis, live in Buffalo; I don't know whether Mr. J. L. Lewis lives at Winnipeg or at Lachine; Mr. Yates in Rochester; and Major Walsh at Port Arthur or Brockville.\n\nQ. Does this firm do business in the United States, and, if so, under what name?\nA. The same members of this firm have business in the States, both in Buffalo and Rochester.\nQ. Is Mr. Walsh a member of both this firm and the American firm?\nA. I don't think he is a member of the American firm.\n\nQ. Did the firm in whose employ you are ever make any contract in the name of Bell, Lewis & Company?\nA. I don't know of any contract, but I understand there was one.\n\nQ. Did you ever know of any contract that Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh ever had in reference to the North-West Transport business?\nA. I understand there was a contract made in the name of Bell, Lewis & Company. I could not give any particulars about it at all.\n\nQ. Or Bell & Lewis, or Bell, Lewis & Company?\nA. I could not give any particulars at all of the contract.\n\nQ. Do you make balance sheets from time to time and send them to the different members of the firm?\nA. Not to the different members. We give them to Mr. Lewis when he comes here, and he distributes them. We give him one copy, sometimes two.\n\nQ. In this statement was there any reference to the moneys received or paid in respect of any Government transport?\nA. No, there was nothing in them. They did not appear in my balance sheet.\n\nQ. How is that balance sheet made up?\nA. We make a trial balance sheet every month. I have not sent any to Mr. Lewis at all. These moneys for this transport service did not appear in either the trial or balance sheets.\n\nQ. What moneys, by cheque or other wise, have been paid to Major Bell through the Bell, Lewis; Yates & Walsh account since the 1st of April, 1885, on what account?\nA. I know there was some paid him for teams, and there was another cheque for private funds through some private deal of Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bell in connection with the Bell Farm. He deposited some money and that was paid back to him. Only one cheque besides that was paid out, and that was for the balance of the teaming account. There was nothing paid him on account of freighting. Nothing passed through my books. He deposited some money with our Company, a cheque for 25 or 30 hundred dollars and that lay at his credit for a couple of months, and he got money once or twice on account of that, and there was a balance paid him, some 5 or 6 hundred dollars when the balance was made, and he got a cheque for one thousand dollars.\n\nQ. Have any moneys been received by you from the Government on account of the North West contract business?\nA. I never received any money. I came over here one time to get a cheque, and it was refused me. They would not pay to any but members of the firm.\n\nQ. Can you produce any books?\nA. Yes, I deposited all the cheques in the Montreal Bank in the name of Bell, Lewis & Company. The account was going still in that name. Since that the account has been changed to the Dominion Coal Company.\n\nQ. If you deposited large accounts received from the Government do they appear in the books?\nA. It didn't go through my books. It was placed to the credit of the firm in the bank, but did not appear in the books of the firm.\n\nQ. Is there any balance due from your firm to Bell, Lewis & Company?\nA. There is a small balance due, between 4 and 6 hundred dollars; I don't remember.\n\nQ. Can you tell me who paid Mr. George Wood, a wagon boss, up there?\nA. I never heard of him at all.\n\nQ. Is there any dispute between J. L. Lewis and the members of the firm of Bell, Lewis, Yates and Walsh, with reference to the profits on the North West transaction?\nA. Not that I know of.\n\nQ. Did Mr. Lewis ever draw any money out of the firm from this source, against these cheques deposited, and produce the cheques to show what was the amount he drew when he left for Montreal, and produce the cheques?\nA. There was money drawn out and sent to Mr. Fox.\n\nQ. If you have any books to show how these cheques were distributed produce them?\nA. Any money we sent to Mr. Fox we could tell you at once.\n\nQ. That is what we want to arrive at. Is it customary for J. L. Lewis to cheque out from your firm large sums of money without accounting for them to the firm?\n\nA. Cheque it out and charge it to himself \u2014 for over two years he always did that. He has made large cheques for $8 or $10 thousand dollars; I remember he drew a cheque for $8 thousand dollars and another for $4 thousand dollars on his own account.\n\nQ. Do you know that Bell & Lewis, and Bell, Lewis & Company were a different firm for the purpose of contracting with the Government?\n\nA. Mr. Lewis told me one time that Major Bell had nothing whatever to do with him. I don't know much about it.\n\nQ. Did you know that Major Bell and John L. Lewis, or either of them, received from the Government any sum or sums of money which were not accounted for to your firm or the members of it?\n\nA. None; I don't believe any that came from the Government passed through the office.\n\nQ. Do you know of any correspondence with the members of your firm, or is it a rule to advise the members of your firm of any important contract?\n\nA. No, I never had any other dealings with the members of the firm.\n\nQ. Were the members of it advised of any contract with the Government?\n\nA. If so, it was Mr. Lewis advised them himself.\n\nQ. Have you ever had any interview or conversation with Major Walsh with reference to the Government contract, if so, state what passed between you?\n\nA. I know nothing about it; I don't know that he ever spoke to me about it.\n\nQ. Has there ever been any fault found with you with reference to your books, statements or returns in reference to the contract with Major Walsh, and, if so, what complaints were made by any members of the firm?\n\nA. Major Walsh asked me one day to let him see the bank book, and then he wanted to see the cash book. He asked me why some large amounts did not appear in the cash book. About $10 or $15 thousand dollars, maybe $20 thousand. I told him this was some business of Mr. Lewis' that he didn't put through the books; of course I did as I was told and didn't know what it meant.\n\nQ. When do you expect Mr. Lewis to be here?\n\nA. I heard that Mr. Lewis was expected to be here about the 22nd.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nNovember 25th, 1885.\n\nD. E. ADAMS, sworn.\n\nCol. Jackso:\n\nQ. What is your occupation?\n\nA. I am book-keeper for the Dominion Coal Company.\n\nQ. Is the Dominion Coal Co. incorporated?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Who is the Secretary-Treasurer?\n\nA. Major J. M. Walsh.\n\nQ. Give a full description of the book in which the Government freighting accounts were kept by J. L. Lewis, and what sum of money does it cover?\n\nA. Well, the book is a common small book, about eight or ten inches long by four or five in width. The sum received is $98,000.00; the balance is $681.\n\nQ. To whom was it paid?\n\nA. I can't tell exactly whom it was all paid to; there were expenses in connection with telegraphing, etc.\n\nQ. It shows the expenditure and other receipts?\n\nA. Yes, and cash sent to Mr. Fox when he was out there.\n\nQ. What other names do you remember?\n\nA. Well there was money drawn out up there by Lewis, and paid to Alloway of Montreal for the amount of $7000, placed to Lewis's credit in the Dominion Coal Co's office; it was telegraphed to Montreal to Alloway, to draw to that amount.\nQ. Do you know what business Alloway is in?\nA. He is a veterinary surgeon there.\n\nQ. Do you know why it was paid to him?\nA. They have some farm deal on hand I think.\n\nQ. Alloway was up here some time ago?\nA. Yes, Lewis and Alloway have stock down at Grand Forks.\n\nQ. You think it was on that land deal, and not in connection with the freighting at all?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Who else was any money paid to?\nA. It is so long since I saw the book that I don't know what the payments were. I think there was some drawn out for Mr. Lewis.\n\nQ. What Lewis was that?\nA. J. L. Lewis. $20,000.00 was the highest sent out. All the rest were sent to pay the teamsters. Twice there was, $8,000 or $10,000 sent out.\n\nQ. Were you there making entries in that book yourself?\nA. Yes, I made them all myself; there was a cheque drawn, I think on Mr. Lewis.\n\nQ. What was the amount of that cheque?\nA. It was a large amount, something like $30,000 or $40,000, it was a New-York draft. His cheque was paid in the Bank of Montreal. There were other small amounts of money. Fox gave drafts to the amount of $3,000 or $4,000.\n\nQ. Did you pay any of that money to W. R. Bell?\nA. I said before that there was $482, but there was some besides that.\n\nQ. The only amount paid out was for paying teams of the Farming Company?\nA. Yes, I am sure of that. Mr. Fox paid him $1,000 at Qu'Appelle on teams that worked there, and he credited $1,000 at the office to them, and that left a balance of some $2,000; afterwards one cheque was paid to Eberts for $482, made out to Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co.\n\nQ. Were there any memoranda in that book showing whom the money drawn by Lewis was intended for?\nA. No.\n\nQ. What was the amount you say?\nA. I think it was $40,000.\n\nQ. He drew that out as a personal matter?\nA. Yes. He was going down to St. Louis to buy coal. Mr. Fox said he was going to buy it for cash this year.\n\nQ. You are giving a description of the book\u2014describe so we'll know it if we see it? What kind of cover had it?\nA. Reddish paper cover, about 14 inches long and about 6 inches broad.\n\nQ. Is it an ordinary cash book?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. How is it ruled?\nA. Single lines of dollars and cents with the date column. The book is about the length of a sheet of fool's cap, but not so wide, ruled down with the dollars and cents and date columns.\n\nQ. Has it a stiff cover?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Is there any sort of heading in the book?\nA. No, I didn't put any on.\n\nCol. Forrest:\nQ. Is there anything to show what it is?\nA. No, I merely intended it to keep my cash straight.\n\nQ. Is there anything but the cash accounts in it?\nA. No, that's all.\n\nQ. You have the names in it like an ordinary cash book?\nA. Yes, Fox's name will be there.\nCol. Peebles:\n\nQ. It is a book containing names of persons to whom cash was paid and from whom cash was received?\nA. Yes.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. Does it show the receipts of money when it was received from the Government?\nA. I think it does.\n\nQ. Where is the book at present? and who has the custody of it?\nA. Mr. Perdue, in Bain, Blanchard & Mulock's office.\n\nQ. What had he to do with the Company?\nA. He is the Solicitor for the Company. Mr. Perdue and Mr. Mulock attend to the business.\n\nQ. You say that these amounts are the only amounts paid to Bell?\nA. Yes, the $1000 and the $482 paid here; but the money sent to Fox was paid at Qu'Appelle.\n\nQ. Then you think that was all to pay the hire for teams for the Company?\nA. Yes; I don't know what Fox paid on account. I know he paid $1000. I saw this on the statements he brought back.\n\nQ. In the absence of Mr. Lewis, who instructs the Solicitor what he has to do?\nA. Fox does, he is the Manager there.\n\nQ. This cheque book, was it a special one, what form of cheque book was it?\nA. The Montreal cheque book, it was on The Coal Co.'s ordinary cheque book.\n\nQ. Was it the one in use by the Company?\nA. Yes, the Bank of Montreal regular form.\n\nQ. Could you pick them out from among the others?\nA. Yes, certainly; these had reference to the disbursing of these amounts.\n\nCol. Forrest:\n\nQ. It was not a separate cheque book?\nA. It was the same book, not a separate one.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. Do you know what the objection is to have these books brought here?\nA. I know Fox did not want them brought here. I didn't understand why it was; I think he didn't wish them brought here in Lewis's absence; he thought he hadn't the authority to bring them out in his absence. It was not because of anything that was in them that they were not brought over.\n\nCol. Forrest:\n\nQ. Except that cheque for $40,000 which Lewis drew out, the rest has all gone for expenses, you think?\nA. Yes, sir.\n\nJohn Stewart called:\n\n13th October, 1885.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nWe have asked you to come here today to give us some information with regard to the Transport Service of the North-West Field Force, in which you are interested. To relieve your mind regarding any claims you have, I may say the Commission have recommended the payment of your claims, so it may not influence, in any way, anything you have to say?\n\nWitness\u2014So far as giving evidence as far as I am concerned, the greater portion of my knowledge is in telegrams and papers. If I had known two or three days ago, I could have given evidence today. I would like to have it postponed for two or three days.\n\nQ. When could we have those papers here?\nA. About Saturday night.\n\nQ. Could we depend upon your return?\nA. Yes, you could depend upon my return here then with the papers.\nQ. You are sure you could be in Saturday night or Monday?\nA. Yes.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\u2014\nQ. Are your papers of such a nature that you could assist the Government and help them from being defrauded?\nA. I will give them all the papers I have in my possession, and they may decide on that.\n\nQ. Do these papers treat on anything in connection with that Moosejaw contract?\nA. There is a written contract between General Laurie and myself; that is all the papers I have treating on that contract, then that letter here.\n\nQ. The ones you referred to as having had here are not connected with it?\nA. No. Thomas Ross & Riddell had a sub-contract from me.\n\nQ. Were they not bidders from the Government with General Laurie?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. They did not get it?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Was your contract the lowest?\nA. I believe it was; they did not get the contract and claimed they could not handle so large a contract, and they wished for a third; they did not know at the start whether they could carry a fourth or a third. The first contract drawn up was for either a fourth or a third, and the thing went on a day or two, and they wanted the contract drawn up by a lawyer, and I think it was handed in to you.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\u2014No, I never saw it.\n\nWitness:\u2014When the thing was closed up they got one-third of the money.\n\nQ. You and Major Bell had some conversation with regard to that contract?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Didn't you offer him half your interest if he would do the financing for you?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Didn't he state that Lewis had half of the contract from Clarke's Crossing?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Didn't he state the amount of money necessary for those contracts was very large, and Lewis being a man of great means and a friend of Col. Whitehead's that I might be able to assist him in getting payments, and it would be an assistance to him to get in with Bell?\nA. No, he did not put it in that way.\n\nQ. Did he use my name in any other way?\nA. Yes, he did.\n\nQ. Let us have it out?\nA. Bell said he wished me to have a quarter of the contract; the contract was to be in Bell's name, and I could have a $\\frac{1}{4}$, and you (Col. Whitehead) were to have an interest in it.\n\nCol. Jackson here called the attention of the witness to the fact that although he had not been sworn, he might be called upon to substantiate under oath the present statement, which he said he was willing to do.\n\nWitness:\u2014It was a better contract than I could get, and you would have a quarter interest, and they have a quarter each, and he would give me a quarter.\n\nQ. In consideration of that what would you give him in return, anything? If Bell, Lewis & Company had the contract and they had large capital why did they offer you a quarter?\nA. To have me give up the contract I had in writing, I asked him to produce his contract, and he said he had no contract in writing, that it was an understanding that he had with Bell, Lewis. He wished me to give him a quarter of mine. In the first place he said that my contract was no good, that Laurie had no power to give a contract, and that he alone had the power to give a contract, and after a while I began to ask him if he would give me an interest in an other, and he began to write, and I noticed in that writing that he acknowledged my contract.\n\nQ. Didn't you offer him in that writing half of your interest?\nA. No. We both signed it; I never intended to give him half; I wanted to catch\nhim on that paper, which I did, and it was the only thing that kept my contract at Moosejaw; I never moved any of the supplies in Bell, Lewis' name; I took the contract in my name, and Bell sent a man named Jones, who was some time a contractor under Bell at Swift Current, I think he is a machine man, and they had me sign a receipt for the goods, and on the heading of that receipt there was no Bell, Lewis mentioned. They had given instructions to the teamsters to go forth, and as soon as I found it out I wired Swinford, which telegrams can be found, that the goods under the name of Bell & Lewis.\n\nQ. What caused you to write Boultbee with reference to the contract?\n\nA. I wrote to Boultbee with reference to the contract that you said in your telegram to General Laurie; I can produce the date from telegrams I received the same hour. I thought I had been swindled out of that contract, and I would make amends, and I thought Major Bell had sent Jones there to do me out of the contract, and I wrote to Boultbee wishing him to go to Ottawa to get the matter arranged.\n\nQ. Have you got a copy of that letter you sent to Boultbee?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Didn't James Anderson go down to Ottawa in your behalf?\n\nA. No. James Anderson was going down to Ottawa, and I handed him a sealed letter to hand to Boultbee.\n\nQ. Who wrote the letter that Anderson carried down to Ottawa?\n\nA. I don't know anything about it.\n\nQ. Your conversations were about these frauds with Anderson?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Will you tell us what Anderson advised you?\n\nA. I cannot say that he advised me to do anything. I knew that Anderson was at Qu'Appelle, and that he knew considerable about the matters, and we had a talk at Qu'Appelle over the matters twice and once at Moosejaw. I never gave him a dollar to go to Ottawa in my life.\n\nQ. When Bell told you that I (Col. Whitehead) had an interest in that contract, were you aware that Bell hadn't the pleasure of my acquaintance?\n\nA. No, I did not stop to think; I did not know anything about it, and I did not care; I wished to hold the contract that I had with Laurie, and Bell said that it was no good, and when he began to write, I got a copy of it, which was the only thing which saved me; and when I returned Bell had given my contract to Ross & Riddell while I was away at the Elbow River, and he signed \"W. R. Bell,\" and did not sign Transportation Officer, and the men would not act, and on my return from the Elbow, on the 21st, I took my copy and went down and I threatened him pretty hard, and he took a back seat and allowed me to go on with my contract at Moosejaw. The bills shew on their face that the goods were shipped at the Elbow, and I had to go to the Elbow to see about the goods being shipped, and in my absence Bell gave my contract to Riddle & Ross; when I came back I saw the boys, and they shewed me the letter that Bell gave them, and they read the order, and they all say that Bell signed W. R. Bell, not Transportation Officer, not committing anybody but W. R. Bell, and they refused to go on with it, and I went on with my contract.\n\nQ. This is a letter signed by you\u2014is it not?\n\nA. I think this is correct.\n\nQ. Is the purport of that letter correct?\n\nA. I believe it is.\n\nQ. You say you are perfectly willing to swear that I had no interest in those contracts?\n\nA. No. This states that I never stated to Boultbee that you had; Boultbee can produce the letter I sent him. It will speak for itself.\n\nQ. It further states that the information was obtained from you, and you personally were defrauded of a large sum of money?\n\nA. I consider I was: I kept my teams waiting from Friday night until Tuesday, waiting to go on with that, and Bell wired for me to come down and he would give me the contract, and you wired me to come down, and then he wired: If you do not come down I will give your contract to somebody else.\nQ. Was this after I wired you that I would confirm the contract?\nA. Yes. Laurie said there would be some trouble; Bell would give me a good deal of trouble; this was another contract; I think my first contract was $135 ton.\n\nQ. What was your contract from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing?\nA. $150.\n\nQ. Are you aware that it was moved for less money?\nA. No, there were ten feed stations on the road, and they fed on the road, and I fed my own teams.\n\nQ. Can you prove that?\nA. No, I have heard so.\n\nQ. That is the information we want if you can give it to us, so that we may use the information so as they may stop from parties money going to them?\nA. I was told it by some parties, and I can tell you something further that Bell told Ross and Riddell if they took the contract at my figures that they could have the feed for nothing. They told me this when I returned.\n\nQ. Were they to take it at the same figures?\nA. No. The figures were to be less.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\u2014How much less?\nA. I have forgotten the figures, but he offered less figures than I was getting.\n\nQ. In face of the large quantities of supplies and forage that we had, and Bell offered food, etc., in consequence of the lower figure, don't you think it would have been much better for the Government to have saved so much on the ton and paid the difference in forage?\n\nA. That would be a matter for the Government; I think they should be a very good judge of that now.\n\nQ. I am asking you for an opinion.\nA. My contract was in writing, and I could not give up my contract to anybody.\n\nQ. Why did you wish to get half or quarter of the other contract?\nA. I wanted to catch Bell on that, and I wanted to get a copy, which I did, to use afterwards.\n\nQ. Therefore you put your name to a piece of paper that you had no intention of carrying out?\nA. You can call it as you wish.\n\nCol. Jackson:\u2014We would like you to bring these papers on your return?\nQ. Do you know what Bell it is who is the firm of Bell, Lewis & Company?\nA. I understand that it is an American gentleman connected with coal mines in Buffalo; I am well acquainted with J. L. Lewis. The Bell in the contract is Major Bell, to my certain knowledge.\n\nQ. This is the man who was acting as Assistant Transport Officer?\nA. Yes, the Bell I have never met in Winnipeg; it is Major Bell and John L. Lewis.\n\nQ. Do you think there is no doubt about it?\nA. I know there is.\n\nQ. Had Bell ever any carts of his own, or ponies, or anything else?\nA. He had the teams of the Bell Farm; these are not his individually, and he had twenty carts and ponies.\n\nQ. Do you know where he purchased them?\nA. From the C. P. R.\n\nQ. Did he purchase them specially for that contract?\nA. Yes; I purchased them from the C. P. R. and handed them over to him when I got the Moosejaw contract; it was about the 15th of May, some time prior to any contracts.\n\nQ. Do you know of Bell purchasing any hay and selling it to the Government?\nA. I cannot state anything further than what he told me.\n\nQ. What did he tell you?\nA. That he was selling to the Government a few hundred tons of hay.\nCol. Whitehead:\nQ. Did he say to the Government, or Hudson's Bay Company?\nA. I understood the Government; I did not pay much attention to it, and I have forgotten the price.\n\nQ. Was it on his own private account or on account of the Bell Farming Company?\nA. I don't know, and I would not like to offer anything in evidence which I could not be certain of, and he may have turned it in; I never heard of any hay being cut on the Bell Farm for the Government; I heard there was an Inspector to examine the hay at Qu'Appelle, and there was a Commission, and it was rejected.\n\nQ. It did not appear to be necessary to inspect that furnished by Bell?\nA. I suppose not.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\nQ. Did you see the hay?\nA. I saw the hay he told me he supplied.\n\nQ. Was it poor hay or good hay?\nA. It was poor hay.\n\nQ. What was wrong with it?\nA. It seemed coarse and old.\n\nQ. Was it sweet?\nA. No, it was not. It was not hay that I would like to feed my own horses on; it was musty.\n\nQ. What month was that?\nA. It was the close of May or the first of June.\n\nQ. Was the hay delivered from Qu'Appelle or at Qu'Appelle?\nA. It was delivered at Qu'Appelle and Moosejaw; he showed me some at Moosejaw which he said he furnished.\n\nQ. In what name was that furnished?\nA. I don't know, I am sure; I am sure that he pointed out hay which he said came from his machine, and it came to Moosejaw to be bound up and wired by the machine.\n\nQ. What did you think was Bell's object in mutilating the contracts in the way he suggested?\nA. He wished to get the contracts himself; and further, about the close of the transportation business, J. L. Lewis came to Moosejaw to see me, wishing me to turn over all my bills to him and he would give me money enough to pay my men, which I can show by telegrams, and then he would divide the profits between himself, Bell and me.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\nQ. Then I was left out in the cold?\nA. You were not mentioned at all\u2014you were left out in the cold; and I can show by telegrams that he was coming with money on the train, and I refused to have anything to do with it; and I asked him what we could do with Ross, who had a contract, and he said, \"We can pitch him out altogether,\" and I was afraid to touch Bell or Lewis.\n\nQ. You had some teams engaged?\nA. I had; I sent out 100 teams; it did not interfere with the other at all; these teams were at Qu'Appelle and Swift Current.\n\nQ. You were awhile at the front, and you are a pretty good judge of the cost to the Government to move the supplies by the day system, and were when you made your tender to move from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing?\nA. Yes; I learned from the Hudson Bay officer who was paying men at Qu'Appelle, and he told me that it was costing from $500 to $700 a ton.\n\nQ. And you consider that your contract at $135 was a saving to the Government?\nA. It looks that way to me.\n\nQ. You considered from the time you made your contract that the Government were moving them at a much less cost than it was previously costing them?\nA. Oh, yes; in the first place, the Government had teams which cost from $18.00 a day, and these teams were only pulling 1,800 or 2,000, and the teamsters were doing as they pleased, and they would take them eighteen or twenty miles and dump them on the ground at night, and some other teams would come and take them on, and they were\nloaded ten times before they reached Clarke's Crossing, and I loaded my teams 2,400 and 3,000, and I billed them all the way to Clarke's Crossing and brought back anything to come; I do not say today that I went into that contract as a philanthropist; I knew pretty well what my teams would do, and just how far I could take them in a day. I have been dealing with teams for twenty years.\n\nCol. Forrest:\nQ. At the time you made those contracts the price had gone down from $10 to $4.50 a day?\nA. No, not at that time; in my contract with the Government you will see all I asked was $5 a day, if they used my teams by the day.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. Then the Government would furnish you with forage?\nA. My contract will tell; I think the Government have charged me for my teams while they were working for them by the day; if I had known I could have hired teams at $2; I had the offer of working on the construction of 100 miles of telegraph; the prices had gone down, and men were willing to work for almost anything; there was no trouble at any time from the start; there was no murmur from anyone when the teams were cut down from $10 to $4.50; when we were working on the railway we were getting from $2 to $2.50 a day, and that was all we looked for; contractors were willing to do it for very little.\n\nCol. Jackson:\u2014Will you kindly bring in those papers?\nA. There are some papers which went from Bell to Laurie ought to go in the same time as mine, and the copy of yours, Col. Whitehead, should be forthcoming.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\u2014I never mentioned Stewart's name in my telegrams.\n\nCol. Jackson:\u2014There was some talk about a contract being cancelled at Moosejaw and re-let at a higher rate. What was the meaning of that?\nA. I never heard anything about that, excepting the telegram from the Colonel here cancelling my contract on the 9th of May.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\u2014You had so many days after my cancelling your contract to continue it?\nA. I know I had, but Laurie said: You know and the Government know that they don't want all that stuff taken back to Clarke's Crossing.\n\nQ. Do you know why I cancelled that contract?\nA. No, I don't know anything about it.\n\nQ. I had found that a large quantity of rotten stuff was being moved, and I thought it best to cancel the contract.\nA. The rotten stuff that I saw was particularly feed.\n\nQ. It has been sold by auction since?\nA. I don't know; a few bales of hay have been burned, but there was no rotten stuff moved from there, because there was some oats there when I went there, and I wished to move all mine, and Laurie would not let me. I will return Saturday night.\n\nNovember 13, 1885\u20144. P. M.\n\nJohn Stewart being duly sworn, saith as follows to Lieut. Col. Forrest:\n\nQ. What is your occupation and residence?\nA. Manitou is my residence; occupation, railway contractor.\n\nQ. You were a contractor of the Transport?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Will you please state to the Commission all that transpired while you were in connection with that contract?\nA. I have a copy of the contract with me. This is not the original. The original contract differs a little from the copy that you have. \"Moosejaw Route accepted\" was not in the first contract. The first contract was for Qu'Appelle and Moosejaw; also from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing and from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing. It was an\nexact copy of that contract, with the difference of that term, \"Moosejaw Contract accepted.\" The other contract was an exact copy of the one I produce, except that term on the right hand, \"Moosejaw Route Contract accepted.\" That was not in the other contract, and immediately on the completion of the writing of the contract the same party that wrote the other wrote this (document produced), subletting a portion of the Qu'Appelle contract, as well as a portion of the Moosejaw contract. It was written the same night. I would like to retain all papers in my possession until I have finally settled with the Government; that is all papers that are any evidence whatever of my contract with the Government. They were written, by the way, by Mr. Dixon here, and he wrote this, subletting a portion of the contract, and the other one I gave to the Transport Officer at Clarke's Crossing on the 28th or 29th of the month. He was fully appointed, and was going back to take charge of Clarke's Crossing, and I told him that the freight that was going forward on the Moosejaw trail was under my contract. It was Captain Hudson.\n\nQ. Was the first contract accepted?\nA. Yes, certainly. That proviso excluding Qu'Appelle was not in the original contract, and the same man that wrote that knew that it was not, and he also wrote this, subletting a portion. It was signed by General Laurie and myself. (Document produced subletting a portion.)\n\nQ. You sent in a contract for freighting from Qu'Appelle and Moosejaw?\nA. Yes, I put in a tender at both places, both Qu'Appelle and Moosejaw.\n\nQ. You also had a tender in for Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford?\nA. I never had a contract for that. I made a written offer to do it, and from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing as well as from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing at five dollars less than the contract. Then when I found I could not work the Qu'Appelle line I made this contract to Ross & Riddell (produced); that is the contract from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing, giving them one-third of the tonnage. I sublet one-third of the contract to Ross & Riddell on the 19th of May. It was dated back to cover some work they had done a few days say. This one superseded the small one subletting a portion.\n\nQ. Why did you make a sub-contract with Ross & Riddell?\nA. They were bidding at the time that I did, and when Laurie explained to Ross & Riddell and myself, they stated they could not handle it all, and we were to divide the contract.\n\nQ. Have you anything about a memorandum of agreement between you and Major Bell, and also give your reasons for signing that?\nA. On the 20th I went to Qu'Appelle to take possession of the Qu'Appelle route. I found Mr. Jones there, Mr. Bell's clerk, and I could not very well take possession that night of that route, and I waited until night. Major Bell arrived from Winnipeg on the night of the 20th of May. We did not have much talk that night, but the following day I went to his office and told him that I had the contract, and wished to take charge of the work. He told me that he had a contract himself covering Qu'Appelle, Moosejaw, Swift Current and Calgary, and that he had made arrangements in Winnipeg with J. L. Lewis and Mr. Whitehead as partners to handle all the freight, and wished me to go further west. I did not wish to do so, and he told me that Laurie had no right to give a contract, that he was a \"damn fool,\" and that he would have him dismissed before a week. I had learned, however, that Mr. Wrigley, of the Hudson's Bay, did not consider Bell had the right to give contracts, and I learned in this office from Col. Whitehead something tantamount to the same on the occasion of Bell wiring me to produce fifty teams, and get transportation for four or five teams, and Mr. Whitehead said that Bell had no right to order teams. He told me that J. L. Lewis and he and Whitehead were going to work in together, and that he would give me an interest in that contract at $212 a-ton, and he put it in writing. He would give me an interest at higher prices than my contract. I saw then he was about to recognize my contract in writing. I was afraid of the man, and I was very anxious to get his signature, and I never intended to go with him, so he made a little memo., a sworn notarial copy of which I have here. (Produced and filed. Exhibit \"R.\")\n\nCommission now adjourned for thirty minutes.\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nJohn Stewart's evidence continued.\n\nCol. Jackson:\u2014\n\nQ. You understand you are still on your oath, Mr. Stewart.\n\nA. Yes. Bell had refused to recognize my contract with Laurie, and said that Laurie had no right to make a contract; and I notice in the memo., that he had written, that he recognized my contract. This was the reason that I signed that memo., and I wished some recognition from Bell on the contract. While in the office with him on that occasion, his figures were to be $212.00 per ton for Qu'Appelle, from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing, and from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing and from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford. He stated, to make the thing look right in the eyes of the public, he had arranged with Col. Whitehead to call for tenders, and I remarked that these tenders would soon interfere with the present contract. He replied \"O, no, we intend to pigeon-hole the tenders until every thing is over.\" That is about all that happened at that interview. I went that night to Swift Current after teams to perform the Moosejaw contract, and on the 24th of May I made my first shipment from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing or to the Elbow. On the 25th of May I received the following telegram:\n\nQu'Appelle, 25th May.\n\n\"J. Stewart,\n\n(Exhibit \"A\") Moosejaw,\n\n\"You better go to Swift Current, matters there are rather mixed.\n\n\"W. R. BELL.\"\n\nI refused to go, and explained everything to General Laurie, and told him about the arrangement that Bell wished me to acquiesce in. I showed him the memo., dated the 21st May, referred to in former evidence, and told him about the tenders that were to be pigeon-holed; and continued on my contract with General Laurie. I positively state that I didn't work nor acquiesce with Major Bell in that agreement one hour or one day. On the 27th Bell came to Moosejaw to inform me that the boat had left the Elbow, and that my teams had better be forwarded to Clarke's Crossing. Before seeing me he had seen General Laurie, and he told me that I had exposed him to Laurie, and that we would have a difficult matter in settling up with General Laurie. I had sent for a team to start to the Elbow to overtake the teams. I made no answer to Bell. But I found Ross and Riddel, my sub-contractors. Riddel I wished to take with me to the Elbow, and told Ross to have nothing to do with Major Bell until I returned. I immediately started for the Elbow, and arrived at nine o'clock that same day. The following day I reloaded the teams and returned with Sergeant McQueen to Moosejaw on the day after. On the way I told him my difficulty with Bell, and on meeting some new teams stopped them and examined the shipping bills, and discovered that the goods were being shipped with the name of Ross and Riddel. I arrived at Moosejaw that night, found Ross; he showed me a letter which might be called a contract with Major Bell. He had shown this previously to General Laurie, and they discovered that Bell had signed this merely \"W. R. Bell,\" not binding the Government. Ross stated the reason that he had accepted this from Bell was Bell told him that I was going further west, and that he had arranged with me before I started. I told Ross that he had no arrangements with him, and that I would continue on my contract with General Laurie. Ross handed me the paper, a letter Bell had left him. It reads as follows:\n\n\"Moosejaw, May 27th.\n\n\"My dear Stewart,\n\n\"I have made a very satisfactory arrangement to me. I have quite cleared myself with the General and satisfied Ross entirely. Now I have laid a foundation for a good thing for you, and I want you to fall in with my arrangements, and I trust all will come out to our mutual satisfaction.\n\n\"Yours in haste,\n\n\"BELL.\"\n\n(Exhibit \"B\")\nCol. Peebles.\n\nQ. Is that the original?\nA. Yes. I told Ross that I would not fall in with Mr. Bell's arrangement, consequently Ross gave up the arrangement with Bell, and continued shipping on my contract, afterwards assigning all the shipping bills to me.\n\n(Exhibit \"C\")\n\n\"John Stewart,\nMoosejaw,\nSee Gen. Laurie regarding Swift Current supplies.\n\n\"W. R. BELL.\"\n\nI saw General Laurie, and he told me the supplies referred to in the telegram dated at Swift Current and addressed to me, were the same.\n\n(Exhibit \"D\")\n\nQu'Appelle, May 21st.\n\n\"Gen. J. W. Laurie\n\n\"Will handle mail as reasonable as freight according to speed. Will close with you tomorrow there, as I leave for Swift Current tonight with owners of teams to give them contracts. Tell teamsters so. Will haul goods from landing to Elbow at prices corresponding to present contract, if trail is good.\n\n\"JOHN STEWART.\"\n\nSwift Current, May 21st.\n\n\"John Stewart,\nQu'Appelle.\n\n\"I am discharging over two hundred teams at Saskatchewan Landing tomorrow, and there is a supply of stores at that point which I may leave for steamers or bring in here for transport to Moosejaw. Do you wish to have any of those teams, and, if so, would you contract to move stores at that point to Elbow or to Clarke's Crossing, and, if so, what quantity and at what price? Reply immediately, as I am sending away the teams.\n\n\"J. W. LAURIE.\"\n\nHe asked me to make a tender to haul the goods from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford. I made up a tender at $135 per ton, and I to bear all expenses and to take the teams from Moosejaw by trail and not by rail. General Laurie was communicating with Colonel Whitehead and General Middleton about the same supplies. A party named Rutherford also made a tender that day, and General Laurie recommended my tender, as I had a large number of teams which I could turn in, and wired recommending my tender to Col. Whitehead, who replied to give Stewart the contract. At the close of the telegram it states I would advise Bell or he would advise me, I don't know which. I wished to start at that moment with the teams to Saskatchewan Landing. Laurie said no, that Major Bell's consent had better first be obtained, or he would give me trouble afterwards. Consequently, he wired Bell, then Major Bell wired as follows:\n\n(Exhibit \"E\")\n\nQu'Appelle, 30th.\n\n\"Jno. Stewart, care Mr. Ross,\n\n\"Come down here first train.\n\n\"W. R. BELL.\"\n\nI didn't go down. He wires again, as follows:\n\n(Exhibit \"F\")\n\nQu'Appelle, May 30th.\n\n\"Jno. Stewart,\n\n\"Let me know what you do with Black's teams. Want to see you at once to arrange about Swift Current freighting. This is very important. Come down today, if possible.\n\n\"W. R. BELL.\"\nAnother telegram:\n\n(Exhibit \"G\")\n\n\"Indian Head, May 30th.\n\nJ. Stewart,\n\n\"When will you come down? Let me know as I close contract before to-morrow night.\n\n\"W. R. BELL.\"\n\n(Exhibit \"H\")\n\n\"Qu'Appelle, May 30th.\n\nJohn Stewart,\n\n\"Arrange on best terms to engage eighty teams just arrived to go to Swift Current.\n\n\"A number of teams there have re-engaged, but not enough. The new engagement will not interfere with the old contract regarding free transportation home.\n\n\"W. R. BELL.\"\n\n(Exhibit \"I\")\n\n\"Qu'Appelle, May 31st.\n\nJohn Stewart,\n\n\"Are you coming down here to-night? Reply quick.\n\n\"W. R. BELL.\"\n\nI replied as follows:\n\n(Exhibit \"J\")\n\n\"Moosejaw, May 31st.\n\nMajor Bell,\n\nQu'Appelle.\n\n\"If my contract is accepted would like to send eighty teams to-night. Please advise me, and as soon as shipping is arranged will go down and see you.\n\n\"JOHN STEWART.\"\n\nI wished to go down at that time to close arrangements at Qu'Appelle, but Laurie said no, that he thought Major Bell would like to make a deal similar to our previous one. And I received this telegram:\n\n(Exhibit \"K\")\n\n\"Qu'Appelle, June 1st.\n\nJ. Stewart,\n\n\"Will you come down; I want to see you.\n\n\"W. R. BELL.\"\n\nAlso this other one:\n\n(Exhibit \"L\")\n\n\"Qu'Appelle, June 1st.\n\nJ. Stewart,\n\n\"Do nothing in connection with contract. Have much lower offer than yours here; unless you come down, will accept it. Reply.\n\n\"W. R. BELL.\"\n\nDuring the sending and receiving of these telegrams I was in General Laurie's office, and he concluded best not to go down, and I didn't, nor did I reply to any of these telegrams, but started with my teams with loads for Clarke's Crossing. A few days after this I met Mr. Jones at the depot. He was on his way west. I understood from him that he was about taking a contract, and I didn't ask him what figures. I continued to work at Moosejaw... Before this contract was concluded, I went down to see Major Bell, some time after this had happened. I had learned that he was telling some of my teamsters that they would never get their pay. I went down to interview him. He was very independent, and said that I would never get my money and I told him that I was prepared to fight. I had reference to it in a business way. I told him that he was very foolish to quarrel with me, after placing such weapons in my hands. He at once referred to the memo, and begged of...\nme not to use that against him. I told him that it would be my last resort. I came back again to Moosejaw, and on the eighth or ninth of June I received the following:\n\n(Exhibit \"M\")\n\nWINNIPEG, 8th.\n\n\"John Stewart,\n\n\"Contractor, Moosejaw,\n\n\"Your freighting contract with General Laurie, on behalf of the Dominion Government, cancelled herewith. Minister will decide who will have contract for transport.\n\n\"E. A. WHITEHEAD,\n\n\"Chief Commis. Officer.\"\n\nI enquired of General Laurie if I could not use the ten days' notice mentioned in the contract. On General Laurie's return (he was in Winnipeg at the time), he told me he thought that they had all the supplies at Clarke's Crossing they required, and that I had better quit. I have forgotten the date of my last shipment. Before General Laurie went to Winnipeg, he saw a notice in the paper calling for tenders to be opened on June 5th. He asked me if I was going down to try and get the contract. I said no, and thought I would write out the tender, but didn't consider that tenders would be open on June 5th, as I thought they would be pigeon-holed. Lieut. Dixon knew this at the same time. I told McQueen, on the 28th of May, the story about pigeon-holing the tenders. On a Sabbath evening, June 14th, J. L. Lewis came to Moosejaw and wished me to accept money enough to pay all the men, stating that he could realize more money on my vouchers than I could. Up to this time I considered that he was working on the $212 contract, and after paying the men he wished to divide the balance in three equal parts between Major Bell, himself and myself. He made no mention of Col. Whitehead's name whatever. I would not consent to this, and on the 18th of June I received the following:\n\n(Exhibit \"N\")\n\nWINNIPEG, 18th.\n\n\"John Stewart,\n\n\"Moosejaw,\n\n\"Leaving for Qu'Appelle this morning. Better meet me there with vouchers, will return first train.\n\n\"J. L. LEWIS.\"\n\nOn the 19th of June I received the following:\n\n(Exhibit \"O\")\n\nQU'APPELLE, 19th.\n\n\"John Stewart,\n\n\"Leaving on freight with funds; sorry missed you yesterday. Await arrival.\n\n\"J. L. LEWIS.\"\n\nThis was the day before I had the interview with Bell. Afterwards I received the following:\n\n(Exhibit \"P\")\n\nQU'APPELLE, 19th.\n\n\"John Stewart,\n\n\"Moose Jaw,\n\n\"Freight train West two hours late. Will you meet me here on to-night's train? I must go to Winnipeg to-night. I am ready to pay all claims.\n\n\"LEWIS.\"\n\nI noticed the word claims, and thought it wasn't right. I sent the following telegram:\n\n(Exhibit \"Q\")\n\n\"Qu'Appelle,\n\n\"Vouchers not arrived from North to-day, as I expected. Will go to Winnipeg on arrival of all bills.\n\n\"JOHN STEWART.\"\nWhen the bills arrived Mr. Ross and myself came into Winnipeg with them.\n\nI have been asked to write some letters to state that Col. Whitehead wasn't implicated. On the Sunday after my arrival W. L. Boyle told me that Col. Whitehead would probably lose his position through some rumors which had been circulated, and that there was no pointed evidence against him, and that it would be well to write the letters stating the falsity of these rumors. I refused to do this, but I signed a letter dictated by him as follows:\n\n(Exhibit \"S\")\n\n(Private)\n\nWINNIPEG, 2nd July, 1885.\n\n\"Lt. Col. Whitehead,\n\nWINNIPEG.\n\nDear Sir,\n\n\"It having come to my ears that some one has seen fit to make the statement, both in Ottawa and here, that you are personally interested in some of the contracts for the transportation service in the North West, I feel it to be my duty to at once write and say that I hope that, should this statement be carried to you, you will not consider this gossip has been spread by me, but, on the contrary, I deeply regret that such damaging statements have been circulated.\n\n\"It is, no doubt, some idle report circulated, out of which to make political capital.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJOHN STEWART.\n\nGovt. Contractor.\"\n\nA day or two afterwards Mr. Blanchard came to me; and stated that he was the Attorney for Col. Whitehead, and that he intended to prosecute, and, if possible, put the guilty party in Penitentiary, and he wished me to write a letter stating that the rumors were false. I told him that if he wished me to do anything to ask me by letter. I received a letter, the second day afterwards, as follows:\n\n(Exhibit \"T\")\n\nWINNIPEG, July 9th, 1885.\n\n\"John Stewart, Esq.,\n\nCity,\n\nDear Sir,\n\n\"I am instructed by Lieut.-Col. Whitehead to ask you to be good enough to reply to certain questions involved in a charge made by Mr. Boultbee against him at Ottawa. They are as follows:\n\n1. Did you authorize Mr. Boultbee to use your name in connection with the charges?\n2. Did you write to Mr. Boultbee at all about them?\n3. If you did not, do you know who did?\n4. Did James Anderson write to Mr. Boultbee on your behalf?\n5. Had you any conversations with Anderson about the team contracts.\n6. Is James Anderson your partner in any of the contracts.\n7. Was he a partner with you in the contract of Stewart and Earle and the H.B. Co?\n\nI trust that you will not consider any of these questions either improper or unjustifiable. You know, from my verbal explanations to you, the position in which Col. Whitehead has been placed, and that it is absolutely necessary that he should defend himself.\n\nMay I ask an answer at your earliest convenience.\n\nI am, yours very truly,\n\nSEDLEY BLANCHARD.\"\n\nThis to the effect that Col. Whitehead had been accused of irregularities, and I wrote the following letter, asking him to state what these irregularities were, by letter:\n\n(Exhibit \"T\" continued)\nWINNIPEG, July 9th, 1885.\n\n\"Sedley Blanchard, Esq.,\nWinnipeg.\n\n\"Dear Sir,\n\n\"Yours of this date is received, and in reply I would ask you to be good enough, in order to save any future misunderstandings, to send me a copy of the charges which you state have been made by Mr. Boulbbee against Col.

When you can show me that Mr. Boulbbee has made certain charges and the nature of such charges, I shall then be in a position to answer your letter, which you will readily see that at present I am not.\n\n\"Yours truly,\n\n\"JOHN STEWART,\n\"Govt. Contractor.\"\n\nThe next day I received the following:\n\n(\"Exhibit \"U\")\n\nWINNIPEG, July 10th, 1885.\n\n\"John Stewart, Esq.,\nc/o \"W. L. Boyle, Esq.,\nCity.\n\n\"Dear Sir,\n\nWe enclose you copy of the correspondence between Mr. Boulbbee and the Government, as requested.\n\n\"Yours very truly,\n\n\"SEDLEY BLANCHARD\"\n\nPer J. S. M.\n\n(Copy)\n\nTORONTO, June 22, 1885.\n\nHon. A. P. Caron,\nMinister of Militia, Ottawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI am instructed by Mr. John Stewart, Contractor, Winnipeg, that he had a contract with the Government to carry freight from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing at $150 per ton net, and another to carry freight from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford at $135 per ton net, and that he made all his arrangements for carrying them out, which involved the transportation of some thousand tons or more of freight. Mr. Stewart was, however, not allowed to carry out the work by those who, under the Government, had control of it, but it was handed over to other parties\u2014Bell and Lewis and one Jones and others who have been doing the work at far higher prices than those agreed on by Stewart. Now I think, under these circumstances, payment for the work done should be stopped, and an investigation had, in order that the profits accruing from the execution of the work may be paid over to Stewart, and not to these men, Bell or Lewis or Jones, who, Stewart is informed, are interested with Bell and others who are representing the Government, and who have been instrumental in depriving Stewart of his contracts for the purpose of improperly putting money in their own pockets. I am led to believe that an investigation into this matter will not only be the means of doing justice to Stewart, but of saving the Government a large sum of money.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nA. BOULTBEE.\n\nOTTAWA, June 25, 1885.\n\nHon. A. P. Caron,\nMinister of Militia, Ottawa.\n\nSir,\n\nSince seeing you today, in reference to my letter of the 22nd inst., in the matter of John Stewart, respecting the contracts for the conveyance of freight from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing and from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford, I have made enquiries,\nas to the status of W. R. Bell, and find that he is acting as Assistant Transport Officer under Col. Whitehead, and, with him, has the management and control of the forwarding of supplies from the points mentioned in my letter of the 22nd inst. I am also informed that this man Bell is one of the firm of Bell & Lewis, referred to in my letter of the 22nd inst., who are doing the work which Stewart contracted for. I am also informed that Jones, who is referred to in the same letter, is in the employ of Bell. Stewart is in possession of written evidence, over Bell's signature, establishing that he, Bell, is doing the work Stewart contracted for, and at a higher price, and that he, Bell, offered Stewart a share of the profits at the higher price, in order to induce him to consent to the arrangement. Stewart also informs me that Bell told him that Col. Whitehead was also to have a share of the profits. Now, as I stated in my letter of the 22nd inst., and told you to-day, that what you want on behalf of Stewart is that no money shall be paid over on account of this work until an investigation has been heard, so that any profits which may be made herein shall be paid over to Stewart, if he is found entitled thereto.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nA. BOULTBEE.\n\n(Copy)\n\n(Exhibit \"U\" continued.)\n\nTORONTO, June 22, 1885.\n\nPRIVATE.\n\nDEAR CARON,\n\nI inclose an official letter to you in this enclosure, so that it may meet your own eye. This man has been grossly wronged, and I fancy the Government has been as grossly robbed at the same time. I am going down to see you in the matter within a day or two, as soon as I can leave.\u2014Meanwhile the payment of the money should be stopped. I shall be able to satisfy you that Bell is defrauding the Government as well as Stewart.\n\nYours in haste,\n\nA. BOULTBEE,\n\nP. S.\u2014My own impression is that the Government are losing from $40.00 to $60.00 a ton, in transport.\n\nA. BOULTBEE.\n\n(Exhibit \"U\" continued.)\n\nWINNIPEG, July 10, 1885.\n\nSEDLEY BLANCHARD, Esq.,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDEAR SIR,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of this morning's date, enclosing copy of correspondence which has passed between Mr. Boultbee and the Hon. Mr. Caron, for which please accept my thanks.\n\nIn answer, therefore, to your letters of yesterday, I beg now to say that, as I have never seen Mr. Boultbee to speak to in my life, I think that the best way of assuring you of the truth to the answers to the questions which you have put to me will be to give you a copy of the only letter that I have up to this time written to Mr. Boultbee, which will of course speak for itself.\n\nI have asked Mr. Boultbee to send me the letter referred to, and as soon as I receive it I shall be glad to hand you a copy.\n\nI might, however, call your attention to our letter marked \"private,\" addressed by myself to your client, dated 2nd July.\n\nIn reference to your questions numbers 6 and 7, I would say that I am somewhat astonished at your asking such a question.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJOHN STEWART.\n(Exhibit \"R\")\n\nCopy of agreement signed by W. R. Bell and John Stewart, dated May 21st, 1885.\n\n\"This memo. of agreement between W. R. Bell and John Stewart is made in good faith and on the honor of each, that out of the contract now existing in the name of John Stewart for transport, W. R. Bell to have one-half profits or losses; that out of the contract now existing in the name of Bell & Lewis for same work, but at increased price, J. Stewart to have one-quarter interest in profits.\"\n\n\"W. R. BELL.\"\n\"JOHN STEWART.\"\n\nMay 21st, 1885.\n\nI, Thomas Henry Gilmour, of the City of Winnipeg, Notary Public, do hereby certify that the above written copy of agreement is a true and exact copy of the original memorandum of agreement of which it purports to be a copy, and that the above was copied by me from the original memo of agreement on the 24th day of August, A.D. 1885.\n\nT. H. GILMOUR,\nNotary Public for Manitoba.\n\nLt. Col. Forrest:\n\nQ. With regard to these negotiations between you and Bell in the result your prices were effected by these propositions, now where there has been collusion to make up two prices have they profited by your collusion?\n\nA. That is easily answered. I worked on the price of $110 per ton, I didn't go in collusion, I didn't acquiesce one hour with Major Bell, it sounded too much like a penitentiary job for me. My contract was for $110 per ton, but that contract Major Bell wished me to acquiesce in was for $212 per ton. Had I acquiesced in this arrangement the Government would have been wronged to the extent of over $100,000.\u2014$102 per ton at Moosejaw and something in the neighborhood of $60 per ton at Qu'Appelle and a like amount at Saskatchewan Landing\u2014the aggregate I know would amount to over $100,000. Further, they followed my advice in changing the plan of transportation, making each teamster responsible for his load and charging him with any loss the Government sustained. Further, my contract was about one-fifth of the amount that I understand it was costing the Government to carry supplies from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing. I received the knowledge from Mr. Rigby who was handling the pay rolls and making out the cheques for the H.B. Co., in the same office with the Paymaster, Mr. Crawford. He advised me that it was costing from $500 to $700 a ton from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing.\n\nThat memo. was never acted upon, as we were never on friendly terms. I didn't realize a dollar from it.\n\nCross-Examination.\n\nLt. Col. Whitehead:\n\nQ. Did General Laurie tell you that your contract at Moosejaw was no good?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. I asked the question because in a previous examination you said he did. Did you consider Bell the authorised party to give the contracts?\n\nA. It was a very hard matter to find out who was authorised to do so.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. What date did you come to Swift Current?\n\nA. The first visit to Swift Current I think was on the night of the 21st of May after meeting Bell that day.\n\nQ. Why did Ross or Bell assign the shipping bills to you?\n\nA. Bell never did to my knowledge; Ross did, he gave up the little contract Bell gave him, not wishing to act upon it.\n\nQ. What was your contract to Battleford?\n\nA. $135 per ton, to be concluded in two weeks.\n\nQ. At what rate was it carried out?\nA. At a greater cost to the Government than that. The contract reads $125 with rations; my contract was not to cost the Government any feed for the men and horses, or for transport. The aggregate would be higher in cost than mine.\n\nQ. Why did Col. Whitehead cancel your contract?\nA. I only assign the telegram I read.\n\nQ. You state that General Laurie gave you a reason, was it not on account of damaged provisions left on hand?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Did not General Laurie tell you that the damaged stuff was left, and should not be moved?\nA. He never assigned that as a reason for cancelling my contract.\n\nQ. Do you know if these tenders were pigeon-holed?\nA. I don't know if they were, my tenders were not. I never said they were pigeon-holed. In support of this I would like Lt. Dixon to be interrogated; he knows that before this I explained all about these tenders. I explained to McQueen that Bell said they were to be pigeon-holed on the return trip from Saskatchewan Landing. It was his first knowledge that tenders were to be called for.\n\nQ. When you signed this agreement to divide your interest with Major Bell at Moosejaw did you intend to carry it out?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Then why did you sign it in good faith?\nA. I wished to obtain his signature to something to recognize my contract. He broke faith that very same day by offering ten dollars less. See contract\u2014Bell & Lewis.\n\nQ. What was your tender at Calgary?\nA. I don't remember.\n\nQ. Then you didn't tender for the Calgary contract?\nA. I won't say positively that I did.\n\nQ. At what date did you make the agreement with Major Bell to share in the contracts?\nA. The memo. is beside you.\n\nJohn Stewart's evidence continued\u2014November 17th.\n\nExhibits \"S, T and U\" produced.\n\nI wired Mr. Boulthbee to return the copy of my letter, which he has not done. In that letter I mentioned the facts as I did in my evidence.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. Can you give us any information about Howard's contract?\nA. No, I can't tell you anything further than hearsay.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\nQ. Then you swear that Col. Whitehead had an interest in your contracts?\nA. I never said you did; I have stated facts as far as I know how.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\nNovember 17th, 1885.\n\nLt. F. J. Dixon, Staff Officer to Gen. Laurie, called.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. Do you know something about the Moosejaw and Swift Current freighting?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. At what station?\nA. Moose Jaw; at the time the contract was made I was there.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about the transactions there?\nA. I accompanied General Laurie from Winnipeg to Swift Current on the 18th of May, stopped over at Moosejaw for one day, and Laurie conversed with Messrs. Stewart, Ross and Riddell regarding a contract. There were certain written conditions he had there which were shown to the different persons, and he asked for tenders.\nQ. Where did he get those written conditions?\nA. He made them up. Stewart was the only person who made a written tender. Ross thought he could not carry all the work at once, so he withdrew, leaving Stewart the sole tenderer. The contract was made at the time between Stewart and General Laurie at Moosejaw. There were no supplies to move then, but when the base was moved to Moosejaw, Stewart commenced working on the contract.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about the moving of the freight at Swift Current?\nA. No. After some days at Moosejaw, someone complained that the shipping bills were made out in the name of Bell, Lewis & Co., the heading being changed, and there were a great many interviews and much telegraphing between General Laurie and Major Bell at Qu\u2019Appelle. After that they were changed, that is the bill-heads to \u201cStewart, Contractor.\u201d I drew up the contract between Stewart and General Laurie, and was a witness to the signatures.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about General Laurie\u2019s authority to make that contract?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about Ross and Riddell?\nA. They were sub-contractors under Stewart. They withdrew, and were getting a sub-contract under Stewart.\n\nQ. Had you any interference with Stewart on that contract?\nA. There were a great many teamsters who had some trouble. They wanted to know for whom they were working, if they were hauling for Bell, Lewis & Co., or Stewart. We didn\u2019t know anything about that more than we were told.\n\nQ. Then you know nothing particularly about that, up to the time of moving the 7th Fusiliers?\nA. No. Col. Williams telegraphed to know if we had made any arrangements, but the General telegraphed that the transport would be arranged. One morning we got a telegram from Major Bell to send 25 teams to Clarke\u2019s Crossing to bring down the 7th, and then he telegraphed that they be recalled. I recalled them the next afternoon. Riddell got a telegram from Sinclair to send thirty-five teams to Clarke\u2019s Crossing; he sent them out, and that afternoon I received a telegram to send these teams. Before recalling these teams, I telegraphed to Bell that he would be responsible for the twenty-five teams for a day.\n\nQ. Do you know if any of the teams were sent from Bell?\nA. I don\u2019t know; when the 7th came in they asked me for their time, and I refused, and sent them to Col. Williams.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\nQ. Why did you refuse?\nA. Because Col. Williams told me that they were to have been discharged half-way between Moosejaw and Clarke\u2019s Crossing.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. Whose teams were they?\nA. Sinclair\u2019s outfit.\n\nQ. Do you know the number of those teams that came down and have returned?\nA. No. The thirty-five teams Ross and Riddell sent out were certified to by Col. Williams.\n\nQ. Did you come in shortly after this?\nA. I remained until after the 7th left.\n\nQ. Do you know anything more about this transport?\nA. About the Saskatchewan Landing and Battleford transport, I merely saw the telegrams sent and received by General Laurie; it is known as Howard\u2019s contract, but it wasn\u2019t known whose it was at first.\n\nQ. Was there anything special in these telegrams?\nA. No; except that he ordered the stuff to be removed by water. There was delay on account of the swollen river. It was reported about the contract being made by land, and that this man would claim indemnification from the Government.\nCol. Peebles:\nQ. You said that some bill-heads were headed Bell & Lewis. Was there any contract with them. How came they to be headed that way?\nA. The only explanation which they offered was that these had been sent up from Qu'Appelle where these books had been used on their old contract.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. What was the condition of the hay that was delivered at Swift Current and Moosejaw?\nA. Some of it was very good, and sometimes some was very bad; often two or three bales were opened before we could get enough for horses feed, it was marshy, and of poor quality. It was apparently good, but when it was opened, it was very much spoiled.\nQ. Then any person might be taken in with it?\nA. Yes, quite easily.\nQ. There was something there called chopped feed, what condition was it in?\nA. Very good, but subsequently part of it became bad, as it was laid out in the rain, and became caked and heated.\nQ. Did you examine the oats yourself?\nA. No, Major Rickard was the Supply Officer.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\nQ. Do you know the price of Ross & Riddell's first contract before they withdrew from General Laurie,\u2014what did they tender at?\nA. I don't know that an actual tender was made.\nQ. Wasn't there a collusion between Ross and Riddell and John Stewart about withdrawing their tender and letting Stewart's tender alone, and then dividing afterwards?\nA. The condition was they would not tender if they received a portion of the carrying from Stewart.\nQ. Did General Laurie move supplies from Swift Current to Moosejaw?\nA. On the cars, yes.\nQ. It was afterwards moved on Stewart's contract?\nA. Yes, from Moosejaw, but I don't know the quantity.\n\nLt. Col. Forrest:\nQ. Was it to keep up the prices that this arrangement was made?\nA. It was thought that Ross could not carry the whole contract out, and if he tendered for a portion of it he might do it for less than he could for all of it.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\nQ. You know Ross and Stewart?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Don't you think Ross is as capable of carrying out a contract as Stewart?\nA. Yes, for it was thought that it required a great deal of capital to carry out this contract.\n\nOctober 14, 1885.\n\nMajor W. R. Bell, called.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nThe matter of transport is up again, and we desire to know what you know about it?\nA. Do I understand that charges are made against me here?\nQ. No charges against you. It has been reported that there are certain irregularities between some officers of the Department and Contractors, and we wish to know about it?\nA. My name has been brought up very frequently, has it not?\nQ. There are no charges against you, any more than you have seen in the papers?\nA. I don't notice that at all; if there are charges I have a right to know what they are.\nQ. Can you tell us anything about the contract at Swift Current, the moving of freight there?\nA. Yes, I can tell you all about it?\nQ. It would be better for you to give it without questions, I suppose, if you could do so?\n\nA. If I knew exactly what you wanted I would give it, but I understand from parties around the hotel, this morning, that they were making charges against me, and I think that it is nothing but fair that I should know what the charges are, and what I would have to explain; it appears that they are boasting that they are against me.\n\nCol. Jackson:\u2014No charges against you that I am aware of.\n\nWitness:\u2014Of course it is a very serious thing with me, and I am willing to give facts about everything I know.\n\nQ. Do you know about the contract of Stewart, Ross & Riddell?\n\nA. Yes; the first I knew about a contract being taken was at Troy. Stewart came and told me he had made a contract with General Laurie, for the transport of all freight from Clarke's Crossing and the Elbow, and at the same time told me he had no money, and asked me if I would advance him the money; I asked him his figures and he told me $110 a ton for it, and he said he had sublet a contract to Ross & Riddell at $105; I said I could not take any interest in it, but I would advance him the money; if he would confine himself to Moosejaw, I would have something to do with him, for I knew that Qu'Appelle had been given up; he went away to Moosejaw, or came to Winnipeg, and I heard nothing more about him for a week; in the meantime Col. Whitehead wired me to make contracts for freight.\n\nCol. Whitehead here read telegram:\u2014Having received instructions from the Minister of Militia to cancel all contracts for transport, I authorise you to dismiss all teams and re-engage them without middle system, etc.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\u2014And at that time I never saw the Major, and never knew him.\n\nYou can confirm that?\n\nA. Yes. As you are aware, there was some doubt about the power of the different officers, and I was careful about acting; I did not know anything about General Laurie, and all I knew was, Bedson was my superior officer, and I was receiving different telegrams, and very doubtful whether General Laurie had any power to make any contracts; I was told that he had not, and when I found that I immediately withdrew from the whole thing; but in the meantime, I had made this contract by Col. Whitehead's orders, with Bell, Lewis & Co. Lewis when I went to him, knowing him to be a strong man in this country, and I had no time to advertise, and it was a mere temporary thing to be cancelled in 24 hours, and I thought it might last only a few days, and I went to Lewis and I told him if he could get some teams, he could make some money out of it, and I was going away the next morning, and I spoke to him about the contract, and said he knew nothing about it, but if I would go into it, take no interest but to oversee the men and push matters, he would give me half interest in the contract, and I acceded to that, but when I went home and found out that I had committed myself\u2014Bedson told me that the General's orders were that I must give up my position as Transport Officer or the contract, and I immediately gave it up, and watched my business as Transport Officer; in the meantime, the firm was Bell, Lewis, Yates & Co., or something that way. In the meantime, when I met Stewart I tried to compromise the thing, so that the thing could be carried on down here, and I offered to give him half my interest for half of his interest in the other contract here, and he shipped a great deal after I saw him. I went and saw Lewis and told him I would have nothing to do with it, and saw Laurie, who heard the contract was being carried on in Bell, Lewis, Yates & Co., and I told him I had nothing to do with it; there was a great deal of freight left there, and it had to be moved at once; there were some 500 or 600 tons there; I went to Moosejaw, and saw Laurie, and told him Stewart was out of it, and told him Lewis did not want the contract at Moosejaw, and said, I will make a contract very much below Stewart's prices; and knowing at this time there was a doubt about the contract Laurie had made, I did not think it would be recognized here, and I told him I could make a contract for $80 or $85 with Ross & Riddell, with better men than Stewart, as I knew he had not a single dollar when he started the work, that we could not give the contract to him at Swift Current as he was losing at Moosejaw, and he agreed to that, and I made a contract with him, say-\ning in all about $20,000 on that contract. But, in the meantime, the Northcote had gone down the river, and that stuff had to be pushed up; I went down to Troy, and General Laurie and I got a contract up, that Ross was to take that; but when I got back, Laurie wired me, in the face of his agreement to accept Ross & Riddell's tender, which he dictated the greater part to me, that he was going to make Stewart stick to his contract. Every contract that I made was to end in 24 hours' notice. When I found that out, he wrote to me that Stewart was going ahead with that contract, and he strongly advised me to give him the Swift Current contract, and said he had offered to do it for $130, the Government supplying everything, and knew he could not carry it out, and that there would be trouble, and I was bound I would not give it to him; and I sent up a clerk that we had there, Jones, and told him that if we could not get contractors, we could run the thing ourselves cheaper to the Government.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\u2014General Laurie wires you have not answered his telegram about contract with Stewart, about freight between Saskatchewan Landing and Battleford. Please arrange for the present until tenders are allotted.\n\nQ. What did Jones do?\n\nA. When he went up, he started by the hundred, at three fifty a hundred; there was no contract, and he was to hire the teams on the best terms that he could hire them. He went up and in three or four days, he made a contract with Thomas Howard, and I immediately wrote him to come back, that Howard had the contract. I have never acted in any of these matters without orders from Col. Whitehead or Bedson, and there's a telegram that I received to bind contractors to carry it out until somebody got at it, and I objected to Stewart doing it, and I thought I was doing my duty when I was trying to save $25,000 to the Government in the Moosejaw contract, and General Laurie would not allow it. The contract with Stewart could be cancelled in ten days, and at the same time Stewart agreed with me that he would throw up that contract, and he was to receive no consideration, except that he was to get the Swift Current contract, which I thought was much fairer at $150 than the other at $110, especially as I could let the Moosejaw contract at $80, if I remember right. I will find out and let you know. But I know there was a large amount of money saved there, and I pointed it out to General Laurie, and he quite agreed with me, and the moment I got home I found the whole thing was broken; I think it turned upon a matter of authority, and he thought he was doing the right thing, and I immediately telegraphed to you, and I also told General Middleton, and I tell you now, as I will tell you under oath, that I had no interest in the contract. I lent Stewart money, and I had to lend him money to buy a suit of clothes, and money to pay his board, and to get him out of town, and he hasn't returned it yet. I thought at first that he was a man of money, and at the first I thought it was a straight bargain that I was to have a half interest if I advanced the money, but I found out that he was such a scoundrel, and I withdrew, and I did not think there was anything dishonest about it, and I claim so today, as I thought I was cutting the whole thing down to half the price.\n\nQ. When you and Stewart were talking about this contract, there was some proposition that there were to be some shares?\n\nA. No, the understanding was that he was to have a quarter interest in my contract.\n\nQ. It was stated there were to be five shares, and yourself, Stewart and two others were named, the fifth was not named, and we want to know whether that fifth was to be retained for any other individual?\n\nA. I know what you mean, but I would rather answer the direct question, but Col. Whitehead had no interest; I never saw him to that moment in my life; the arrangement was that I had a half interest with Lewis, and I wanted to barter my half interest with a half interest with Stewart. There is the agreement, which I want to keep, which is to show that I was to have half interest with Stewart, and I was to divide my half interest with Stewart in the Bell Lewis contract, but as far as Col. Whitehead goes, I regret very much that the thing has ever come up, but John Stewart or any other person has no reason to state that I ever stated that Col. Whitehead had any interest in that contract. He has done so to blackmail me, and I don't know why, unless it is because I advanced him money to start in. I lifted him out of the ditch. In starting the thing I told him that Lewis was a man from Montreal, and he would be able to finance better than we could,\nknowing Col. Whitehead, and help us to get our settlements better than either he or I could, but, on my word as a man, that is the only thing I ever told him, and I don't know how in the world he could have taken anything other than what I meant by that.\n\nCol. Whitehead here read telegrams of 21st of May from his book.\n\nWitness:\u2014I think the contracts I have made should be brought up as I made them, all subject to your order to be cancelled in twenty-four hours, and I thought I had secured myself and the Government when I made the contract with Bell, Lewis and Yates; I could not find anybody to take it.\n\nQ. Could you not have got the middlemen?\n\nA. I had no authority in the first place to do it, and I could not do it; I understood at that time that there were to be no middlemen, as the cry was at that time about the contractors in the middle taking the contracts and making so much out of them; we could not depend upon teamsters; we could not trust any teamsters on the road. I think it was just before the 21st of May, that I refused to obey your (Col. Whitehead's) orders at all; I thought you would understand that I could not obey your orders, and take one order from you, and another from somebody else to the contrary; I think the first time I ever met Col. Whitehead was on the night of the 21st; I saw him in the club for a few moments; I was introduced by somebody, and I came down to see him what this meant.\n\nQ. Was there any arrangement between you and Col. Whitehead?\n\nA. Not the slightest, except to facilitate the thing; we went and saw Mr. Wrigley; I knew there was money being wasted, and Col. Whitehead and I went to see him; I think on the morning of the 23rd.\n\nQ. Did you understand that it was to be carried out\u2014the contract was to be carried out\u2014by weight, providing the Bell Farm teams were kept on at $10 a day?\n\nA. Not at all; the first teams that came in afterwards were dismissed immediately and reduced to $4.50 a day. Nearly all the teams were dismissed in May, but there were some of our teamsters with the General to the very last, and these are our accounts today for $5 a day.\n\nCol. Jackson:\u2014I wish to have it cleared up, as it is suggested.\n\nA. Not at all, as far as I am concerned I am sorry that my name should have been mixed up in saying that Col. Whitehead was in any way interested in the contract, and it has not emanated from me; I believe there was a question about our hay.\n\nCol. Forrest:\u2014You say distinctly for June and July they were charged at $5?\n\nA. No, I don't say that, but I say our teams that were with General Middleton were charged at $10 a day until they came back; I could not dismiss them when they were at Prince Albert; I dismissed the teams as fast as they came in and they were sent home. It was impossible for me to hire teams and not middlemen; the teamsters were not responsible men, and I had to make my contracts with others; the first intimation I got about the teams being dismissed was the telegram that I got from Col. Whitehead. General Laurie dismissed them at Swift Current, and in consequence of that I telegraphed my resignation to General Middleton.\n\nQ. It is said that the Bell Farming Co., of which you are manager, had the contract to deliver hay?\n\nA. We had, with the Hudson Bay, nearly nine hundred tons altogether; the price was 20 dollars loose hay and 22 dollars wired.\n\nQ. How much did you deliver?\n\nA. We delivered between eight hundred and nine hundred tons, I don't know exactly.\n\nQ. Do you know the date of your last delivery?\n\nA. I think the last lot was in May or the fore part of June; It was a very small lot, just delivered around Troy to keep the teams coming back.\n\nQ. It is reported there was a large lot of hay along the line in excess of what was required; I suppose you received that in telegrams from Captain Hudson?\n\nA. No, I did not; the cry all the time was that they were short of forage. I never received a telegram from Hudson in my life.\n\nQ. It has been reported that a great deal of that hay was in bad condition when shipped?\nA. Yes, there was a great deal of it.\n\nQ. How did it come to be so bad?\n\nA. They say it was all right when it was shipped from here, and I went to Captain Swinford, and told him that I was not going to ship any more like that. Ours was shipped from Qu'Appelle, and I can get you a certificate from Archie McDonald to show that our hay was the best that was shipped.\n\nQ. Wasn't he a contractor?\n\nA. He was a contractor, I suppose, as a Chief Factor of the Hudson Bay Co. He made nothing because he was not interested in it, as far as I know. The contract was made before I had anything to do with the transport; my accounts have all gone into the office here to be settled; I cannot say that he was making any profit on it, but I know that we got just what we agreed to get, and he has never got a dollar from me, and never will get a cent from me; my accounts have gone into the Hudson Bay Co. and this contract was made before I went into the transport service. We had a large quantity of hay there to sell, and of course we were willing to sell it, and I can prove that it was the best hay that was sold to the Government through the whole engagement, and that the teams that I engaged were the best. It cost us $7 to have it pressed, double-wired.\n\nQ. There seemed to be great desire at Qu'Appelle to forward this hay to the front\u2014why was that?\n\nA. That has nothing to do with me; I never shipped a bit of hay; our hay went up the first part of the season; it came from Winnipeg.\n\nQ. You sent up a lot of hay that was damaged?\n\nA. Not from our farm; it was spoilt in transit; it was all burning when it got to Troy; it was bound up wet, and I went to Captain Swinford, and called a commission, and said I would not ship any more like that, and General Laurie had it examined, and he found that the only good hay that was delivered was our hay, not because I was any more honest than any of the rest, but because it did not have to come so far; we broke open some of the cars of hay, and found it was wet-packed, and almost on fire.\n\nCol. Jackson:\u2014Who ordered the opening of the cars, when it was found that that hay was so bad?\n\nA. Our clerks did the most of it; we shipped whatever Captain Swinford wanted shipped. Captain Swinford would tell the clerks what to ship, and they would ship it. When I got there was the first day that they employed oxen, and instead of taking 600, we took the full ton, and I placed these oxen between different stations to take the full ton and McKnight telegraphed me that the first lot that got there was no good, and it was then that I referred the matter to Captain Swinford, and that was the first I knew of any bad hay being sent; baled hay looks perfectly right and straight on the outside, but you break it open, and you will find it is perfectly rotten inside; I have given you exactly the facts, just as I have reported them to General Middleton, and I think, comparing my statement of today with that which I gave General Middleton, you will find that I have given you the fair straight story, and it will compare very fairly. I have worked as faithfully as any man could, and I studied that Transport Service the same as if I was paying the bills myself, and I would not allow the teamsters to go on without their horses being shod, and not charged to the Government; I insisted on them paying for it themselves; I worked as faithfully and economically as possible for the Government, and I would not offer a teamster a dollar a day less than I offered those men, and I don't think the prices paid were high, for you must remember the expense of transit from the time they leave here until they get there takes a great deal of their profit.\n\nQ. Don't you think the high prices paid them influenced the prices of other teams all throughout the country?\n\nA. Not at all. You cannot hire a team in our country for less than $6 a day; you must remember when they were hired the seeding season was just open, and it is a loss that we lose the whole year, and I would not take $50 a day for our teams at that season of the year, and I would not let our teams go next year at the same rate, for the valuable part of our year is the middle of May, and I told Mr. Wrigley that I would not let them go for that figure, and when he asked me to state my figure I told him I was going to charge $14 a day; we were paying our men $75 a month and our foremen $10 extra; we did not make such a sum out of it after all.\nCol. Forrest:\u2014They state in that little contract at Qu'Appelle, there was a little ring that was interested, one in passing it, and one buying it, and it was very bad hay?\n\nA. I deny any man to prove it; I sent a man through the country buying hay, and he paid as high as $14, and I cleared $400 on the eighty tons that I sold, and I will give you my word of honor as a man that there was no man made anything out of any contract that I had anything to do with, except the contract of our Company; that hay was shipped from the 18th of May to the last of May, and it was nearly all shipped except these last few tons; it was fresh baled, and within a day after it was baled, it was shipped on.\n\nQ. It was said that the large stock that remained was very bad?\n\nA. No, it was not. I went there to bid on my own hay, and I would have given $10 a ton for it, because I could have sold it to the Police, and a friend of mine came up and said: I think you had better not buy it, and I withdrew; and I could have cleared more out of that hundred tons than I did on the whole contract, for it was good hay, and was sold for $2.50 a ton; not one of our bales was ever opened at the Fort, and not one of our bales found rotten; there were six hundred bales came up one day that was all destroyed; I inspected it when it came there, and I refused to carry it any further, but it was paid for then, being sent from here.\n\nCol. Jackson:\u2014What quality of hay did you have cut on your farm in the spring?\n\nA. We had about 500 or 600 tons; we never mowed a ton; everything was stacked there from the year before; the whole country was burned over in the spring, and we never mowed a single ton.\n\nQ. You had some places on your Farm where the hay was standing up, through the ice, and you ran your mower over it, and stacked it up and sold it?\n\nA. No, we did not, not a single ton.\n\nQ. Of course that hay would be very apt to get rotten?\n\nA. Of course it would; as a rule I think we got the usual run of hay; there was some very poor, and some very good; we must admit it that there was a lot of waste hay there, and everything else; I had two clerks to look after it night and day, and I did my best, and I thought I was going to get a little credit for it, rather than be blackguarded as I have been; but things go contrary sometimes; I have given you the straight facts, and I am willing to swear to them if they are correctly reported.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nW. R. Bell, sworn. November 17th, 1885.\n\nCol. Jackson:\u2014\n\nQ. What relations do you bear towards the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company?\n\nA. I am Manager of that Company.\n\nQ. What position did you occupy during the Rebellion in connection with the North West Field Force?\n\nA. I was under Brigade Field Orders, as Transport Officer at the Base.\n\nMr. Anderson:\u2014\n\nQ. Are you a stockholder as well as manager of the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company?\n\nA. I am.\n\nQ. You were Transport Officer at Qu'Appelle during the late Rebellion?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. What were your duties?\n\nA. To forward all supplies I received from the Supply Officer.\n\nQ. As cheaply as possible?\n\nA. No, not exactly, but to get them there.\n\nQ. You were there to look after the interests of the Government?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. You hired a number of teams through agents west of Winnipeg, during the Rebellion?\n\nA. Yes.\nQ. Name the first point at which teams were hired.\nA. Brandon; I had no agent there, but wired different parties who had teams.\n\nQ. Do you know a person called McGregor at Brandon?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. He hired a number of teams, did he?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. What was the price paid at Brandon?\nA. $8.00 per day, same as all others I engaged.\n\nQ. Is that what the Government was charged?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. How were these men paid for their trouble for hiring the teams?\nA. They were not to hire them under $7.00 per day. I never made a contract with them, except by telegram, stating that the Government was paying $8.00 per day. We had very great difficulty with our teams, on account of them receiving so many different rates of pay. The $5.00 teams refused to take the same loads that the $10 a day teams take. I cautioned them (the parties furnishing the teams) that I would not allow them for the trouble, but would pay them $8.00 per day.\n\nQ. How many teams did McGregor hire?\nA. I don't know the number, I think about one hundred.\n\nQ. In hiring these teams, did you take it upon yourself without sending out a requisition?\nA. No, I had orders from Capt. Bedson and from Mr. Wrigley. I never hired a team without direct orders. I had no power to issue a requisition.\n\nQ. Where was the next point you hired teams?\nA. All the way from Brandon to Moosejaw. When we were short of teams, I had to telegraph all over the country.\n\nQ. What were the prices paid?\nA. $7 to $8 per day for horses, and $5 to $6 for oxen.\n\nQ. Did the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co. get a contract for hay?\nA. Yes, they made a contract.\n\nQ. Was it packed hay?\nA. Both baled and loose hay.\n\nQ. What was the price for baled hay?\nA. $22 per ton, delivered at Indian Head or Qu'Appelle.\n\nQ. What did you get for the loose hay?\nA. $20 per ton at Qu'Appelle and Troy.\n\nQ. Who made the contract with you?\nA. Arch. McDonald, Chief Factor of H. B. Co. at Fort Qu'Appelle.\n\nQ. He made the contract with you as the Manager of the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. How many tons was the contract for the baled hay?\nA. Five hundred tons.\n\nQ. How many tons did you deliver?\nA. I can't say exactly, but think about 800 tons.\n\nQ. You must have been paid for it?\nA. No, not in full.\n\nQ. Sent in your bills?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. How much loose hay did you deliver?\nA. One hundred and ninety tons.\n\nQ. What price did you pay for it?\nA. We paid from $12 to $15 per ton.\n\nQ. You were a Government officer when you took that contract?\nA. The first contract was made before I had anything to do with the Government.\n\nQ. Who bought that hay at Qu'Appelle station?\nA. I did.\nQ. Was it measured or weighed?\nA. It was measured, at five hundred cubic feet to the ton.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. How did you arrive at this conclusion?\nA. We supposed 343 cubic feet of hay in stack is a ton, but we allow 500 cubic feet to a ton, as it was measured on the waggon.\n\nMr. Anderson:\nQ. Who was this hay delivered to, the Government?\nA. To the Transport Officers and Supply Officers.\n\nQ. Who checked the quantity of hay that came in to Qu'Appelle station?\nA. It was generally Mr. Jones, in my office, on the part of the Transport; and Mr. Swinford, or his clerks, on part of Supply Department.\n\nQ. One of these clerks was your own book-keeper?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Did you supply any oats to the Government?\nA. No, not one bushel, I had 10,000 for sale, and couldn't sell them.\n\nQ. Your blacksmith was also working for the Government?\nA. I had dismissed him from the Farm, and he engaged with the Government afterwards.\n\nQ. When did you first meet Col. Whitehead?\nA. I can't really state the date, but I think it was the fore part of June.\n\nQ. You saw him before the contract was let to Bell, Lewis & Co., did you not?\nA. I think I did.\n\nQ. You know the date of that contract?\nA. No, I don't, without referring to it.\n\nQ. Did you meet Col. Whitehead in Winnipeg?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Have you any idea of when you did come down?\nA. I can't tell exactly, but was here some time during May and June.\n\nQ. Were you here on the 18th of May?\nA. I cannot say exactly, I may have been.\n\nQ. Were you here on the 19th?\nA. I cannot say.\n\nQ. Were you here on the 20th?\nA. I can't say, but I never remained here more than a day at any rate.\n\nQ. Would you be astonished to find that you were here on the 18th, 19th, and 20th?\nA. Yes, I would be.\n\nQ. How could you be here if you signed that contract with Mr. Lewis at Qu'Appelle?\nA. I don't know; I could not be.\n\nQ. Did you not see Mr. Lewis at Qu'Appelle before this contract was let to you? On what day?\nA. After the first of May he was there.\n\nQ. How many days would that be before the contract was let?\nA. I don't know; I had a great deal of business with Mr. Lewis before contracts or anything ever came up?\n\nQ. Between the first of May and the 22nd?\nA. It might have been, he was at the Farm two nights; he drove to Qu'Appelle with me and came back at night.\n\nQ. Was he there for the purpose of finding out the distances and the condition of the trails?\nA. No, he had no idea of finding out this; he was there examining the Farm, as he was then negotiating for a large amount of the stock.\n\nQ. You came down to Winnipeg on the 18th?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. You were here on the 19th and then went back to Qu'Appelle and Lewis got the contract.\nA. Yes; I never stayed here more than one day.\n\nQ. Who gave J. L. Lewis the information in regard to the distances and the state of the roads, to take this contract on?\n\nA. I gave all the information I could to get him into it.\n\nQ. You went to Mr. Lewis with the intention of trying to induce him to take the contract?\n\nA. I had orders to make a contract with any responsible man; we didn't want anything delayed, or have any trouble about capital.\n\nQ. What is the distance from Qu'Appelle Station to Clarke's Crossing?\n\nA. I think about 215 miles.\n\nQ. How many days does it take a team to take a load and come back empty?\n\nA. Eighteen to twenty-one days.\n\nQ. When were the teams reduced to $4.50 per day?\n\nA. They were never reduced but dismissed, and contractors re-engaged at different prices.\n\nQ. Those who wished to work on had to do so at the $4.50?\n\nA. I had orders to dismiss them; they were not forced to remain on.\n\nQ. And these were really hired by J. L. Lewis at $4.50?\n\nA. Some at $4.50 and some at $5.\n\nQ. The general price was $4.50?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Who hired the teams at $4.50?\n\nA. I hired some of them.\n\nQ. Were you acting as an agent for Lewis?\n\nA. I was one of the firm; I was in with him, on the start.\n\nQ. So you had an inducement to go in with him?\n\nA. When I made this contract with Mr. Lewis, I had very great trouble to get him to go into it. I knew that every day that we let the thing run on it would cost the Government an enormous sum, and I would be saving thousands of dollars by closing the contract at once. I asked Lewis, as a friend of mine and a strong man financially; and was anxious, to make a contract with him. He said he would not go into it unless I took an interest with him. We figured the thing up, and I said if he could get the figures, I would go into it with him, if Col. Whitehead would accept our terms. I made the contract, and referred it to Col. Whitehead. Between the time I spoke to him and when I made the contract, I hadn't seen Col. Whitehead. This was late in the evening. I don't know the date exactly. I submitted the contract to Whitehead for his acceptance. It was subject to being cancelled within twenty-four hours. When this was accepted, all I had to do as Transport Officer was to dismiss all teams under my control that were not at the front, as fast as they returned to the base, not to interfere with Middleton's camp; and, as I had explained to the Minister at Ottawa, through Mr. Wrigley, I promised to get the teams in as quickly as possible. I notified Captain Bedson that I had taken a contract. He spoke to the General (Middleton), and he objected to me having anything to do with it. That I would either have to resign one position or the other. It was then about the first of June. I concluded to give up the contract, and I notified Lewis that I would have nothing to do with the contract, that it was against the General's orders, and that he would have to run the contract himself.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. What date was that?\n\nA. The fore part of June, perhaps the 4th, when the first convoy was sent out. It must have been between the 4th and 9th. I told Captain Swinford and Lieut.-Col. Forest that I was a contractor, and considered it perfectly legitimate, and when the General objected to it, I gave it up, and have had no interest in it since, directly or indirectly. I never got a dollar out of it, nor put one in.\n\nMr. Anderson:\n\nQ. At the time of taking this contract with Lewis, did you advise Col. Whitehead that you were in with Lewis on that contract?\n\nA. I told him afterwards.\nQ. When did you tell him?\nA. I don't know the exact date.\nQ. So he was aware before Lewis was paid, that you were in that when it was first let?\nA. I can't tell\u2014I must have told him.\nQ. What was the price of that contract?\nA. $140 per ton.\nQ. Your contract was let to Bell & Lewis at $140 per ton?\nA. Yes.\nQ. When you were a Government officer?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Was it not your duty to advise Col. Whitehead that you were a Government officer, and that you had an interest in it?\nA. I had no interest in it, only for a few days, when nothing was done.\nQ. Are you aware of a contract made between Gen. Laurie and John Stewart?\nA. Yes, Stewart told me; and I saw a copy of the contract shown me by Gen. Laurie, Moosejaw.\nQ. Where was that from?\nA. From Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing; there was none from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing. Laurie showed me the contract from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing.\nQ. Didn't that cover some other trails?\nA. No.\nQ. In the contract let to John L. Lewis, what was considered a load for teams getting $1.50 per day?\nA. I don't know anything about it. Swinford's men loaded the waggons, and the contractors' agents started them off. I only kept the time of teams as they came in, and dismissed them, and saw that they had been paid, and that the thing was properly done. The moment a contract was let, the Transport Officer was powerless.\nQ. What number of days did Bell, Lewis & Co.'s teams take to do the round trip from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing?\nA. Our teams were understood to make it in eighteen to twenty-one days.\nQ. I think you said that these were hired for a certain sum?\nA. Yes, $1.50 per day.\nQ. At what date did you tell Gen. Middleton that you were in this thing?\nA. I don't know the date, but it was in Regina during Riel's trial; I told him the whole thing exactly as it was in a full report.\nQ. Do you know were there any shipping bills at Moosejaw, in the name of Bell & Lewis, given to John Stewart's teams?\nA. When I went to Troy, Stewart told me he had a contract from Laurie on the Moosejaw trail, and offered me a half interest if I would advance money to pay the teams; I agreed, and told him he had better allow the one concern to run the whole thing. I offered him half of my interest in the Qu'Appelle trail, telling him that I had a half interest in that. Providing he would give me a half interest in his contract, I would give him half of my interest in Bell & Lewis's contract. He accepted this, and shipped the goods himself in the name of Bell & Lewis. I sent a man to look after it and requisitioned Captain Swinford to send a man to direct the loading and check it off. It was Mr. Jones whom I sent up.\nQ. Did he take up those books with Bell, Lewis & Co's bill-heads in?\nA. No, it was the regular transport books\u2014we had no others.\nQ. Do you know who filled in those headings?\nA. We never had them in our office. It was Captain Swinford, or his clerks, I suppose.\nQ. Then you arranged with Stewart to share part of his contract\u2014Did you look upon it as a secret arrangement?\nA. No, I didn't. I was then an open contractor, and made a written agreement with Stewart, who afterwards determined to refuse these terms.\nQ. Is this letter yours? (Reading Exhibit \"B\")\nA. Yes, it sounds very much like my composition.\n\nQ. What did you mean by stating that you had \"laid a foundation of a good thing?\"\n\nA. Stewart promised me to withdraw, and left for the Elbow. I then made a contract with Ross from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing for $90 per ton as Transport Officer. Laurie had orders to forward all supplies from Swift Current to Battleford. I spoke to him about giving the contract to Stewart in lieu of the one he had given up, providing his price was right. I wrote to Stewart the letter produced telling him to give up the Moose Jaw contract, that I had let it to Ross\u2014saving the Government about $30,000 on the contract. I went to Laurie and made arrangements with him. Ross agreed to the contract. When Stewart returned from the Elbow, he positively refused to agree to this, and went on with the original contract with Laurie. I notified him that I would have nothing to do with it. Laurie then wanted to give him the contract for Swift Current as well, and I objected to it, for two reasons; the first was, that he opposed me in giving that contract to Ross thereby costing the Government the above large sum; second, that he hadn't money to carry it out, and his price was too high.\n\nQ. How did you satisfy Ross about the contract?\n\nA. I went to Ross with General Laurie, and asked him the lowest price he would take. He asked $100, and I beat him down to $90.\n\nQ. What consideration was Stewart receiving?\n\nA. The consideration of another contract. Stewart worked with me because he knew he had no money, and accepted money from me. When Stewart came back, General Laurie, rather than have his authority put aside, insisted on Stewart carrying out the contract he made.\n\nQ. What number of contracts were entered into to convey freight from Moose Jaw to Clarke's Crossing?\n\nA. I think only one, the contracts in the Brigade Office will show for themselves.\n\nQ. Is Captain Howard a stock-holder in the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company?\n\nA. Yes, he is a small stock-holder, a director and Vice-President of the Company.\n\nQ. Was Captain Howard at your house on business regarding the contract to Swift Current?\n\nA. No, never. Howard used to speak to me about teams, as he had a contract up there. His teams were at Swift Current, where I had no power to control them.\n\nQ. Can you give the date when Howard informed you that he had a contract from Saskatchewan to Battleford?\n\nA. No,\n\nQ. Did you send Mr. Jones, one of your clerks, to Saskatchewan Landing?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Did Jones issue bills in the name of Bell, Lewis & Co. at Saskatchewan Landing?\n\nA. No, he issued the first lot in his own name, as he did not know in whose name to do it. I did not know the cost of the different articles. The men had regular rations, the horses so many pounds per day; at first, 45 pounds, afterwards I reduced it to 37 pounds.\n\nQ. You estimate it will take eighteen days; what would the cost of rations be for that period?\n\nA. They drew eighteen days' rations, and carried it with them; I did not estimate the cost.\n\nQ. Howard's contract was $125 per ton from Swift Current, or Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford; he took no other contract?\n\nA. I don't know.\n\nQ. Do you know the number of days it takes for the round trip from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford?\n\nA. It used to take our own teams twenty-four days.\n\nQ. Do you know what teams could have been got for at that time?\n\nA. I don't know.\n\nQ. Did you ever make an estimate of what it actually cost the Government a ton?\n\nA. I didn't\u2014it would be purely guess work, as far as my knowledge went, but I think fifty per cent, was saved in making any of the contracts.\n\nQ. Do you remember telegraphing John Wood, who was in charge of Lewis' teams, to re-load at Humboldt and take a heavy load to Clark's Crossing?\nA. I might have telegraphed him to load one time when we took some stuff from Toronto, which was left at Humboldt, and, rather than have the teams come back from there, I told him to load up there. We wanted the convoy to keep together.\n\nQ. The bills on which the contract is paid will explain this. It was signed at Troy by Captain Swinford, and receipted for by the Supply Officer at its destination.\n\nQ. What was John Wood receiving per day?\n\nA. He was hired by the Government as Superintendent from Troy to Touchwood, at $5 per day. When the contracts were let, Wood was discharged and entered the service of Bell, Lewis & Co.\n\nQ. What time was Wood paid off?\n\nA. I don't know the time exactly, but the pay sheets will show it; but he didn't get one dollar that he hadn't earned.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\n\nQ. Will you state whether, directly or indirectly, I had a conversation with you, or you with me, in reference to any share or interest I had with Bell, Lewis & Co., Thomas Howard, or any one else?\n\nA. I state, most emphatically, no.\n\nW. R. Bell's evidence continued.\n\nNovember 18th, 1885.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. What date did you assume the duties of a Transport Officer?\n\nA. It was the 5th or 6th of April.\n\nQ. What was the date of the contract of 500 tons of hay with the H. B. Co.\n\nA. It was the day before. I got my appointment from Bedson, and coming after looking over the roads, I made the arrangements about the hay.\n\nQ. What was the date of the second contract?\n\nA. I have forgotten it, but it wasn't a contract other than a telegram, which I received from Mr. Clark, of the H. B. Co., asking me if our Company could supply them with 28 cars of hay, and at what price. I wired him the price, and he accepted, as it was much the lowest offer he had.\n\nQ. Can you produce the telegram or the contract?\n\nA. No, it is in town here, in the Hudson Bay Company's office.\n\nQ. What did you receive for consideration, in giving up your interest in the Bell, Lewis & Co. contract?\n\nA. Not a dollar.\n\nQ. What money did you receive, in the way of cheques, from the firms of Bell & Lewis, and Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh?\n\nA. I have had a great deal of business with Mr. Lewis during the last three months in a private way, and he held some $3,000 of my money which I sent from home to him, as my agent to make a payment on some stock I had purchased from one John Northwood.\n\nQ. Was this paid back in more than one check?\n\nA. Northwood, after I had bought the stock, sold it to Mr. Boyle, and Lewis did not have to pay this money; he therefore paid it back to me as I required it\u2014$2500 from Troy, and I gave him $500 more, which was $3000 altogether; and he paid back, July 10th, $1,000; July 28th, $585; Sept. 9th, $1,000. That is all I deposited in the Bank, but I have got from him several small sums since, and he still owes me about $200.00.\n\nQ. Did you ever receive a cheque for between $20,000 and $30,000 from him at once?\n\nA. No, I never saw such a thing; that is the only money I ever received from Mr. Lewis in any way. This money was my own, and only returned to me.\n\nQ. Did you order or recall Ross and Riddell's teams, after they had started to bring down the 7th?\n\nA. I got a telegram from Gen. Middleton, to send teams to bring down the 7th from Clarke's Crossing to Moosejaw. I wired to Laurie asking if he could send teams from Moosejaw, and I got no answer that afternoon, nor the next day. I telegraphed again,\nhaving heard that Laurie had gone East, to the officer commanding at Moosejaw. I could get no answer; I then got our own teams, sending to the Farm for them. My orders were to send the teams, but only pay $5 per day. Our teams made Qu'Appelle that night at ten o'clock, and started next morning, but I could not stop them till they reached Touchwood, which I did. The next morning I received a telegram that the teams at Moosejaw were ready to go, and I wired to stop them. I got another telegram saying the teams had started, and I then wired to let them go, and I would recall the teams sent from Qu'Appelle. I then telegraphed to Touchwood, and Col. Dennison's Brigade, coming down, came with those teams.\n\nQ. Do you know the date your teams started?\nA. No, I have forgotten, but it was the day after Gen. Laurie went east. Sinclair had a lot of teams arrived from Battleford, and he undertook to bring these down.\n\nQ. Why did you recall these teams? (Moosejaw Convoy.)\nA. Because I had sent sufficient from Troy.\n\nQ. Did you order them to proceed on the same or on the following day?\nA. I will have to quote from those telegrams, the first mistake was made by not getting an answer from Laurie. We could not stop them between Moosejaw and Touchwood.\n\nQ. These teams were paid, I suppose?\nA. No, they are not.\n\nQ. Were they not included in the account and charged for?\nA. Yes. Of the twenty-five teams, eight of them went to Humboldt, on Gen. Middleton's orders, to bring down Major Jarvis' Battery; they missed each other on the trail.\n\nQ. It has been reported that your teams took the regular trail.\nA. Yes. Major Jarvis took the south trail, or wrong trail.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nW. L. Boyle's evidence. Nov. 18th, 1885.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\n\nQ. You know John Stewart?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Would you kindly tell the Commission what you know of the contract he had from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing.\nA. I had simply an interest in financing him through. The firm had interests represented by him.\n\nQ. After the completion of the contract, when he returned to Winnipeg for a settlement, and I produced correspondence from Ottawa from Boulbee to the Minister, in reference to charges Stewart made against me, personally, did I run after him asking him to give letters contradicting these charges?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Did Col. Whitehead ever say that his position in the force was dependent upon that letter of contradiction?\nA. No. It was entirely independent of any accusations.\n\nQ. Did Stewart state to you that he was most anxious to sign such letters?\nA. Certainly, he did sign them.\n\nQ. You wrote to Boulbee on Stewart's account for copies of correspondence.\nA. I did not write myself, but I was informed by Stewart he got an answer.\n\nQ. Do you know if he got an answer?\nA. I don't know, he telegraphed once.\n\nQ. In your opinion you consider that Stewart rather ran after me than I after him, in reference to this matter.\nA. Yes, I did run after you myself on Stewart's behalf. I was interested in getting Stewart's claims settled.\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. Do you know of any person who intimated to any officer of the staff that a consideration would be given in certain claims, providing that they were pushed through.\n\nA. I never heard of such a thing mooted by any person.\n\nQ. Have you any knowledge of a contract of freighting by Bell, Lewis & Co.\n\nA. Yes, I have seen it.\n\nQ. Is that all you know about it?\n\nA. I have seen the contract, and know some of its details.\n\nQ. Who was the Bell connected with it?\n\nA. I have been informed that it was the Bell of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh, That is all I can tell you. I can only form an opinion. If I were asked if it were Bell of the Bell Farm or of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh, I have my own doubts about it:\n\nQ. Do you believe that W. R. Bell was a partner in that contract.\n\nA. I am certain that he was at one time.\n\nQ. Do you know if he received any consideration for retiring from the firm?\n\nA. No, I believe not. As far as I know, he has never received a dollar.\n\nQ. Do you know that he would receive anything as a portion of the profits.\n\nA. No, I know that he has not received any of the profits of Stewart's contract. The money has been paid to me, and I know what has been done with it.\n\nQ. Do you think that Stewart was in league with the Contractors to keep up prices and defraud the Government?\n\nA. No, I don't think that he was. He was anxious to get all he could for his work.\n\nI never heard of collusion.\n\nQ. I believe that you are a stockholder in the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co.?\n\nA. I am.\n\nQ. Has Bell been acting in any capacity for the Company?\n\nA. Yes, as manager.\n\nQ. Did he enter into contracts on behalf of the firm?\n\nA. Yes, with the consent of the directors and their authority.\n\nQ. Do you know what quantity of hay the Company agreed to deliver to the H. B. Co.\n\nA. Yes, that we would sell five hundred tons, but we did not deliver that amount.\n\nQ. Do you know the quantity that you did deliver?\n\nA. No, not from memory. I think it was about three hundred tons; I am not sure.\n\nQ. You think it was over three hundred, but not quite sure?\n\nA. It might be between two hundred and fifty and three hundred. I think it was under three hundred.\n\nQ. Was Bell's salary continued while he was in the employ of the Government?\n\nA. Yes; he asked the consent of the directors to be allowed to accept the position in the Government. Of course it has to be settled whether he will get a salary or not. It is to come before the shareholders.\n\nQ. You have a good idea how that will go then?\n\nA. I am opposed to giving him a salary.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nWM. S. Beecher, Cashier H. B. Co. November 19, 1885.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. I think you were employed by the H. B. Co., at Qu'Appelle?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Did you make out payments on account of hay furnished at Qu'Appelle?\n\nA. Yes, I did.\n\nQ. Who were the parties you paid?\n\nA. Major Bell, principally; I think there were a few other little accounts paid to contractors for the mail, and Scott, and Leeson, and some others.\n\nQ. Was their contract furnished on account of the Government?\n\nA. Yes.\nQ. What was their price?\nA. They had a round sum for delivering along the line, either at Qu'Appelle, Humboldt, Touchwood, and different points along the line.\n\nQ. You said you paid Major Bell\u2014was the payment made in his name?\nA. Everything was paid by check, and nearly all to the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co., and cashed immediately at the Merchants Bank; they were made by our agent, Mr. Crawford.\n\nQ. Some payments were made then direct to himself?\nA. Yes; I fancy they were made direct to Major Bell, because I understood he had some hay selling on his own account. Of course Mr. Crawford made the payments\u2014he was our agent out there.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about a contract between the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co. and the H. B. Co.?\nA. Yes; it was merely a verbal affair. Bell made the agreement with Arch. McDonald to supply 500 tons of hay; it was merely an understanding between him and McDonald.\n\nQ. Was it on his own behalf?\nA. I could not say.\n\nQ. What quantity of hay was delivered on that contract?\nA. The five hundred-hundred tons was delivered; and we got an account for an amount in excess of that, and the thing was referred to McDonald, but he didn't know of anything further, and that account we never paid.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about the price of that hay?\nA. I think it was $20 and $22, and then there was some double-baled hay, which was raised in price $2 per ton; I forget whether it was raised from $20 to $22, or from $22 to $24. I understood that portion of the hay was furnished by Major Bell, personally.\n\nCol. Forrest:\nQ. Was there not a mistake about the quantity of hay still due. I understood from Beeson and Major Bell that there was $500 due him on that contract?\nA. He claims that this was on account, I don't remember the number of tons, but he claimed that it was on account of the $500 contract. We wrote to McDonald, and he wrote back saying that this contract had been discharged, and that there was nothing due on it. This further claim was over and above that, and we could not do anything with it.\n\nNovember 24, 1885.\n\nW. S. Beecher's evidence continued.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. Of course you are still under oath, Mr. Beecher?\nA. Yes. I have the cheques showing that they are made payable to Mr. Bell.\n\nCol. Forrest:\nQ. They are indorsed by Eberts and by Bell.\nA. No; the two I refer to are for the payments made in this list of mine. They are endorsed and placed to Bell's credit in the bank.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. You were to give us some information in regard to the payments made to Bell?\nA. This is the information:\u2014The first agreement was five hundred tons, and then they went on, as the hay was requisitioned for, showing how the cheques were made payable on the vouchers. This is the whole hay business in connection with the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company. The explanation of this cheque is that it was made payable to the Qu'Appelle Company, endorsed by Eberts, and marked payable to W. R. Bell. Then this other one, there is something here I didn't know before, I think from what I heard it was $1,000. He supplied 22 cars of hay, the vouchers recommend for; he got in advance $1,000 in cash. The rest of the hay was made in these two parts. The whole voucher is $4,080.35 in three different lots: $1,000 in cash receipt, signed W. R. Bell, Gen. Manager of the Farm, and a cheque in favor of the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming\nCompany for $553.50, and the balance, cheque in favor of W. R. Bell, $2,526.85, then the whole of the rest was paid to the Farming Company. This is about all I know about it.\n\nQ. What amount did you pay Bell in Winnipeg?\nA. It was paid at the bank, $6,652.50.\n\nQ. Do you know of any other contracts Bell was interested in, on behalf of the Government?\nA. No, I don't.\n\nCol. Forrest:\nQ. Does that make about $10,000, altogether?\nA. No. The total amount between the Company and Bell was at Fort Qu'Appelle, $16,946.85 and the amount paid Bell in Winnipeg is $6,652.50 paid in two cheques, one for $5,902.50, and the other $750.00, both placed to the credit of W. R. Bell. Out of that something was paid to Bell's own order. I think $2,526.25.\n\nQ. Do you know what the cars carry?\nA. No, about ten tons.\n\nQ. Do you think we would be right in calling each car ten tons?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. You think it was more likely to be 12 and 6 tons?\nA. Yes, but I don't know anything about shipping.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. This amount refused was payable to whom?\nA. Payable to the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company, for refused hay. The amount refused payment is $15,837.00.\n\nQ. Is there anything else you know about the transactions, about the quantity of hay?\nA. I understood the quality was right enough; McDonald satisfied himself about it. I know he seemed to think he had done a very good thing in making the first agreement about the hay.\n\nQ. Do you know the price per ton?\nA. $20 and $22. We paid $25 here in Winnipeg, that was delivered at Qu'Appelle. We merely made the payments in Winnipeg. I understood the price increased when it was double-wired in the baling. Returned or cancelled cheques were produced showing that they were payable to W. R. Bell for $6,652.50, first $750 payable to W. R. Bell, second $5,902.50 payable to W. R. Bell.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nHERBERT SWINFORD.\n\nNovember 19.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. What is your occupation, Mr. Swinford?\nA. Manager of the Winnipeg and Western Transportation Company.\n\nQ. What is your position, and where were your stations during the Rebellion?\nA. I was Commissariat Officer at Troy.\n\nQ. Who controlled the shipping supplies at that station?\nA. I did.\n\nQ. Who inspected, weighed, and received the hay on behalf of the Militia Department there?\nA. I and some other men, sometimes myself, and then I got a Board of Officers to do it.\n\nQ. Was that the hay that came by car?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. There was a quantity delivered by waggons?\nA. Yes, loose hay.\n\nQ. Who received that?\nA. The members of the transport; they measured it by cubic measurement themselves, and gave me the receipts for it.\nQ. Was that hay shipped north as well as the baled hay?\nA. No loose hay was there by the teams going to and from the fort.\n\nQ. Was a system of measurement in place of weighing satisfactory?\nA. I heard no complaints; we had no system of weighing, in fact it was impossible to do so.\n\nQ. Were the measurements ever verified?\nA. The men who measured it gave me the reports. It was bought on that measurement. It was a custom in that country; it is a moral impossibility to weigh it.\n\nQ. You didn't know the number of pounds in a cubic foot?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Who would verify this measurement?\nA. I left it to transport men, because they knew more about it than I did. They were accustomed to this sort of thing.\n\nQ. I wish to know if you ever verified the proportion of cubic feet to the number of pounds. If there had been only ten cubic feet, you could have done it in some way?\nA. We hadn't a scale to put ten feet of hay on.\n\nQ. The object was to know if so many cubic feet contained so many pounds?\nA. I have stood by, and have heard the teamsters kick about not having good measure. I used to go around and see that they had good measure, and they always thought they didn't get good measure, that is the different men who would be supplying the hay.\n\nQ. Was there any pressure to hurry forward the hay after the grass became good for feed?\nA. The teamsters objected to use the grass, because it scoured their horses.\n\nQ. Was there any undue pressure to hurry the hay after the grass became good for food?\nA. No, there was no undue pressure.\n\nQ. It was reported that there were great quantities all the way along the trails?\nA. You had to do what you could under the circumstances, and I provided for the Force to the best of my ability. There was no telling when a strike among the teamsters would occur.\n\nQ. Then you controlled the shipment altogether?\nA. Yes, I did, and stopped the shipments myself.\n\nQ. It has been reported that a quantity of damaged hay had been shipped?\nA. It was shipped, not knowing that it was damaged. The bales outside had seemed quite as you would wish, and when they were opened they were just dusty inside. I used the very best precautions it was possible to use at the time against this, but bad hay would get in. I have no doubt some of it got rained on.\n\nQ. Do you think the hay was as good as it has been reported?\nA. I have reason to believe that some of it went in not as good as it might have been, but after I once got on to it, that it was in any way inferior, I used to have big rows with the men about it, and would not ship it unless it was good.\n\nQ. Was there any advantage given or shown towards teams of the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company?\nA. Not that I am aware of.\n\nQ. You requisitioned for the teams, and didn't know anything about where they came from?\nA. The Qu'Appelle Farm teams were pretty well in the front.\n\nQ. Were there not some belonging to Bell. How many had he of his own?\nA. I don't know how many he had personally. It was all done by sub-divisions and sections, and we didn't take the name of the contractor, but the number of the team, and they settled after they came back with the transport. We were not in a position to know who were the transporters.\n\nQ. Didn't you know that Bell had some 20 or 30 carts there?\nA. I heard something about that.\n\nQ. Haven't you sufficient knowledge about the business to know that he had them there?\nA. I can't say.\nQ. How many double teams had he?\nA. I can't tell you; all I knew was by the section numbers and team numbers and the drivers' names. That was outside of my department altogether.\n\nQ. What was the ordinary market price of hay at Troy during June and July?\nA. About $20 per ton.\n\nQ. That is the Government price?\nA. I have heard that it was bought from $12 to $15 per ton. That was outside of my jurisdiction.\n\nQ. It is quite natural for a person to ask the price of hay? or in fact the price of anything.\nA. I knew more about the price of other things, bacon, flour, etc.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about the management of teams by Bell?\nA. He was an excellent organizer, his system was beautiful. As far as I could see it was very well managed, but you must understand it is not like a thoroughly organized train service of our regular army. We have such a peculiar class of men to deal with. I don't say but it was expensively managed.\n\nCol. Forrest:\nQ. Major Bell's teams delivered over 800 tons of hay. He increased his 500 tons contract for over 300 tons?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. You didn't measure that portion of the hay?\nA. We had to take the Railway bills, the weights were generally marked on the outside of the bales, and we checked the number of bales in a car; I didn't check the whole of it, but have checked the Railway weights.\n\nQ. Then, in some shape or another, these 800 tons passed through your hands, and you verified the weights?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. When they commenced freighting by the ton, have you any knowledge of their having started with small loads, and reloaded at Humboldt?\nA. I believe there was some reloading at Humboldt. I was informed that they did, under the superintendence of Mr. Ferron. It was done because they had a good road from that onwards; I understood that before I had left.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\nQ. Do you mean by reloading that they carried supplies from any one station between Qu'Appelle or Moosejaw and Clarke's Crossing, and charge for it as though it was round freight?\nA. No, not on what they took on. The teams started on a through bill and the bills were returned.\n\nLieut.-Col. Forrest:\nQ. So, this taking on a quantity at Humboldt was no detriment to the Government?\nA. No, if they had wanted to do that they must have got new bills; they never loaded on old bills. Their bills read from Troy right through.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\nQ. You consider the change in the system of transporting supplies was a saving to the Government?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. About what saving?\nA. I don't know, but a man had to go in a certain time, and before they used to take it leisurely, but then it was as much to his own benefit, afterwards it was to his benefit to come back as soon as possible.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. Have you ever made a calculation as to the difference between the cost of day and ton freightage?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Well, you consider that Bell was a good man, then?\nA. Yes, he was. The man had been used to managing a large concern, and the work didn't bother him.\nJames Anderson, called.\n\nCol. Jackson:\u2014We wish to get some information from you with regard to the Transport Service in the North-West. You will not be sworn now, but you may be called upon hereafter to substantiate what you say.\n\nWitness:\u2014Before I give any evidence I enter a protest against Col. Whitehead being on the Commission at all.\n\nCol. Whitehead (to the other Commissioners) I am perfectly willing to leave the matter in your hands. All I want is to get at the truth of the matter.\n\nCol. Whitehead here left the room.\n\nCol. Jackson:\u2014We have been talking about the Stewart contract?\n\nA. Yes, it was for $112 a ton.\n\nQ. Do you think that was the lowest tender?\n\nA. I don't think there were any tenders asked. There was a notice in the papers of June 5th, but all these were let before that; I have seen the contracts.\n\nQ. They asked tenders?\n\nA. I don't know anything about that. I would rather tell the thing myself. In the first place I was sent up by Col. Forrest to pay off some invalids at Moosejaw. I met Stewart, whom I had known since 1879, and he told me he was very much annoyed by Major Bell's actions with regard to his own contract there. He was trying to cancel his contract, and annoy him in every possible way, but he got him at last in a position that he could not very well annoy him any further. I don't remember the date of this. He said he had a memo. from Major Bell of the agreement, which he produced and showed to me. I have not got it here, but I can show it to you tomorrow. It was to this effect: that in the contract from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing, that is Stewart's contract, Major Bell was to have a quarter interest, Lewis, Winnipeg, another 4th, Stewart a 4th, another fourth did not say who it was to go to, but Stewart told me that Col. Whitehead was to have the other fourth; and, further, goes on to state that in Bell, Lewis contract Stewart was to have a 4th interest in that contract, and signed both by Bell and Stewart. I took a copy of that myself. It was in Bell's writing. Then there was another letter in Bell's writing, saying I have seen the General and fixed that all right. I have also seen Ross, who is another contractor there, that we have had some trouble with. Now, come in, and we will make a big thing out of the contract. I told Stewart you ought not to go into anything of that kind, and he said I don't want anything, \"all I want is my contract.\" Then he told me he had another contract, $610 a ton, from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford, which contract I also saw. This he also had trouble with, but, after a while, General Laurie wired Col. Whitehead, who wired him to give Stewart the contract at, I think, $130 a ton, and he was to feed his own teams and men, produce the teams without any cost to the Government, and pay his own ferriage. Bell came up, and kicked up a fuss about this contract being given to Stewart, and the first thing he knew Jones was sent up to take charge of the contract, and Stewart was told by Bell he wasn't wanted any more, that Jones was going to take charge of the contract. Jones made some shipments, and the bills of lading were all made out in the name of Bell & Lewis from Saskatchewan Landing. A few days after that, Captain Howard came up, and said he had the contract for it, and Jones left, and there was about 90 tons of it marked shipped by Bell & Lewis, and I suppose Howard took them over, but I don't know that.\n\nCaptain Howard took the contract and carried it out; Captain Howard came down to Winnipeg before he went up to take the contract, and they were the whole night in the Club, the whole night up to two or three o'clock in the morning, and there was another man walking behind the Club until this was done. This man told me this, and he is willing to swear to it. There was another man named Kelly had an interest in it. Major Bell was to get one 5th and Laurie one 5th; and he presumed Col. Whitehead was to get a fifth; the teams were shipped on the train at Qu'Appelle at a great expense; there were a number of teams shipped from there, and they were hired by Major Bell and his clerks there. I saw Captain Howard there once for a few hours, and Major Bell's own ponies were sent up from Moosejaw to help drawing to Swift Current.\nQ. Were they sent from Qu'Appelle?\nA. No, I don't think they were; they belonged to Bell. He told me when he purchased them from the C.P.R. they were first worked on the Moosejaw route and then they were taken to Swift Current.\n\nQ. They were hauling by the ton?\nA. Not from Swift Current, but Saskatchewan Landing; they were working there first. A number of the receipts while Stewart had the contract from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing were made out on the same heading, Bell & Lewis\u2014these red headings. This was done, Stewart told me, without his authority or knowledge; at the time he had quite a fuss with them over it. The cost of transportation from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing\u2014it took fourteen days to make the round trip at $4.50 a day\u2014would be $63, and they took about 3500 a load. Of course he fed his own teams and his men.\n\nQ. Was that cheaper than the old way of sending by the day?\nA. It was cheaper if they were only taking 1800 and paying $10 a day. As soon as they got the contract, these teams were reduced in price.\n\nQ. When they took this contract was it cheaper to the Government than when they were paying $6.40?\nA. Cheaper to the Government? Oh no, because the roads got much better. They objected to taking more than a ton and a half at first, but all you had to do was to force them. As soon as these contracts were given out, Bell & Lewis reduced to $4.50. From Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing, and Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing, one was longer than the other, one taking 14 and the other 18, and Bell & Lewis' contract was $130 a ton, and they averaged thirty and 3500; it cost them $81 for each team.\n\nQ. That would be $10.88 and some fractions per day a team?\nA. Yes, very nearly $11 a day per team, then they got them $4.50, and the difference between them is nearly $90 a trip profit.\n\nQ. We were paying equal to $10.88 a day?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. So that it would cost more that way to the Government than the other way?\nA. Yes; they cleared about $100, or nearly, a trip. The first week or ten days or two weeks that the Contractors were contracting, I was sent up to attend to some little things wanted at the Front. The contract was Bell & Lewis, and there was no Bell & Lewis there, but only Bell. He loaded the teams, and did everything else, but two or three weeks afterwards a clerk from the office here of Bell & Lewis came up and attended to everything.\n\nQ. Was that Major Bell the partner of Lewis?\nA. Yes. On my return I reported to Capt. Swinford that everything on the road was going to rot and ruin, hay wasted, and in fact at some of the stations you could walk over your boots in oats, and I never saw such waste; I reported this to Capt. Swinford and he said he would speak to Major Bell; I reported this to Capt. Swinford, and he told them not to ship any more hay, but, after that, cars were broken open, and hay sent out by Major Bell and his men.\n\nQ. You know that for a fact?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Do you know about the date?\nA. I could look up the date. Capt. Swinford was very much annoyed over it, and spoke very harshly over it. Teams that left Qu'Appelle loaded would lose a part of their load on the road, feed for horses and rations, and would re-load at Humboldt stuff that cost the Government $200 a ton; they were reloaded whatever they could consume themselves\u2014these were the contractors' teams that were going by the ton. They filled up at Humboldt.\n\nQ. You only heard that?\nA. There is no trouble to prove it; I will give you the name of the men who told me.\n\nQ. And there was always a Supply Officer there to look after the interest of the Government?\nA. I think Perrin was there; you will see by his books; of course there are a great\nmany things that I have been told, and there is no doubt they can be proved by getting the papers. There were telegrams both at Moosejaw and Qu'Appelle which would shew up the whole thing.\n\nQ. Did Bell have any arrangement with the telegraph operator at Qu'Appelle to intercept telegrams that went through?\n\nA. Oh, yes, I think they knew everything that went through. Major Bell at first leaving Qu'Appelle to come down here, when Col. Whitehead first came, he was abusing Col. Whitehead, and when he came back he seemed quite pleased with him.\n\nQ. Was it after he had seen Col. Whitehead, or before, that he made this proposition to Stewart?\n\nA. It was after.\n\nQ. Is there anything more you wish to say?\n\nA. I might tell you something about the hay business: I happened to meet two young farmers from my part of the country who complained that it was a shame the way they were treated in the price of their hay; that they were drawing into Qu'Appelle loose hay; and all they were getting was $12.00 a ton, and I said I know the Government were paying more for it, and I said I would enquire of Mr. _______ at Qu'Appelle, who had the contract for purchasing hay for the Government, and he said it was a secret; but I learned that the Qu'Appelle Farming Company were buying at $12.00 and selling it to the Government at $20; they did not weigh it; they measured it by a tape; Bell put it in, and he had the packing machines all down the line, and packed it, and charged the Government $22 a ton for it, and a good deal of it was that rotten hay that was sent up\u2014it was all pretty well rotten up there; there were piles of it along near the stations that you could not go near it, and the horses would not touch it at all, and there was about a third or a fourth was also bad.\n\nQ. Did they furnish you with oats too?\n\nA. I think they did; there were a lot of teams went down and loaded up with something; of course there is a great deal of information that you could get if a person went about to get it; I was told that they had to give Bell so much for every team they hired, and I was told the same thing was done at Brandon.\n\nQ. That was only hearsay again?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Have you got any teamster or contractor who could swear to it.\n\nA. I am positive if I took charge of it I could get men who would prove it; Kelly told me that he supplied eight teams too many for his contract, and Bell said he would not touch them, or have anything to do with them if you gave him $4,000; McGregor's son was up there, and he heard of the thing, and he went in, arranged the whole thing with Bell, and they were taken on; the teams were hired here at $6.50 a day until they were returned, and some of them objected to being reduced to $4.50, and they said, return us to Winnipeg, and they say the extra was paid by the Government, but of course this has got to be looked up. Kelly told me he knew cases where it was done; if it is necessary I can give you copies of these originals, but I suppose Stewart can give you the originals. Stewart also had the promise in the way of a contract from Qu'Appelle to Clark's Crossing, and that is how he found out that he could get contracts. Stewart has all the contracts and he can show them to you. There was a contract first from General Laurie from Qu'Appelle to Clark's Crossing, and there was a certain part of it which was copied into Bell, Lewis' contract and dated three or four days ahead of his.\n\nQ. There may be some trouble to prove that, as they might say it was the other way about\u2014copied from their's into the other?\n\nA. Yes, but what I say is this\u2014that a person of Col. Whitehead's intelligence should give contracts to men at those figures, costing about $80 or $90 a trip, and there were no tenders asked there, but these men came down here and arranged those prices, and any man who can multiply 4\u00bd by 8 can tell what it would cost to carry that the distance it had to go, and tenders were asked; and before any tenders could be put in nearly all the stuff was pushed up to the front; and there was nothing left to push up, and you see the contracts and they were about half the amounts of the others. The stuff was all gone through, but to see the difference of prices, compare them. On the 5th of June there were tenders sent\nin at $70 a ton, but of course it was too late then, all the stuff was gone. If they had asked for tenders in the first place, they would have got them for $70. What I want to show you is that these tenders were bad ones. Bell & Lewis' contract was let without a tender of any kind. I don't know who was interested in Stewart's contracts; I did not know that he had a contract until I went up to pay some invalids; I know Kelly, but I don't know Arnett. I saw Howard up there. Kelly's contracts were all let before I got there.\n\nQ. Has Stewart ever offered to assist you, in any way, to get your accounts paid?\n\nA. No, never made any offer of any kind. I have heard on the streets rumors that some of these fellows who have been bitten have been making these charges against me, and I would like them to put in a charge. When I returned from Ottawa, on my arrival here, I met Stewart, and I told him I had placed the matter in the Minister's hands, and gave him the letter, and he told me he was worried to death by Blanchard, Col. Whitehead's Solicitor here, running after him, wanting him to make affidavits that Col. Whitehead was pure, and never had anything to do with any such evidence as he had in his possession. I wired this to Ottawa, and received an answer afterwards; they tried every means possible to get possession of papers that he has in his possession.\n\nCol. Forrest.\u2014I think you have made it clear that you were not interested, in any way, with any contracts for hay?\n\nA. No, not to any extent; all I did was to introduce a friend to the Hudson Bay Company, and he was promised a contract. I never received a cent commission on the purchase of horses, and I don't know of any body who did. The first horses we had a good deal of trouble with. I was present at the purchase of every horse, after I came home. Graham acted first rate, and helped me all he could, but there was another fellow who put in a claim for another horse more than he had put in, and I reported it to you.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nJames Anderson. November 19th.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. What position did you occupy during the late Rebellion?\n\nA. I was assistant to Lieut.-Col. Forrest at Qu'Appelle most of the time.\n\nQ. We wish you to explain this letter which you have sent in to us? What do you wish to say about the contract from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford?\n\nA. I was never there myself. I have nothing to say about that.\n\nQ. You said that Col. Whitehead wired to Gen. Laurie to give a contract to John Stewart.\n\nA. Yes, this I know by a rough copy of the tender given to me by John Stewart.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about Jones's duties? What was he round there for?\n\nA. He was a clerk for the Transport Office.\n\nQ. You say that the said Jones took bills of lading from Bell & Lewis for 200 of freight?\n\nA. Yes, Mr. McQueen said he did.\n\nQ. And that these bills were endorsed over by Bell & Lewis?\n\nA. That is on the Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford trail.\n\nQ. You say a great number of teams were hired by Bell, and sent from Swift Current on this contract?\n\nA. Yes, I know this myself.\n\nQ. Do you know whose service they were in?\n\nA. The teamsters told me Major Bell hired them, and sent them up there, and Jones went up there a few days after they were hired.\n\nQ. You say that Col. Whitehead gave a contract to a personal friend of his own for twenty head of cattle, without tenders, and at a loss to the Government?\n\nA. I can produce the evidence to that, if necessary.\n\nQ. Do you wish to produce the witnesses on that?\n\nA. It would be necessary in order to go into it thoroughly.\n\nQ. You say that Col. Whitehead allowed Bell & Lewis to be paid their contract from Qu'Appelle at prices fifty per cent. too high and was guilty of improper negligence?\nA. I can produce evidence that this could have been done fifty per cent cheaper at that time.\n\nQ. Without any interruption to the service?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. You say that Major Bell, above mentioned, was the Bell of Bell & Lewis, Transport Contractors, and that said Bell admitted this at Regina? Are you prepared to prove this?\n\nA. Bell admits it himself.\n\nQ. You say that the said Bell himself superintended the work for some time on behalf of himself and Lewis. You were at Qu'Appelle then, do you know anything about it?\n\nA. Yes, that he was running it without any agent.\n\nQ. For how many days\u2014was it two days?\n\nA. It was more, perhaps five. The teams worked there for some time before Fox came up to take charge of it.\n\nQ. You say that said Bell hired the teams for this contract, and loaded them with rotten hay, knowing at the time that it was unfit for use?\n\nA. On my return from this trip to the Saskatoon Landing I found a quantity of hay at each station on the road that was unfit for use and rotting. Teamsters would not allow their horses to touch it; what little they did use was for bedding. The teams were let out on grass and picked what they could as it was just sprouting at the time. This was on my way down.\n\nQ. Where did you meet the first portion of these teams that were going out on the contract?\n\nA. I met the first somewhere about the Salt Plains. Of course there were some that were hauling for the Government as well as on this contract. There was a quantity of stuff at each of these stations, and when the contract was let to Bell & Lewis, teams were continually going back and forward taking the stuff.\n\nQ. How long did it take you to return from Qu'Appelle to that place?\n\nA. I think it was three or four days.\n\nQ. Then you were not at Qu'Appelle when this convoy was organized?\n\nA. No, not the first lot.\n\nQ. How do you know that Bell was engaging teams?\n\nA. He continued doing so. I wasn't there when the first lot were hired. Some of them told me that they had been hired by Bell.\n\nQ. Had Bell control of the shipping of that hay?\n\nA. Yes, he was loading the teams all the time. I reported on my return, telling Forrest & Swinford, who was there looking after this shipping, complained of supplies going out that should not go. In reference to charge 28, all I can produce is the evidence of John Wood, but he is now working for the C.P.R. in the Rocky Mountains.\n\nQ. We have an affidavit here to the effect that, even if that had been loaded there, it would have made no difference, so that the Government could not have been injured?\n\nA. Wood told me that there was crooked work in the matter.\n\nIn reference to charge 24, I should like to look into the payments before I could state what evidence I could bring on that.\n\nIn reference to charge 27, I have seen them measuring the hay.\n\nQ. Would it have been any advantage to Bell to have reduced the quantity to the teamsters, the men who furnished the hay?\n\nA. I don't know that he had an object in it.\n\nQ. What was the customary manner of weighing or measuring hay?\n\nA. I don't know.\n\nQ. Were there not clerks there to check it?\n\nA. I complained that the hay was turned in, without any one checking it, that he turned it in to himself, and made his own returns; he did everything, he was agent and contractor, and everything else.\n\nQ. Do you know the price of hay at Qu'Appelle at that time, the ordinary market price?\nA. Some farmers were only getting $10 a ton, and they were complaining about the Government giving $20.\n\nQ. Do you mean to say that, after paying all expenses, it could be laid down at the station, at $15 per ton?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. How could this be bought without expenses?\n\nA. Purchasing and packing could be done at this price.\n\nQ. In reference to charge, are you prepared to show us that the supplies hauled by Bell, Lewis & Co. cost more than when hauled by the day?\n\nA. Yes, I am prepared to show that this contract cost a good deal more to the Government than could the teams at the ordinary price, from $6.50 or $7 per day.\n\nQ. In reference to charge 29, are you prepared to swear to this statement as being correct?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nLieut. Col. E. A. WHITEHEAD. November 21, 1885.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. What was your position in the Militia Department, during the Rebellion?\n\nA. My position, as appointed by the Minister, was Chief Commissariat Officer, limited to supplies, subsistence, and transport.\n\nQ. When were you appointed, and when did you arrive in Winnipeg?\n\nA. I was appointed about the 19th of April, and arrived here on the 22nd of the same month.\n\nQ. What were your duties?\n\nA. The duties of the Chief Commissariat Officer.\n\nQ. When did you first have any interview or business with Major Bell in connection with the transport business?\n\nA. About the 20th of May\u2014by telegram on the 15th of May, personally about the 20th.\n\nQ. Did you meet him about the 19th of May last, and if so what took place at that interview?\n\nA. No, I didn't meet him on the 19th, to my knowledge. On the 20th of May I wired him as follows\u2014\"Having received instructions from the Minister of Militia to cancel all contracts for transport, I authorize you to dismiss all teams, and re-engage them without middlemen, on the tonnage system, not interfering with teams of the General.\"\n\n\"K. A. WHITEHEAD.\"\n\nI have never had an interview with Major Bell; I didn't know the man.\n\nQ. Did you arrange for contract with Bell & Lewis, or either of them; if so, give particulars as to prices?\n\nA. Major Bell, acting under my telegram of the 20th May, made contracts for moving supplies, which contracts were referred to me.\n\nQ. Before closing this contract, did you make enquiries as to cost of transport per ton from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. What enquiries did you make?\n\nA. I calculated the cost to transport supplies from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing, and, on the improved system, I considered the saving equal to one-third, and reported the same to the Minister of Militia.\n\nQ. What information did you get, and from whom?\n\nA. From my own common-sense.\n\nQ. Did you ask Major Bell the distance from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing?\n\nA. No, Capt. Allan was my consulting officer, and knew the trail from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing, from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing, and from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford.\nQ. Did you ask the state of the roads?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Did you ascertain the number of days in which the round trip could be made?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Did you know what time was allowed to make the round trip, and that the limit was eighteen days?\nA. I consulted with Capt. Allan, and he allowed from 25 to 30 miles per day, and made our calculations accordingly.\n\nQ. At the time you were letting this contract to Bell & Lewis, you were aware that the teams then in the employ of the Government were discharged, and were hired by Bell & Lewis at $4.50 per day.\nA. The teams were discharged by my orders\u2014I have no knowledge of what they were engaged at afterwards.\n\nQ. Have you ever estimated the cost of a round trip at these prices?\nA. I never figured on the $4.50 per day. I was satisfied that the tonnage system was a saving of one-third the old system.\n\nQ. Were you aware that these teams drew 3,000 pounds?\nA. No.\n\nQ. At $140 per ton would this load not net $200?\nA. I didn't figure that way; I figured on the saving to the Government of the new system over the old. I didn't suppose to calculate the profits or the loss of the contractors.\n\nQ. At $4.50 per day, at 18 days for the trip, would not the trip cost the contractor only $81.\nA. Simple calculations show that.\n\nQ. Would not the net profit be $129 for each team's trip?\nA. Leave that to an accountant.\n\nQ. Now what would be the net profit to the contractors per ton?\nA. I neither know the terms that the contractors agreed with the teamsters nor anything about the profits.\n\nQ. Would it not be $86 for each ton, clear profit?\nA. I have never studied the interests of contractors, or made the calculations.\n\nQ. Did you use your own discretion in letting this contract, or did you rely on Bell's advice alone?\nA. I relied on Bell's advice alone, submitting the contract.\n\nQ. Did you enquire if any other one would do it cheaper?\nA. Through Mr. Blanchard, Advocate, whom I engaged in the interests of the Government, and consulted on the matter of cancelling the contracts existing between the Hudson Bay Company on behalf of the Government and the teamsters, these Contractors, with the exception of one, refused to sign the agreement, cancelling the contract, and enabling the teamsters to re-engage on the tonnage system. I advised Major Bell on the 2nd June, as follows:\u2014\u201cHave consulted lawyer whose opinion is that contractors are entitled to pay until teams return home. Have drawn up deed for contractors, signing it, cancelling contract and agreeing to teams being re-engaged, and will notify you, but don't engage contractors' teams till document is completed.\u201d Any contractor refusing new system you will return home to destination. Will keep you posted. On the third of June, I telegraphed him \u201cCan you continue service and dismiss contractors' teams. Contractors unwilling to continue at a price and cancel original contract. What can you afford to pay by the day? This arrangement will continue until new contracts are issued, when you will be advised.\u201d\n\n\"E. A. WHITEHEAD.\"\n\nThese contractors, with the exception of one, refused to cancel the agreement, I therefore wired Major Bell accordingly.\n\nQ. Did you compute yourself what would be the profits?\nA. No.\n\nQ. At the time Bell & Lewis got the contract, were the roads better or worse than before?\nA. I have no knowledge of that?\nQ. Could the Government not have discharged the teams, and rehired them, instead of Bell & Lewis at the $4.50 per day, or thereabouts, and had the benefit?\nA. Not at that time\u2014the contractors refused to cancel their agreement, and they controlled 1200 teams.\n\nQ. Did Major Bell, about the 19th of May, inform you that he was a partner of Lewis?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Did you know from any other source this fact?\nA. Not till afterwards.\n\nQ. Did you authorize Major Bell, as your subordinate or agent, to make the contract with Bell & Lewis, as stated in the agreement of May 21st?\nA. I never gave Bell any orders to make a contract with any firm or individual. I ordered him to move the supplies to the front, by order of the Minister, on the tonnage system, and dismiss all contractors' teams.\n\nQ. Will you swear that you were ignorant of Major Bell's connection with Bell & Lewis when you deputed him to make the contract?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Do you know who got the benefit of the profits made on this contract?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Was this contract, dated the 21st of May, drawn up, and signed and delivered, on or about the day of which it bears date?\nA. The contract speaks for itself.\n\nQ. What was the style of the firm when the contract was made, and when was the name changed, and for what purpose?\nA. The style of the firm when the contract was made was Bell, Lewis & Co. It was dated 21st May. I never knew of any change.\n\nQ. You are aware that shipping bills were headed Bell & Lewis for some time after the contract was given, and afterwards \"Co.\" was added?\nA. No.\n\n(Counterfoils of stubbs of the first shipment produced.)\n\nQ. Did you advise the Minister of Militia that the Bell of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh was the Bell of Bell, Lewis & Co.\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Did you do that after some complaints had been made?\nA. The Minister wired me if the Bell of Bell, Lewis & Co. was Major Bell of the Bell Farm. I answered he was not\u2014I afterwards advised him he was, when I gained the information.\n\nQ. What was your object in making this representation?\nA. I made no representation.\n\nQ. Was your object really not to get the money for Lewis?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Can you explain how the Minister was under the impression, until recently, that Bell, Lewis & Co. were not paid?\nA. He was always under the impression that they were not paid, because he ordered me not to pay them.\n\nQ. When the Minister first communicated with you in regard to the alleged Transport frauds, what steps did you take to ascertain the facts?\nA. I consulted everyone who could give me information from the front.\n\nQ. In what quarters would you be likely to get information that such frauds really existed?\nA. I sent Captain Allan, my consulting officer, over the trail.\n\nQ. Did you make enquiries from any of the following officers at the Contract Depots:\u2014Colonel Forrest, Captain Swinford, James Anderson, of Qu'Appelle, or General Laurie, Moosejaw, or any other officer?\nA. No; I hadn't the pleasure of these officers' acquaintance, and they all ignored my position.\n\nQ. Was it not your duty to enquire from the parties just mentioned, and from every other source you could think of, before advising the Minister?\nA. It was the duty of these parties to report any irregularities to me, as chief of that branch of the service.\n\nQ. Did you see J. L. Lewis, of Bell, Lewis & Co., about it?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. If you saw him, what took place between you?\n\nA. I never saw him.\n\nQ. Did you read Major Bell's letter in a Winnipeg newspaper, denying any connection with the Transport contract?\n\n(Letter read.)\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Can you account for the different statements in the letter, and Major Bell's evidence?\n\nA. Major Bell had better be called upon to give his evidence.\n\nQ. Was there a contract for transport from Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing given to John Stewart, at $110 per ton, net cost, to the Government?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Are you aware that through freight from Winnipeg costs only $2 more per ton to Moosejaw than to Qu'Appelle?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. In that case would not the transportation, from Qu'Appelle via Moosejaw to Clarke's Crossing, be only about $113 per ton, net cost, to the Government, as Stewart, in his contract, fed both men and teams?\n\nA. Stewart's tender from Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing was $150. The General having ordered that trail to be kept open, therefore the supplies at Qu'Appelle could not be freighted by rail to Moosejaw.\n\nQ. Are you aware that Bell, Lewis & Co.'s contract cost the Government $140 per ton to Clarke's Crossing?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Are you aware that the rations and feed of teams used by Bell & Lewis cost the Government about $60 per ton?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Are you aware that Bell & Lewis were to allow the Government $10 per ton, if the Government fed the teams?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Taking this into consideration, and giving allowance for this $10, would there not be a cost to the Government of about $190 per ton?\n\nA. No; Bell & Lewis were charged up with what they consumed.\n\nQ. Would this not make a difference per ton of $78 in favor of Moosejaw?\n\nA. I don't know anything about that.\n\nQ. Was it not your duty, either personally or through your subordinates, to ascertain the cheapest route, and send by the cheapest route, without favoring any contractor?\n\nA. I favored no contractor; I did my duty.\n\nQ. Did not General Laurie advise the adoption of the Moosejaw route, on the ground that there would be a saving to the Government?\n\nA. General Laurie had no right to advise. General Middleton ordered the Qu'Appelle route to be kept open.\n\nQ. Were you aware that the distance in favor of the Moosejaw route was at least 48 miles, and in a round trip 96 miles, and that the roads were quite as good, if not better?\n\nA. When the General Commanding orders me, I obey. I don't discuss the matter with him.\n\nQ. In the face of these facts, what reason do you give for sending the bulk of the freight over the most expensive route?\n\nA. Carrying out my orders.\n\nQ. Do you remember sending a telegram to General Laurie about 30th May last? Produce it.\n\nA. Yes, on the 31st of May I telegraphed to General Laurie:\u2014\n\"Thanks for statement of supplies. Have telegraphed Bell to arrange with you and Stewart, and make contract, pending tenders.\n\n\"E. A. WHITEHEAD.\"\n\nQ. Did you not deny the existence of such a telegram when John Stewart was making his statement before this Commission?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Was not Major Bell aware that you had sent this telegram?\nA. (Telegram from Colonel Whitehead to Major Bell) \"General Laurie wires: You haven't answered his telegram about contract with Stewart, to freight between Saskatchewan Landing and Battleford. Please arrange for the present until tenders are allotted. I have given you full power.\"\n\n\"E. A. WHITEHEAD.\"\n\nMy sole reason in wiring Bell and Laurie to move the supplies at that base was owing to a report I received from the Transport Officer at the Landing that the supplies were spoiling. Also a telegram from Major-General Laurie, stating that the supplies were becoming bad, and the Troops were in an unhealthy condition.\n\nQ. Was not John Stewart's figures, viz., $135 per ton net, Stewart paying ferriage, feed of teams and men, time of teams, transport of teams, and the contract, to be finished in two weeks?\nA. None of these provisos were mentioned in Stewart's contract, with the exception of food and forage, and I considered Howard's contract for $125 cheaper.\n\nQ. Did you authorize Major Bell to make a contract for this purpose with Mr. Howard?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Was Howard's contract not $125 per ton, Government paying transport of teams from Qu'Appelle to Swift Current, a distance of about 200 miles, Government feeding them and paying ferriage?\nA. The contract speaks for itself. It reads: \"Free transportation returning home.\"\n\nQ. If the Government fed the teams they were to be allowed $10 per ton?\nA. Yes; that is correct.\n\nQ. Are you aware that this would cost the Government at least $20?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Would the cost of this contract not be $125 freight, $1 for ferriage, $4 for conveyance of teams, and $7.50 for feed of men each, and $10 extra cost of teams' feed thus making altogether not less than $147.50 per ton?\nA. Howard paid his own ferriage. I consider the calculation incorrect.\n\nQ. According to these figures would not Stewart's contract be $12.50 per ton less than Howard's?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Did not the Government, between the date of Stewart's contract and Howard's, feed some 100 teams or more at Saskatchewan Landing, while the contract was being settled?\nA. Not to my knowledge.\n\nQ. How much would the wages and feed of these teams cost the Government the time they were idle?\nA. I am not aware that any teams were idle at that date, at the expense of the Government.\n\nQ. If Stewart had been allowed to do this work at these figures, would there have been any necessity for the delay of these teams?\nA. I am not aware that any teams were delayed at the expense of the Government.\n\nQ. Did this delay, while it lasted, cost the Government at least $800 per day?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Are you aware that there was another delay for about ten days, when the ferry was broken, and that the Government fed the teams for this, while if Stewart's contract had been accepted he would have had to bear this himself?\nA. I don't consider the Government lost any money by the delay, and the carrying away of the ferry was an act of Providence, for which the Government cannot hold me responsible.\n\nQ. When was the contract with Howard made?\nA. June 3rd.\n\nQ. Who negotiated this contract? How long were the negotiations pending before the contract was closed?\nA. I don't know.\n\nQ. Did you instruct Bell to give this contract to Howard dated 3rd June, 1885?\nA. No.\n\nQ. How did you instruct Bell, was it by telegram or letter?\nA. I didn't instruct Bell.\n\nQ. Have you a copy of your letter or telegram, if instructions were so given?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Did you not accept this contract on the night of 4th June?\nA. Not to my knowledge.\n\nQ. Why did you accept this contract?\nA. I considered it the lowest.\n\nQ. Was not John Stewart to supply his own teams and finish the contract in two weeks?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Are you aware that about 90 tons were shipped, before Howard took the contract, by one Jones, a Government officer?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Produce these certificates of these shipments. (Certificates produced)\n\nQ. Was Captain Howard paid for this work?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Captain Howard then got the benefit of shipments made by a Government officer before he really had the contract?\nA. I am not aware of it.\n\nQ. Captain Howard is an old Montreal friend of yours, is he not?\nA. Yes, of 30 years' standing.\n\nQ. Is John L. Lewis an old Montreal friend of yours?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Did not Montreal friends have quite a number of contracts?\nA. Not one that I know of.\n\nQ. When the contract was closed with Howard were tenders not then really advertised for?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Before accepting Howard's contract, why did you not wait a day until the tender should be in?\nA. Because I was carrying out the Minister's orders.\n\nQ. Did tenders come in pursuant to the advertisement?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Where are they?\nA. In Ottawa.\n\nQ. Were they opened?\nA. Not in Winnipeg. I was ordered by the Minister to send them unopened to Ottawa.\n\nQ. Who was present when they were opened. If not opened, why were they sent to Ottawa?\nA. I don't know who was present; they were opened in Ottawa.\n\nQ. Was it at your suggestion or at the Minister's request?\nA. At the Minister's orders.\n\nQ. Produce the telegram you received from Sinclair, the contractor, about the beginning of June, on the Saskatchewan Landing contract.\nA. I sent that telegram on the 6th of June, the date it was received, to the Minister of Militia, as it was a tender for freighting.\nQ. Did you not let a contract for twenty head of cattle to a man in Winnipeg?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Produce the contract and assignments (contracts and assignments produced) assignments attached to claims sent in for payment?\n\nQ. Where did this cattle contract man come from?\nA. I don't know.\n\nQ. Did you know him in Montreal?\nA. No.\n\nQ. What was his occupation there?\nA. I don't know.\n\nQ. Did you ever sell him any goods while you were in business in Montreal?\nA. I never saw the man in my life till I saw him in Winnipeg.\n\nQ. Did you ask for tenders or get figures from any other person, cattle dealers or butchers?\nA. I submitted the requisition from Col. Otter to the Government contractor, Gallagher, and the Minister ordered me to give a contract to Harris, who tendered one cent less than the Government contractor.\n\nQ. How many transfers of this contract were made before it came to the party who furnished the cattle, and what do the assignments show to be the profits of each individual?\nA. Two assignments; no profits mentioned.\n\nQ. Have you any further evidence to give?\nA. I will read a few telegrams:\n\nOTTAWA, 15th May, 1885.\n\nCol. WHITEHEAD,\n\"I have telegraphed to Wrigley as follows: Please see Whitehead. I have telegraphed him to call for tenders for transport everywhere, except not to interfere with teams now with the General. I also wished tenders to be called for meat, oats and hay, as the immediate want which required department to act without tenders has now disappeared.\n\n\"A. P. CARON.\"\n\n\"Now take immediate steps to call for tenders for all supplies required, being particular about issuing any tenders for supplies to be delivered at given stations, which you must decide upon after communicating with commanding officers. It might also be possible for you to ask that supplies tendered for be conveyed by Contractors to various stations.

You are limited to transport, supplies and subsistence.\n\n\"A. P. CARON.\"\n\nTelegram on the 6th May from Col. Whitehead to the Hon. A. P. Caron:\u2014\"Have seen Wrigley. Will act with discretion.

CARON.\"\n\nTelegram from Colonel Whitehead to the Minister of Militia, 19th May:\u2014\"Have reorganized the cost of transport to freight by the ton instead of by the day\u2014a saving of $5000 per day. Present transport system not interfered with. It is necessary that you order the H. B.

Co., which I would recommend, or do you wish the contract made direct to me? In the meantime I\nhave adopted the tonnage system at one-third saving, and when you decide the questions with H. B.

The saving is enormous, and I have worked it with great discretion, especially as the present system of transport will not be molested, and supplies, as heretofore, promptly delivered.\"\n\nAnswer from the Minister of Militia to Col. Whitehead:\u2014\"I have ordered H. B. Co. to cancel contract with present contractors. Follow more economical system. Do all you can to the H. B. Co., as you recommend.

Co. the preference for future contracts, but they are not willing to resign their present hold and throwing obstacles in the way. In the meantime, am moving supplies on tonnage system at a great saving. Suggest you telegraph to Wrigley that I have full power to relieve him, and insist on immediate cancelling.

Jackson:\u2014\n\nQ. What is your name, occupation and residence?\n\nA. Thomas Kelly, contractor.\n\nQ. Were you connected with Captain Howard last spring, any way as to hiring teams on the Transport Service, if so, state fully what you know about it?\n\nA. I was. All I know was that I got the contract from the H. B. Co., and have filled it, to supply a certain number of teams for the Transport Service.\n\nQ. What was the rate per day?\n\nA. Six dollars and fifty cents.\n\nQ. Do you know anything in regard to a certain contract, given to Howard for transport from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford. If so, state what you know?\n\nA. I know that he and I put in a tender on the fifth of June, for the moving of\nsupplies from Qu'Appelle Station, Moosejaw and Swift Current; and on the morning of the 6th June he told me that one Jones had the contract for moving the stuff from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford. I think it was a day or two days after I heard that he had gone west, and had this contract. About three or four days after I went out west, and met him between Swift Current and Saskatchewan Landing, after he had the freight all shipped for Battleford, and then he told me, at Swift Current, on my way back, he would carry out his arrangements with me, as to my proportion of the profits.\n\nQ. Were you not with Howard on the night of June 4th, in reference to this contract, and who were these negotiations with?\n\nA. It will be either on the night of the fourth or fifth that tenders were to be in. I saw Howard as late as one or two o'clock that morning; I think that tenders were called for to be in on the fifth of June, so if the fifth was included it was the morning of the sixth, half-past one, or thereabouts, that I saw Howard.\n\nQ. Had you any conversation at that time?\n\nA. We talked over the matter, and he said he was going to the Club, as Major Bell and Col. Whitehead wanted to see him. I went up Portage Avenue with him, and we parted at the corner of Hargrave street; he went to the Club, and I went home.\n\nQ. At what hour during the night or morning were these negotiations closed?\n\nA. Between one and two o'clock on the morning of the 6th of June.\n\nQ. Why should you have been negotiating then at that hour, after that closing of the tenders?\n\nA. It was negotiating to try and secure the contract for moving the supplies that were at Saskatchewan Landing, pending the result of our other tenders, as it would require some time to decide the matter.\n\nQ. Do you know the date that Captain Howard went west to take charge of this contract?\n\nA. It will be the seventh or eighth of June; he remained a day after the fifth, and I think he went the following morning.\n\nQ. Did you have any understanding or conversation with Howard as to the releasing of the teams hired by the day. If so, what was the understanding or conversation?\n\nA. Well, we had a conversation. I think that if we got this moving of supplies at Saskatchewan Landing, we would have to release our team contracts with the H. B. Co.; we thought the matter over, and after he went west, I got a telegram asking me to release my contract. I telegraphed him, asking him to explain the thing more fully. I got no answer, and therefore I did not release my contract. Howard and Flannigan were in with me in this contract. Howard asked me to see Flannigan, and see if I could make arrangements to release these teams.\n\nQ. You didn't do so?\n\nA. I saw Flannigan and had a conversation with him, and he consented to do whatever I would do in the matter.\n\nQ. What was the result?\n\nA. Howard didn't answer the telegram I sent him, and we did not release the teams. He had released his without our consent. There were some of my teams at Battleford, and when they struck Swift Current, they were moved into Winnipeg.\n\nQuestioned by Col. Peebles:\n\nQ. They were your teams and Flannigan's that were shipped into Winnipeg?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. At the time you had these interviews with Capt. Howard, did you know that John Stewart had a contract for this same work, and have you any reason to believe that Howard knew this?\n\nA. No, I don't think I ever heard it mentioned that Stewart had this contract; no, not to my knowledge. I had asked General Laurie if he was receiving tenders to move the stuff from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford; he said no, that they were receiving in Winnipeg.\n\nQ. Have you ever made a calculation as to the difference in cost of freighting by\nthe day and ton in that contract, at the ordinary rate per day, the difference to the Government?\n\nA. Well, no, I have not; I think it cost the Government more by the hundred than it would by the day, if they had no delays. I considered that my calculations were based on the average of about $6.50 per day for the teams. I only got hearsay about, the price paid for freight was 64 cents per pound.\n\nQ. You, then, have apparently been misinformed about the rates?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Did you notice any hay when you were over the trail?\n\nA. Yes; at the Landing and at the Station, between Swift Current and the Landing, that is as far as I was, the quality was very bad.\n\nQ. How would you account for it being bad?\n\nA. It looked like hay cut and pressed out of season; not like hay saved in the summer; much of it was rotten. Of course it was pretty hard getting hay at that time.\n\nQ. Did the outside of the bales look all right?\n\nA. This hay I referred to was very bad, when I saw it; it might have been exposed to the rain, which would have a bad effect on the outside of it.\n\nQ. Do you know of any irregularities connected with this freighting?\n\nA. I do not know, personally.\n\nQ. Did you find it necessary to pay a commission to any officers of the Transport Service in order to carry out your contract?\n\nA. No; I never paid a cent.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nW. F. LUXTON (Editor of Free Press) sworn.\n\nNovember 24th, 1885.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. We have called you here to give us some information in regard to some statements which appear in your paper.\n\nA. The articles were based on information we received from time to time during the progress of the campaign, and we never published anything but upon what we considered the best possible authority. However I may say now of our own knowledge, I was not in a position to know, as I was not in the field myself. Nearly all we said was from hearsay, but was on what he deemed most undoubted authority. I think the first matter we touched upon was about the Qu'Appelle Farm teams being employed at $10 per day. We alleged that while the Bell Farm teams were being paid $10 per day, teams could be had at $6 per day, and that the authorities were aware of this. We based that on the information we had from William Clark, Mr. Wrigley's deputy of the H.B. Co. He told me that the first teams the Company sent out, I think, it was $8 a day they paid. They had to be got in a very great hurry. When they could get the teams at $6 per day they so advised Gen. Middleton, who was en route. I am relating it as I had it. I know, as a matter of fact, that teams were being employed at $6 per day. It was not admitted that they were receiving $10 per day by the Qu'Appelle Farm people.\n\nQ. Of course you know that the service was an exceptional one, there was no organisation of the Government at that time by which that work could be done?\n\nA. Our point was this.\u2014We did not object to the Government giving $8 or $10 per day in the first instance; but after Mr. Wrigley telegraphed Gen. Middleton that teams could be had for $6 we objected to teams getting $10 per day. Of course the H.B. Co. were simply acting as commission agents. I cannot remember the whole thing categorically, just now and names. I cannot say who were our authorities from time to time either. We alleged that Major Bell was understood to be a Government officer, was interested in contracts, and we said the Government was quite aware of it. We said that the Minister of Militia knew it, and Sir John Macdonald, and we based that statement upon this. I saw the document signed by Major Bell and John Stewart, in which they agreed as men of honor to divide the profits accruing from a certain contract that was indicated. There was a foot note or supplementary memorandum on the same sheet of paper making a similar arrange-\nment about a contract Bell & Lewis had. I saw this, and knew the person who had it at the time, to be a trustworthy man. I had a letter from Bell in which he threatened to take an action for libel. The party told me that he had shown it to the Minister of Militia and Sir John Macdonald. This is how we justified the statement that the Government knew just how things were. Bell had declared, over his own signature, that he was interested in no contracts whatever. We had in mind this particular contract. There was an enormous amount between what Stewart contracted with the Government to do it for and what he paid for it; I cannot remember the sum now.\n\nQ. You mean what Stewart was doing the work for?\n\nA. No, what Stewart re-let it for, or what the Government was paying for it, and what was actually paid for the performance of the work, the difference accruing to these \"middle-men.\" The inference was that Bell did not honestly let the work\u2014I think we drew this inference.\n\nQ. Were you aware that Stewart re-let a portion at $5 per ton less than he was doing it for?\n\nA. I could only know it from hearsay.\n\nQ. From whom did you get that information?\n\nA. From different parties. I cannot name the parties. I know the party who had the document\u2014I prefer not to name him.\n\nQ. We have the same power as any other Court?\n\nA. His name is James Anderson.\n\nQ. What do you suppose his object was?\n\nA. I did not ask. We said it was a friend of the Government who has shown these documents.\n\nQ. Have you any knowledge that W.R. Bell was a member of the firm of Bell, Lewis & Co?\n\nA. I did not think that of Major Bell. It never occurred to me that Major Bell is of the firm of Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh. It never occurred to me that this was the Bell who had the contract for freighting. Our point was, that Major Bell, as a Government officer, dishonestly used his position for his own emolument. The contract or agreement between himself and Stewart was the evidence of it, and Bell had declared that he had no interest, directly, or indirectly. Our point was that he was not faithful to his position.\n\nQ. You only had one letter from Bell, July 17th. It was taken from the paper at the time?\n\nA. These contracts must have been made long before that, but I don't know as to exact time.\n\nCol. Forrest:\n\nQ. That should naturally be, I suppose?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. Then what you have written in the paper was from hearsay. You have no personal knowledge?\n\nA. Yes; excepting the matter of the agreement, which I know had Bell's signature. What we were reaching at was, that Bell was defrauding the Government, and, while representing the Government, was interested in the contracts.\n\nQ. Regarding the transport, was there anything further that you could give us information about before we come to supplies?\n\nA. I cannot remember anything just now. I never spoke to McGregor. I don't know the men.\n\nQ. Then you don't know of anything else regarding the transport of teams?\n\nA. I don't remember so many things just now.\n\nQ. Regarding supplies, the furnishing of supplies, is there anything that you know about?\n\nA. Yes, the hay. I only know this in the same way as I know other things. I have every reason to believe that the Government was paying three times more for it than was necessary, and that it was of very inferior quality.\nQ. What was the price of hay at Qu'Appelle at that time?\nA. I was told that the Government were paying four times what farmers were offering to sell it for; that farmers' offers were declined; and that the hay bought was rotten. Of course newspapers cannot wait to get the most specific and detailed information; when they honestly believe a thing they treat it as a fact.\n\nQ. Supposing the Government paid $20 and $22 for hay at Qu'Appelle, was that a big price?\nA. Hay was offered there at $15; my information was that the Government were paying $75 per ton. Speaking of supplies, I have it from several persons whom I believed to be good authority, that the Government paid the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company for oats, and were receiving ruined wheat (unmarketable wheat) for oats.\n\nQ. This is, of course, only hearsay?\nA. That's all.\n\nQ. We have it on authority that they gave no oats.\nA. Perhaps the authorities didn't know the Qu'Appelle. Upon this rotten wheat I think (I am not sure) Capt. McMillan can give information. Dozens of people told me the same thing. I was under the impression about the hay that it was offered at Fort Qu'Appelle; I thought I was pretty solid on the hay question, but I cannot follow it out just now. I think they were paying from three to five times the price it was offered for. I had information something like this: that while the Government was paying a certain price, they were refusing it from farmers at a much smaller price. At the time I was perfectly satisfied about it.\n\nQ. You intimated occasionally, that the officers serving in the Transport and Supply Departments were interested in various ways; and you reflected upon the personnel of the Commission when it was appointed?\nA. I may say that Col. Whitehead's name was mentioned over and over again to us in connection with the matter; that there was collusion between Major Bell and himself, but his name was never mentioned in the paper in that way. I cannot remember just now who named him.\n\nQ. You can't give us names of any one who could prove that?\nA. I can't. Of course we didn't mention Col. Whitehead, we didn't wish to mention his name; but it was in the public interest to clear the thing up.\n\nCol. Forrest:\nQ. We are not trying to whitewash Bell or anybody else, we are trying, to the best of our ability, to put the right saddle on the right horse.\nA. I am quite satisfied that; I was challenged in the matter of the Commission, and I have, therefore, thus explained.\n\nQ. I suppose, after all, what you have stated is what you have heard casually?\nR. Yes, of course, but fortified always by a thorough belief in the truth of the statements. I was hearing about this for a month before I touched it, and I fortified myself as far as I could. I believe my informants were truthful persons, but it was very difficult to be specific. I considered that when I saw the document to which I have referred, we had made our case. Major Bell was the only name we ever mentioned, being the only one of whom we actually knew anything.\n\nQ. We only wish to get at the truth.\nA. I know nothing of Col. Whitehead's doings; but that they were mentioned in connection with all this matter.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\nWilliam Clark's evidence. November 24, 1885.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. What is your occupation?\nA. I am a factor of the H. B. Co.\n\nQ. Had the Hudson Bay Company a contract with the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company for a quantity of hay, during the Rebellion, on behalf of the Government?\nA. We hadn't down here, but Arch. McDonald at Qu'Appelle made an agreement for 500 tons,\u2014this is as far as I knew.\nQ. Was that the quantity actually delivered?\nA. Yes, and over.\n\nQ. You haven't a copy of the memorandum of agreement?\nA. No, I believe there was none, it was a verbal agreement between McDonald and Bell on behalf of the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company\u2014then there is some of Bell's own.\n\nQ. Was that subsequent to the other 500 tons?\nA. I could not say\u2014There was no contract made for that\u2014it was between myself and Major Bell.\n\nQ. Then you made the contract with Bell?\nA. The way of it was that Messrs. Beeston and Beecher had been up there, and they said what was the use of taking hay up there, that Major Bell had a lot of hay up there for sale. Of course I don't know to whom the hay belonged, whether it was Bell's or the Company's. I wired Bell \"have you baled hay for sale; wire quantity and price?\" He replied: \"Can supply 500 tons f. o. b. cars Whitewood, Wolseley, Indian Head, and have first-class hay, extra wires.\" I found out that we could get the hay there at a less rate than by buying it and sending it up. This was all the bargain-made.\n\nQ. Do you remember the price?\nA. $25 per ton, delivered there.\n\nQ. At Troy?\nA. Yes.\n\nCol. Peebles:\nQ. That was Bell himself with whom you engaged?\nA. Yes, it was Bell I had to do with, and the money was paid by cheque in his name.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. Were the accounts presented in Bell's name and the payments made direct to himself?\nA. I understood it was Bell's, apart from the Company. I understood it was his own private affair. The cheques were certainly made out in his name.\n\nQ. Do you know the amount paid to Bell altogether?\nA. Yes, it was $6652.50 in two cheques, one for $5902.50, the other was for $750.00.\n\nQ. How much do you owe them on that contract now?\nA. Nothing on that bargain, there is something due the Qu'Appelle Farming Co. $4585.75. We had nothing to do with it. The Hudson Bay Co. had no contract with the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company for that hay supply. They supplied it to the Government up there, and on requisition, but not through us.\n\nQ. Then the account should be sent here?\nA. Bell called upon me once and requested payment of this, and I told him to go here. (Brigade Office.)\n\nQ. How much hay has been paid for altogether between you and the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company?\n\nStatement produced and filed, Exhibit \"A\"\n\nQ. What is the meaning of Eberts and Bell?\nA. Bell was manager, two cheques were made payable to him here, and Eberts signed the vouchers. Part of the other payments were to Bell and part to the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company.\n\nQ. Do you know the date that the hay was delivered at Touchwood?\nA. I do not know. We refused payment of that.\n\nQ. On the order of Swinford, who requisitioned for that?\nQ. On whose order did you send for this hay?\nQ. Have you heard about bad hay being sent out?\nA. It was good when it was sent from here. I know where it came from?\n\nQ. Who was the sender of it?\nA. Shaw and Masterman.\n\nQ. They sold it here?\nA. Yes. It was good when it was shipped.\nQ. It was bad on the outside?\nA. It was bad weather then, and it would be apt to spoil, and the cars were shut up, and it lay there before it was unloaded. It is strange to say that this hay that was refused we had inspected here very particularly Anderson took a sample to show me at the office. It was not musty, but I have seen better hay; it was coarse and fresh looking when we opened it.\n\nQ. Do you know of any other contracts Bell was interested in?\nA. I do not.\n\nCol. Forrest:\nQ. Did you not get a bill or receipt to show whom you were paying?\nA. O, yes, we got a voucher. Eberts signed the voucher for receiving the money for Bell. Eberts stayed here, and he managed the business down here.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. Do you know that Bell had an interest in any teaming?\nA. I do not.\n\nQ. At what time do you think the price of teams hired by the day should have been reduced to $6.50 per day?\nA. Well, it is very hard to tell that. We thought it should have been three weeks after they went out. Commander Wrigley wired to the General and the Transportation Officer recommending that such should be done.\n\nCol. Forrest:\nQ. You think that teams could all have been procured at that price after that date?\nA. Yes; we got hundreds of teams for that. Of course the teams were getting very scarce after that. In fact there were 100, we didn't know at the time, came from the other side of the line.\n\nQ. Still the fact remains that you could get them for this price?\nA. Yes.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. Did you have a contract with Thomas Howard for anything?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Who were his partners?\nA. Sinclair and Flanagan, and Armit and Kelly.\n\nQ. Were there any other parties connected with any contract?\nA. I do not know of any.\n\nQ. Can you state any of the irregularities connected with the transport and supply service?\nA. I cannot.\n\nCol. Forrest:\nQ. When it was telegraphed about three weeks after the teams had been first sent out that the prices should be reduced, was Bell notified of this?\nA. It was the General and Transport Officer that Comr. Wrigley telegraphed to within 10 days of first shipment, and copies of telegrams were sent extra to the Minister. He said the better way would be to give these teams the preference, to make a new agreement at the new price at $6.50 per day. He got no reply from either. We were just as anxious to get the prices down as anybody.\n\nQ. The preference ought to be given at the same price?\nA. Yes, exactly.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. There were a number of teams hired at Qu'Appelle by Bell\u2014were they hired on behalf of your Company?\nA. Major Bell was requested by Comr. Wrigley to hire some teams on proper authority and to send a list of the same to McDonald, Qu'Appelle.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\nQ. Had Howard a contract direct himself?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you give a contract to one James Anderson for 100 teams?\nA. No.\n\nQ. Did Mr. Wrigley give him one?\nA. No, his name was never in any of our contracts.\n\nQ. Didn't he bring down an order from Comr. Wrigley's office to yours which you filled up to outsiders for 100 teams?\nA. No.\n\nEXHIBIT \"A\" IN CONNECTION WITH MR.

We want information from you, Mr. Blanchard, as to the action taken by the Transport Service in cancelling the contracts between the H. B. Co. and the Contractors. You had experience with these contracts?\n\nA. I was the Acting Solicitor for the H. B. Co., in connection with all their transport contracts for the Government, in connection with the Rebellion. A number of contracts had been made by them for the supply of teams, at a certain rate per day for a team. I received instructions from the Company, and also from Col. Whitehead, being the result of conferences between Col. Whitehead and Mr. Wrigley, to endeavor to have these contracts cancelled. They consisted of contracts with Thomas Howard, Armit & Kelly, Sinclair & Flannigan, Stewart & Earle. At this time the teams were in the field. My instructions were that the Government desired to have these contracts cancelled, so that they might introduce a different system of freighting, that is, a system by the hundred-weight, instead of paying teams so much per day. I examined the Company's contracts with these parties, and found that under the contracts they could only be cancelled by a return of the teams to the original place of shipment, or the place at which they have been hired by the Company, and I so advised the H. B. Co. Under the instructions from them, based upon my advice as Solicitor, I prepared contracts for cancellation between the Company and the parties I have mentioned. The contracts provided that if the owners of teams desired to re-engage either with the Government or any private individual, instead of going back to the place of shipment, that would be a return of the teams to the place of shipment, and that the Contractors would be allowed whatever profits they were making on these teams for a reasonable number of days, that would be consumed in the actual return of the teams in returning to the place of shipment.\n\nQ. Were the teamsters guaranteed that they would get their fare back free?\n\nA. Yes. It covered the transport. The contract I drew placed the Company's Contractors in that position that their contract stopped the day they signed that agreement, but in every other respect they were to be allowed as if they had returned. That was for the purpose of allowing them to re-engage. I prepared contracts filled in for the signatures of those whom I mentioned, and I took them personally to those of the Contractors who were there. I took them to Flannigan, Sinclair, to Kelly, of Armit & Kelly, to Stewart, of Stewart & Earle. I am not quite sure whether it was Stewart or Earl I took them to, my recollection is that it was Stewart. They all refused to sign, with the exception of one, Howard, who executed the contract or the agreement. It was about the day it was signed. The date on which I presented this was about the day that is mentioned in\nthe agreement with Captain Howard, which he executed. The contract of agreement signed by Capt. Howard is exactly the same draft as the agreement presented to the others. Capt. Howard executed the agreement, and I forwarded it to Col. Whitehead, and I then notified him in writing that the other parties had refused to sign, and in order to close their contracts, it would be necessary to send orders to the front to have all these teams returned to the place of shipment.\n\nQ. Was any inducement held out to Capt. Howard to sign this contract?\n\nA. I say, certainly not. I was acting all through for the H. B. Co., and was given to understand by Mr. Wrigley that I was acting for the Government as well, and was bound to look after the interests of the Government. I was acting to the best of my ability. I discussed the matter with Mr. Wrigley, from the Government standpoint, and he had informed me that the Company were, as I knew they were, practically the agents of the Government in the employment of these teams. I was acting from the beginning when I say I was to look after the interests of the Government in this matter. I may say that the legal business, and the whole of the payments made by the H. B. Co. on these contracts have been made by my own orders to the employees of the Company, Mr. Wrigley having stated that these payments were not to be made without my orders.\n\nCol. Forrest:\n\nQ. Where payments have been made covering the amount of money due the teamsters, have there a legal claim against the Company?\n\nA. I think the middle-men have,\u2014the contract shows this. The contract provides that these men are to supply teams. The contracts to which I refer were made by the H. B. Co. directly with the principal Contractors, and the contracts specify the rates at which the principal Contractors are to be paid. The H. B. Co. are bound to pay that amount, and it is quite immaterial whether these principal Contractors owned the teams themselves, or whether they gathered them together from the owners, and hired them from them, at a lesser money. But these contracts contain a clause by which the Company reserved to themselves the right to pay any owners of teams who may have been sub-contractors of the contractor at such prices as the Contractors may have agreed to pay the subcontractors. This was done with my knowledge and upon my advice, and upon the principle upon which a contract for a building is let, where the owner agrees to pay the contractor so much for the building, reserves the right to himself to pay the workmen. I have no doubt whatever of the liability of the Company to pay to the Contractors the full amount of the contract, and I have so advised them.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nNovember 25th, 1885.\n\nTHOMAS HOWARD, sworn.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nQ. What is your name, residence and occupation?\n\nA. Thomas Howard, I reside in Winnipeg, I am a forwarding and commission merchant.\n\nQ. Had you a contract from the Government to transport freight from Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford, last spring?\n\nA. I had.\n\nQ. With whom had you the first negotiations with reference to this contract?\n\nA. I made the contract with Major Bell. When I was at Ottawa, on or about the 25th of May, I received a telegram from my partner, stating that the contract I had with the H. B. Co. was cancelled. That was the contract I had for the furnishing of 75 teams made on or about the 11th of April. The first negotiations I had were with Col. Whitehead.\n\nQ. Where did these negotiations take place?\n\nA. Here.\nQ. At what date?\nA. On or about my return from Ottawa, on the 1st day of June. I believe I returned on the 31st of May. As I have already said I had this contract with the H. B. Co., and I returned purposely to find what was meant by cancelling my contract. When I returned on the 31st, I was told by Mr. Blanchard that the Company found it necessary to cancel their contracts with those they had made contracts with in April for the furnishing of teams.\n\nQ. State what took place at all interviews with Col. Whitehead in reference to this contract?\nA. The only interview with Col. Whitehead was that considering I had cancelled my contract, and knowing there was stuff to be moved from Saskatchewan Landing to the North, I applied to him for the contract; and he told me he had nothing to do with it, that the matter was in Major Bell's hands. It was early on the morning of the first of June, to the best of my knowledge, the day I relieved the H. B. Co. from their contract with me, that I saw Col. Whitehead.\n\nQ. That is, you released the contract on the 1st day of June?\nA. Yes, the 75 teams I had in my own name at $7 per day.\n\nQ. Did you not meet Col. Whitehead at the Manitoba Club in Winnipeg, and have interviews with him with reference to this contract?\nA. I certainly saw him there frequently. I don't know that I had any conversation with him regarding this contract particular.\n\nQ. You think not?\nA. I think not.\n\nQ. Were you not walking with Col. Whitehead behind the Manitoba Club late on the night of June 4th and negotiating with him in reference to this contract?\nA. No, I was not.\n\nQ. You had teams then hired through you to the Government?\nA. I had 75 teams in my own name, and I was interested in a contract with two men, one named Thomas Kelly, the other named James Flanagan, for 100 teams in addition.\n\nQ. At what date were these teams released?\nA. My own teams which I had power over I released on the morning of the first day of June. Mr. Blanchard put it in this light, he said the H. B. Co. had put themselves in a very awkward position indeed. It was solely on Mr. Wrigley's account I did this. They considered by my agreeing to do this they could get the consent of all the others to do the same thing. I therefore signed at once at my office, and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, it was on the 1st day of June I did this.\n\nQ. Was it not a part of the agreement that the Government could discharge the teams and return them to Winnipeg at any time?\nA. Yes, they were not discharged until their return here.\n\nQ. It was not necessary for the Government to give you a contract to discharge these teams to get rid of any obligation?\nA. Nothing of the kind. I did it solely on Mr. Blanchard's representation that hereby they could get the others to agree to the same thing.\n\nQ. At what date did you arrive at Saskatchewan Landing to take charge of this contract?\nA. I arrived on either the 10th or the 11th, either the Thursday or the Friday in that week. I was there either on the 10th or the 11th. I left here on the morning of Monday the 8th.\n\nQ. When you got there did you not find a number of teams there ready to do this work, already transported to that point by the Government at the cost of the Government?\nA. I found a number of teams there. I had the contract when I left here to move that freight.\n\nQ. How were the teams got there?\nA. I can tell you. I undertook this contract simply because I had teams at my disposal. At the time I took this contract I had contracted with the Government to move from Medicine Hat via Swift Current one hundred tons of supplies for the North West Mounted Police. Considering that I had relinquished any claim I had in the\nH. B. Co. I think I was perfectly justified in using every endeavor to get this contract for moving supplies to the North. And I therefore applied to Col. Whitehead for the contract to move these. He told me that the matter was entirely in Major Bell's hand, and I, on the night of the 1st, or the morning of the 2nd, wrote a private letter to Bell, offering to move the supplies at $125 per ton. At that time, having released my teams, I knew that I would have at Saskatchewan Landing probably upwards of 75, and when I undertook to take this contract my intention was to make use of these teams I had already in the H. B. Co.'s contract when I arrived at Saskatchewan Landing. I may further say at that time I was supposing that the ferry was in working order on the South Saskatchewan Landing. When I arrived there I found that the day before, either the 9th or the 10th, the ferry had been carried away, and up to the time I left it hadn't been replaced. I found teams on the south bank of the river which I made use of moving the supplies to the north, but who sent them there I knew nothing of; I don't know how they got there.\n\nQ. Do you know who hired these teams and sent them there?\nA. I heard that Major Bell had sent them there.\n\nQ. Have you any doubts about that?\nA. I can't say; I could not tell you the exact number of teams that were there.\n\nQ. Had Bell told you that he had sent them there?\nA. No, I heard from gentlemen that were out there\u2014Mr. McQueen and others.\n\nQ. Whom did you find in charge of the teams there? Was it not one Jones from Major Bell's office at Qu'Appelle?\nA. I found Mr. Jones.\n\nQ. Who was Mr. Jones?\nA. When I undertook the contract Bell informed me that until the contract had been awarded he sent Jones up there to look after the interests of the Government.\n\nQ. How many tons of freight had been shipped by Jones?\nA. Between 90 and 100 tons. Some of it was still on the south bank of the river when I got there; they had been loaded, but hadn't left, the ferry being down. Ten or twelve tons might have been still on the south bank.\n\nQ. In whose names were the shipping bills made of this freight, was it not in Bell & Lewis's name; if not, in whose name was it shipped?\nA. In Jones' name. No, it was not in Bell & Lewis' name. My understanding with Bell was that any freight shipped was to be included in my contract. The originals of these bills can be seen. They were in Jones' name.\n\nQ. In your settlement with the Government did you get pay for what Jones had shipped?\nA. In the settlement, yes; the accounts came when I was in the West.\n\nQ. Did you not sublet some of your freighting under this contract?\nA. No. A man named Timms freighted some to the same place as the others; he was not a subcontractor. He had so many carts for which he was responsible. He is in the habit of freighting, and he had thirty or forty carts; he was a Government freighter, and I paid him at the same rate.\n\nQ. You had no sub-contracts then?\nA. None whatever.\n\nQ. Produce your contract, if in writing.\n(Original produced and compared with copy).\n\nQ. Your contract was $125 per ton, was it not? Government to feed men, pay ferriage, transportation of teams, and if the Government was to feed the teams you were to abate $10 per ton?\nA. I had to pay ferriage. I am at a law-suit with the ferry-man at the Landing; I had to pay him. My ferriage is not mentioned at all. I had to pay that myself, which I have done.\n\nQ. The Government was to feed the men?\nA. Yes, in this contract. $10 per ton was to be deducted if I had the teams fed by the Government.\n\nQ. Are you aware that the feeding of these teams cost more than $10?\nA. I don't see why that should be, as certainly fully 110 teams out of the number were ox-teams, and some of them carried 3500 pounds; that would be $17.50.\n\nQ. How many days would a trip take?\n\nA. I don't think they average over 12 days for the round trip after they crossed the river.\n\nQ. Would it not cost double this amount?\n\nA. I should not think so. Ox-teams don't require that much, what they got was principally this chopped feed, and the grass in June was very good. The majority of them took over 3000 pounds and 110 were ox-teams.\n\nQ. The teams that you hired at $4.50 per day were bound to make the trip to Battleford and return in a certain number of days; if so, state the number of days?\n\nA. I didn't hire any teams whatever by the day. I paid them 3\u00bd cents per pound. I moved it by the pound and paid the teams' ferryage.\n\nQ. While the ferry was broken and teams idle to whom was this fee charged?\n\nA. I cannot tell. I certainly rendered valuable service to the Government in that case. To enable me to carry out my contract with the Mounted Police, I had procured from The North West Coal and Navigation Company one of their barges, by which I could have removed all the stuff from the south to the north bank of the river to go with my teams that were on the south bank, and move all the stuff to Battleford within very much less time than I did it. But, owing to the fact that a large outfit returning from the north (Lejeune's outfit returning from the north, numbering, I believe, between 150 and 175 teams) were prevented crossing from the north to the south bank unless this barge of mine was made use of, I relinquished my claim to the barge, and handed it over to the Transport Officer there. Had I not done so I consider the Government would have been put to an enormous expense. This prevented me from moving the supplies I undertook to move, in what may be considered reasonable time; but, under any circumstances, a large saving was made to the Government.\n\nQ. Do you know the number of days it took for the round trip on your contract?\n\nA. A number did it in eleven days from the time they got across the river, with a crossing time about fourteen days.\n\nQ. You are aware that John Stewart was given the same contract by Gen. Laurie and approved of by Col. Whitehead about 30th May?\n\nA. No, it was never approved of by him. I never knew anything of it.\n\nQ. Did you get your contract by tendering pursuant to an advertisement for tenders then in the papers?\n\nA. No, I wrote to Bell on the morning of the 2nd. Whitehead told me I had to get it from Bell. The matter was entirely in Bell's hands; and at the time I made an offer to him in a private letter.\n\nQ. Were you the only person interested in this contract, if not, who else were interested with you, and who got the benefit of the profits, if any?\n\nA. I was the only person interested, and I have never paid $1 to any one else.\n\nQ. Were you not formerly from Montreal, and did you not know Col. Whitehead there before he came here?\n\nA. Certainly, I have known him all my life.\n\nQ. Have you any interest or connection with the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company, if so, state what it is?\n\nA. I am a stock-holder and Vice-President of the Company.\n\nQ. Is Major Bell interested, if so, state how and what his position is?\n\nA. He is a stock-holder and Manager as well.\n\nQ. You had no difficulty in getting your pay, had you?\n\nA. Well, I was not here, I was West, looking after my other work. I think there was no difficulty.\n\nQ. Who certified to your accounts and recommended payment?\n\nA. Mr. Wright, my partner, got the accounts paid, and I have never seen them. I can't say who certified to them.\n\nQ. Did Colonel Whitehead or any one else inform you that there was some difficulty at Ottawa in respect to your contract?\n\nA. No.\nQ. How many teams had you freighting from Saskatchewan Landing?\nA. About 189; that is what I was willing to allow the ferryman ferriage of; he claims for more.\n\nQ. Were those the teams you had previously working by the day on the Qu'Appelle trail?\nA. Some of them were. A large portion of the 189 came down from Battleford.\n\nQ. How many do you think came from Qu'Appelle?\nA. I can't tell you. In this Lejeune outfit there was a lot of my teams which I intended to make use of, but I found teams on the south side of the river, and I took these instead of the Battleford teams.\n\nQ. Can't you tell us the number of the original teams?\nA. There were not a great many. I thought I would have nearly 600 tons of stuff to move. I employed many that I had to dismiss and pay for their time.\n\nQ. How were they taken to Swift Current; on what day did they leave Qu'Appelle?\nA. I found them there on the 10th or the 11th.\n\nQ. Were they drawing pay by the day until they commenced the tonnage system?\nA. Yes, until they were discharged on the 2nd of June, when they returned. When they came from the North they were discharged on the 2nd or 3rd of June. They were paid to the 2nd of June. The contract was to cease on the first day of June.\n\nQ. Give names of all persons who did receive, or who are to receive, a share of the profits, commission, bonus, gratuity, or otherwise?\nA. I know of no person; there is none. Of course I had two or three men employed whom I paid for their services.\n\nQ. Did you promise a consideration in any form to any person in order to secure the contract?\nA. I did not.\n\nQ. Were the teams on the north side of the Saskatchewan drawing pay by the day from the Government while freighting by the ton?\nA. They were, till I employed them. I employed a lot of these men on my own contract. I paid these men, and they were allowed to the time they would get to Swift Current.\n\nQ. Did the original contractors of teams by the day continue to draw their profits on the teams from the Government after the tonnage system was adopted? You think it is probable that these teams would have been drawing by the day and at the same time carrying freight by the ton for contractors?\nA. I never gave a man a load until I saw his discharge signed by Mr. Arkell. And in the case of this man Kelly, he wanted his teams loaded, and I would not load them until I saw his agreement signed by the H. B. Co. I did not employ one team except on my own contract of 75 teams, so there could be no difficulty whatever. I never loaded a man's team till he showed his discharge signed by Mr. Arkell. I didn't employ one of them more than those who were in my own contract. I knew well that Armit & Kelly didn't sign this lease, and I didn't employ one of the men who didn't show their discharge.\n\nQ. Who paid the teamsters that took the stores receipted for by James Rutherford and W. E. Jones, previous to your arrival to take charge of the contract?\nA. I paid every teamster and held the individual receipt of each teamster for this service.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nD. H. McMillan, Merchant Miller, Winnipeg, sworn.\n\nColonel Jackson:\n\nQ. Were you at Qu'Appelle during the late Rebellion, and what position did you occupy?\nA. Yes; I was at Qu'Appelle. I was second in command of the Ninety-first.\n\nQ. What do you know about frozen wheat said to have been mixed with the oats, and by whom was it delivered?\nA. I know nothing about that.\n\nQ. Did you ever examine the oats there?\n\nA. No, never. I saw oats fed to my horse; there was more or less wheat mixed with these oats; you frequently find this in the oats delivered in the city.\n\nQ. How much would the oats be depreciated in value for feed?\n\nA. Well, if they do not injure the horses any they don't depreciate in value, the wheat is nearly as strong as the oats. It is considered dangerous to feed horses with wheat.\n\nQ. Do you think there was sufficient wheat mixed to do that?\n\nA. No, I do not.\n\nColonel Forrest:\n\nQ. You don't know anything at all about a lot of frozen wheat delivered in Qu'Appelle on some of the contracts?\n\nA. No, I don't know anything about that myself.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nNovember 25, 1885.\n\nALEXANDER McQUEEN, sworn.\n\nColonel Jackson:\n\nQ. What is your occupation, and where do you reside?\n\nA. I am Inspector of Fisheries; I live in Winnipeg.\n\nQ. Were you employed in the Transport Service during the Rebellion?\n\nA. No, I was Supply Officer at Saskatchewan Landing and the Elbow.\n\nQ. You were shipping clerk at Saskatchewan Landing when Jones and Captain Howard were forwarding freight?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. How many tons were shipped under Jones' management?\n\nA. About 100 tons before Captain Howard arrived; perhaps a little more.\n\nQ. In whose name were the shipping bills made out?\n\nA. They were all made out in Captain Howard's name.\n\nQ. Were you there before Jones?\n\nA. No, I was a day later than he was. I was sent up by Captain Swinford to Swift Current.\n\nQ. Were not a number of teams lying idle there at Government expense, both as to wages and feed, for want of instructions before Jones arrived?\n\nA. I don't know. There were teams there, but I don't know whether they were at Government expense or not.\n\nQ. Did Mr. Jones explain to you why he was suspended?\n\nA. No, he gave no explanation.\n\nQ. State everything you know in regard to shipping from this point?\n\nA. When I got there, there was a lot of stuff on the bank of the river in the weather, and I tried my best to get it away as quickly as possible. The ferry about the second day gave way, and we had a lot of trouble in getting the stuff away. Much of it was taken across in small flat boats. In about 17 or 18 days work we got it across.\n\nQ. Can you give us the date you commenced up there?\n\nA. I think it was about the 20th of May. I don't recollect exactly. I went first to the Elbow of the South Saskatchewan. I can't give the date I went to Saskatchewan Landing.\n\nQ. Was it the first or second of June?\n\nA. It was between the first and the twenty-first of June, I can't say exactly.\n\nQ. Do you know of any teams being shipped to Qu'Appelle at that time from Swift Current?\n\nA. I heard there were some, but I don't know the number.\n\nQ. Who gave the teams their time notes or cards at Swift Current when they returned from the north and were discharged?\n\nA. I think it was Mr. White.\nQ. Was it possible for those teams that were hired by the day to also draw pay from the Government on the new system?\nA. I can't say that; it might have been.\n\nQ. Do you think those teams Howard was using could have been drawing pay in that way?\nA. There may have been some of them; we offered him some of them, and he didn't take the number offered.\n\nQ. Were the 100 tons moved forward by teams paid by the Government?\nA. I don't know whether they were or not. I think the teams Jones engaged were his own. I suppose, in fact, that he was doing the work for Howard; when he was doing it I didn't know it was for Howard.\n\nQ. Did you suppose Jones had a contract?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Did Jones tell you he had it?\nA. Yes, but he did not show me any authority for it, and I could not tell till I saw the authority.\n\nQ. What contractor received payment for removing those 100 tons?\nA. I don't know; I certified to the number of tons shipped. I suppose he and Howard.\n\nQ. Were the teams brought up from Qu'Appelle at Government expense for Jones or Howard's contract?\nA. I don't know. They were landed at Swift Current and driven into the Landing.\n\nQ. Do you know who composed the firm of Bell, Lewis & Co.?\nA. No, I do not.\n\nQ. Did you see any hay down there that had been shipped out. What was the quality of it?\nA. I didn't consider it was good quality of hay, but the horses were using it.\n\nQ. Was there an over-abundance of it?\nA. Yes, more than the horses required.\n\nQ. Was there any waste?\nA. There wasn't much waste.\n\nQ. How far did you go at this time or subsequently?\nA. In connection with the Supply office I didn't go any further.\n\nQ. Was there a large quantity of hay there?\nA. No, there wasn't a large quantity. There were a few tons at the Landing, none at all at the Elbow.\n\nQ. Who purchased hay at Qu'Appelle?\nA. I don't know at the time. I was there a couple of weeks, when I came back.\n\nQ. You were in the Supply office then?\nA. Yes, with Major Rickart.\n\nQ. Who received the hay at Troy?\nA. It was all over at that time. That was in July. After coming back from Swift Current, I was a couple of weeks at Troy.\n\nQ. Do you know anything about Stewart's contract from Saskatchewan Landing to Clarke's Crossing?\nA. I do not.\n\nQ. Do you know of any irregularities in connection with the Transport and Supply Departments?\nA. No; I saw everybody try to do the best they could to try and rush the thing through.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\nDecember 2nd, 1885.\n\nW. E. JONES, sworn.\n\nColonel Jackson:\nQ. We have asked you to come here to give us some information in regard to the Transport Service. You reside at Qu'Appelle?\nA. Yes, at Qu'Appelle Station.\n\nQ. What position did you occupy during the Rebellion?\n\nA. I was Chief Transport Clerk. I was appointed by Mr. Bedson, Chief Transport Officer, and served directly under him, and also under Transport Officer Bell, at the Base.\n\nQ. Where were you stationed during the Rebellion?\n\nA. Chiefly at Qu'Appelle Station. I have acted at Moosejaw, Swift Current, and Saskatchewan Landing.\n\nQ. What did you go to Saskatchewan Landing for?\n\nA. To forward goods there. Goods had been delayed and complaints had been made about it, and the Government was anxious to move it at once, and I was sent to start the thing and get the supplies moved as quickly as possible. There was a good deal of conflicting between General Laurie and Mr. White.\n\nQ. How were the goods being shipped then?\n\nA. By contract. Captain Howard was the contractor.\n\nQ. What date?\n\nA. I think I left about the 3rd of June.\n\nQ. Then you would reach there when?\n\nA. I would be there on the 4th.\n\nQ. When you left Qu'Appelle was it an understanding that Howard was a contractor?\n\nA. Well, no. No one knew who was the contractor. I was sent there to get that stuff moved. I was given carte blanche.\n\nQ. How many teams did you take up there?\n\nA. There were no teams went up when I did; I don't know how many were sent up there afterwards.\n\nQ. Can't you give us some idea of the number?\n\nA. There might have been fifty.\n\nQ. Who were those teams sent to?\n\nA. To me.\n\nQ. Then those teams were to go on the tonnage system?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Then who would receive remuneration for them if they were sent to you?\n\nA. That was not arranged yet.\n\nQ. When you went there I understand it was to assume the responsibilities of the contract?\n\nA. No, I could not assume the responsibilities, for I had no contract.\n\nQ. What was the understanding with Major Bell?\n\nA. That I would go there and start that stuff, and get things moving, as they were suffering loss through exposure.\n\nQ. Was there any understanding that the contract should be so arranged that you would have a portion of the profits?\n\nA. Well, it was this way: Bell said, \"Jones you are deserving, and if I can do something for you I will, and if I can arrange anything for you I will do it.\" I felt that if I could get a contract I would be very glad, to resign my position and take it.\n\nB. What portion was Bell to receive?\n\nA. None; he simply said that I had worked hard and deserved something.\n\nQ. How many days did you continue shipping goods?\n\nA. I must have started to load up on the 6th; and I continued till Captain Howard came up and told me he had the contract.\n\nQ. Well, then, what did you do with the quantities you had shipped?\n\nA. I turned the stuff over to him, the vouchers and everything; in fact, I don't know how the stuff was shipped\u2014it was simply a mistake of it being shipped in my name\u2014I relinquished everything to him.\n\nQ. What consideration did you receive for handing over those papers?\n\nA. Well, none. I have been doing the work as a Transport Officer.\n\nQ. Did you utilize any teams other than those sent from Qu'Appelle?\nA. Yes, the teams had been lying there for a long time, and no decision could be arrived at. I met these teamsters and told them they would be paid $3.50 a hundred pounds. They consulted among themselves a short time, and accepted it, started that night, part of them, to the Landing, and the balance followed next day, that would be the fifth.\n\nQ. Then, if you made that arrangement as a Transport Officer, that would be the price the Government would have to pay?\n\nA. I made this arrangement as I had carte blanche to do as I liked, but get this stuff moved. Now I had given no thought about a contract. Bell had told me that whatever I did would be recognized; that bargain was made, and Bell, as a Transport Officer, would have to see what these men were paid. I didn't know who the contractor was.\n\nColonel Jackson:\u2014Produces shipping bills of this transaction and showing them to witness.\n\nQ. When was this put in, this addition in red ink?\n\nA. I could not say.\n\nColonel Forrest:\u2014\n\nQ. What date did you make the contract with these teamsters? Was it the first day you went up?\n\nA. Yes, I think on the 4th; I met the men, and was acting under instructions not to waste one moment, but get the things started at once. I made a very good arrangement, indeed.\n\nColonel Jackson:\u2014\n\nQ. Is that all you know about this Saskatchewan Landing business?\n\nA. It is not all I know, because I know everything. I remained there only a few days.\n\nQ. Did you return to Qu'Appelle from there?\n\nA. Yes, to Qu'Appelle Station. The stuff was being moved after a great difficulty; the ferry broke down, and an enormous amount of stuff was taken across the river. We made use of a barge which had been hauled up the river by teams.\n\nColonel Forrest:\u2014\n\nQ. Did Major Bell know on the 4th of June that you had made a contract with the teamsters for 3\u00bd cents per ton?\n\nA. I don't know whether he did or not. I don't think I telegraphed anything at all to him about it. It would be a very likely thing for me to do. I must have let him know shortly afterwards.\n\nQ. About when?\n\nA. I don't know when.\n\nQ. He must have got information from somebody?\n\nA. Perhaps any information he got was through Swinford, the Supply Officer.\n\nQ. If Bell sent you there on a special object it would be natural for him to be informed of it?\n\nA. Yes. Perhaps I did inform him, but I can't state that I sat down and wrote a telegram stating that I had made these arrangements, and dispatched it to him.\n\nCol. Jackson:\u2014\n\nQ. Had you been at Moosejaw previously?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. At what date?\n\nA. It must have been a fortnight or three weeks after this, about in the middle of May, some time about that.\n\nQ. Did any person go up with you?\n\nA. Yes, Capt. Swinford sent the acting Supply Officer.\n\nQ. Who took up the forms for the shipping bills?\n\nA. I think McQueen did.\n\nQ. Whose name were they shipped in at that time?\n\nA. John Stewart's name.\nQ. The whole of it?\nA. Yes. I am quite sure of it. As far as any shipments I made, I was acting under the orders of Bedson to ship 91 tons of stuff from there to the Elbow, so as to meet the steamer which was bringing up the wounded from the hospital at Moosejaw. The great difficulty was to get anything done between Gen. Laurie and his Transport Officer White. They did nothing; and when I went up there I was interfered with until I said that if they interfered with me the responsibility would fall upon them and I would report to Bedson. After a great difficulty, Laurie wanted to interfere and sent this steamer to some other place. I was sent up there with positive orders to pay no attention to Laurie or anyone else.\n\nQ. Stewart was the contractor?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Were not some of those bills filled in with red ink as \"Bell, Lewis & Co., contractors\"?\nA. I don't think so\u2014in fact, I am positive; all I saw was shipped in Stewart's name, as contractor. I never saw Bell, Lewis, Yates & Co. until I saw them at Qu'Appelle Station.\n\nQ. Do you know of an attempt to amalgamate the different contracts?\nA. No, I know nothing about that, directly or indirectly.\nQ. Was there an effort made to supersede Stewart?\nA. Not that I know of.\nQ. Did you judge so from the appearance of the work going on?\nA. No. Stewart, at the time I was there, was everything, and seemed to work it all right.\n\nQ. What date was that?\nA. About the middle of May.\nQ. Was it about the Queen's Birthday?\nA. I could not be sure. There was no celebration out there, we were too busy.\nQ. There was some sort of celebration of the 24th at Moosejaw, was there not?\nA. Yes; I was there that day.\nQ. Had you been there many days?\nA. No, only four or five days; Mr. McQueen went with those teams to transfer that stuff to the steamer, and get the receipts for the goods from the Officer on board.\n\nQ. Do you know who composed the firm of Bell, Lewis & Co., freighters?\nA. No, I do not.\nQ. Was Major Bell interested in the matter?\nA. I do not know.\nQ. Would you infer so from the manner in which he engaged teams?\nA. No.\nQ. Did you engage teams for them?\nA. No.\nQ. Who engaged them?\nA. I don't know; I was not there at the time; I was at Saskatchewan Landing or Moose Jaw.\n\nQ. You were there subsequently?\nA. I found Fox there on my return.\nQ. Did not Fox go there after you returned?\nA. No, I found him there off my return.\nQ. Then you did not engage any teams?\nA. No, I did not engage any teams for the Contractors at Qu'Appelle Station.\nQ. Did you not engage some for Bell at the reduced rate of $4.50 per day?\nA. No; I did not engage any for Bell.\nQ. Do you know anything about the hay that was there?\nA. Yes, I used to receive it; up to a certain date we received it, and after that the Supply Officer received it; they received all stuff of every kind and the car load was just turned over and we shipped it.\n\nQ. Who measured the hay there?\nA. I did, and the clerks in the office.\n\nQ. Did you see any of the hay shipped by Bell, Lewis & Co., under their contract?\n\nA. Yes, all hay I saw was good hay.\n\nQ. What quality was it?\n\nA. I considered it good indeed.\n\nQ. Was there anything that might be called bad, rotten?\n\nA. Yes, it was refused.\n\nQ. What was done with it?\n\nA. The C.P.R. hold it for freight.\n\nQ. But, independent of that?\n\nA. There might have been, yes, a car load arrived that was heated, and it was taken out immediately, and the hay got all right again, but not more than one car. It came from the east, some place near Wolsely. It was done up in very large bundles, weighing about 300 lbs. each.\n\nQ. Did you know that any of the hay shipped turned out bad?\n\nA. I know of no hay that was bad when it was shipped.\n\nQ. How were the rations and forage supplied Bell, Lewis & Co. distributed along the line?\n\nA. They were given their rations, forage and oats at the base, and they had to carry them for the trip.\n\nQ. You are positive of that?\n\nA. Yes, I remember the men having such a row about having to carry such an enormous quantity of rations.\n\nQ. What do you mean about the \"trip\"?\n\nA. The round trip, to Clarke's Crossing and back. I have forgotten the number of days it took. I was speaking about the Qu'Appelle contract. There were between each station and depots a certain number of teams; and the team that went from Qu'Appelle Station to Troy returned next day, and the very of teams went on to the next station, Howard, and returned, and then to Touchwood, and returned. There was a good deal of stuff at Touchwood, and a good deal at Swinford and the next station; and the teams were not withdrawn from there, but kept moving supplies from the base. There was nothing left on the trail at all, excepting at Fort Qu'Appelle, and some at Touchwood, under the direction of the officer commanding the 91st.\n\nQ. Is it not a fact that Bell, Lewis & Co.'s teams took oats at Qu'Appelle, and carried them to Fort Qu'Appelle, and then took sufficient at Fort Qu'Appelle for Touchwood?\n\nA. I know they never did such a thing. They took their oats from the commencement of the base, and carried them through. They dropped them at different points for their return.\n\nQ. Did you go over the trail?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Then you really have no personal knowledge of what was done out there?\n\nA. No, but the depot clerks worked under my direction, and I got a report of the movements of all stuff during the day, stuff that arrived and stuff that left. By the telegraph service we could keep track of all the movements of the teams. It was my business to look after the working of these depots, and there was a man specially appointed to see that the depots were cleared up.\n\nQ. What time was that?\n\nA. Just when the contracts were let to Bell, Lewis & Co.\n\nQ. Who was in charge of that special work?\n\nA. John Wood.\n\nQ. What time did he finish that?\n\nA. I don't know; he returned about the time the contract was let to Bell, Lewis & Co., and went to the Rocky Mountains. He was superintendent on the line. Afterwards he was employed by the Contractors, and went up with one of their convoys, so that he was no longer than the time I speak of. After cleaning up the trail, he was employed to go with a convoy of eighty or one hundred teams.\n\nQ. Was there not a lot of stuff to clear up after the campaign was over?\nA. Yes, at Qu'Appelle, but that we turned over to the Supply Officer at once.\n\nQ. What do you know about the moving of the 7th from Clarke's Crossing to Moosejaw?\n\nA. I know nothing about that; I believe there were teams sent out for the purpose, but it did not come under me directly.\n\nCol. Forrest:\n\nQ. When you went to Swift Current you went expecting to be a contractor?\n\nA. Well, I did; in the first place, I was sent there, and Bell says to me, you have worked hard, and if I can get this contract for you, I will. The first thing I knew of it was, that Capt. Howard had it.\n\nCol. Peebles:\n\nQ. When you went up there what position were you in?\n\nA. I was Chief Transport Officer.\n\nQ. How could you have a contract, then?\n\nA. If I had a contract, I would have had to resign.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\n\nQ. Had James Anderson any conversations with you about the irregularities of the Transport or the Supply Departments, if so, state what transpired?\n\nA. I hadn't much to do with Anderson, except in one instance, when I was told by Crawford that Anderson was a dangerous man, he was hanging around, picking information out of the messengers and stable-men about the work. I met Anderson in Oesler's office, and I turned on him and told him that if he wanted any information in regard to the Transport office, he had better come to the office, I would not allow him to go round interviewing messengers and stable-men. He got into a rage about this, and I told him my mind. That is the only interview. He seems very unfortunate in having very few friends.\n\nQ. Had you any conversation with Col. Forrest, in regard to this matter, the irregularities of the Transport and Supply Service?\n\nA. No, I cannot say I had. I appealed to him in everything up there.\n\nQ. While you were stationed there did you see any irregularities there?\n\nA. No, I did not. To the best of my knowledge and belief, I never saw anyone work harder than those clerks, and everybody else, at Qu'Appelle Station.\n\nDecember 3rd, 1885.\n\nWm. E. Jones' evidence continued.\n\nCol. Jackson:\n\nWe wish you to ask you a few more questions in regard to the Transport Service,\u2014you understand you are still on your oath?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. You stated yesterday that you were at Moosejaw on the Queen's Birthday?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. How many days did you remain there afterwards?\n\nA. I could not tell, I do not think more than four or five.\n\nQ. Then where did you go?\n\nA. I returned to Qu'Appelle.\n\nQ. What date did you go to Swift Current?\n\nA. About the 3rd of June.\n\nQ. Was it as late as that?\n\nA. Yes, I know it was the 3rd of the month of June I was there.\n\nQ. When you got there?\n\nA. No, when I started.\n\nQ. What day of the week did you reach there?\n\nA. I could not answer that.\n\nQ. How long does it take to go to Qu'Appelle?\n\nA. About twelve hours.\n\nQ. What time had you made the arrangement about the freighting, with those teams?\nA. Right afterwards, I went up and made the arrangements at once, at $3.50, on the 4th. I commenced loading them the day after I made the bargain with them, and went out with them.\n\nQ. Before you went, whom did you report to?\nA. I reported to no one.\n\nQ. That was something irregular?\nA. No, not for me, in my position\u2014I had the confidence of the Transport Officer.\n\nQ. Was it understood what price you were to pay the teams, before you left Qu'Appelle?\nA. No, it was left with me; the figures were spoken of, but I was told 3\u00bd cents per lb.; it was understood that, if I could get teams at $4.50 per day, or $3.50 per cwt., I was to do the best I could, not to lose a day. This governed me in my actions.\n\nQ. Then, as an officer of the Government, of the Militia Department, that price you made, ought not that to have been the price the Department should have paid for this service?\nA. I would not be prepared to answer that.\n\nCol. Peebles:\nQ. About the 6th would be the day you took the first load?\nA. Yes, about the 6th.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. Had Rutherford shipped any before you went there?\nA. No, I would not like to say anything about Rutherford's movements; I may state that there had been nothing shipped there for some time previous to my going there, although there were a number of teams doing nothing there.\n\nQ. Then this shipment made by Rutherford about the 6th of June, would be the first shipment made?\nA. Yes.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\nDecember 3rd, 1885.\n\nWm. Bain Scarth, sworn.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nWe have asked you to come here to throw some light upon statements made about the Transport and Supply Departments.\n\nQ. What is your occupation, Mr. Scarth?\nA. I am Managing Director of the Canada North West Land Company.\n\nCol. Whitehead:\nQ. Do you know James Anderson?\nA. I do.\n\nQ. Had you a conversation with James Anderson in reference to articles which appeared in the Winnipeg Free Press, if so, state what took place?\nA. Yes I had such a conversation. I told Mr. Anderson that he was accused of having given the information to the Winnipeg Free Press upon which certain articles in it were based; he said it was not true, that he did not give any information to the Free Press, whatever.\n\nCol. Forrest:\nQ. Do you know what date that was?\nA. I cannot tell the exact date, it is probably three or four weeks ago.\n\nQ. It is since the articles appeared in the paper?\nA. Oh yes.\n\nCol. Peebles:\nQ. Since the last article?\nA. Yes.\n\nCol. Jackson:\nQ. Do you know anything about the contracts for freighting?\nA. No.\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT OF THE WAR CLAIMS COMMISSION TO THEIR REPORT DATED WINNIPEG DECEMBER 5TH, 1885.\n\nFor consideration of the Honorable the Minister of Militia and Defence.\n\nTwo of the Commissioners having taken the evidence of John L. Lewis, under oath, at Ottawa, and submitted the same for the consideration of the third Commissioner, find the facts elicited are not sufficient to make any change in the original report. The evidence is therefore submitted to be attached to the previous papers.\n\nOTTAWA, January 23, 1886.\n\nW. H. JACKSON, Lt.-Col., D. A. G., Chairman.\nW. H. FORREST, Lt.-Col., Member.\nA. PEEBLES, Lt. Col., Member.\n\nEDMUND B. HOLT,\nSecretary.\n\nOTTAWA, Monday, 11th January, 1886.\n\nDEPOSITION of John L. Lewis, Managing Director of Dominion Coal and Coke Co., residing at Lachine, Q., under oath:\n\nI am one of the firm of Bell, Lewis & Co., who had a contract with the Government for freighting from Qu'Appelle northwards; I also expected to have had the contract from Moosejaw.\n\nMajor W. R. Bell was the only partner with me in the contract, and it was through his explanations of the matter that I was induced to undertake the said contract.\n\nFor a short period a few teams were hired for the service at $3.50 per day, but the average price paid was about $4.50, which was price first paid.\n\nCol. Whitehead and I were old friends in Montreal, and I should think that, all other things being equal, he would have no objections to my getting the contract.\n\nHad the contract gone on as contemplated I should have considered Major Bell, entitled to half the profits.\n\nThere was no mention whatever of any share being given to Col. Whitehead.\n\nI am not aware that Col. Whitehead was led to believe the contract was being given to Bell, Lewis, Yates & Walsh.\n\nI claim all the profits of the contract personally, and I hold the money arising out of it.\n\nI have not paid anything to Major W. R. Bell, nor is there any understanding that I will do so.\n\nI gave Bell some cheques. All monies and cheques that I gave him were outside of this contract altogether, and were for purchase of stock from Northwood, and other matters not at all connected with the contract. A $9,000 cheque given to Mr. Blanchard for Bell was returned to me, the transaction for which it was given not having been carried out.\n\nI took a large amount of money East with me, but none of it was expended in Montreal.\n\nWhen I went to Qu'Appelle, shortly after the contract was entered into, Bell stated that he found, owing to the position he occupied as Transport Officer, he could not be a contractor also, and said he must withdraw and wash his hands of the whole thing; that I could either continue alone, or give it up, just as I pleased.\n\nI solemnly state that no portion of the profits arising out of this contract has been promised to any one whatsoever.\n\nThe whole details of receipts to, and payments in connection with this contract appear in a small account book, separate from the affairs of the firm of which I am\na member; and if there is any discrepancy, it is merely a mistake, and not with the intention of concealing anything.\n\nJOHN L. LEWIS.\n\nREPORT No. 87.\nOTTAWA, 9th January, 1886.\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nREPORT.\n\nFor consideration of the Honorable the MINISTER OF MILITIA AND DEFENCE.\n\nW. C. Nos. 646 and 645, 141 and 6.\u2014W. R. Bell, for travelling expenses, $208.30; hay delivered at Touchwood and Fort Qu'Appelle, $1583.75; hay account, 27th May, $927.50; hire of ponies and carts, teams, &c., $2850; in all, $5569.55.\n\nMajor Bell, having accepted the position of Transport Officer at the base, viz., Qu'Appelle, exceeded his duty by entering into a contract for a quantity of hay with the Hudson's Bay Co., who were agents for the Government: it is therefore submitted that Major Bell be called to account for the difference between the cost price of the said hay and the price charged to the Government, viz.: $7030. The Commission allowing the ample price of $15 per ton for the hay.\n\nWith regard to the account for teaming, the Commission deduct $2 per day from the 1st May for all teams supplied the Transport Service, taking off $430, as Major Bell should have charged his teams at a price similar to that received by others. Total deduction, $7460. The statement underneath gives details of Debits and Credits, and as the Debits exceed the Credits, Major Bell should be called upon to refund the difference, viz., $1890.45.\n\nDEBITS.\n\nTo overcharge on 703 tons hay purchased by Major Bell whilst he was under pay as a Staff Officer, at prices not exceeding $15 per ton and for which the Department have paid about $25 per ton; overcharge, $10 per ton........................................$7,030.00\n\nTo overcharge on personal teams in May, 1885, vide Transport account paid by H.

Nos. 6 and 7.\u2014Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co., for teaming, $9470 and $5110; in all, $14,580. These claims for hire of teams at $10 per day have been under consideration by the Commission for some time, the latter claim being reduced to $2260, by taking off $2850 for services of teams being the private property of W. R. Bell, as sworn to by W. L. Boyle, President, and W. R. Bell, Manager of the Company, leaving the total claim $11,730.\n\nAfter having heard evidence under oath, and consulted telegrams from S. L. Bedson (Chief Transport Officer) to W. R. Bell, dated April 8th, 1885, directing that not more than $8 per day shall be paid, and from the fact that the price of teams had been reduced to $6 and $6.50 per day from about the 8th or 10th April. The Commission are of opinion the rate per day for all teams supplied by this Company should be reduced to $8 from and after the 1st May, thus allowing 22 days to effect the change.\n\nThe Commission could only recommend this high rate on the presumption that the teams were exceptionally good and occupying an important position at the front, although the work was not so laborious as if they had been continuously on the trail. Bell, as Transport Officer, says these teams could not be exchanged without inconveniencing the advance column; but, as other teams were constantly going to and from the front with supplies, the exchange could have been effected in a few weeks without difficulty. The claims are therefore reduced by $2850, leaving a balance of $6890 (as per annexed statement), which the Commission recommend for payment.\n\nJuly 14.\u2014By claim for teaming .................................................. $9,470.00\n\" 31 \" \" \" \" ........................................................................... 2,260.00\n\n$11,730.00\n\nLess.\n\nMay 31.\u2014To overcharge on account of teaming 1st to 31 May, at $10 per team per day, having been charged when rate was limited to $8, vide telegram dated 8th April, 1885, 22 days allowed per team to return home or exchange with others at lower rates, 1,399 days, at $2 ............................................................ $2,798.00\n\nJuly 31st.\u2014To overcharge on account for teaming to 31st July, same as above, 74 days, at $2 .................................................. $148.00\n\nJuly 14th.\u2014To overcharge on account for teaming 1st May to 11th July, 947 days, at $2 ............................................................ $1,894.00 $4840.00\n\nBy balance due Qu'Appelle V.

No. 613.\u2014Great North Western Telegraph Co., for services of operators and lineman and their expenses and material supplied, $3187.34. From letters and memo. from H. P. Dwight, General Manager of the Co., attached, it appears that the Honorable the Minister of Militia and Defence gave instructions for this service, and in order to ensure promptness and efficiency, reliable experts in the employ of the Company were despatched hurriedly, with instructions to spare no effort, either by night or by day, in order that the service might be correctly and satisfactorily carried out.\n\nThe very excellent report of Mr. Lanskail and others attached, show the importance and magnitude of the work; frequently performed under most trying circumstances, and to their efforts with others of the same service the country was indebted for the daily accurate reports from the advance columns, and the ordering of all supplies also depended upon these people.\n\nThe Commission therefore recommend payment in full.\n\nTORONTO, August 5th, 1885.\n\nH. P. DWIGHT, Esq.,\nGeneral Manager Great North Western Telegraph Co.\n\nI beg to submit for your information a brief account of my work in the North west:\n\nWe (Pike and myself) left here on April first, taking with us our field instruments and other necessary material, arriving in Winnipeg on Sunday, April fifth. Labello, lineman from Montreal, joined us there on Monday. We awaited the arrival of the Queen's Own on Tuesday, leaving with that regiment on Tuesday afternoon, and arriving at Qu'Appelle Wednesday morning.\n\nFrom there we reported by telegraph to General Middleton (who was then about thirty miles north of that place) and received orders, Pike to proceed to Fort Qu'Appelle, I with lineman to join his headquarters as soon as possible. We left Qu'Appelle about noon with half of \"C\" Company Infantry School Corps, and overtook General Middleton at Touchwood on Friday evening.\n\nIn company with the Troops we reached Clarke's Crossing, Friday, seventeenth April. On our way up we cut the line, and established communications at noon and in the evening. On Thursday, twenty-third April, the Troops moved forward, and there being no line on the eastern side of the Saskatchewan I was ordered by the General to remain at the office on the western side of the river in order to forward his despatches, which would be sent in by Courier. Operator Macdonald joined me there Thursday evening.\n\nOn the arrival of the Seventh Fusiliers, in May, I opened an office on the eastern bank of the river, the Supply and Transport departments having been established there, and, nearly all our work then being in connection with those departments, remaining there till relieved from duty July the twenty-fifth, when I returned to Toronto, arriving here August fourth.\n\nOn our way to the front, we repaired the line in several places, and did everything possible to put it in reliable working order. The line, however, is far from being a good one. The poles are of poplar, very slight, and only sunk from two to three feet in the ground.\n\nA great deal of trouble and interruption was caused to the line owing to this shallow putting in of the poles, especially when the frost was coming out of the\nground. Another serious trouble was caused by the teamsters cutting the poles for firewood. This we represented to the chief of the Transport Service, who in a great measure stopped the mischief, though not entirely, as, on one or two occasions when the lineman returned from a search for the trouble, he reported that poles had been cut off close to the ground and carried away.\n\nThe serious delays to despatches by these interruptions can be better understood when it is remembered that it was almost if not entirely impossible to get poles to replace those taken away, there being no suitable timber for poles on the prairie. The long distances between stations was also a serious drawback, a day, and often a day and a half, being occupied in reaching the break.\n\nAfter the fight at Fish Creek, and during the stay of the Troops there, an office was opened at that camp and the wire run from there across the river and attached to the Prince Albert line, some three miles distant, by Labelle, our lineman. Anticipating such an event, I put up a battery of twenty cells at Clark's Crossing, and attached it to the Prince Albert line, in such a manner that the line could be used either separately (we relaying the business) or during fine weather connected with Qu'Appelle and the business sent direct from the camp, our battery acting as an aid to the Qu'Appelle battery. The wire used in making the connection from the camp to the Prince Albert line was that sent by you, the heavy kerite submarine wire being used as a cable in crossing the river, and it is to your foresight in providing this wire that General Middleton was enabled to send his despatches direct from the camp, and receive his replies there.\n\nI append a list of the offices we worked with, and the distances between them:\n\nQu'Appelle.\n\nFort Qu'Appelle .................................................. 18 miles\nTouchwood .......................................................... 46 \"\nHumboldt ............................................................ 81 \"\nClarke's Crossing .................................................. 58 \"\nBattleford ............................................................. 93 \"\n\nBranch Line.\n\nClarke's Crossing, Prince Albert ......................... 82 miles\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJOHN LANSKAIL.\n\nTORONTO, Ont., September 23rd, 1885.\n\nH. P. Dwight, Esq.,\nGeneral Manager G. N. W. Tel. Co.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe following is a detailed statement of services rendered by me in the capacity of Military Operator during the late rebellion. Received orders, March 31st, to proceed with all haste to scene of trouble. Left Toronto April 1st for the North-West via Chicago, arrived at Winnipeg on the 5th, remained there while reels for wire, etc., were being made; on afternoon of 7th accompanied Queen's Own Rifles, Winnipeg to Qu'Appelle, arriving there the following morning. Reported to General Middleton from that point for orders. Orders read: \"Proceed to Fort Qu'Appelle and await further instructions.\" I arrived at the Fort, 14 miles distant, the same evening, and worked in the office there until the 10th, when I received orders to proceed with the Grenadiers, 10th Royals, under command Lieut.-Col. Grassett, who were then marching past.\n\nI reported to the Colonel and marched with him, made myself as useful as possible, and secured as much information as could be obtained in any way en route.\n\nI cut the wire every night and opened up communication between our column and the General who was two days' march ahead of us; received orders, etc., after pitching camp every night, and before breaking camp in the morning, all along the\nline of march up the trail, between Qu'Appelle and Humboldt. Col. Grassett and other officers were highly delighted with the service and frequently commented upon the usefulness and importance of this connection. Upon our arrival at Humboldt, April 15th, I received instructions from the General to remain there for further orders. The Grenadiers at this time being under orders for Clarke's Crossing.\n\nI found matters in rather an unsettled condition at Humboldt, it being a very important Telegraph and Supply Station. I was kept very busy, and for several weeks, during Fish Creek and Batoche engagements, I, being alone, had to work almost day and night. Humboldt was the station to which scouts and couriers brought despatches from Prince Albert, Batoche, along the Saskatchewan, Fish Creek, etc.\n\nThe Governor-General's Body Guard, commanded by Lieut.-Col. Denison, arrived at Humboldt May 2nd, where they remained to guard supplies, etc., until close of rebellion. I kept Col. Denison and Cols. O'Brien and Tyrwitt, of 12th and 35th, who arrived shortly afterwards, well supplied with latest news, and obtained for them as much information as possible from the battlefield, during the campaign.\n\nSoon after, being stationed at Humboldt, I saw I would have great difficulty in keeping the line up and in working order, it was in a very bad state in that vicinity, especially between Humboldt and Clarke's Crossing. As soon as the frost came out of the ground interruptions occurred which interfered seriously with communication at a very critical time. I did my utmost to keep line working through, went out to repair it frequently. About time fight at Fish Creek was in progress, the line was in such bad condition between Humboldt and Clarke's Crossing, I considered a thorough repair between these points necessary, and suggested to the General that I should have it done. He at once approved of my suggestion, and placed a transport team at my service. I secured an operator to take my place for a few days, obtained assistance and went over the line personally, cut and drew poles 25 miles, and repaired 60 miles of line as thoroughly as possible. If I had not done this, communication would have been interrupted for several days. Battleford and other important points would have been cut off entirely during height of excitement.\n\nHerewith, please find a detailed account of my expenses while on active service as military operator, also a statement of line troubles, repairs made, &c., during the time I was stationed at Humboldt.\n\nI received orders from the General on the 21st July that my services were no longer required, that I could proceed homewards. After waiting for transport, and driving 160 miles to Qu'Appelle, I could not arrive in Toronto before 5th August. Please calculate my salary up to that date, and oblige\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTHOMAS PIKE.\n\nW. C. No. 676.\u2014Lt. Jas. Christie, pay for services with Rocky Mountain Rangers, $445.99, and travelling expenses, $47.25. This officer was authorized in March last to proceed from Ottawa with Captain John Stewart to the North West for the purpose of organizing the Rocky Mountain Rangers. From some cause, his name was omitted from the first Pay List, and although entered in a subsequent one, he had failed to sign the receipt, consequently the Paymaster struck out the amount. It is therefore recommended that he be paid for 103 days at $1.58 and forage and rations for the same period, in accordance with the agreement entered into with the Honorable the Minister, amounting in all to $445.99 and for travelling expenses $47.25.\n\nW. C. No. 677.\u2014W. J. Horn, Saskatoon, for hire of horse and carrying despatches to Clarke's Crossing and return, as certified to by the Deputy Surgeon General, $18. Recommended for payment in full.\n\nW. C. No. 688.\u2014David Storey, Winnipeg, for rent of stable for guard room, etc., $50 (being $25 per month for two months); the agreement was for $10 per month.\nLt.-Col. Scoble informed the Acting Deputy Adjutant-General, that the whole premises would be available if required for stabling horses; the building was taken on 10th April, given up by Lt. H. G. Bate, Supply Officer; on the 25th or 29th of the same month (see that officer's memo. on claim), consequently Mr. Storey would only be entitled to $10; but, as there appears to have been some damage done, and as the stables were subsequently occupied by horses of the Halifax Battalion without proper authority, the sum of $30 is deducted, and the balance, $20, recommended for payment.\n\nReport approved.\u2014A.

No. 417.\u2014Collingwood and Lake Superior Steamship Line (Canada Transport Co.) for demurrage, or estimated profit on engagement to carry troops from Port Arthur to Collingwood, $21.36. This claim was previously reported upon on 24th October last. Mr. Barlow Cumberland, Manager of the Company, having requested a reconsideration of the case, that gentleman came before the Commission by appointment, today, producing copies of telegrams re the transport of troops by the steamer \"Campana\" from Port Arthur. The ship's log having also been produced, showed she was at Port Arthur on Sunday, 19th July, at 11 A.M., as agreed upon, and remained until 6 P.M. the following day.\n\nThe Honorable the Minister had directed that the York and Simcoe Battalion (356 strong) should be transported by this line, but, owing to change of time of departure from Winnipeg by C.P.R. Railway, this Corps reached Port Arthur 24 hours in advance of the time agreed upon, when it became necessary to continue the journey by C.P.R. Steamship. It was then arranged to send the Montreal Garrison Artillery by the Collingwood Line, in lieu of the York and Simcoe Battalion, but, for some unexplained cause, this Corps also embarked on C.P.R. Steamship, leaving the \"Campana\" to continue her trip, after waiting 36 hours, with but half a cargo, which she had brought from Duluth, with the view of leaving ample room for the accommodation of the troops. The claim is for the profits on the transport of 356 men, $2136. As the steamer went down partly light, and the damages and cleaning, which would have necessarily followed the transport of troops, were saved to the Company, and the running expense otherwise reduced. The Commission consider compensation on the strength of the Montreal Garrison Artillery, viz.: 299 at half the amount claimed or $3.00 each should be sufficient, thereby making a reduction on claim of $1239 and recommending payment of the balance, $897, in full settlement. It may be further remarked that Mr. Beatty, Manager of the C.P.R. Steamship, stated to one of the Commission (Lt.-Col. Whitehead) that he notified Lt.-Col. Oswald that the Montreal Garrison Artillery were to embark on the \"Campana,\"\u2014to this Lt.-Col. Oswald objected, and marched his men on the C.P.R. Steamship.\n\nReport approved.\u2014A. P.

P. Railway for transport of Troops, stores, etc., I would respectfully submit the most liberal construction should be put upon all transactions carried out by that Company.\n\nIt has been stated all work (between Biscotasing and Port Arthur, 461 miles) by Contractors and others ceased during this service, but the Company have not given number of teams employed, number of men thrown out of work and under pay, or number of days the work was interrupted.\n\nSome of the Supply Officers say the teams were only withdrawn when actually required for use of Troops, and immediately returned to work of construction, after crossing the particular gap on which they were engaged; they also say very few men, exclusive of teamsters, were provided by the Company, and the fact the gaps grew shorter as each Corps arrived is proof the work did not cease. Therefore most respectfully submit the ten (10) cents per mile, and increased rate for freight for the period before the tracks were united; with half those rates subsequently, should be ample to meet all incidental losses. It may be stated the Montreal Garrison Artillery was the only Corps transported westward after this date, consequently the five (5) cents per mile would only apply to the transport of that Corps; and the ones returning by the North Shore after the 15th July, and before the road was declared open.\n\nThe comparative statement re the transport of the Montreal Garrison Artillery attached shows the large sum a six company corps cost to proceed only as far as Winnipeg.\n\nI may here mention Mr. Drinkwater stated, in presence of the Commission, it cost about one thousand dollars to run a passenger train from Montreal to Winni-\npeg, consequently their proposed charge of $24,917.53 for one corps appears exceedingly large.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW. H. JACKSON, Lt.-Col., D. A. G.,\nChairman.\n\nThe Honorable Sir A. P. Caron, K.C.M.G.,\nMinister of Militia and Defence.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nP. S.\u2014It may be added the Troops were returned by the North Shore route, for the benefit of the C. P. Railway; the recommended 5 cts. per mile going east per man; and proportional increase for freight, being nearly double full first class rates. There were three lines of steamers from Port Arthur and two lines of railway east of the Lakes; the whole of the Troops could have been sent by these routes, for two thirds (\u00a7) the regular rates, viz., 2 cts. per mile, or two-fifths (\u00a7) the amount recommended.\n\nREPORT No. 93.\nOTTAWA, 21st January, 1886.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nREPORT.\n\nFor consideration of the Honorable the Minister of Militia and Defence.\n\nW.

Ouimet, attached, states that owing to his ill health the team was kept waiting from day to day, about one week, and after arrival at Edmonton, the horses being somewhat used up, were placed on duty between that place and Fort Saskatchewan, by Captain Hamilton, Supply and Transport Officer. As only a few days were consumed in the trip for which the horses were engaged, the balance of the time was the usual service except the week waiting doing nothing (during Lt.-Col. Ouimet's illness), for which that officer was responsible, and not the man who supplied the team; therefore, it is recommended that the price be reduced to $12 per day, taking off $264.

A. 2486 and 2922.\u2014Major General Strange, claim for kits lost at Fort Pitt by Alberta Field Force. The voluminous papers connected with these claims have been carefully considered. The articles claimed to have been lost by the N.W.M.P. appear to have been put in for the purpose of accounting for those articles, with the view, no doubt, of a new issue from their own stores in lieu of those lost on service. Steele's Scouts and the Alberta Mounted Rifles enumerate the articles, but give no price, and these men are now scattered. It is not probable many could be found, and as the evidence taken before the Board is not by any means conclusive, and leads to the belief that the claims are much exaggerated, the Commission think the claims of these two Corps should be held in abeyance. The Winnipeg Light Infantry were fully fitted out by the Government in April, at time of organization. They received extra socks and some other articles at Battleford; and were served with a new outfit of underclothing and trowsers at time of disbandment, consequently they have been fully compensated for any losses.\n\nOne man, Private Sullivan, No. 3 Co., claims to have lost a watch and razor which he values at $20.50. This claim might remain in abeyance.\n\nThe claims for the following officers for private property appear to be reasonable, and payment is recommended in full:\n\n| Lt.-Col. Osborne Smith, C. M. G. | $27.50 |\n| Major J. Lewis | 6.00 |\n| Assistant Surgeon, S. J. MacAdam | 12.00 |\n| Captain W. R.

The loss appears to have been the result of shipment by the wrong route. Although there is nothing to show from where forwarded, it is presumed it was from Winnipeg. The Government should not be held responsible for errors in private transactions of this nature; the agents, shippers or transport company would appear to be responsible. Rejected.\n\nW. C. No. 685.\u2014M. M. & D. A. 3048.\u2014J. A. Pelkey for tent sold to Richard Vigers, Acting Mayor, of Port Arthur, $250. This tent was used at Red Rock as a stable by teamsters. As the C. P. R. Co. provided the teams for the transport of Troops across the gaps, on the north shore of Lake Superior, including all expenses connected therewith, this is not a claim against the Government. Rejected.\n\nW. C. No. 697.\u2014M. M. & D. A. 2938.\u2014Gowanlock and Laurie for two oxen taken possession of by Troops at Fort Pitt, valued at about $90, each (according to the letter of Geo. G. Maury, dated Onion Lake, Fort Pitt, 28th Oct., 1885, attached to claim). Recommended as follows:\u2014the Department of Militia to pay for one ox used for beef by the Winnipeg Light Infantry, $90, and claimant to be notified to apply to the Indian Agent for the return or payment of the ox left in his charge.\n\nW. C. No. 687.\u2014M. M. & D. A. 2914.\u2014Edm'd. Wragge, Honorary Secretary Red Cross Ambulance Corps, Toronto, $95, for tent which was the private property of the Corps, but left in charge of Gen. Laurie, Swift Current, and forwarded by that Officer down the South Saskatchewan to Telegraph Coulee, where it was used to protect Government stores, and became the property of the Government. Payment is therefore recommended in full.\nW. C. No. 664.\u2014M. M. & D. A.3023.\u2014Wm. Scanlan, Prince Albert, 19 days carrying despatches, $57. Recommended for payment in full.\n\nW. C. No. 603.\u2014M. M. & D. A.2727.\u2014Lt.-Col. Houghton, D. A. G., claim for pay while on active service, $1,090.88. This claim having been referred to the G. O. C., that officer says \u00a31 10s. stg. per day is the full pay of a D. A. G. on service with, in this case, $1 added for field allowance. As the latter sum has been paid previously, and as the G. O. C. directs that any other pay of which the claimant is in receipt shall be deducted, the amount is made up as follows:\n\n64 days @ $7.30..........................$467.20\n\nThe Major General Commanding having approved of the original recommendation of the Commission, the balance of $467.20 is recommended for payment.\n\nReport approved.\u2014A.

Bell, W. C. 6. 141. 645. 646.)\n\nThe legality of W. R. Bell, a transport officer, purchasing and selling hay to the H. B. Co. for use of N. W. F. Force, having been referred for legal opinion, the Commission submit herewith an extract touching this question, from which it appears Bell's actions were legal, consequently he would be entitled to the amount of his claim, $5,569.55, less $2 per day overcharge, paid through the H. B. Co. on teams furnished by him after the first of May, $430, leaving a balance of $5,139.55 due Bell.\n\nExtract from legal opinion:\n\n\"The Company made a contract with Mr. W. R. Bell to supply certain hay at $25 per ton, under which contract Mr. Bell delivered a quantity of hay, and was paid therefor.\n\nMr. Bell at the time was Transport Officer, in receipt of $8 per day and pay allowance, but it is admitted that, as Transport Officer, he had no duty with respect to the purchase of hay or other supplies.\n\nIt is stated in the papers that the Hudson Bay Co. were acting as Agents for the Government, but that is an assumption which ought not to be made under the agreement with that Company.\n\nIn respect of this contract, however, that distinction does not seem to be important.\n\nThe Minister, who has had this matter under consideration, is of opinion that whatever may be thought of the conduct of an officer who takes means to raise the market price of the goods which the Government is obliged to purchase, the Go-\nvernment is bound to pay to the Hudson Bay Co. the price agreed on for the purchase of the hay, by them, provided that, in agreeing for such price they are buying as cheaply as possible, and provided there was no collusion between the Hudson's Bay Co. and any one else, to enhance the market price, so as to make it appear that the Company was buying as cheaply as possible in paying the exorbitant price.\"\n\nW. H. JACKSON, Lt.-Col., D. A. G.,\nChairman.\n\nE. A. WHITEHEAD, Lt.-Col.,\nMember.\n\nW. H. FORREST, Lt.-Col.,\nMember.\n\nEDMUND B. HOLT,\nSecretary.\n\nREPORT No. 101.\n\nOTTAWA, 5th February, 1886.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nREPORT.\n\nFor consideration of the Honorable the Minister of Militia and Defence.\n\nW. C. No. 726.\u2014M. M. & D. A. 1954.\u2014Geo. H. Bradbury, for services and expenses in connection with the North-West expedition, $424.70. Mr. Bradbury was authorized by the Honorable the Minister to proceed to the North-West to assist Lord Melgund in organizing a Mounted Corps 250 strong, and he was provided with transport requisition through the United States in order to expedite his movements.\n\nOn reaching Winnipeg he found Lord Melgund had gone forward. The Minister then authorized him, through Lt.-Col. Jackson, to join Lord Melgund, which he did, but found no opening for appointment, the Corps not having been organized. Mr. Bradbury then took charge of a Transport Convoy from Humboldt to Fish Creek, after which, as he says, on the advice of Lord Melgund, he returned home. Payment is therefore recommended of his expenses, and 60 days' pay as Captain. Deducted $70.80, overcharge of pay, and $42.50, paid at Qu'Appelle, leaving a balance of $311.40, which is recommended for payment.\n\nW. C. No. 82.\u2014McNeill Bros., Calgary, meals to 65th Battalion, $48. The certificates being now satisfactory, the claim is recommended for payment in full.\n\nW. C. No. 654.\u2014P. Rutherford, Winnipeg, $2,620, for consequential damages on account of teamsters leaving his employ and engaging on Militia Transport Service. No teams were pressed into the Government service, but came voluntarily; if they broke any previous engagements with private parties they should be held responsible, not the Government. Rejected.\n\nW. C. No. 723.\u2014North-West Transportation Co., $2,550, for loss sustained by not conveying the 7th Battalion from Port Arthur to Sarnia. There is nothing to show that any contract or agreement existed under which this Corps should go by this line. The Halifax Battalion was conveyed by this line. This Corps being very strong, and conveyed by one boat, the profits would be almost equal to transporting two ordinary Corps on different boats; it is therefore considered that the Company did not sustain loss, in any case they would not be entitled to damages. Rejected.\nW. C. No. 647.\u2014R. Dewitt, per G. G. Mills, Winnipeg, labor removing stores at Saskatchewan Landing, $6.25. Recommended for payment in full.\n\nW. C. No. 337.\u2014D. Lamoreaux, Transport Service between Edmonton and Fort Pitt and Calgary, $744, deduct $2 a day on last sixty days; teams generally having been reduced to $6 a day from that period; taking off $120, the balance, $624, is recommended for payment.\n\nW. C. No. 595.\u2014M. M. & D. A. 2663.\u2014Department of Indian Affairs relative to claim of S. B. Lucas, Indian Agent, at Peace Hills, for supplies to Troops, $1,477.48. Recommended that the entry warrant in favor of the Department of the Interior be now issued for the amount claimed as per letter of the Deputy of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs annexed.\n\nW. C. No. 526.\u2014S. B. Lucas, Peace Hills, expenses incurred looking for beef cattle to supply troops, $112.60. Recommended for payment in full.\n\nW. C. No. 728.\u2014Alexander McLean, Edmonton, extra services carrying despatches from Fort Pitt to Battleford; $100. This man was engaged at Edmonton with 20 others, at $5 a day by Major General Strange, to float the scows down the North Saskatchewan; pay to continue till his return to Edmonton. At Fort Pitt he was used to carry messages to Battleford, and now claims extra pay. Claim rejected.\n\nW. C. No. 719.\u2014H. Nash, for demurrage or detention of teams at Swift Current, $25. There was no contract for conveyance of any particular quantity of goods; a portion of stores were ordered back to Winnipeg, and a portion went on to Battleford at high rates. It is not probable the teams were detained specially for these stores, as they appear to have been at Swift Current waiting for any freight which might offer payment cannot be recommended. Rejected.\n\nW. C. No. 700.\u2014M. M. & D. A. 2909.\u2014John Richardson, Warden County of York, Toronto, for boots and underclothing presented by the County Council to the 12th York Battalion, previous to their departure to the North-West.$1,059.\n\nOn the 12th May, 343 pairs of boots were issued to the York and Simcoe Battalion, on the ground that they had not been previously provided by the Government. As the boots and underclothing were given to the men as a present it does not appear reasonable that the Government should be called upon to recoup the County. Rejected.\n\nW. C. No. 56.\u2014M. M. & D. A. 3103.\u2014R. W. Dulmage, Saskatoon, logs of house used for fuel by Troops at Clarke's Crossing, $40. The Deputy Minister of Justice says this claim should be settled by the Department of Militia, and not by the Department of the Interior; there is nothing to show the size or condition of the logs claimed for, nor is there any supporting evidence. Payment cannot therefore be recommended. Rejected.\n\nW. C. No. 89.\u2014M. M. & D. A. 3103.\u2014Thos. Lee, Calgary, damage to crops by cattle, owing to removal of fences by Troops for fuel, $200.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice says this is a fair claim against the Department of Militia, and not the Department of the Interior.\n\nAs the property and fence appear to have belonged to the Government, and as the Commission cannot see how a crop of onions and cabbage could have been sown in the N. W. T. in April, they cannot entertain the claim. Rejected.\n\nReport approved.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. H. JACKSON, Lt.-Col., D. A. G.,\nChairman.\n\nE. A. WHITEHEAD, Lt.-Col.,\nMember.\n\nW. H. FORREST, Lt.-Col.,\nMember.\n\nEDMUND B. HOLT,\nSecretary.\nREPORT No. 102.\n\nOTTAWA, 6th February, 1886.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nREPORT.\n\nFor consideration of the Honorable the MINISTER OF MILITIA AND DEFENCE.\n\nRe H. B. Co.\n\nThe Commission having had under consideration the various accounts current and statements presented by the Hudson Bay Co., and, after having gone through the extended annotations of Major Gay, who audited the accounts, and also examined many of the vouchers, find considerable sums of money, and many goods have been supplied on requisition or certificates of various officers, whose authority does not appear clear, and as these requisitions have been honoured in many instances, without having been supervised or approved by a competent authorized officer, irregularities must necessarily have occurred, but as the H. B. Co. acted in apparent good faith, and with the view of rendering prompt assistance to the Troops, and as they were not, perhaps, in a position to know where to draw the line, the Commissioners think the whole claim should be dealt with in the most liberal manner; consequently attention will only be called to such items as appear to be quite inadmissible.\n\nIt was understood the Company should give the Government the full benefit of their extensive organization, which of course includes officers, clerks, etc., etc., all over the North West Territories and Manitoba; goods furnished from their own stores were to be given at wholesale prices; those purchased for ready cash, and cash payments for supplies, or, on account of transport, were to be placed at a commission of five per cent. There being no written contract, it may be difficult to define fully what the liberal allowance of five per cent. on such a large transaction should cover, but it would appear the Honorable the Minister considered it ample to cover all expenses, and this would appear reasonable when such large quantities of goods on hand were disposed of at regular wholesale prices. The Commission, therefore, beg respectfully to submit the following:\n\nSTATEMENT No. 6.\n\nVoucher No. 416.\u2014Subsistence of officers of the 9th Battalion while on a pleasure trip to the Rockies $77.50. The Commanding Officer of the Corps should be called upon to refund to the Department.\n\nVouchers Nos. 468 to 606.\u2014Or twenty in all, of $10 each, $200, bonus to teamsters at Calgary. These teamsters were in receipt of large pay, and ought not to expect a bonus for using extra exertion at times.\n\nThe Commission have not recommended claims of this nature, believing bonuses to rest entirely with the Honorable the Minister or those who have his special authority; but as these have apparently been paid in good faith attention is merely called to the items.\n\nVoucher No. 47.\u2014Prince Albert, 3 catties tobacco, $54, to Lieut.-Col. Montizambert for the use of the men of his Battery. The Officer commanding the Battery should be called upon for repayment to the Department.\n\nVoucher No. 49.\u2014Prince Albert, 10 catties tobacco, $180, for use of men of the 90th Battalion, receipted for by Lieut.-Col. MacKeand as for repayment. That officer should be called upon to refund to the Department.\n\nSTATEMENTS Nos. 7 and 8.\n\nVoucher No. 708.\u2014Edmonton,\u2014tobacco, $21, should be charged to 65th Battalion, and the Officer commanding that Corps called upon for a refund to the Department.\nSTATEMENT No. 9.\n\nVoucher No. 738.\u2014Qu\u2019Appelle, $423 paid Mr. Rigby, clerk to Mr. R. Crawford, acting as Paymaster to the H. B. Co. The five per cent. commission should cover all expense for paying out money. This man was not in the employ of the Government, consequently the item should be disallowed, together with the five per cent., making $444.15. Rejected.\n\nAccount No. 1.\u2014Fourteen Pay Lists, amounting to $21,156.46, Major Bell and other employees. A Departmental Paymaster had been stationed at Qu\u2019Appelle and provided by the Government with ample funds to meet all such calls. These pay lists should have been presented to that Officer for payment.\n\nThe H. B. Co. had been notified the Government had provided for payment and their officers at the station knew it was the Departmental Paymaster\u2019s duty to pay, consequently the five per cent. commission charged on the payment should be deducted, amounting to $1,057.82, which is recommended.\n\nSTATEMENT No. 13.\n\nVoucher No. 711.\u2014Calgary, straw hats and helmets $100.77, for the 9th Battalion. Supply Officer Woolsey paid for one lot of helmets, and the Corps (including officers) was supplied from Government stores, Winnipeg, with white helmets by order of the Director of Stores. The Officer commanding the 9th Battalion should be called upon to refund this amount to the Department.\n\nSTATEMENT No. 15.\n\nGoods in Depot at Winnipeg, $7,197.37 (this account, as originally rendered, $8,600.87, had previously been rejected, shows a portion of the goods as having been disposed of by the claimants). The Honorable the Minister authorized supplies for sixty days from the commencement, consequently there ought not to have been any reserve in Depot after the expiration of that time, and surely not as late as the 25th September, consequently payment cannot be recommended. Rejected.\n\nSTATEMENT No. 16.\n\nAccount No. 278.\u2014$157.50 for hay, no receipt for delivery; refused by Supply Officer, at Qu\u2019Appelle, it being damaged. Bain, Blanchard & Mulock, lawyers, at Winnipeg, gave an opinion the Company were liable to the Contractors. On this authority they paid, but it is for the Hon. the Minister to say if the military rule of refusing damaged supplies shall be maintained. If the Minister concurs in maintaining the rule, the Commission recommend the rejection of the claim, adding freight from Minnedosa $92.20, and also 5 per cent. charged on the payment, $7.87, making a total of $257.57 disallowed.\n\nSTATEMENT No. 18.\n\nAccount of Bain, Blanchard & Mulock, law costs, drawing contracts, advice, etc., $965.56. This claim was submitted to the Hon. the Minister of Justice for assessment, and reduced by him to $500.46. In accordance with the agreement between the Hon. the Minister and the H. B. Co., supplied by legal opinion, this expenditure is covered by the 5 per cent. commission, consequently the amount charged, $965.56, is recommended to be struck off.\n\nSTATEMENT No. 19.\n\nInterest on balances from 15th September to 7th December, $1,978.44. This should be disallowed, on the ground the Company would sell goods on contract to the North West Mounted Police Indian Department or reliable traders on credit, or a discount for cash; large sums were advanced by the Government, from time to time, as early as 9th May. Four hundred and sixty thousand dollars had been advanced in this way, on which no interest has been allowed.\nThe Commission think these advantages should balance each other, it is therefore recommended the item be disallowed. Rejected:\n\nThe sum of $4,900.00 having been deducted from claims of the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co., to cover $2 per day per team, subsequent to 1st May, and paid by the H. B. Co.; also $430.00 from W. R. Bell, in a similar manner, thus reducing teams after 1st May, from $10.00 to $8.00 per day. It appears but reasonable the 5 per cent. on such over-pay, amounting to $266.50; should be disallowed, which is recommended.\n\nExpense account $3,282.30, made up as follows:\n\n- Travelling expenses ................................................................. $740.35\n- Salaries and office expenses at Troy and Moosejaw ...................... 1,020.50\n- Printing special forms (to facilitate the Co.'s work, no doubt) ........ 148.85\n- Expense at Railway Depot, forwarding special shipments ............... 32.50\n- Express charges on parcels of currency forwarded to various points for payment of teamsters, etc. .................................................. 1,176.45\n- Telegraphing at Fort Qu'Appelle ............................................. 163.65\n\nThe telegraphing, $163.65, is recommended.\n\nThe five per cent. commission should cover the other charges. It was understood the Company's whole organization was at the disposal of the Government, consequently it is recommended $3,118.45 be disallowed.\n\nOn or about the 17th May, Capt. Swinford, Supply Officer at Qu'Appelle, reported four car loads of hay for which he had given requisition for the transport, had proved bad, and requested the freight, amounting to $220.80, should be recovered. This letter was forwarded by Lieut.-Col. Whitehead to the Commissioner of the H. B. Co. It is presumed each car contained ten tons, the price charged on May 8th was $17.50 per ton. As this hay was not accepted by the Supply Officer, and as the Company had been notified by Lieut.-Col. Whitehead not to pay for hay before acceptance, it appears but reasonable the freight and value of this hay should be deducted from the Company's Account, as follows:\n\n- Freight, four cars ................................................................. $220.80\n- 40 tons of hay at $17.50 per ton ............................................. 700.00\n- 5 per cent. commission on the hay ........................................... 35.00\n\n$955.80\n\n**Recapitulation.**\n\nAmount of balance claimed, account current \"A\" No. 19, January 12, 1886 ................................................................. $76,648.64.\n\n**Deductions Recommended.**\n\n- Voucher No. 738, Mr. Rigby .................................................... $444.15\n- Account No. 1-14, pay lists 5 per cent ........................................ 1,057.52\n- Statement No. 15, goods in Depot ............................................ 7,197.37\n- Account No. 278, damaged hay ............................................... 257.57\n- Statement No. 18, Bain, Blanchard & Co .................................. 965.56\n- \" \" 19, interest on balance .................................................. 1,978.44\n- Commission of 5 per cent on over-payments to Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co. and W. R. Bell ........................................ 266.50\n- Expense Account ................................................................. 3,118.65\n- Deduct for freight and damaged hay, about 17th May ................. 955.80 $16,241.86\n\n$60,406.78\n\nThe balance $60,406.78 is recommended for payment.\n\nThe question of paying interest and charges on drafts, as charged in account current No. 15, having arisen, the legality would appear to depend upon the arrangement or understanding between the Hon. the Minister and the Hon. D. A. Smith, on behalf of the H. B. Co. In the absence of a written agreement the\nquestion appears one for the Hon. the Minister to determine; should he decide the \n5 per cent commission covers this expenditure a further reduction of $6,497.33 \nshould be made, leaving the balance, $53,909.45.\n\nW.

No. 738\u2014Dr. Wm. Nattrass, transport expenses, Battleford to Swift \nCurrent, $70. Recommended for payment in full.\n\nW. C. No. 739.\u2014A. H. Clark, Hospital Steward, Prince Albert, for drugs $140.43.\nit would appear that this man ordered drugs, toilet articles, etc., from W. J. Mit-\nchell of Winnipeg, as a private speculation. It is stated these goods were lost en \nroute; but there is nothing to show that the Government was responsible for the \nloss; consequently, payment cannot be recommended.\n\nW. C. No. 704.\u2014M. & D. A. 2965 2nd Batt. Q. O. R., Toronto, for expenses \nincurred in calling out the Regiment for North West Service, $5,429.06. It appears \nthis Corps was not provided with necessaries by the Department before leaving\nToronto, but certain articles had been given to the Corps by the City Council of Toronto, similar to what was given to the 10th Royal Grenadiers.\n\nThe claims for allowance in lieu of rations (4 days while on duty before leaving, and three days after returning), is reduced to 25cts. per day, the same as allowed other corps, under like circumstances. The amount of the different items allowed is as follows:\n\n1. Account transportation ................................................................. $56.10\n2. Ambulance and hospital stores ...................................................... 56.34\n3. Butcher's knife, steel, &c., disallowed ........................................... 6.03\n4. Revolvers, holsters, &c., disallowed ............................................... 51.93\n5. Hardware for Pioneers ................................................................. 160.00\n\nThe D. A. G. should be instructed to have these kettles returned into store.\n\n7. Seven days' subsistence while in Toronto, 285 officers and men @ 25cts. 498.75\n8. Allowance, in lieu of kit and necessaries, same as granted the 10th Royal Grenadiers 265 men, @ $8.15 per man ........................................ 2,159.75\n\nRecommended for payment ............................................................ 2,988.90\n\nMaking a reduction on claim of ....................................................... 2,040.16.\n\nIt is further recommended that the allowance in lieu of kit, $8.15 per man, be paid through the Deputy-Adjutant General of the District, on receipt of pay lists, properly signed by each man.\n\nW. C. No. 737.\u2014Geo. S. Clouston of Battleford, $2,050, for prospective loss of saloon business and breakages in removing household effects to barracks. There is no supporting evidence, nor does it appear to be a claim against the Government. No doubt, the claimant with his family, if he had one, was fed by the Government during the period, and, instead of asking for damages, should refund the value of rations consumed. Rejected.\n\nW. C. No. 513.\u2014T. P. McHugh for 75 cords of wood, at $6 per cord, $450, ordered by Major-General Strange for use of troops at Calgary. After considerable correspondence with various officers, and having taken the evidence of Mr. McHugh, under oath, the claim is considered a just one, and is therefore recommended for payment in full.\n\nW. C. No. 388.\u2014M. & D. A. 2368.\u2014Capt. J. Peters, \"A Battery,\" for uniform and other clothing lost en route to Battleford, N. W. T., $225. This claim has been held over for several months, hoping that the case containing the articles would be recovered. Strickland & Sons' price list, sent by Capt. Peters, shows he has charged full credit prices, certifying that the articles were as good as new. The Commission recommend payment at prices for which the articles can be replaced for cash, viz:\u201410 per cent. discount, on condition that Capt. Peters guarantees to refund to the Department the then value of the lost articles which he may hereafter recover:\u2014$22.50 is therefore deducted, and the balance, $202.50, is recommended for payment.\n\nReport approved.\u2014A.

The time-notes on which payments to teamsters were made were issued by officers fully competent, and were to the satisfaction of the parties receiving them at the time; and, as claims for injured or dead horses are inadmissible according to legal opinion, this claim is rejected.\n\nW. C. No. 746.\u2014M. & D. A. 3227.\u2014H. Heigham for pay as Acting Surgeon and Supply Officer to Cavalry School Corps from 1st August to 12th September, $167.70.

Howard, transport of supplies, Saskatchewan Landing to Battleford, $376.25. Deduct $10 per ton for subsistence, according to contract, \u00a731, leaving a balance of $345.25. While examining contracts, and taking evidence upon oath at Winnipeg, the Commission discovered that the $10 per ton to cover subsistence provided by the Government had not been deducted from previous claims; the accounts having been rendered in all cases without showing this reduction, as per contract, as follows:\n\nOn 337 $\\frac{5}{6}$ tons, at $10 per ton.................$3,373.30\nLess previously deducted for oats consumed ... 99.70\n\n$3,273.60\nLess amount of present claim..................345.25\n\n$2,928.35\n\nshowing a balance due by Thos. Howard, as above, of $2,928.35. Major Guy has on the request of the Commission called upon Mr. Howard to correct this error, and it is recommended that a refund be insisted upon. See remarks of Lt. Col. Whitehead at end of Report.\n\nW. C. No. 450.\u2014Reynolds & Tripp, transport service between Houghton and Touchwood and Qu'Appelle, 34 days, at $7, $238. The time-notes show only 33 days; over-charge for one day, $7, is therefore deducted, and the balance, $231, is recommended for payment.\n\nW. C. No. 115.\u2014Lieut. Corgell, Steele's Scouts, compensation for injury to horse while on active service, $60. Reported upon on 23rd September last, and was reconsidered by permission of the Honorable the Minister of Militia and Defence. It was not previously known that the claimant was a graduate of the Royal Military College and a Lieutenant in the Militia; such being the case, he comes under the Regulations and Orders, and is entitled to compensation under paragraph 1004. The proceedings of the Board are attached to the claim and the full amount claimed, $50, is recommended for payment.\n\nW. C. No. 208.\u2014A. McDonald, Winnipeg, for pay advanced to Lac la Biche, Scouts, $162.50. Recommended for payment in full.\n\nW. C. No. 752.\u2014M. & D. A. 2443.\u2014Letters and papers from N. W. M. Police Department relative to claim of A. C. McDonell, Calgary, for horse taken posses-\nThis claim was presented to Lt.-Col. Forrest, Paymaster N. W. F. F. in September last, for payment, but as he was aware that the Government were not bound to furnish Major Steele nor any of the members of this Corps with horses\u2014there being a special agreement to the contrary\u2014the documents were forwarded to Major Steele for an explanation, which that officer returned (see his letter annexed to claim) to the effect that the Militia authorities had nothing whatever to do with the payment of this horse and that it was a matter altogether for settlement by the North-West Mounted Police. It is therefore recommended that the docket be referred back to the Department North-West Mounted Police with copy of above remarks.\n\nW. C. No. 680.\u2014M. & D. A. 2955.\u2014H. Belanger for expenses incurred by him in taking charge of a sick mare attached to \"B\" Battery, $47. Recommended for payment in full.\n\nW. C. No. 115.\u2014Edward Cole, trooper Steele's Scouts, for loss of horse, $140. This horse was taken over by Veterinary Surgeon Duncan at Fort Pitt, and subsequently sold at Battleford on account of Government. The proceedings of a Board are attached to the claim, with copy of Mr. Duncan's receipt for the horse; the claim has been held over for the purpose of getting the original, which has been lost or mislaid. A letter attached from Major Steele, dated Battleford, 16th January, 1886, appears to leave no doubt that the horse was disposed of, as above stated, consequently it is now recommended $100 be paid under R. and O., paragraph 1004, making a reduction of $40 on claim.\n\nW. C. No. 750.\u2014Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co. for 1 grey mare purchased, $225. In the absence of any agreement as to price, it is considered that $200 would be a fair value for this horse, and is recommended for payment, taking off $25 from the claim.\n\nReport approved.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. H. JACKSON, Lt.-Col., D. A. G.,\nChairman.\n\nE. A. WHITEHEAD, Lt.-Col.,\nMember.\n\nW. H. FORREST, Lt.-Col.,\nMember.\n\nEDMUND B. HOLT,\nSecretary.\n\nI concur in the preceding report, with the exception of that portion referring to W. C. No. 641, Thomas Howard, for transport of supplies. With regard to this matter, I respectfully beg to bring to the notice of the Commission, that Mr. Howard reported that he used ox-teams as well as horse-teams, and did not draw full rations. He admits having received forage, but in consideration of his services in ferrying the 175 discharged teams from the north to the south side of the Saskatchewan, thereby saving the Government $1200 per day,\u2014the forage was considered an offset. The wire ferry had been carried away by the high floods, and to bring the Government teams across the Saskatchewan, Mr. Howard's barge had to be utilized. Mr. Howard had the option of furnishing his own rations, and receiving full contract price, or drawing rations and forage from the Government at $10 per ton less than the full contract price. If Mr. Howard did draw a certain amount of rations and forage, the Supply Officer should be called upon to report, and if Mr. Howard has a claim against the Government for ferriage, he should lay the same before the Commission.\n\nE. A. WHITEHEAD, Lt.-Col.,\nMember.\n\nEDMUND B. HOLT,\nSecretary.\nREPORT No. 111.\n\nOTTAWA, 24th February, 1886.\n\nWAR CLAIMS COMMISSION.\n\nREPORT.\n\nFor consideration of the Honorable the Minister of Militia and Defence.\n\nW. C. No. 745.\u2014Dominion Express Co. for transport of horse and buggy of J. H. Pearson from Winnipeg to Qu\u2019Appelle, $100, on 18th April, 1885. Originally this account was rendered at $125. Two telegrams dated 17th April, from W. R. Bell and J. H. Pearson respectively, show that the horse and cart were ordered to go by first freight. These telegrams were disregarded and the trap sent by express on the following day. Mr. Drinkwater\u2019s telegram attached shows that the freight charges would be about $34, which sum is recommended for payment; taking off $66.\n\nW. C. No. 753.\u2014Chas. Ffolliott, Brandon, for blankets taken by Ambulance Corps for use of wounded at Cut-Knife Creek, $12. Recommended for payment in full.\n\nW. C. No. 26, Account No. 5.\u2014Heney & Co., Ottawa, balance of account for waist-belts, etc., $299.85. The original claim, amounting to $539.50, was reported upon on 11th September last, and $239.65 recommended for payment.\n\nBy permission of the Honorable the Minister is now reconsidered. The account, as originally presented, was for 250 waist-belts, sheaths and knives for Rocky Mountain Rangers, and was reduced in number to correspond with the strength of the Corps. Capt. Stewart now explains the whole number were used by making shoulder-belts out of those not required for the waist, which enabled the men to carry 60 rounds of ammunition instead of 30 rounds, the belts being now in Government Stores at McLeod.\n\nCapt. Stewart offers to pay for the 125 knives, $25, which sum deducted from $299.85 leaves a balance of $274.85, which is recommended for payment.\n\nW. C. No. 590.\u2014G. L. Dodds for grocery supplies, $51.54. No. 591.\u2014W. D. Perley, tent, $9. No. 592.\u2014James P. Dill, clothing, $21.50,\u2014all articles purchased for use of Moose Mountain Scouts, reported upon on 12th November last, and now reconsidered by permission of the Honorable the Minister. A letter from T. W. Jackson with affidavits having been attached, it appears these articles were supplied in good faith, and as there is no doubt they were used by the Corps while on service it is now recommended that the respective claims be paid in full as special cases.\n\nW. C. No. 653.\u2014Thos. E. McWilliams, freighting from Clarke\u2019s Crossing to Moosejaw $25. Recommended for payment.\n\nW. C. No. 756.\u2014J. A. Kerr, Regina, for one Winchester carbine, 5 boxes of cartridges, and reloading tools, furnished to Dr. Roddick, $49.75. It appears that certain of the Medical Staff were ordered from Swift Current to Battleford at a time when the journey was considered extra hazardous, the trail being that on which Poundmaker captured a convoy of supplies. The Surgeons felt it necessary to have some protection, and were provided with this rifle and ammunition for that purpose. The claim is supported by an order from Major Rickards, Supply Officer, dated Swift Current 26th April, 1885. Payment is therefore recommended in full.\n\nW. C. No. 283, Account No. 46.\u2014Richard N. Broderick, M. & D. A. 2562 (of Steele\u2019s Scouts), for horse taken possession of at Fort Pitt, and subsequently sold on account of Government, $150.\n\nBy permission of the Honorable the Minister, this claim is now reconsidered. A letter from Capt. Oswald and an affidavit by F. W. Warren attached leaves no doubt as to the facts. Capt. Oswald states the horse cost $100, which sum is recommended for payment, making a reduction of $50 on the claim.\nW. C. No. 40.\u2014Mrs. Philom\u00e8ne Beaupr\u00e9 of Gleichen, N. W. T., for powder, etc., $70.50, taken by order of Major-General Strange, previously reported upon and rejected. By permission of the Honorable the Minister, the claim is now reconsidered.\n\nA letter from Major-General Strange of 8th and 12th Feb., 1886, respectively, and one from J. E. Flaherty, agent C.P. Railway, show that Major-Gen. Strange was in error as to Mrs. Beaupr\u00e9 selling ammunition to the Indians. It was owing to this rumor the goods were taken possession of by the Military, and payment refused. It now appears that the powder was made up into cartridges for 9 p'r. M. L. R. Guns, consequently a fair claim against the Militia Department, and the full amount, $70.50, is recommended for payment.\n\nW. C. No. 414\u2014Thomas P. McHugh, of Calgary, N. W. T., $1,020 for hire of one 4-horse team at $12 per day. This claim had been reported upon and rejected on the ground that there were some doubts as to the team having been in Government service during the period claimed for. By permission of the Honorable the Minister the claim is now reconsidered. Declarations by T. P. McHugh and John Meagher respectively appear to leave no doubt about the team going out with a Government convoy from Calgary on or about 8th April, 1885, but there appears to be a doubt as to whether the team was kept continuously at work.\n\nDuring a period of six days after the team returned from Red Deer to Calgary the teamster was sick, consequently those days are deducted, and as all teams were reduced in price after 1st June, and to cover the doubt as to continuous work, it is considered that $9 per day for 79 days would be ample; $309 is therefore deducted and the balance, $711, recommended for payment.\n\nW. C. No. 757\u2014M. & D. A. 2658.\u2014Lyman, Sons & Co., Montreal; $691.66 for drugs, &c., supplied the 65th Battalion. This Corps was hurriedly equipped for active service, and the Surgeon considered it necessary to have a suitable supply of medicines and instruments (none having been provided previously), ordering the same from Lyman, Sons & Co., without first procuring a requisition from the proper Staff Officer. This irregularity occurred no doubt through the want of knowledge regarding the regular routine, but there is no doubt the articles were received by the Corps, and fortunately the quantity was sufficiently large to allow of a distribution to various other Corps in the North West, who were without similar supplies, as shown by the Surgeon's report.\n\nThe Commission do not think officers should be allowed to make purchases, except in cases of emergency, without authority from the proper Staff Officer, but traders do not generally know whose order should be honored, consequently ought not to suffer for irregularities of this nature. The claim, $691.66, is therefore recommended to be paid in full.\n\nIt is further suggested that the D. A. G. of the District be instructed to have balance of articles returned into District or Dominion stores.\n\nReport approved.\u2014A. P. C.\n\nW. H. JACKSON, Lt.-Col., D. A. G., Chairman.\n\nW. H. FORREST, Lt.-Col., Member.\n\nEDMUND B. HOLT,\nSecretary.\n## INDEX TO THE NAMES IN REPORTS OF THE WAR CLAIMS COMMISSION\n\n| Names                                      | W. C.

There was no fixed Departmental Medical Staff, no Field Hospital or Ambulance Service, no organized Corps of Nurses, no fixed method of recognizing such societies as the St. John's Hospital Aid Society, the Red Cross, and other similar charitable associations.\n\nAdded to these the hurried levy, the necessarily scanty equipment of many of the men consequent upon this, the severity of the weather, the difficulties of transport, exposure of the Troops to the frost and snow in open cars, the long distances to be traversed through the gaps between the finished and unfinished portions of the railway, the difficulties of communication, the distance between this city, the base of supply, and the field of operations, the Major-General Commanding having already left Winnipeg for the front with a portion of the Troops,\u2014all conspired to render the task one of unusual difficulty. Five or six regiments and two batteries, comprising the Ontario and Quebec and Nova Scotia contingents, were already on the march and were provided with, some of them at least, but very meagre or ill-regulated medical supplies and very few medical comforts. Under such circumstances, to provide attendance and comforts for the sick and the wounded, should unfortunately a collision occur between the Troops and the Half-breeds and Indians, as unfortunately did occur, appeared to be almost a hopeless task. Should any precaution be omitted or any article, no matter how trifling a character, be unprovided, I felt that I should be exposed to the severest criticism, and your Department held responsible for any of my shortcomings. Nevertheless, I felt that there should be no hesitancy: the flower of our youth was under arms,\u2014no care too great could be taken of them by the Medical Department, nor should any expense be spared in securing for them everything that could contribute to their health, their comfort and their safety; and I may now safely affirm that, whilst not extravagant, every means within the power of the Department were used to secure these ends. Matters, too, were complicated by the absence from the city of Dr. Douglas, V. C., to whom had been entrusted the preparation of Medical Supplies. Until after consultation with him, ignorant of what steps he had taken to carry out your orders, I was not in a position until the evening of Saturday, the fourth of April, to satisfactorily perfect the arrangements which I proposed to make. In the meantime I placed myself in communication with Colonel A. H. Girard of New York and Mr. Samuel Coulson of Montreal, who at my request consented to act as my purchasing agents in those cities.\n\nDr. Douglas returned upon the fourth, and placed in my hands a list of the drugs, instruments and surgical appliances which he had ordered at Montreal. On the evening of that day also, Drs. Roddick, of Montreal, and Sullivan, of Kingston, whom I had summoned by wire, reported to me here, and I put before them my views as to the necessities of the situation, and they accepted the positions, which, upon my recommendation, you had been pleased to approve should be offered to them. During the night I prepared a list, summary of which is attached hereto, of all that I believed to be necessary for the complete and thorough equipment of the Field Hospitals, and on the following morning, Sunday, transmitted it by mail\nto my agent, Mr. Coulson, with instructions to procure and forward all to Winnipeg by express train, without an hour's delay, to the end that the Field Hospital Staff, with complete hospital equipment, might overtake the Major-General and his command\u2014they were then a week in advance\u2014before they crossed the Saskatchewan, and before a collision should occur with the enemy.\n\nToo much credit cannot be given to Mr. Coulson for the manner in which he executed the order:\n\nCots, mattresses, sheets, pillows, and other articles of the kind required for the Field Hospitals were not in the market, and had to be manufactured to order. They were put in hand on the same day, (Sunday) and on Wednesday, the eighth, the complete equipment of Number One Field Hospital was shipped by car attached to mail train, and reached Winnipeg on the morning of the Tuesday following.\n\nThe equipment of Field Hospital No. 2 was despatched within a few days after, and the reserve supplies early in the following week.\n\nMuch of the equipment of the Field Hospitals it was found necessary to obtain from New York, and I must here gratefully acknowledge the rapidity and accuracy with which Col. Girard filled my orders, and forwarded everything required from that city for No. 1 Hospital, so as to reach Montreal in time to be shipped upon the same train with the stores from that city.\n\nLet me mention here that the equipment of each Field Hospital was divided as nearly as possible into four equal parts, each part in itself forming a complete equipment for an hospital of 50 beds. The hospital accommodation provided was calculated for an army of 6000 men, and for a campaign of six months. Although the number of the men in the field exceeded this number by more than 1000, the sudden collapse of the rebellion after the battle of Batoche and the surrender of Big Bear left a large portion of the supplies on hand, the perishable portion of which was at once disposed of, and the remainder retained and turned into store\u2014some of it for future use, and some of it handed over for the use of the Mounted Infantry School at Winnipeg.\n\nOf the large quantity of goods returned into store, the greater portion was of the invoice of Messrs. Lyman, Sons & Co. of Montreal. Nearly all the packages had been broken, and therefore were not so valuable, and much that had been exposed to the air was worthless. These goods I sold back to that firm at a discount of fifty per cent., excepting the instruments purchased from them, which I returned to them at the original invoice price.\n\nPrevious to the return of Dr. Douglas, and on the morning following the date of your instructions, I had the honor to recommend the appointment of a Medical Staff, the establishment of two Field Hospitals, an Ambulance Corps, a Purveyor's Department, and the framing of rules and regulations for the employment of nurses, whether voluntarily serving without pay, or as a hired staff.\n\nI also recommended that the offers of service made by the Grey Nuns and other religious orders of the Roman Catholic Church, and of Protestant ladies throughout the country, as nurses, be accepted, and that the aid of the public generally be invited in the formation of Red Cross, St. John's Hospital and other societies whose object is the care and relief of the sick and the wounded, and, the providing of medical comforts such as could not well be provided by the Department.\n\nMedical Staff.\u2014In the memorandum I had the honor to submit I recommended, the more effectually to carry out the objects enumerated above, that a Medical Staff should be constituted, as follows, under the authority of paragraph 32 of the Regulations and Orders of the Militia of Canada, 1883:\n\n1. A Medical Director-General, to be the sole responsible, administrative head of the Medical Department, of the same rank and with the same powers and pay as the Director-General of the Medical Department of the British Army.\n\n2. A Deputy-Surgeon General, with head-quarters in the field, to have, subject to the control of the Director-General, the superintendence and charge of all hospitals, ambulances, surgeons, nurses, and purveyors and such Red Cross or other societies as may be authorized by you. For the more effectual discharge of these\nduties, I directed him to report to the Major-General Commanding in the field, as well as, from time to time, to myself for your information. It to be part of his duty, and not the least important part of it, to advise, through the Major-General, or other officer in command of the Troops, on all sanitary matters pertaining to hospitals, camps, clothing, rations, drills, marches, etc., his powers, rank, and pay to be the same as those of officers holding similar positions in Her Majesty's service.\n\nPurveyor-General.\u2014The Purveyor-General to have the sole charge, at his headquarters, of the hospital marquees, or buildings and the surroundings, and to be responsible for their condition; to inspect them frequently and to remove any defects which he might discover. He to have full charge of all stores for the use of the Field Hospitals and ambulances, of all the drugs and medicines, medical and surgical appliances, and, upon requisition duly made and countersigned by the Deputy Surgeon-General, to issue such as may be required to fill deficiencies in the Field Hospitals and ambulances, or Regimental Hospitals. To this officer, as well as to the Deputy Surgeon-General or Surgeon-Major in command of each Field Hospital, full instructions as to his and their duties were forwarded, copies of which I have the honor to attach hereto.\n\nAll of these recommendations, with one exception, you were pleased to approve. You preferred that the head of the Staff should have the rank of Surgeon-General, and in the Canada Gazette of Saturday, 25th April, under the head of Militia General Orders, is to be found the following:\n\nThe following temporary medical appointments have been made, and Field Hospitals organized in connection with the force now on duty in the North-West territories:\n\nMEDICAL STAFF.\n\nTo be Surgeon-General:\nDarby Bergin, M.D., M.P., of Cornwall, Ont.\n\nTo be Deputy Surgeon-General:\nThomas G. Roddick, M.D., of Montreal, Que.\n\nTo be Purveyor:\nHon. Michael Sullivan, M.D., of Kingston, Ont.\n\nHOSPITAL AND AMBULANCE CORPS:\n\nFIELD HOSPITAL NO. 1:\n\nTo be Surgeon Major:\nCampbell Melles Douglas, V.C., late Deputy Surgeon-General H.M.'s Service.\n\nTo be Surgeons:\nDr. James Bell, of Montreal, Que.\nDr. Edward A. Gravely, of Cornwall, Ont.\nDr. J. Reddick, of Winchester, Ont.\nDr. E. Hooper, of Kingston, Ont.\nDr. Fred. Hamilton Powell, of Ottawa, Ont.\n\nFIELD HOSPITAL NO. 2:\n\nTo be Surgeon-Major:\nDr. Henry Raymond Casgrain, of Windsor, Ont.\n\nTo be Surgeon:\nDr. R. Tracy, of Belleville, Ont.\nDr. N. O. Walker, of Toronto, Ont.\nDr. Francis Murray, of Montreal, Que.\nDr. Cloutier, of St. Ars\u00e8ne, Que.\nDr. Philippe Pelletier, of Quebec, Que.\n\nThe Deputy Surgeon-General.\u2014In the selection of Dr. Roddick, as Chief of the Medical Staff in the Field, I had an eye solely to the efficient performance of the duties, to give confidence to the country that the best medical and surgical skil\nwas at the head of the service\u2014that all was done, humanly speaking, that could be done for the comfort and the safety of our young men in the North-West, and I am glad to say that his appointment gave the greatest satisfaction and inspired universal confidence. One of the most distinguished of Canadian Surgeons, young, full of vigor, of powerful physique, knowing no fatigue, a first-class horseman, I looked upon him as just the man for the place, and the result, as shown by the letters of our sick and wounded who were under his care, and of the Press, which is never slow to detect error or mismanagement\u2014and equally ready, I must say, to offer a generous meed of praise, where found to be due\u2014has amply justified his selection and stamped approval upon his work.\n\nThe Purveyor-General.\u2014Hardly second in importance to the Deputy-Surgeon, General was the officer to whom was to be trusted the control of the supplies, and of the comforts provided for the hospitals. Upon him was to depend the careful, economical, and the honest distribution of the large quantities of stores to be committed to his charge. Experience in camps of instruction and in frontier service, long taught me that there was little limit to the wants and to the demands of Regimental Surgeons for medical and other supplies. The opinion prevailed among them that, so long as stores were provided by the Government, they were at liberty to requisition for them, almost without curb or restraint; and the result was a wasteful and, shall I say it, an extravagant misappropriation of the public property. To check and to prevent such waste and such misappropriation required at the head of this branch of the service a man with a thorough knowledge of its wants and of its requirements, who knew what to give and what to refuse\u2014what was necessary equally for a Surgeon in charge of a Detachment or a Regiment. Such a man I found in the Hon. Dr. Sullivan, Professor of Surgery, Royal College of Surgeons, Kingston. To him I offered the position of Purveyor-General, and it gives me great satisfaction to say that he filled it with credit to himself and to the great advantage of the country. He was emphatically the right man in the right place. He knew when to say no, and had the courage then to say it.\n\nOrderlies and Dressers.\u2014In addition to physicians and surgeons, Field Hospitals required dressers, orderlies and nurses, and there being no Ambulance Corps, or trained bearer companies, it was necessary to provide them on the instant. I was aware that in some of the medical schools, during the past year or two, more or less attention had been given to ambulance work, and at Montreal and Toronto lessons in First Aid and Stretcher Drill had been given and classes formed by Dr. Bell, of McGill College, and Dr. O\u2019Reilly, surgeon to the Toronto General Hospital, and other surgeons of that city. Upon its being made known that I would accept volunteers for this work, almost every medical student in the Dominion, without exception, volunteered his service, showing a spirit worthy of the highest praise, asking only as remuneration that he be sent to the front free of transport expense. I accepted the services of as many of these young gentlemen as I possibly could, without entailing too great outlay; but I recommended that in no case should service be accepted without pay. It was manifest to me that the Hospitals, to be of real benefit to the sick and to the wounded, must be under the most perfect discipline, and experience teaches that where men are employed in any service which is voluntary, and to which no pay is attached, they feel under very little restraint, and are not inclined to practice the virtue of obedience, beyond what it may please them at the moment to observe. So many having volunteered as dressers, orderlies, stretcher-bearers, or helpers in any capacity, in the field or in the hospitals, I requested Dr. Fenwick, the eminent Professor of Surgery of McGill College, Montreal, to select the number necessary for one Field Hospital, from the graduating class, and the third and second year students of his University. Dr. O\u2019Reilly of Toronto was kind enough to make the selection for the other Hospital from the similar classes of the Universities in that city. Many of these young men did noble work, regardless of danger. Where the bullets fell thickest, with a heroism that has never been exceeded, they were to be found, removing the wounded and the dying to places of shelter and of safety in the rear. Some cases of individual\nheroism are reported to me, which I feel call for more than a passing remark; and embolden me to say that amongst these non-combatant lads; and the Staff to which they belonged, are to be found some of the greatest heroes of the war. At Batoche I am told that during the fight a flag was thrust from the window of the church, and was observed by a surgeon and a student who were under shelter from the fire at a couple of hundred yards distance. The student immediately he perceived it proposed that a party should at once go to the relief of the one demanding succor. No one appeared willing to second his proposal. To go to the church through the open under such a terrible fire as was being poured from the Half-breed pits, seemed to be like proceeding to certain death; but persisting, the surgeon said, \"if you are determined to go and we can find two volunteers to assist us in carrying a stretcher I am with you.\" Two men from the Grenadiers of Toronto at once stepped forward; and the four started upon their perilous journey\u2014crawling upon their bellies\u2014taking advantage of any little inequality of ground to cover them, and to shield them from the bullets of the Half-breeds. They reached the church\u2014the bullets tearing up the earth all around them\u2014without a scratch, and, breathing a short prayer for their deliverance thus far from death and danger, they looked around for him whom they had risked, and were still risking, their lives, to succor and to save. They found him in the person of a venerable priest, who had been wounded in the thigh, and they at once proceeded to remove him, after administering temporary aid. To remain in the church was to court certain death. To return to their corps seemed to be no less perilous; but they chose the latter. When they sortied from the church, so astonished were the Half-breeds at their daring that they ceased their fire for a moment. This time, returning, they had no cover, and were obliged to march erect. Bullets flew thick and fast; but the condition of the wounded man precluded anything like hurry, and they hastened slowly. God watched over them and protected them, and they reached their comrades in safety\u2014their wounded charge also escaping without further harm. Such conduct deserves recognition, and I beg respectfully to call attention to it in this official way. I have not yet been able to obtain the names of the two noble fellows belonging to the Grenadiers, but I hope this notice of it will bring the information I desire. The other two are Surgeon Gravely of No. 1 Field Hospital, and Mr. Norris Worthington, from the same Hospital.\n\nThe manner in which Capt. Mason was rescued and brought in by, I believe, Dr. Codd of the 90th and one of the young dressers was an exhibition of marked courage by members of the Medical Staff. Other instances well deserving of commendation have been reported to me, and I would respectfully suggest enquiry into all such cases, and, if they be found as reported to me, that honorable recognition of them be made.\n\nNurses.\u2014Your invitation to the different religious orders, both Protestant and Catholic, and to ladies generally throughout the country, to volunteer as nurses to our brave youth who might unfortunately be the victims of disease, or of wounds received in battle, was promptly answered by communities and individuals from all parts of the Dominion. The Nuns, ever ready at the call of charity, placed themselves at your disposal as did the Sisters of St. John the Divine, belonging to the Church of England at Toronto, and ladies of the highest standing throughout the country, some of them trained under Florence Nightingale, many of them in the Hospitals of London and New York, offered their services, all without fee or reward. Nor was the offer of service as nurses confined to Canada. Many such offers came from ladies in the United States, begging to be permitted to share in the work of charity. Where so many offered to take part in the holy work it was difficult for me to choose, and I hesitated for a time before making a selection. It was not until the removal of the Base Hospital from Swift Current to Moosejaw, a more convenient and more healthful situation, to which Hospital all were removed from Saskatoon that could be moved with safety, that, with your approval I accepted the services of the Sisters of St. John the Divine of Toronto. Dr. Roddick, the Deputy Surgeon-General, and the Honorable Dr. Sullivan bear\ntestimony to the value of their services and have for them nothing but praise. Dr. Boyd of London; who pronounced the hospitals at Saskatoon and Moosejaw to be the best equipped and best managed he ever saw, also adds his testimony in their favor. I must congratulate the Lady Superior upon the economical way in which she performed her work and of the careful management of the funds entrusted to her to cover the expenses of the return journey of herself and staff. Of the $200 confided to her for that purpose, she returned, if my memory serves me well, about $70. May I be permitted to suggest that a contribution towards the furnishing of their new Home at Toronto would be a graceful act, and would be appreciated and approved by the country.\n\nLadies' Aid Societies.\u2014Before the first echo of the news of the Battle of Fish Creek, which had been flashed over the wires, had died away, offers to form St. John's Hospital Aid Societies and other similar Societies, came to me from all parts of the Dominion. The ladies of St. John's Church, Prescott, led the way, and were almost immediately followed by the ladies of Montreal, Toronto, London, Hamilton, and other places, proposing to furnish bandages, clothing, necessaries, medical comforts and even delicacies for the sick and the wounded. Under your instructions I directed that all such goods delivered to the Purveyor-General or his agent at Winnipeg would be forwarded to the parties to whom they were directed in the field, free of expense to the senders, by the Government Transport Corps. I regret to say that this system was not found to work well; and I would recommend that in the future, should unfortunately this country be again engaged in war, all such medical comforts and supplies, whether furnished by Aid Societies to troops in the Field or by individuals to their friends serving in the army, should be undertaken by an association or a society formed expressly for that purpose. I would also recommend\u2014the experience of the late campaign having shewn that large quantities of useless material were forwarded\u2014that every package should be opened, inspected, all that was useless withdrawn, and only that which was of value repacked and forwarded. It is manifest that this duty is not one for the Government; and should be confided to private civil associations. Much of the material, collected after much labor and at great cost, never reached the poor fellows for whom it was intended, was stolen by the way, plundered, I am ashamed to say by the teamsters, and some, as we are informed, fell into the hands of Poundmaker and his braves, who for some days feasted gloriously upon potted meats, preserved fruits, marmalades and jellies; and held high carnival with the fine brandies and luscious wines intended for the brave fellows shut up in Battleford.\n\nRed Cross Corps.\u2014The suggestion to invite the formation of a Red Cross Corps was promptly met; and, with your approval, I accepted the offer of Mr. Edwin Wragge, Local General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway at Toronto, to organize a Red Cross Corps in that city, and authorized the formation of one by him, whose duty it was to be to look after the sick and the wounded, in the field, and who were to undergo instruction in First Aid and Stretcher Drill during the week previous to their departure for the front under the direction of Dr. Nattress of Toronto. This drill consisted of lifting up into and lifting from the ambulance in such a manner as not to injure or cause discomfort to the wounded, and of placing them on and removing them from the stretchers; the proper method of stretcher-bearing, and of removing them from the stretchers to the beds in the hospitals; they were also instructed in the proper methods of arresting hemorrhage, of bandaging, of setting fractures and of giving temporary relief and assistance until the aid of the Surgeons in the rear or in the hospitals could be obtained.\n\nThe gentlemen belonging to this Corps were almost without exception young medical men, graduates in medicine and surgery, who performed the duty without pay. They were provided with transport and rations at the expense of the Government, and upon their arrival at Swift Current were ordered to Battleford, and there placed under the command of Brigade-Surgeon Strange, arriving at that point, almost immediately after the battle of Cut Knife; under the direction of that officer, they rendered valuable service in the Hospital there.\nWines and Spirits.\u2014Anticipating that, through the mistaken kindness of friends in the older Provinces, quantities of wines and spirits would be forwarded with the supplies and comforts, I directed that, under no circumstances, should such be forwarded to the Troops in the field. That wines and spirits could only be allowed for hospital use, and, if forwarded to the Purveyor, would be confiscated by him, placed in the hospital stores employed for no other purpose than for the sick, and then only, upon requisition made by the Surgeon in charge of the Hospital, who would be held responsible therefor; and in any case, where the Purveyor was of opinion that the quantity asked for was in excess of the requirements he was directed to issue no more than, in his opinion, was really necessary, reporting his refusal and reasons therefor, to the Deputy Surgeon-General for the information of the Major-General Commanding.\n\nRecommendations.\u2014Having thus briefly sketched the operations of the Medical Staff in the field, I may be permitted to direct attention to that which I consider to be the especial weakness of the service\u2014I mean the regimental system. During the late campaign it was found to be expensive, extravagant and almost unmanageable. With the exception, I think, of two or three corps, the Queen's Own, the Grenadiers and the Seventh Battalion, no Regimental Surgeon accompanied his regiment to the front. The Sixty-fifth, the Ninth, the Halifax Battalion, the Montreal Garrison Artillery, and others from the older Provinces, all took with them Volunteer Surgeons, and, with the exception of the Halifax Battalion, not one of them\u2014of the Surgeons attached for the campaign\u2014has made a satisfactory report of the cases treated by him or of the sanitary or unsanitary condition of his regiment that has reached me.\n\nSurgeons recruited in an emergency\u2014Regimental System.\u2014Surgeons recruited in an emergency without any previous military medical training, are apt to be and as in some instances during the late campaign were found to be, very inefficient and, from their want of discipline and ignorance of military law, were very difficult of control, and gave no adequate service in return for the large amounts of money expended upon them for transport, pay and rations.\n\nMedical Staff Corps.\u2014I strongly recommend, therefore, that a Medical Staff Corps be formed, very much on the lines of the Medical Staff Corps of Her Majesty's service, due regard being had to the differences of conditions and nature of the two services. The British Medical Service, being a permanent one, ours, so to speak, being more of a temporary charter, its component parts often varying, frequently changing. The system which I propose includes an administrative and executive staff, Field Hospital Corps, Ambulance Corps and a Military Cadet Corps. From this latter, year by year, the Staff Surgeons to be drawn. In my opinion there should be a Surgeon-General, the administrative head of the service, a Deputy Surgeon-General in each of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, a Deputy Surgeon-General for the Maritime Provinces, a Deputy Surgeon-General for Manitoba, for the North-West Territories and British Columbia, one Brigade-Surgeon in each military district, one Surgeon-Major to each brigade division,\u2014the present Regimental Surgeons, whilst not severing their connection entirely with their regiments, to be considered as Surgeons of the Staff so long as they remain within their brigade divisions. To meet the future requirements of the service, both for Surgeons of the Staff, Field Hospitals and Ambulance Corps, I beg to recommend that Medical Cadet Corps be established at the seats of our medical schools, say at Montreal, Toronto, Kingston, London, Halifax and Winnipeg; and thoroughly taught Ambulance and Field Hospital work. After graduation, having passed a satisfactory examination, they would be eligible as Surgeons of the Staff. During their pupilage they can be made available, should the necessity arise, as quarter-masters, assistant quarter-masters, hospital sergeants, hospital orderlies, dressers, etc. From them could be obtained also, if necessary, some of the material for bearer companies.\nBefore appointment as a Surgeon each candidate should be subjected to an examination, which should embrace the following subjects:\n\na. Military surgery, including transport of sick and wounded.\nb. Military medicine and pathology and therapeutics.\nc. Military hygiene.\nd. Duties of executive medical officers, during peace and war.\n\nHe must also give evidence of having attended a complete course of operative surgery in some recognized Medical University; and, in the presence of the examiners, write a thesis upon some military medical or hygienic subject. All warrant officers should pass an examination such as is required by the medical regulations of Her Majesty's army. No Staff Surgeon should be promoted to the rank of Surgeon-Major until after ten years' service. No Surgeon-Major should be appointed to the rank of Brigade-Surgeon except on the grounds of ability and merit; and in accordance with the regulations laid down for the Medical Department of Her Majesty's army.\n\nThe establishment of a Cadet Corps would entail some expense, but this would be trifling in comparison with the benefits to be derived; and if an annual allowance were made to the several Medical Universities, to enable them to give a full course each year, upon the subjects above mentioned, Canada would, in a few years, have as an efficient Medical Staff Corps as any country in the world. If possible, and I think it is, a Field Hospital should be attached to every camp of instruction and bearer companies should be formed in proportion to the strength of the brigade division. The camps of instruction, or as many of them as it be possible, should be inspected by the Surgeon-General or, in his absence, by the Deputy Surgeon-General of the Province. The Surgeon-General should also inspect the Infantry School Barracks and Hospitals at least twice a year; should inform himself thoroughly as to their sanitary condition and as to the manner in which the Attending Surgeons perform their duties, and report thoroughly thereon, through the Major-General Commanding, for the information of the Honorable the Minister of Militia and Defence. This would entail some little expense, as it would occupy that officer probably 20 or 25 days in the year, but the country would reap a corresponding advantage.\n\nTransport Service.\u2014Owing to the long distances which had to be traversed between the Base Line and the Troops in the field, and the want of a Medical Transport Service, it was found very difficult to forward medical supplies to the various Hospitals, at Battleford, Calgary and Saskatoon, and to the head-quarters of the columns of the North West Field Force. To remedy this, I would recommend that each Military District be supplied with at least one hospital cart and in the event of active service one should be attached, with a Surgeon in charge, who should have under him one Apothecary and two Orderlies. One such cart, upon the model of the U. S. army cart, which will contain everything needful for a brigade, I have had constructed\u2014a full description of which I send herewith.\n\nTo each Field Hospital in each district there should be attached, at the least, six ambulance waggons; but, insomuch as the strong express waggon, such as is used by the Express Companies in our cities, can be readily converted into ambulances; and as it is to be hoped that many years will elapse before necessity arises for their use, I do not recommend the construction of any at this moment. The few stores now on hand and not required for the use of the Infantry Schools I recommend to be sold. They consist principally of instruments, the greater number of which were purchased in New York at the contract price to the Purveyor's Department of the United States Army, which is much below the price at which surgeons can purchase them from the manufacturers; and I would recommend that medical men should have the opportunity of purchasing them out of store at the original cost price. There are also in store a large number of I. R. sheets, which were not used, are in perfect order, and might be sold on the same terms as the instruments. These sheets are white, finished on both sides, of the best material, and were obtained at a very great reduction upon the usual retail price.\nThe goods sent out by Her Royal Highness the Princess Louise, but which were not used because the Hospitals were already sufficiently supplied before their arrival, are now being distributed by you to the Hospitals and charities, which, in your opinion most need them, in accordance with Her Royal Highness' instructions; and I take occasion here to express the gratitude, which I, in common with all loyal Canadians felt at this manifestation on her part, of her continued interest in the welfare of Canada and the Canadians.\n\nI beg to bring to your notice the zeal and ability displayed by Mr. J. A. Polkinghorne, whom you assigned to my office. He was untiring in the performance of his duties, and deserves not only especial mention by me here, but adequate remuneration in the shape of extra pay, his work not having been limited to the ordinary office hours, but extending until two and three, and frequently four, o'clock of the morning.\n\nOf the manner in which the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Grand Trunk Railway managed their part of the Transport Service I cannot speak too highly. The former transported a car laden with medical stores from Montreal to Winnipeg, via Chicago, in six days and a few hours, and the latter railway in somewhat less than six days. A rapidity unprecedented.\n\nThe details of the several Hospitals will be found in the several reports of the Deputy Surgeon-General and Purveyor-General appended hereto; and I desire to express my high appreciation of the manner in which they performed their duties.\n\nIt would be ungrateful of me to close this report without most warmly thanking Purveyor General Baxter of the United States Army, who in the friendliest unofficial way, gave me the benefit of his large experience, supplying me with hints and suggestions that much facilitated me in the work so new to me, and enabled me to save large amounts of money to the country.\n\nI append also a list of the Pension Boards.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

To be large enough to carry three (3) boxes for stores, each 18 inches wide, 36 inches long, and 18 inches high.\n\n2nd. The weight of the finished cart, with wheels and empty boxes, must not exceed 600 lbs., and have strength of frame sufficient to withstand a load of 800 lbs.\n\n3rd. The cart-wheels must be interchangeable with the hind wheels of the new ambulance wagon.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS.\n\nWHEELS.\u2014The wheels will be 4 feet 2 inches high (without tires), the hubs (of best elm) 6\u00bd inches in diameter at centre, 5\u00bc inches at butt, and 4\u00be inches at the point, by 9 inches in length; butt with iron bands on each end mortised for sixteen (16) spokes. Size of mortise 1\u00bd inches by 9\u00bd inch with a \u00bd inch disk. Spokes (best seasoned hickory) 1\u00bd inches by \u00bd inch (hub tenon) felloe tenon, round \u00bc inch in diameter; felloes (best hickory) 1\u00bd inches, two (2) pieces for each wheel; tire (best charcoal iron) 1\u00bd inches wide, by \u00bd inch thick, fastened on with eight (8) tire-bolts in each wheel; two (2) felloe-plates in each wheel over joints.\n\nAXLE.\u2014Of best quality refined iron 1\u00bd inch square for 7 inches from each collar-washer, the remainder rounded. Collar-washer 2\u00bd inches in diameter, \u00bd inch thick; wheel-boxes of best quality foundry iron, 7\u00bd inches long, 1\u00bd inches in diameter, 7\u00bd inch thick at butt; 1\u00bd inches in diameter, and 5\u00bd inch thick at point, with two (2) lugs, 2 inches long, \u00bd-inch high. Oil-chamber, 2 inches long, 1\u00bd inch deep, to commence 2\u00bd inches from the butt. Weight of box, not less than 4\u00bd lbs. each. Axle to be arranged to track five feet from centre to centre of wheels.\n\nBODY.\u2014Outside length 57\u00bd inches, width 40\u00bd inches, height 8 inches. Inside length 54\u00bd inches, width 38 inches, height 6 inches. Frame, of oak, consisting of two (2) exterior side-sills and two (2) end cross-bars, size 1\u00bd by 2\u00bd inches. Centre cross-bar 2 inches by \u00bd inch, and two (2) interior cross-bars, at half distance between the centre and the ends, 2 inches by \u00bd inch; all cross-bars, except the tail-bar, are mortised into the side-sills, and are even with them at bottom; the tail-bar is mortised to receive the sill-tenons. The tenons of the end bars are of one-third thickness; those of the interior bars are of half the thickness. The floor planks will be ash, \u00bd inch thick, and level with the top of the side-sills. The upper rails are 1\u00bd inches by 1 inch, and extend over the sides and front, and are vertical. The side panels of the body are of ash, screwed, each side, to six (6) single studs and to a front double corner stud; the front panel of the body, also of ash, \u00bd inch thick, is screwed in like manner, to three (3) single studs and the double corner studs, to which the sides are attached. These studs are all tenoned into the side sills and upper rails. The studs are 5 inches long; the single ones \u00bd inch by 1 inch, and chamfered at their exterior corners between the sill and upper rail. The double corner studs are made from square pieces 1\u00bd by 1\u00bd inches. The sides and front of the body are stayed by upright rods and flat angle-irons about the front corners and the sides, also by upright and brace-rods at the rear. The ends of the rear cross-bar and the centre-bar project 4\u00bd inches beyond each side to receive lower ends of these braces. The tail-board is framed of \u00be inch (panel) boards of ash, screwed to five (5) studs \u00be by 1 inch, mortised into a top and bottom rail 1 inch by 1\u00bd inches. The length of tail-board extends even with the exterior of the sides. The tail-board will be hung to the rear cross-bar by three light hinges to stand even with the end of bar when upright, and will be held closed by means of hooks attached to the sides, and hooking into eyes attached to the irons on the upper rail of the tail-board.\n\nSPRINGS.\u2014Two (2) side half-springs, perpendicular to the axle, and clipped beneath it, connected in front by a cross-spring. The side springs are to be 48\ninches long, of English No. 3 oil-tempered steel, of five (5) leaves, 2 inches wide. The cross-spring, of the same number of leaves, of the same width and thickness and 38 inches long, or of sufficient length to connect the side-springs. The eye will be of double thickness, and have eye-bolts 7-16 of an inch. The spread of the springs should be as slight as will keep the body off the axle. The cross-spring will be bolted to an iron cross-piece, which is bolted to the shafts and side-sills. The side-springs will be clipped beneath the axle, by pairs of clips, screwed by nuts, with brass spring-blocks. Behind, the side-springs will be bolted to the sills by iron V-pieces, as may be found most convenient. India-rubber buffers may be interposed over the clips of the side-springs to the axle.\n\nThe Shafts are made of ash, 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) by 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches, separated 22 inches in front, and 30\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches at the foot-board. They will be somewhat curved, so as to carry the body nearly level, or with a slight inclination downwards at the rear. They are, bolted to the body through the front-cross bar and the forward interior bars, being also locked by mortises 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches deep at each bolt. A foot-board 4 feet long 8 inches wide and 1 inch thick, of oak, is bolted to the top of the side-sills, which extend 8 inches in front of the body, to receive the foot-board. The bolts also pass through triangular blocks placed between the foot-board and the sills, and also on the shafts, which give a suitable inclination to the board.\n\nSwingle-tree and Splinter-bar.\u2014The draft is made from the axle by means of two (2) wrought-iron rods \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch in diameter, bolted under the foot-board to an oaken splinter-bar, to which the swingle-tree is attached. The swingle-tree will conform to that used in the ambulance wagon.\n\nChests.\u2014There will be three (3) chests, interchangeable, and consequently of uniform dimensions, viz., 36 inches long, 18 inches wide, 18 inches high. They will be made of half-inch boards of walnut or ash, and firmly framed, and secured against splits or strains by light steel straps and angle braces. The bottoms of the boxes will be covered with sheet zinc, and the tops by cow-hide. The under corners will be supplied with strong castors, and at the middle of each end there will be strong iron folding-handles, which must not project more than half an inch when folded down. The chests will open from above by hinged-lids, and will be secured, each, by two suitable bolts and locks equidistant from either end.\n\nSlide-board.\u2014A slide-board, to lower the boxes from the cart to the ground, will be carried on iron loops attached underneath the body, so that when drawn to the rear, to be used as a slide, the hooks at the front end will hold by the rear loops, and when not wanted for use this board will slide back on its loop, and be secured by a thumb-screw.\n\nTarpaulin.\u2014A canvas cover, about 6\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) by 5 feet, will be provided with eyelets at the four corners, to be secured to suitable adjustable fastenings to the four corner studs.\n\nPainting.\u2014The cart will be painted of the color and finish of caissons and other ordnance carriages, the iron work black. The letters D. C., four inches high, will be painted at the centre of each side panel. Near the front end of each side panel a stencil mark will be placed with the inscription, in small characters, Transport Cart; D. C. Med. Dept.\n\nIn carrying out this work, the endeavor has been made to select from the standard supply table of the Medical Department such medicines, stores, appliances and utensils as experience has proved to be useful, and necessary for the ordinary emergencies of field service, and to arrange them compactly and conveniently.\n\nAs the supply table has been strictly conformed to in the preparation of the list for furnishing these chests, it will be possible to refurnish them from the stores usually found at even the more remote frontier posts. Under the circumstances ordinarily attendant upon scouts, expeditions, and marches, it is believed that the quantity and variety of the supply furnished will be abundantly adequate for a force of not less than five hundred troops for a period of three months. The medicine\nchest has been divided by means of accurately fitting trays into five divisions, the trays subdivided into spaces and compartments for the disposal of medicines, appliances, etc., and, so far as possible, these spaces and compartments have been constructed with reference to the average size and form of the original package or article furnished for the Medical Department, so that the chest may be readily and quickly filled from any dispensary.\n\n**MEDICINE CHEST.**\u2014The medicine chest is furnished with five trays covered by accurately fitting lids. The trays are of black walnut, and are seventeen and a half inches long, sixteen and three-quarter inches wide, and vary in depth and in their subdivisions.\n\nAll the trays are readily raised by apertures for the fingers cut near the upper edges of the ends.\n\nTray No. 1 is five inches in depth and is subdivided into three compartments. One compartment is intended for stationery, the two others for miscellaneous articles, as enumerated in the subjoined list:\n\n**TRAY NO. 1 OF MEDICINE CHEST.**\n\n**COMPARTMENT A contains\u2014**\n\n- Paper, cap, ruled, Quire 1.\n- Paper, Quarto-post, ruled, Quire 1.\n- Paper, note, ruled, Quire 1.\n- Envelopes, official, large, No. 25.\n- Envelopes, official, small, No. 25.\n- Inkstand, traveller's, filled, No. 1.\n- Pencils, lead, Faber's, No. 2, No. 6.\n- Pens, Gillott's steel, No. 12.\n- Penholders, No. 6.\n- Ink, carmine, bottles, 1.\n- Mucilage, bottles, 1.\n- Elastic rubber-bands, doz., 1.\n- Pocket register for patients, No. 1.\n\n**COMPARTMENT B contains\u2014**\n\n- Pill Tile, 8 by 6, No. 1.\n- Probang, No. 1.\n- Ichthyocolla plaster, in case, yards, 1.\n- Fountain syringe in case, No. 1.\n- Assorted corks, box, 1.\n- Pill Boxes, paper, No. 1.\n- Matches, in tin box, boxes, 1.\n\n**COMPARTMENT C contains\u2014**\n\n- Brass Spirit Lamp, with wicking, No. 1.\n- Hard Rubber penis syringe, No. 1.\n- Tape measure, No. 1.\n- Suspensory Bandages, No. 6.\n- Needle-case, filled, No. 1.\n- Pins, papers, L.\n- Tape, roll, 1.\n\nTray No. 2, of the same dimensions as Tray No. 1, is subdivided into forty-one compartments, and is intended for medicines and such pharmaceutical appliances as are necessary to fit out a temporary dispensary for the field.\n\n**TRAY NO. 2 OF MEDICINE CHEST.**\n\nThis Tray contains\u2014\n\n- Extractum Hyoscyami, in 1 oz. pots, oz. 2.\n- Extractum Conii, in 1 oz. pots, oz. 2.\n- Extractum Belladonnae, in 1 oz. pots, oz. 2.\n- Soda Bicarbonas, oz. 6.\n- Ipecacuanhae pulvis, oz. 4.\n- Phyllus Extracti Uloecynth, Comp.

The remainder of the chest is left vacant for packing the larger utensils.\n\nTray No. 1 is four inches in depth and is subdivided.\n\nTRAY NO. 1 OF MESS CHEST.\n\nThis Tray contains\u2014\n\nKnives, table, No. 12.\nKnives, carving, No. 1.\nForks, table, No. 12.\nForks, carving, No. 1.\nSpoons, table, No. 12.\nSpoons, tea, No. 12.\nNutmeg grater, No. 1.\nPlates, tin, doz. 1.\nPepper box, No. 1.\nSalt box, No. 1.\nTin case for matches, No. 1.\n\nTray No. 2 of the mess chest is five inches in depth, and, designed for cans and packages of various sizes, is not divided into compartments.\n\nTRAY NO. 2 OF MESS CHEST.\n\nThis Tray is intended to be packed with extract of beef in cans or jars, condensed milk in cans, farina in papers, corn-starch in papers, and any other article of nourishment or comfort for the sick which may be regarded as necessary by the medical officer.\nTray No. 3, six inches deep, is divided into compartments and furnished with tin cans.\n\n**TRAY NO. 3 OF MESS CHEST.**\n\nThis tray contains cans for\u2014\n\n- Butter,\n- Coffee, ground; or green,\n- Pepper,\n\nSalt,\nSugar,\nTea; or for any other articles desired.\n\nThe large space in the chest unoccupied by the Trays is to be packed with the following articles:\n\n- Basin, tin, washstand, No. 2.\n- Cleaver, No. 1.\n- Cups, Britannia, No. 12.\n- Cups, tin (1 qt., 1 pt.), No. 2.\n- Dippers, assorted, No. 2.\n- Dishes, tin, No. 6.\n- Grater, large, No. 1.\n- Gridiron, No. 1.\n- Kettles, camp, covered, No. 1.\n- Kettles, tea, iron, No. 1.\n\nKnives, butchers', No. 1.\nLadles, No. 1.\nLantern, No. 1.\nPans, frying, No. 1.\nPans, sauce, No. 1.\nPots, coffee, tin, No. 1.\nPots, tea, tin, No. 1.\nSaws, butchers', No. 1.\nSteelyards, No. 1.\nTrays, tin, No. 1.\n\nTo secure the articles contained in the mess chest against injury by motion it will be advisable to pack the spaces firmly with oakum, or some yielding and clean material.

RODDICK,\nDeputy Surgeon-General, Montreal.\n\nSIR,\n\nAs principal Medical Officer, upon your arrival at Qu'Appelle, or at the head quarters of the General Commanding, you will, with the junction of the General at once, or at such time as may appear to him to be necessary, issue such instructions regarding sanitary precautions to be observed for protecting the health of the Troops as he may consider requisite for the guidance of the Medical Officers.\n\nYou had better appoint a Brigade Surgeon, with the approval of the General, who shall daily inspect the camp, and especially inform himself as to the health of the Troops, and of the appearance of any zymotic disease amongst them, and he shall immediately on being informed of the appearance of any such disease, examine into the cause of the same, whether such disease proceed from or is aggravated by sanitary defects in the camp, bad or deficient water-supply, dampness, marshy ground, insufficient clothing, or from any local cause; or from bad food, intemperance, unwholesome liquors, fruit or want of shelter, too much exposure, fatigue, or any other cause, and report immediately to the Major-General Commanding, on such causes, and the immediate measures necessary for their removal, sending a copy of all such reports to the Medical Director General here, and report at least once daily, on the progress or declining of the disease, and on the means adopted for the removal of its causes, until the disease shall have come to an end. You will at such intervals as I shall hereafter direct forward to me full information on all subjects connected with the hygiene of the force, together with such recommendations for improving this service as you or the Brigade-Major may report to you to be requisite. All Medical Officers in charge of Field Hospitals should transmit to you, for the guidance of your Brigade Sanitary Officer, full information as to the sanitary state of the Troops and the Hospitals, and on all matters affecting the health and physical efficiency of the men, at such intervals as I may from time to time direct.\n\nYou will direct the Sanitary Officers in the field, and the Surgeon-Major of each Field Hospital, to draw up a weekly sanitary report on the state of the Army, and of the hospitals, to be sent to you for the information of the General Commanding, a copy of which you will please transmit to me immediately upon its receipt.\n\nUpon your arrival at the head-quarters of the Major General, and immediately after having reported yourself to him, ascertain the amount of transport that will be required for the sick, the nature and extent of the stores and supplies of all kinds necessary for such transport, and the number of Medical Officers and attendants that you may deem to be necessary.\n\nYou will be furnished from this office without delay with a detail of each Field hospital including the Surgeon-Major and Surgeons, Dressers and Dispensers. As all the Field Hospitals and the Purveyor's department are under your control and direction, you will make a special inspection of all the stores, medicines, drugs, medical comforts, beds, cots, bedding, utensils and arrangements for cooking. You will see that the stores and water-supply are good and sufficient; that there is a due proportion of Medical Officers according to the number and state of the sick, and that in case of the transport of the sick a sufficient number of Orderlies, at least one in every ten of the sick, is provided.\n\nShould you discover any defects in any of the above particulars likely to affect injuriously the health of the Troops during their transport, you will forthwith report the same in writing to the General Commanding, and transmit copy of your report to the Brigade-Surgeon, and instruct him to forward the same with his remarks to this office.\nYou will be careful, when requisitions for instruments, surgical appliances and medical comforts are presented to you by Regimental or Detachment Surgeons, to ascertain beyond any doubt that necessity exists for the issue asked for, and that it is not in excess of the actual need or want of the regiment or detachment; and in all cases, when possible to obtain it, for anything beyond a small quantity which is of immediate urgency (in this you will use your discretion) you should obtain the signature of the Major-General Commanding.\n\nI must ask you to use the telegraph wire as seldom as possible, and when using it to be most concise, so as to bring the expenditure of your department under that head to the lowest possible amount.\n\nYou will please advise me by letter immediately upon your arrival as to the health of the staff of the Field Hospital which you will take with you to-morrow morning from Montreal to headquarters.\n\nThe staff of Field Hospital No. 2 will follow you within a day or two.\n\nThe Purveyor, who will also have charge of the medicines, instruments and surgical appliances and medical comforts necessary for the use of the Troops in the North-West, will leave to-morrow night with his assistants, and, within a week or ten days at the furthest, will have a supply of all that is needed for the sick in the hospital or in the field, upon which you can draw by requisition whenever you may have occasion to do so.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. BERGIN,\nMedical Director-General.\n(E).\u2014INSTRUCTIONS TO PURVEYOR-GENERAL, HON. DR. SULLIVAN.\n\nOttawa, April 10, 1885.\n\nHon. Dr. Sullivan,\nKingston, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that you have been appointed Purveyor to the Medical Branch of the Militia Department, and, until further orders, with headquarters at Winnipeg, to which point you will proceed without any delay. Upon your arrival you will report by wire to the Major-General Commanding in the field, and you will be responsible to the Medical Officer in charge of the Troops in Manitoba and the North-West Territories, for the proper performance of your duties.\n\n2. In all matters of discipline, you will be under the command of the Major-General, and you are bound to obey all orders issued by him, with reference to the duties of your department.\n\n3. On all matters of importance connected with your duties, which do not admit of reference to me here, you will do well to address the Major-General Commanding, and obtain his opinion and advice. In all such instances, your reference will be made through the Medical Officer in charge, the Deputy Surgeon-General.\n\n4. You will have the sole charge at Winnipeg, or at whatever point the Major-General Commanding may decide to fix the Base Hospital, of all buildings and surroundings, be responsible for their condition, inspect them frequently, at convenient hours, take instant steps to remove any defects which you may discover, or which may be brought to your notice by the Surgeon-Major Commanding the Hospital, or other inspecting officer.\n\n5. Under you, steps must be taken for the cleanliness and order of the Hospital and its surroundings, and you will be responsible that they are kept in a perfectly cleanly state.\n\n6. You will take care that the culinary arrangements for the Hospital are complete, that the cook and his assistants discharge their duties properly; that the cooking and all kitchen utensils are kept perfectly clean, that the patients' meals are properly prepared, and punctually served.\n\n7. You will take every precaution to prevent any waste of fuel.\n\n8. It will be your duty to see that the men employed in the kitchens are steady, cleanly, and instructed so as to make them efficient cooks after a short training. I shall endeavor to provide you with cookery books to aid you in this branch of your work.\n\n9. You will report to the Deputy Surgeon-General from time to time the names of such of the assistant cooks, or of the hospital orderlies as, in your opinion, are fit to take charge as cooks of divisional hospitals, should such be established.\n\n10. You will obtain every morning, from the Medical Officers in charge at Winnipeg, the name, regiment, rank, regimental number, and the date of admission, death or discharge of every man treated in the Hospital.\n\n11. You will be careful, on the admission of a soldier into the Hospital, to receive over his pack, etc., and to enter a list of the contents thereof in a pack store check-book which you will keep for that purpose. The condition of the man's effects when received must be indicated on the face of the list by initial letters, thus: 'N' for new, 'G' for good, 'B' for bad, and 'W' for worn, and great care must be observed in registering the articles correctly, so that no dispute may arise on the discharge of the man from the Hospital. A duplicate list is to be prepared and handed to the ward-master, or other non-commissioned officer in charge. The pages of the check-books are to be numbered consecutively, and in the index the name of each man is to be entered in regimental order, the number of the pack being specified against his name. On his discharge he is to receive the pack from the pack store, on the production of the said duplicate, duly receipted.\n12. The effects are to be carefully put up and arranged in shelves in the store, in numerical order, each pack bearing the number giving the list of its contents in the check-books, and in the counterfoils in the possession of the patient, or of the ward-master.\n\n13. The packs are not to be placed on the racks too closely together, and the store is at all times to be kept dry and well ventilated.\n\n14. You will on no account allow soiled linen or clothing to be placed in the packs or bundles. All such articles are to be thoroughly cleansed, and the expense charged against the battalion or regiment to which the man belongs.\n\n15. To prevent errors, or exchanges, a clothing No., corresponding with that on the pack to which the linen, etc., belongs, is to be attached to each article sent to the wash, and, on their return from the wash, they are to be immediately placed in their respective packs.\n\n16. You will keep a book in which you will cause to be entered every article which it may be found necessary to send to the wash from the pack store, with the name, regiment, etc., of the patient to which they belong, and the number by which his pack is distinguished in the store.\n\n17. No access is to be allowed to the packs, nor are any articles to be delivered to the patients, except on the certificate of the Ward Orderly, approved by the Medical Officer in charge, that the article is absolutely necessary for the patient's use and comfort.\n\n18. You will retain the effects of the deceased men until you receive orders regarding their disposal from the commanding officers of the battalions or regiments, to which they belong.\n\n19. You will prepare all wills for the patients when required so to do, and you will be provided with forms for that purpose.\n\n20. You will keep, for future reference, a correct register of all wills prepared by you.\n\n21. You will, on the death of a patient in the Hospital, make all necessary funeral arrangements, if required by the Surgeon-Major in charge of the Hospital so to do, and you will give notice to the chaplain of the time of the burial.\n\n22. You will report the deaths to the Commanding Officer of the battalion regiment or battery to which the men belong.\n\n23. You will keep an establishment book containing the names of all the officers and servants of every description belonging to the Hospital, with the dates of their appointment and removal and the rates of their daily pay, rations, etc.\n\n24. You will pay the wages of such of the Hospital servants as do not belong to the Hospital corps, and you will make requisition for the pay and allowances of the men belonging to that corps attached to the Hospital at Winnipeg.\n\n25. Should you at any time require further assistance, you will apply to the Major-General Commanding, through the Deputy Surgeon-General, for non-commissioned officers or men belonging to the Troops in the field to be detailed for the purpose of acting as storekeepers or issuers. When men belonging to the Troops are not available, you may engage civilians, with the approval of the Major-General Commanding.\n\n26. You will provide for the subsistence of the sick, and it will be your duty to countersign, all demands upon the contractors for supplies, and frequently to inspect articles upon delivery, both as to quantity and as to quality.\n\n27. You will be held responsible for the cleanliness and order of the rooms, or buildings in which the provisions are stored, and you will see that every precaution is taken to prevent injury to, or waste of the provisions, drugs, medical comforts, or other stores committed to your charge.\n\n28. You will cause a book to be kept in which you will enter daily the receipts and expenditure for all articles of subsistence, and from this you will prepare, or cause to be prepared monthly returns, invariably taking stock on the last day of each month, in order to prove the accuracy of the remains in the said returns.\n29. You will obtain as early as possible each day, not later than 12 o'clock, noon, from the non-commissioned officer charged with the duty, a requisition for the extras prescribed for the day, and you will, on receipt of such requisition, as soon after as practicable, cause the articles to be issued.\n\n30. You will, on receipt of requisition for diets required for each ward, or division, for the following day, cause to be prepared by your store keeper, a statement of the actual quantity of provisions to be issued for the diets of the day, which statement, after being examined by you, will be handed to the cook, to enable him to check the issue made by the storekeeper, and to regulate the messes for the Hospital.\n\n31. At the end of each month, you will compare the requisitions and diet-sheets and stores issued, and report to the Deputy Surgeon-General any discrepancies that may be discovered. In the case of the death or discharge of the patient previous to the issue of the following day's diet, the ward orderly should be directed to send notice of the same to you, that you may stop the issue, and should the ward orderly neglect to give this notice, the stoppage will be charged to him.\n\n32. You will bring to the notice of the Deputy Surgeon-General any instance in which it appears to you that an unusual amount of extras has been prescribed, or that an unusual course of exceptional dieting has been followed, and you will, at the same time, transmit the diet-sheets to that officer.\n\n33. When necessary, and no other means of transport is provided, you will pay for the conveyance of the sick to the Hospital, but the sum so expended should be recovered from the Paymaster of the corps to which the men belong.\n\n34. You will frequently inspect the Hospital, and ascertain that the stores are correct in number, and properly complete.\n\n35. You will comply with the requisitions of the Medical officer in charge of the Hospitals, or Divisional Hospitals, for articles included in the authorized schedule; and in case of apparent extravagance in quantity or quality you will report the same to the Deputy Surgeon-General, in order that it may be brought under the notice of the Major-General Commanding.\n\n36. You are not authorized to supply any article of diet or extras, or any hospital stores, not included in the schedule attached hereto, without the special sanction of the Deputy Surgeon-General.\n\n37. You will frequently inspect the supplies delivered by the contractors, rejecting any articles not found equal to sample, and you will direct the immediate replenishment of the inferior article by one of a proper description, in default of which you will purchase the necessary supplies at the contractor's expense.\n\n38. The steward of the Base Hospital at Winnipeg will furnish you daily with a requisition for the total amount of perishable articles required for the diet of the following day.\n\n39. You will provide and keep up the furniture and utensils, and supply clothing, bedding, medical comforts, etc., in accordance with the schedule attached hereto.\n\n40. You will make the necessary arrangements for washing the hospital clothing and bedding at Winnipeg, and for the repair of the same, either by local contract, or by the employment of work people by the day.\n\n41. The following returns will be made to you by the surgeons in charge of field regimental detachment or Divisional Hospital, daily and monthly, as hereafter:\n\n   1st. A daily abstract of diets and extras, which you will forward to this department on the 1st and 16th of each month.\n\n   2nd. Monthly diet-sheets of patients under treatment, to be forwarded on the last day of the month.\n\n   3rd. A nominal return of admissions, discharges and deaths during the month, to be forwarded on the last day of the month.\n\nYou will carefully examine their returns and report on any large expenditure you may discover therein.\n42. On receipt of bills for the supply of medicines, or for the purchase or repair of instruments, or for stores of any kind, you will prepare an abstract of the same, and transmit it to this Department, through the Deputy Surgeon-General.\n\n43. You will be held responsible that the supplies for the hospitals are from time to time duly supplemented and kept up.\n\n44. You will furnish, for the information and guidance of the Deputy Surgeon General, the Surgeon-Major in charge of each hospital, and the Surgeons and Asst.-Surgeons attached to each battalion, regiment or battery, a copy of the list of stores to be obtained on requisition from you at Winnipeg.\n\n45. You will consult with the principal Medical Officer as to the description of supplies which will be most probably required, and you will prepare estimates of the same, and forward them to me, with such observations as you may wish to make.\n\n46. You will transmit to me, at the end of each month, a return showing the detailed receipts and issues for the month, indicating whence and from whom you derived the supplies, to what hospitals, regiments, battalions, or batteries the issues have been made, upon the authority of whose requisitions, and the articles remaining in hand. You should also report to me therewith the quality of the articles supplied.\n\n47. You will keep on hand, properly packed, a full supply of hospital stores for the establishment of Divisional Hospitals, upon requisitions for such supplies from the Deputy Surgeon-General.\n\n48. As you will be held personally responsible that the wants of the hospitals are amply provided for, and that everything necessary for the comfort of the sick and wounded is promptly supplied, it will be imperative upon you to keep a reserve store, at all times well stocked, and to insist upon the Surgeon-Major in charge of each hospital supplementing his stores regularly from your depot.\n\n49. All supplies sent out by you should be accompanied by a delivery note and an invoice of the articles.\n\n50. You are authorized, when necessary, to make purchases of medical comforts and other stores, when supplies are not obtainable in the proper way from this Department. The necessity for such purchases should be certified to by the Deputy Surgeon-General or by the Major-General Commanding.\n\n51. You will issue medical comforts and other stores on requisition of the regimental or other medical officer in charge of hospitals, such requisitions to be countersigned by the Deputy Surgeon-General or principal Medical Officer.\n\n52. When sick or wounded are sent home, or from one station to another, in ordinary hired transport, you will provide, on the requisition of the Hospital Surgeon, countersigned by the Deputy Surgeon-General, or principal officer in charge, such medical comforts and hospital stores as may be so ordered.\n\n53. A hospital car, with dispensary kitchen, and accommodation for a Surgeon and three assistants, will be placed at the disposal of this Department by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., for the transport of the sick and wounded between points furthest west and Winnipeg, and all such are to be transported if possible by that hospital car.\n\n54. If you are in doubt as to the meaning of any of the above instructions, or should you require any further information upon any point, you will please, if the principal medical officer in charge be not at hand, to communicate directly with this Department.\n\n55. I must ask you to be as economical in the use of the telegraph wire as possible, and to incur no expense of any kind for hospital stores unless upon requisition as herein before directed, duly signed or countersigned by the Deputy Surgeon-General, or principal medical officer in charge of the Troops in Manitoba and the North West.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. BERGIN,\nMedical Director-General.\n(F).\u2014REPORT OF SURGEON-MAJOR JAMES KERR,\nWINNIPEG FIELD HOSPITAL.\n\nWINNIPEG, April 16, 1886.\n\nD. BERGIN, Esq., M.P.,\nOttawa.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have the honor herewith to submit to you a report of the Winnipeg Field Hospital during the time it was under my charge. To explain the date at which this report is sent in, I have to state that, until I received your telegram a few days ago, I was not aware that any report was required from me; I naturally supposed that the report would be furnished by my successor, Dr. Codd, when the Hospital was closed. I was placed in charge of sick volunteers by the Deputy Surgeon-General, Dr. Roddick, on Apl. 14th, 1885, and I immediately proceeded to make arrangements for their hospital accommodation, which was, with the concurrence of the D. S. G., agreed with the directors of the Winnipeg General Hospital, to place the sick volunteers in a portion of their building to be specially set apart for that purpose. It was so decided, in consideration of this plan being much more consistent with affording the militia invalids the best care and treatment during their sickness, and, at the rate agreed, entailing a very much less expenditure than the renting and equipment of a building here. I refer specially to this arrangement, as during the first few weeks that I had charge of the Militia Hospital within the General Hospital serious annoyance and embarrassment to the proper discharge of my duties was offered by the arrival of other Surgeons, who represented themselves as authorized either to supersede myself and assistants in our positions, or to establish another hospital, and close up the one that had been thus organized.\n\nBy the enclosed list, you will find the numbers treated in the Hospital from 13th April to 15th August, while I had charge of this Hospital.\n\nThe majority of the cases during the first month were colds and other affections incurred owing to the exposure and fatigue during that part of the journey where the soldiers were marched over the uncompleted part of the Canadian Pacific Railway north of Lake Superior.\n\nDuring my service, there was furnished a daily sick report to the Brigade Office here, also discharge and admission sheet of all cases admitted and discharged, with weekly statement of diaries and hospital comforts supplied; besides a weekly report was furnished the D. S. G., and as soon as the request was made, a daily report was also furnished your office at Ottawa. In addition, I had histories written of each case during its stay in Hospital, before any history books were supplied; these were afterwards copied into the history books supplied from Ottawa. I am sorry that I cannot return a complete set of histories; they have been deprived of their covers, and a large number are missing. All the papers and forms in my possession were handed over by me to Dr. King, who was then acting as House Surgeon. There were appointed with me an Assistant Surgeon and three Dressers; the entire number treated in the hospital during the four months it was under my care was 81, leaving 10 in hospital. The death-rate will be seen by the enclosed tables to be very low. No complaints of want of proper care or feeding came under my notice.\n\nI must mention that the comfort of the military invalids was materially increased by frequent liberal donations of fruit, flowers, reading matter and invalid chairs by the ladies of Winnipeg.\n\nThe operations performed in the Hospital included incision in a case of emphysema, with drainage and antiseptic dressings. (Harrison, 91st.)\n\nExcision of a large hydrocele of the neck, situated deeply at base of the neck, in contact with carotid sheath and subclavian artery. (Kilburne, 91st.)\n\nIncision of knee-joint and extraction of bullet. (Eggett, Montreal Garrison Artillery.)\nThese constitute the major operations\u2014they all ran an aseptic course, and resulted in complete cures. The minor surgical operations consisted in incision and drainage of abscess, making center openings for cure of purulent accumulations and sinuses.\n\nExtraction of a bullet from a sinus in the case, and removal of necrosed fragment of bone from bullet tracks.\n\nMy duties, in addition to daily attendance on the Hospital, also included those of Acting Brigade-Surgeon at Winnipeg; daily attendance at the Brigade Office, and attending to the requirements of the various corps on their way to the front, and the other duties connected with this district as a base of supplies.\n\nI must apologize for the imperfect character of this report. Had I been asked for it I could necessarily have made it much fuller, when I had possession of all the papers connected with this Hospital, as a Base Hospital, and with all the facts fresh in my mind, but I must emphatically assert that your telegram was the first intimation I had of a report being requested of me.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJAMES KERR,\nLate Surgeon-Major, Winnipeg Field Hospital.\n\n| Name          | Regiment | Admitted | Discharged | Disease or Injury | Result |\n|---------------|----------|----------|------------|------------------|--------|\n| J.

Bergin, Esq., M.P.,\nSurgeon-General, Militia.\n\nSir,\n\nIn compliance with your instructions, I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the Medical Department of the North-West Field Force during the recent campaign.*\n\nHaving, on your recommendation, received from the Honorable Minister of Militia and Defence the appointment of Deputy Surgeon-General, I left Ottawa on the evening of April 7th, 1885, with orders to report to Major-General Middleton, who had by this time reached Troy, North-West Territories, with a portion of his command.\n\nA Field Hospital Corps, which had already been organized by yourself, also accompanied me.\n\nThis was composed of the following members; drafted chiefly from the profession and medical schools of Montreal and Toronto:\n\nFIELD HOSPITAL CORPS No. 1.\n\nSurgeon Major.\u2014C.

Alma Macpherson Ottawa, Ont.\nJ. Lawson \"\nJ. Foran \"\nHenry Filteau Montreal, P.Q.\nH. H. Arrowsmith \"\n\nWe reached Winnipeg, via Chicago, on the morning of Sunday, 12th April.\n\nI reported, as soon as possible, to Col. Jackson, who was doing duty as Deputy-Adjutant General. He kindly assisted me in billeting the Corps, and gave other advice and assistance, for which I feel deeply indebted.\n\n* This must of necessity be incomplete, owing to the fact that I was late in reaching the field of operations (the battle of Fish Creek having been fought before I arrived at the front), and, besides, many of the Regimental Surgeons have not favored me with reports.\nI also telegraphed to Major-General Middleton, who at that time was somewhere between Touchwood Hills and Humboldt. My telegram was to the effect that I was anxious to furnish his Column with a Field Hospital outfit, and also to know his views regarding the location of a Base Hospital. He replied on the following day, ordering me to go to Swift Current and establish Base Hospital there, and reach him by the Saskatchewan, as the Fort Qu'Appelle route was likely to be impassable for a time, and was, in fact, about to be abandoned.\n\nOn the 13th, Dr. Sullivan, Purveyor-General, arrived in Winnipeg, in charge of medical and surgical outfit which had been shipped from Montreal. This latter consisted of instruments, drugs, appliances, necessaries, cots, mattresses, stretchers, etc., arranged in four (4) complete sets for Field Hospital purposes.\n\nArrangements were made with the authorities of the Winnipeg General Hospital, for the accommodation of sick and wounded soldiers, the rate per diem being one dollar fifty cents ($1.50). I appointed Drs. Kerr and Mewburn to take charge of the wards set apart for the accommodation of the Troops.\n\nFour students of the Winnipeg School of Medicine were added to the strength of the Corps.\n\nSupt. Egan, of the Canadian Pacific Railway, kindly gave every assistance in procuring and fitting up a caboose and emigrant sleeper, to be subsequently used for purposes of transport. A box car was also secured for baggage and equipment.\n\nI may say, in this connection, that the emigrant sleeper is especially adapted for the transportation of sick and wounded men, being arranged with berths similar to the ordinary Pullman car, but, with this great advantage for hospital purposes, viz., the entire absence of upholstery of any kind. It is also fitted with wash room and closet and heated with steam. With a very little trouble and expense the emigrant sleeper could be converted into a most admirable hospital car.\n\nWhile in Winnipeg, I made inquiries regarding the equipment of the various Regimental Surgeons then serving with their corps in various parts of the Territories, and was surprised to learn that, without an exception, they were all very scantily provided with the medicines, instruments and dressings necessary for the campaign; in fact, I felt that, in the event of an epidemic or an engagement, it would be impossible for them to render the men that service which would be required.\n\nOn the 15th, I left Winnipeg for Swift Current, with the entire Corps.\n\nOn the advice of Lt.-Col. Van Straubenzee, who had joined our party on his way to the front via Qu'Appelle, and being most anxious to furnish the Surgeons in the Field with a more complete outfit, I again telegraphed Major General Middleton, suggesting that I might send a Surgeon and Dressers with a small hospital outfit by the Qu'Appelle route going on myself to Swift Current, as he had ordered. He promptly replied to the same effect as before, namely, that everything should be sent by the River.\n\nMajor-General Laurie joined us at Troy, on his way from the front to Swift Current, to take charge of the base and line of communication. He also reported the trail to be in places almost impassable, thus bearing out the statement of the General.\n\nHaving ascertained that a detachment of the 35th regiment, encamped at Troy was in need of surgical aid, I left Surgeon Graveley and Assistant-Surgeon King to take charge until some other arrangement would be made.\n\nOn the afternoon of the 16th April, we reached Swift Current, the ground covered with snow, and thermometer several degrees below freezing. Within sight of the railway were several \"tepees\" of Indians and Half-breeds. The Midland Battalion, under Lieut. Col. Williams, had arrived a short time before, and encamped near the railway station, awaiting further orders.\n\nThe Caboose, Emigrant sleeping car and baggage car were placed on a convenient siding, and occupied by Surgeons and Dressers, there being no house available, and no tents to spare.\nApril 17.\u2014Five men belonging to Col. Otter's column were brought in, being invalided back during the day, from the Saskatchewan Landing and Battleford Trail.\n\nPrivate Wiggins......................G. G., Foot Guards.\nSergeant Hewgill.....................Q. O. R.\nPrivate Bain.........................Q. O. R.\n\"Birchall............................Q. O. R.\n\"Nondel.............................Infantry School.\n\nThey were suffering mostly from cold and exposure, Pte. Wiggins having pneumonia. These were promptly billeted in a room adjoining the railway station.\n\nApril 19.\u2014Surgeon-Major Douglas was ordered to report to Major-General Strange at Calgary, taking with him a full hospital outfit, and the following members of the corps:\n\nSurgeons.\u2014W. R. Tracey, F. H. Powell,\nDressers.\u2014John Caven, A. J. McDonell,\nW. P. Caven, W. B. A. Hill.\nT. McKenzie,\nOrderlies.\u2014D. A. Macpherson, H. H. Arrowsmith.\nJ. Lawson,\n\nSurgeon Reddick was ordered to Saskatchewan Landing to become permanently attached to the Midland Battalion, two companies of which were stationed at that place.\n\nAssistant Surgeon Might, of the Midland Battalion, having become very much enfeebled from the journey, was ordered back to Qu'Appelle to relieve Surgeon Graveley, who, with Assistant Surgeon King, came on at once to join the Field Hospital Corps.\n\nApril 21.\u2014The \"Red Cross\" Corps, under Surgeon Nattrass, arrived this morning, and received orders to join Otter's column, then three days distant on the Battleford trail.\n\nThis Corps consisting of a Surgeon, Assistant Surgeon and eight Dressers, was organized in Toronto, and handsomely equipped by the citizens of that city. It promised to be a most efficient and useful body of men.\n\nOn the 22nd, Surgeon Bell of the Field Hospital Corps, left Swift Current with a complete Hospital outfit, and the following Surgeons and Dressers:\n\nSurgeons.\u2014E. N. Graveley, E. E. King.\nAssistant Surgeons.\u2014H. A. Wright, J. S. Freebourne.\nDressers.\u2014A. N. Worthington, W. J. Bradley.\nJ. A. Kinloch, H. L. McInnes,\nW. R. Pringle, W. A. B. Hutton.\nOrderly.\u2014J. Foran,\n\nHis orders were to take passage per Str. \"Northcote,\" then lying at Saskatchewan Landing, her destination being some point on the river Saskatchewan nearest the headquarters in the field of Major-General Middleton. Lieut.-Col. Van Straubenzie and Lieut. Col. Williams, with four companies of his regiment, were also under orders to take passage by her.\n\nThis landing is the nearest point on the Saskatchewan River to Swift Current Station, being over thirty miles distant, and in the line of the Battleford Trail.\n\nApril 23rd, sick doing well, with the exception of Pte. Wiggins, whose symptoms are somewhat unfavorable, the inflammation having extended to the other lung.\n\nThe Steamer \"Northcote\" left Saskatchewan Landing.\n\nApril 24th, telegram from Major-General Middleton, giving a short account of Fish Creek Battle.\n\nOwing to some delay in the transportation of the \"Red Cross\" Corps, and the urgent call for assistance and medical supplies from Brigade-Surgeon Strange of Otter's column, I dispatched Assistant Surgeons Kennedy and Doherty and Dressers Wilson, McIntyre, Campbell and Hillier, with orders to overtake the column, if possible, before reaching Battleford.\nField Hospital Corps No. 2, in charge of Surgeon Major Casgrain, arrived today.\n\nThe Surgeons, Dressers and Orderlies composing his corps were as follows:\n\nSurgeons.\u2014N. O. Walker\u2014Toronto, Ont.\nE. Hooper\u2014Kingston, \u201c\nFrancis Murray\u2014Montreal, P.Q.\nE. Pelletier\u2014Quebec, \u201c\nE. O. Cloutier\u2014St. Arene, \u201c\n\nDressers.\u2014W. J.

Lawless\u2014Hull, P.Q.\nWm. Francke\u2014Toronto, Ont.\n\nCook.\u2014Peter Nugent\u2014Kingston, \u201c\n\nThese were all quartered in the emigrant sleeper.\n\nDr. Natrass returned to Swift Current, to obtain, if possible, other transport, but as nothing better was available, he proceeded to Battleford without further delay.\n\nApril 26th.\u2014Surgeon-Major Douglas returned from Calgary, bringing with him Dresser W. B. A. Hill and Orderly D. A. Macpherson, having attached Surgeon Powell and two dressers to Major General Strange\u2019s Column, and established a small Hospital at Calgary under the charge of Surgeon Tracy. My original intention in sending Surgeon-Major Douglas to Calgary was to have him attached to Major General Strange\u2019s Column, but the Brigade Surgeon of that Column considered that his services would hardly be required, and besides it was found impossible to obtain transport for his equipment.\n\nApril 29th.\u2014Anxiety regarding the position of Steamer \u201cNorthcote\u201d was somewhat relieved by the arrival in camp of a scout who reported her grounded ten miles from the Elbow of the South Saskatchewan, and with very little prospect of her getting off.\n\nThe Field hospital outfit intended for General Middleton\u2019s Column being, in consequence, indefinitely delayed, and knowing how urgently certain articles would be required after the battle of Fish Creek, I determined to proceed to the front without delay via the Moose Jaw Trail. Surgeon-Major Casgrain detailed from his Field Hospital Corps to accompany me, Surgeon Pelletier and Dressers White, Schmidt, McDonald and Rea. A large field pannier and as much else in the shape of necessaries, dressing, stretchers, etc., as could be carried in an ordinary waggon, were quickly got ready.\n\nI proceeded the same evening by rail to Moosejaw, where by previous arrangement, Mr. James Ross was awaiting me with the waggons, etc., necessary for the journey.\n\nThe Moose Jaw trail had been abandoned for many months, owing to the hostile behavior of the Indians comprising White Cap\u2019s Band of the Moose Woods reserve, as well as from the unsettled state of that part of the country generally. From information obtained from surveyors and others, I was, however, convinced\nthat it would be in good condition, and, in fact, at that time the only available route to the front. I venture to say that, had it been better known, it would at that time have been selected for purposes of transport in preference to the river route.\n\nApril 30.\u2014Left Moose Jaw this afternoon, about two o'clock, with two double wagons, a cart for carrying fodder, and two spare horses, Mr. James Ross kindly consenting to act as guide. The same evening we reached the house of the last settler, some thirty miles from Moose Jaw, and put up for the night.\n\nMay 1.\u2014Travelled hard all day, stopping only to feed horses, and reached the Elbow at 7.30 p.m. Here we found Capt. Dennis encamped with a detachment of the Intelligence Corps. (They had been ordered here to guard this exposed part of the river during the passage of the \"Northcote\" and also to stop Indian and Half-breed fugitives.)\n\nCapt. Dennis reported the \"Northcote\" as having passed the Elbow the day before, and proceeded beyond the beat of his scouts, which would be at least twenty miles north of that point. We encamped here for the night.\n\nMay 2.\u2014Started at 3 a.m. Late in the afternoon, we met Major Bedson on his way to find the \"Northcote\" with some fifty teams, the intention being to lighten her, so that she might be enabled better to cross the various sand bars which were constantly impeding her.\n\nHeard from him that the wounded were being brought on to Saskatoon under charge of Brigade-Surgeon Orton.\n\nMay 3.\u2014At two a.m. reached Saskatoon, having made the journey from Moose Jaw in the then unprecedented time of sixty hours.\n\nNews received of the battle of Cut Knife Hill.\n\nFound that the wounded had just arrived from the front, under charge of Brigade-Surgeon Orton, assisted by Surgeon Ralston of Boulton's Scouts, Assistant-Surgeon Moore of the \"90th\" and Dr. Willoughby, a local physician. There were thirty-five (35) wounded in all, billeted on the inhabitants of the place and in the schoolhouse.\n\nSurgeon-Major Douglas had arrived an hour or two before me, having performed the remarkable feat of paddling alone in a canoe from Saskatchewan Landing to this place, a distance of over two hundred miles. He overtook the \"Northcote\" some fifty miles up the river, passed her, and reached Saskatoon in less than five days. He was the first to bring tidings of the whereabouts of the \"Northcote\" from the time that she passed the Elbow. I consider that Surgeon-Major Douglas deserves due credit for his pluck and endurance.\n\nDuring the day, Surgeon-Major Douglas took over the wounded from Brigade-Surgeon Orton, who, with Surgeon Ralston and Assistant-Surgeon Moore, returned immediately to the front by trail.\n\nSurgeon Pelletier and the dressers who came with me were detailed for duty under Surgeon-Major Douglas.\n\nThe following is a complete list of the sick and wounded drafted back from Fish Creek:\n\nCaptain Wm. Clark, 90th Battalion.\nPrivate David Hislop,\nCorporal Lethbridge,\nJ. B. D. Code,\nPrivate W. W. Matthews,\nM. O. R. Jarvis,\nC. H. Kemp,\nWm. Wainwright,\nW. Restall;\nEdward Lowell,\nA. S.

Taylor,\n\nMay 4.\u2014At daybreak, Major Bedson and myself went up the river some distance in search of the \"Northcote,\" and found her stuck fast on a sand-bar, about five miles above Saskatoon. She soon afterwards reached Saskatoon, where Surgeon Bell with his Field Hospital Corps disembarked. After a short delay here, the steamer proceeded on her way to the Fish Creek camp, and I took passage in her for the purpose of reporting myself to the General, taking with me Dressers Pringle and Kinloch to be attached to the 90th Regiment and Boulton's Scouts respectively.\n\nAfter many delays, caused by the grounding of the Steamer, the camp was reach-at 7 o'clock next morning.\n\nI was courteously received by the General, and discussed with him, and Brigade-Surgeon Orton, questions of Field and Base hospitals and Medical matters, referred to in your General Orders, which will be found in the Appendix.\n\nIt was decided to establish a Field Hospital at Saskatoon, and a Base Hospital at either Swift Current or Moose Jaw, depending on whether or not the river route remained available.\n\nAs another engagement was imminent within a few days, it was decided to make provision at Saskatoon for at least fifty more wounded.\n\nThe General ordered me to send on without delay the Field Hospital Corps, originally intended for his Column, under charge of Surgeon Bell.\n\nI left the camp at 2 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, taking with me in one of the ambulances Capt. Doucet A.D.C., who had received a serious gunshot wound of the right elbow joint. Having to travel very slowly on his account, we did not reach Saskatoon till midnight.\n\nMay 5.\u2014At the request of the General, I visited on the way back a man named McDonald, lying ill in a house about five miles from Fish Creek. He was suffering from \"caries\" of the spine. I ordered him to Saskatoon, as it was unsafe for him to be in such close proximity to the enemy's country.\n\nMay 6.\u2014Surgeon Bell, with the following members of the Corps, viz.:\n\nSurgeon.\u2014Graveley.\nAssistant Surgeons.\u2014Wright,\nDressers.\u2014White,\nBradley,\nMcInnes,\n\nFreebourne.\nHutton,\nWorthington,\n\nleft this morning to join General Middleton's Column, his instructions being to place himself under the orders of Brigade-Surgeon Orton.\n\nSpent most of the day in examining the wounded and consulting regarding their condition with Surgeon-Major Douglas.\n\nTelegraphed Dr Kerr of Winnipeg to send Nurse Miller, of the Winnipeg General Hospital, without delay to the Front, via Moose Jaw trail, other Nurses to follow as soon as selected.\n\nMay 7th.\u2014Busy organizing. Appointed Dr. Willoughby to the position of Assistant-Purveyor, and Mr. James McGowan, a resident of Saskatoon, to that of Supply Officer.\n\nRequisitioned the three largest houses in the place for hospitals, so as to concentrate the wounded, and thus lighten the work of attendance.\n\nThe village of Saskatoon is the chief settlement of the Temperance Colonization Company, situated on the east bank of the South Saskatchewan, about seventeen miles south of Clarke's Crossing, and twenty miles north of the Moose Woods Indian Reserve.\nThere are about twenty wooden dwellings and a commodious school house in the place. It is well situated from a sanitary standpoint, the banks of the river here being high, and the soil naturally porous and dry. In fact, it would be difficult to find a better \"sanatorium,\" and I am convinced that much of the success which followed the treatment of the sick and wounded billeted here was due to the remarkably healthy condition of the place.\n\nThe buildings referred to, which I requisitioned, were especially well placed on the bank of the river, and, being unfinished, could be conveniently arranged for hospital purposes. When filled with the wounded, it was computed that every man had upwards of one thousand (1000) cubic feet of air space. This is, of course, a small proportion, but the ventilation was so thorough, and the air-supply so abundant and uncontaminated, that I considered it sufficient. The ventilation was simply by opposite windows and additional openings in the ceilings. Two of the buildings were two-storey, the other one-storied.\n\nThe strictest rules were laid down by General Orders with regard to the immediate removal of all excreta and foul dressings, and privies were constructed at convenient distances from the buildings. A man was detailed to apply dry earth frequently, so that the discharges were never left uncovered for longer than a few moments; water was abundantly supplied from the river for cleansing purposes, while delicious drinking water was obtained from a spring some two miles from the village.\n\nThe food was at first a little scanty; under the circumstances, no complaint could be made. There was an abundance of fresh meat, a large drove of cattle having, through the admirable foresight of the Commissariat Department, arrived simultaneously with the wounded. Beef tea was thus readily obtained, and milk also in fair amount. All the eggs, butter and flour available were purchased from the settlers, which, with the necessaries and comforts of the outfit which I brought from Moose Jaw with me, served to make up a very fair dietary.\n\nFor the following few days, the members of the staff were constantly engaged attending to the wounded, as, owing to the absence of skilled women, much of the nursing had to be done by ourselves. Two or three of the farmers' wives of the place kindly rendered what assistance they could, but their time was chiefly occupied in the preparation of food.\n\nThe cases at this time requiring most attention were those of Capt. Clark, wounded through the back, not penetrating; Capt. Doucet, A.D.C.; Corp. Code, wounded through both legs; Pte. Lethbridge, penetrating wound of chest; Pte. Hislop, whose arm had been amputated near the shoulder; and Pte. Caniff, shot in the elbow-joint.\n\nMay 12.\u2014Nurse Miller arrived today, and immediately took charge of the wounded.\n\nNews received of Battle of Batoche, and complete rout of Riel and his followers.\n\nSent courier to General, asking him to relieve Surgeon Bell, as I would require him to take charge of the wounded as they came in from Batoche. Five men wounded in the early part of the fighting arrived from the front today, also the body of Private Hardisty.\n\nCorporal Code much worse, having had an alarming hemorrhage from one of the wounds in the leg; very little hope of his recovery. Other serious cases improving.\n\nReceived orders from the General to prepare for the Batoche wounded.\n\nMay 14.\u2014Steamer \"Northcote\" arrived with wounded, including two Half-breeds\u2014Assistant Surgeon Wright and Dresser Fred White in charge. The bodies of Capt. French, Lieut. Fitch, Lieut. Kippen, and Pte. Fraser were also on board.\n\nA violent rainstorm coming on, it was decided not to transfer the wounded to the Hospital until the following day.\nMay 15.\u2014Private Watson died during the night on board the \"Northcote.\" Corp. Code also died during the night.\n\nCommenced early moving the wounded, dressing each case as he came into the Hospital. The following is a complete list of those who were drafted back from Batoche:\n\nSergeant F. R. Jakes, 90th Battalion.\nCorporal Wm. Kemp,\nPrivate R. Barron,\nJos. Chambers,\nJas. Dowker,\nM. Erickson,\nF. Alex. Watson,\nA. L. Young,\nGunner N. Charpentier, \"A\" Battery.\nW. Fairbanks,\nM. Twohey,\nDriver T. J. Stout,\nCaptain J. F. Manley, 10th Royal Grenadiers.\nJas. Mason,\nCorporal Jas. Foley;\nPrivate W. Cantwell,\nR. Cook,\nJas. Eager,\nH. Milson,\n\nPrivate Jas. Marshall, 10th Royal Grenadiers.\nA. Martin,\nJno. Quigley,\nAlf.

Christie,\nCorporal E. A. E. Halliwell,\nPrivate W. Barton,\nSimcoe Daley,\nW. Powell,\nLieutenant J. F. Garden, Intelligence Corps.\nPrivate R. S. Cooke, French's Scouts.\n\nMay 16th.\u2014Surgeon Bell arrived from the front, and was immediately put in charge of the Hospital, with the rank of Surgeon-Major, in accordance with your orders. I append Dr. Bell's report of the Battle of Batoche.\n\nSURGEON-MAJOR BELL'S REPORT OF BATOCHE.\n\nT. G. Roddick, Esq.,\nDeputy Surgeon-General, Saskatoon.\n\nSir,\n\nIn compliance with your instructions, I started from Saskatoon on the morning of May 6, with the following members of the corps:\n\nSurgeon.\u2014E. A Gravely.\nAssistant Surgeons.\u2014H. A. Wright,\nDressers.\u2014White,\nBradley,\nMcInnes,\nJ. S. Freebourne.\nHutton,\nWorthington.\n\nThe Rev. D. M. Gordon, of Winnipeg, was also of the party.\n\nWe encamped that night at McIntosh, six miles from Fish Creek. Left the next morning at five o'clock, and were just in time to transfer our stores to the transport waggons, and to go on with the Column. We reached Gabriel Dumont's Landing that afternoon, and remained there for the night. Next morning we struck back from the river trail, and camped at Beautiful Spot, about eight miles north-east of Batoche.\n\nNext morning, May 9th, we left camp at about six o'clock, going in with twenty empty waggons for the wounded, with a bale of hay in each, and our complete hospital equipment. Each man of the Ambulance Corps was equipped with a \"haversack\" in which he carried iodoform, bandages, and some absorbent cotton, and two of them had Esamarch's rubber bands. We reached Batoche after the fighting began, about half-past eight o'clock. We first located our hospital waggons in a ravine, near the church at Batoche, but subsequently took possession of the church, and had the wounded brought in there to be treated. We had the assistance of two or three nuns, with blankets and utensils, while we remained in the church.\n\nAbout two o'clock in the afternoon, we were ordered to leave the church, and, putting the wounded into waggons, retired some little distance. For the remainder of the afternoon, we were at some considerable uncertainty as to our future movements.\nFinally, late in the evening, when an entrenched camp was decided on and located, we pitched the hospital tent at the edge of a slough in the centre. This was the only tent pitched at Batoche, until after the conclusion of the fight, when two additional bell tents were pitched to accommodate the wounded. We spread hay on the soft wet ground at the edge of the slough on which our tent was situated, and laid the wounded on stretchers in the tent.\n\nSeveral bullets went through the tent that evening, and on subsequent occasions but, owing to the dip of the ground, the wounded men were out of range, the bullets passing through the tent three or four feet from the ground.\n\nThe first man wounded was Gunner Charpentier of \"A\" Battery, a Winchester bullet passing through the left calf and into the right knee-joint, shattering the joint, and penetrating the calf muscles.\n\nDriver Stout, of \"A\" Battery, was run over by a nine-pound gun, early in the morning.\n\nPhillips, of \"A\" Battery, shot in the ravine, was dead when recovered.\n\nPrivate Moore of 10th Royal Grenadiers was struck in the right parietal eminence by a spent bullet late in the evening, causing compound fracture of the skull. We had decided to trephine the skull, but before it could be done he had died.\n\nCaptain Mason, 10th Royal Grenadiers, was also shot early in the morning of the first day, bullet striking him in the left lumbar region, and passing deeply through the muscles, making its exit near the anterior superior iliac crest.\n\nAltogether, the casualties of the first day were two killed and nine wounded.\n\nThe casualties of the next two days were slight, but on the evening of the charge we had our hands full.\n\nAltogether, there were eight men killed and forty-five wounded at Batoche. Some of the latter were so slightly wounded that they were not sent back to Saskatoon.\n\nPrivate Watson died on board the \"Northcote,\" before reaching Saskatoon.\n\nOn the 13th of May, the steamer \"Northcote\" was got ready, and as fast as possible the wounded men were transferred in waggons to the ferry, which was about one and a half miles distant from our camp. By four o'clock in the afternoon, all the wounded were comfortably stowed away on board the boat, and she left for Saskatoon.\n\nDr. Wright and Mr. White took charge of them on the trip to Saskatoon.\n\nI also sent Jobin and Delorme, two of the Rebel Council, who had been picked up on the field previously, seriously wounded. Three of them had been brought to our camp badly wounded, and died in the meantime.\n\nI beg to attach herewith a report of the operations performed at Batoche.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJAMES BELL,\nSurgeon-Major.\n\nREPORT OF OPERATIONS PERFORMED ON THE FIELD, AT BATTLE OF BATOCH\u00c9,\nMAY 9TH TO 13TH, 1885.\n\nLieut. Garden, Intelligence Corps.\u2014I extracted the bullet, and a good deal of cloth, from the outside of the arm, on the morning of the charge, May 13.\n\nR. S. Cooke, French's Scouts.\u2014Compound fracture of the head of tibia. Leg was put in blue clay splint by Drs. Orton and Codd, on Sunday morning, May 10th. He was wounded on first day.\n\nGunner Fairbanks, \"A\" Battery.\u2014Bullet extracted from leg.\n\nPrivate Eager, 10th Royal Grenadiers.\u2014Shot through lower jaw. Fragments of the shattered bone were removed on the night of May 12th, by Dr. Orton and myself. He lost a great deal of blood, as there was some difficulty in ligaturing the vessels.\n\nPrivate Martin, 10th Royal Grenadiers.\u2014Bullet extracted from inner angle of scapula by Dr. Ryerson, on Sunday, 10th May.\nCorporal Kemp, 90th Battalion.\u2014Bullet extracted from temple immediately in front of the ear, having broken the bridge of the nose; and passed through eyeball.\n\nLieut. Halliwell, \"Midland Battalion.\"\u2014Dr. Horsey and myself removed a bullet from his left shoulder, where it was lodged in the capsule of the joint, having shattered the coracoid process, and carried away anterior surface of clavicle, being a round bullet.\n\nPrivate Barton, \"Midland Battalion.\"\u2014The right testicle was carried out of the scrotum, a Winchester bullet passing completely through it. The diseased tissue was pared away, and the testicle returned to the scrotum, having been cleansed with carbolic lotion and the scrotum brought together with sutures, leaving capillary drainage.\n\nPrivate A. L. Young, 90th Battalion.\u2014Bullet removed from lower third of thigh, posterior side, by Dr. Whiteford and myself.\n\nPrivate H. Milson, 10th Grenadiers.\u2014Bullet was removed from beneath the skin on the antero-lateral portion of left chest, having entered between the spines of the vertebrae on the right side.\n\nThe cots which had been supplied were found somewhat defective in both construction and quality of material, so that the bulk of them were discarded entirely, and wooden cots substituted for them. Fortunately, there was no scarcity of mattresses, so that the beds could be made very comfortable.\n\nThe 7th Battalion, under Col. Williams, arrived about this time from Saskatchewan Landing, en route for Clarke's Crossing, and left us a liberal supply of bacon sugar, candles, etc.\n\nMay 19.\u2014Steamer \"Northcote\" arrived to-day from the front, bringing Capt. Young and Guard in charge of the prisoner, Louis Riel. Capt. Young disembarked at Saskatoon, preferring to take the trail for Moosejaw, on his way to Regina. To strengthen the guard, I sent four convalescents with the party. The Captain of the \"Northcote\" had orders from the General to place the steamer at my disposal, for the transport of convalescents to the \"Elbow,\" whence they were to take the trail to Moosejaw. Twenty-eight men, in charge of Surgeon Major Douglas and Surgeon Walker, who arrived from the Base the day before, accordingly embarked on the 20th May.\n\nThe \"Northcote,\" being a large and commodious steamer, was well adapted for purposes of transport. The men were made very comfortable in the spacious staterooms and saloon.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Base, important changes were taking place. Major-General Laurie and staff, and Purveyor-General Sullivan and staff, had within a few days moved their headquarters from Swift Current to Moosejaw, the intention being to utilize the Moosejaw trail, as the chief line of communication with the front. The \"Moose Hotel,\" a conveniently constructed building, had been requisitioned for hospital purposes by the Purveyor-General, and expeditiously put in order so as to accommodate about thirty patients, with medical attendants and nurses.\n\nMay 23.\u2014Two Nurses, an assistant and a helper, arrived to-day by trail and were at once put on duty under the superintendence of Nurse Miller. The latter had hitherto been most indefatigable in her attendance on the wounded. In fact, much of the success which attended the treatment of our wounded at Saskatoon was undoubtedly due to the skill, kindness and untiring devotion of Nurse Miller. Nurses Elking and Hamilton are likewise deserving of praise for their unremitting attention to duty.\n\nMay 25.\u2014Being anxious to inspect the Base Hospital at Moosejaw, I started early this morning by trail, reaching the Elbow the same night. I here learned that the \"Northcote\" had reached her destination and landed the wounded the day previous, returning immediately down the river.\n\nI accomplished the journey to Moosejaw in forty-eight hours. The trail had\nbeen very much improved since my journey north, Lieut.-Governor Dewdney having ordered the bridges to be repaired, etc. But, notwithstanding this, in some places it had become very rough, owing to the heavy transport which had recently passed over it. There is one serious objection to this trail, namely, the scarcity of water, but this could readily be overcome by sinking wells at reasonable distances.\n\nThe following report of the journey of the convalescent wounded from Saskatoon was handed me by Surgeon-Major Douglas:\n\nMoosejaw, May 26th, 1885.\n\nTo Dr. Surgeon-General Roddick,\nMoosejaw.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report my arrival at this place in charge of a party of wounded invalids from the Field Hospital, Saskatoon.\n\nLIST OF INVALIDS PROCEEDING FROM SASKATOON TO MOOSEJAW.\n\n10th Royal Grenadiers.\n1.

(Omitted.)\n\nTrooper Perrin, amputation of arm.\nMcNeill, syphilis.\n\nWe left Saskatoon early on the morning of the 21st inst., having embarked on board steamer \"Northeote,\" on the previous evening.\n\nThe voyage up the river on board of this steamer was most satisfactory. The wounded, nearly all of whom were comparatively slight cases and convalescent, were well accommodated in cabins, state-rooms or on mattresses on the cabin floor for the night, and there were facilities for dressing those cases that required it in the wash-room. On the 23rd we arrived at the \"Elbow\" of the South Saskatchewan river, and continued our journey to Moosejaw overland, next morning, nine teams having been procured for our conveyance. The journey over the trail was more trying to some of the severer cases of wounds, especially to one of compound fracture of the forearm and to a case of amputation of the arm. A tent was procured for the seven cases at the Elbow, and another was found about two-thirds of the way from the river, so that on the second night out all could be accommodated.\n\nWe arrived about 10 a.m. today, the distance from the Elbow, 50 miles, having been performed in two days, five hours.\n\nThe invalids were at once taken to the Hospital at Moosejaw, where ample provision had been made for them.\n\nI would suggest that no serious cases of wounds should be sent by this route, the journey overland in unsuitable vehicles being too trying. Fortunately, there are only a few cases of this kind at Saskatoon, and when the Hospital is broken up, then they could be sent direct to Winnipeg by the Hudson Bay Co.'s boats, as soon as the navigation of Lake Winnipeg can be performed by them.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. M. DOUGLAS,\nIn charge of Field Hospital.\nMay 27.\u2014Accompanied by Major-General Laurie, Purveyor-General Sullivan, and Surgeon-Major Casgrain, I inspected the new Base Hospital. It consisted of a long, narrow, wooden building, two storied, the ground floor being conveniently partitioned off, having in front an office, a portion of which was now used by the Apothecary. Within this was a wide hallway of sufficient capacity for five beds. Further on was a large, square, well-ventilated room, in which ten beds were placed; ample air space being afforded. Behind this again a spacious kitchen, with cupboards adjoining.\n\nThe upper story was divided up into small rooms, some of which were large enough for two patients. A recreation tent, cookshop and marquee for convalescents were being erected on the large green adjoining the Hospital. Privies and cesspools were erected at a convenient distance.\n\nSurgeon-Major Casgrain was ordered to take charge of the Base Hospital, his staff consisting of: Surgeon Walker; Dressers Collins, Thompson, McCuaig, Turnbull, McKay, Bishop, Graham, Aikins, Park; Orderlies Lawless and Francke; Apothecary Wilbur.\n\nMay 28.\u2014At my suggestion, Major-General Laurie appointed an invaliding Board, composed of Surgeon-Major Douglas, Surgeon-Major Casgrain and myself. We examined ten men whom we considered to be sufficiently convalescent to undertake the journey home. I also discharged from duty Dressers White, McKay, Thompson, Turnbull, Collins, McCuaig and Lawless, as there was not likely to be any more necessity for their services.\n\nMay 30.\u2014The Nurses arranged for and sent by you from Toronto, namely four Sisters of St. John the Divine and three skilled Nurses, arrived this morning in charge of Dr. Caniff. Their arrival was most opportune, as some of the men were much in need of skilled nursing.\n\nArrangements were made for Sisters and Nurses to reside in a building adjoining the Hospital. The Lady Superior at once took charge, so that in a short time, things were put into good shape.\n\nJune 1.\u2014Went to Qu'Appelle station, and inspected the small Hospital in charge of Dr. O. C. Edwards. This is a small building, having three wards, which, in the early part of the campaign, was filled with men drafted back from General Middleton's Column, but now containing only one patient. This was the late Dr. James Corbett, who took ill with dropsy on his way to report to me, and was never well enough to proceed further. He was being well cared for, and was improving, but, as I was about to close the Hospital, I ordered him back to the Winnipeg Hospital, where he was subsequently treated as a private patient up to the time of his death.\n\nJune 3rd.\u2014Returned from Qu'Appelle again, inspected Hospital, and had reason to compliment the Lady Superior on the efficiency of her staff and the admirable condition of the Hospital generally.\n\nJune 5th.\u2014Received a telegram from the Minister to the effect that Dr. Boyd, sent by the Princess Louise with a medical and surgical outfit, and large fund for distribution, was on his way to Winnipeg and would expect me to take him in charge. I at once proceeded to Winnipeg, received Dr. Boyd on his arrival, and, on the 8th, left with him for Moosejaw, to give him an opportunity of seeing the Base Hospital.\n\nHe expressed himself as highly pleased with the arrangements, and compared our work most favorably with what he had already seen in recent campaigns in Servia, Zululand, etc.\n\nI spent the next three or four days in Moosejaw, assisting the Purveyor-General in distributing supplies of all kinds, forwarded to him from head-quarters, and from various towns and cities in the Dominion. I also suggested important alterations in the ration list of the Field Force, such as a more liberal supply of fresh meat and compressed vegetables, and the substitution of oatmeal and molasses for a portion of the hard tack ration. Dr. Boyd took some trouble to find out the circumstances of the wounded men in Hospital, and assisted many of the more deserving by distributing clothing and small sums of money. He also kindly sup-\nplemented the ordinary allowance for travelling expenses, so that, instead of taking rations on their journey homeward, the men could pay for three meals a day. In this connection I would especially mention the case of a young Scout, Herbert Perrin, who had lost his arm, and who was anxious to visit his mother in a distant part of the country, and return to his homestead in the Territories. Dr. Boyd very kindly furnished him with fifty dollars from the fund in order to accomplish his object.\n\nJune 15th.\u2014Being anxious to return to Saskatoon, and also to give Dr. Boyd an opportunity of visiting the Field Hospital there, I left with him for Qu'Appelle today, and there took the trail for Clarke's Crossing. I chose this route because it was reported to be in excellent condition, and, furthermore I wished Dr. Boyd to see the main trail to the front. We reached Saskatoon at 5 a.m. on the 18th.\n\nSurgeon Bell reported all doing well, with the exception of Gunner Charpentier of \"A\" Battery, whose leg had required amputation, and who died a few days before. I at once began to make arrangements for the removal of all those remaining in the Hospital here, and in a despatch to the General suggested the river route by the way of the \"Forks\" and Lake Winnipeg. He concurred fully in my scheme, and instructed me to make the necessary arrangements, promising the assistance of one of the steamers.\n\nJune 24.\u2014In reply to my telegram asking for instructions regarding the custody of the wounded Half-breed Delorme, Major-General Middleton replied as follows:\n\n\"He must be kept under sentry and taken with you with the other wounded and left at Regina. I will tell Col. Williams at Clarke's Crossing to send you a guard when you think it necessary. Delorme is an important prisoner and must not be allowed to escape.\"\n\nI lost no time in communicating with Col. Williams, and suggested that it would be much safer and more convenient to take the prisoner to his camp, which he accordingly did.\n\nJune 25.\u2014Sent five convalescent wounded to Moosejaw by trail, eighteen remaining.\n\nFearing that there might be some detention at Grand Rapids, I telegraphed to Lieut.-Col. Whitehead as follows:\n\n\"Please instruct North-West Navigation Co. to facilitate movement of wounded over tramway at Grand Rapids and on steamer. Some of wounded too weak to leave their beds. Dr. Bell and Capt. Tracy in charge. Can you arrange to have their wishes carried out by the Company's officers? Most important so as to have no accident.\"\n\nHe replied:\n\n\"Steamer 'Princess' leaves to-night for Grand Rapids to meet barge with wounded. Captain will see that wounded are carefully conveyed across portage. Every arrangement for care and comfort.\"\n\nI also telegraphed Col. Whitehead to send to Grand Rapids from Winnipeg\u2014fresh meat, eggs, compressed vegetables, comforts; etc., so that the wounded might be kept well supplied with these necessaries.\n\nHaving decided to utilize a barge for purpose of transportation, obtained permission from Lieut.-Col. Whitehead to take possession of the best among the number lying at Clarke's Crossing, and proceeded to get it fitted up. Through the kindness of Col. Williams of the 7th Fusiliers, I secured the valuable services of Capt. Tracy of that regiment, and as many mechanics as the latter required. Capt. Tracy being an engineer, and a practical man, at once drew plans which satisfied me perfectly and lost no time in putting them into execution. The following report addressed to yourself has been kindly furnished by Capt. Tracy, referring to the mode of construction, capacity, and qualifications generally of our Hospital Barge:\u2014\nLONDON, April 21, 1886.\n\nD. BERGIN, Esq., M.P.,\nSurgeon-General, Department Militia and Defence, Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report on the \"Hospital Barge\" used for the conveyance of wounded from Saskatoon down the Saskatchewan River on the way to Winnipeg.\n\nThe barge was selected from those built at Saskatchewan Landing for the conveyance of supplies to Clarke's Crossing, and on which the 7th Fusiliers and two Companies of the Midland Battalion made the trip down, about 320 miles.\n\nI selected from the number the one with the best record on the down trip, and called the \"Sir John A. Macdonald\" (an omen of success), and with willing help from men of the 7th, proceeded to fit it up.\n\nThe barge was of pine about $16 \\times 50$ feet, the bottom flat, turned up a little at the ends and of two inch plank, well caulked, the sides 2 inch plank and about 2ft 6in high. About 4 feet at each end was decked over to strengthen the hull.\n\nThe inside of the hull was first thoroughly cleaned out, scrubbed and white-washed. We then put in a new floor and additional cross timbers to strengthen the bottom, the sides were double-planked and a light strong frame put up to carry the covering and which added a good deal to the stiffness of the craft.\n\nThe covering was of canvas, securely battened to the frame with an inner ceiling to check the heat of the sun. The sides were canvas inside and outside, the frame fixed with cords to each, so that they could be tied up at any height desired in fine weather.\n\nThe ends next the decked portions were enclosed with canvas, arranged to allow for thorough ventilation. Other little details were arranged, and, considering the materials available, the barge was very comfortable.\n\nThe cots were arranged, feet inwards, with a passage down the centre, some of the most serious cases being curtained off from the rest. The barge being used exclusively for the wounded, they were away from the noise and bustle of the steamer, an advantage of consequence in taking care of them.\n\nThe steamer \"Alberta\" arrived at the Crossing on the 3rd day of July, and towed the barge up the river to Saskatoon, where the wounded, to the number of eighteen, were taken on board, and early next morning we returned to the Crossing, where two sick men of the 7th were added to the number. Dr. Fraser, Surgeon of the 7th, also joined us, and we proceeded down the river. Batoche was reached in the afternoon, where we stopped to take in wood, allowing such of the wounded as could walk to revisit the scene of the fighting. We stopped for the night near the \"Hudson Bay Crossing\" and reached the Forks of the River about noon, where we found A Company of the Midland Battalion. We waited here several days till General Middleton and the Troops coming down the North Branch arrived, when the whole started down the river.\n\nOur steamer, being small, and having the Hospital Barge on one side, a double barge containing the Midland Co. on the other side, and a large barge in front for wood, cows, etc., was slower than the other, and we were soon left behind, but every night the General with the steamer \"Marquis\" waited for us to come up to see how the wounded were progressing.\n\nOn arriving at Cedar Lake, the wounded were transferred to the \"Marquis,\" and the last I saw of our barge, which had served so well, was stripped of everything moveable; it was left at a little Indian village with a crowd of wondering Indians carefully examining it.\n\nOur barge behaved well during the trip. A little water leaked in, the first day, through the upper joints from the wave in front, but we soon stopped that with a little oakum which we had brought along. The weather at the Forks was very disagreeable, being rainy most of the time. A second covering of canvas borrowed from the steamer helped to make the roof tight, and, with the exception of the first night, we had no trouble. The barge rode smoothly and easily, being free\nfrom the jar of the machinery during the day, and the never-to-be-forgotten snoring of \"Captain Maloney\" at night.\n\nOn arriving at Grand Rapids, the wounded were taken across the tramway and placed on board of the \"Princess,\" and after a very pleasant trip down the lake, they were again transferred to a river steamer at Selkirk, and from there to Winnipeg, and by carriages and ambulances to the Hospital.\n\nNo accidents occurred on the trip, and the wisdom of sending the wounded in this way was undoubted. In the state of the trail from Saskatoon to the C. P. R. at Moosejaw, I do not think it would have been possible to have taken them over alive. As it was, they all seemed to improve very much on the trip, and I was confirmed in the opinion expressed above by the remarks of the men on seeing them at the Hospital, that \"they suffered more in being carried by road from the river to the Hospital than in the other 1100 miles by water. I might add that the care and skill shown by the Medical Department in preparing for and looking after the wounded on the way, reflected the greatest credit on the Deputy-Surgeon-General, Dr. Roddick, Dr. Bell, the Surgeon in charge, and his assistants and nurses.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTHOMAS H. TRACY,\nCaptain, 7th Fusiliers.\n\nJuly 1.\u2014All is now in readiness for evacuating Saskatoon Field Hospital, and we eagerly look for the arrival of the steamer. Being Dominion Day the occasion was celebrated as become loyal Canadians; the officers and men of the 7th Battalion kindly assisting in organizing games and amusements of all kinds for the benefit of the wounded.\n\nJuly 3, 9 a.m.\u2014The steamer \"Alberta\" arrived, towing the Hospital Barge taken on at Clarke's Crossing.\n\nArrangements were at once made for the removal of all the inmates of the Hospital to the barge, which was constructed to hold twenty beds.\n\nSurgeon-Major Bell and Assistant-Purveyor Willoughby, with the dressers and nurses were quartered in the state-rooms and cabin of the steamer.\n\nTwo milch cows, and a liberal supply of fresh meat, vegetables, comforts, etc., were placed on board for the journey.\n\nDr. Boyd, who had manifested a deep interest in the men lying in the Saskatoon Hospital, supplied several whose clothing had been destroyed or lost with suits of serviceable corduroy, while others were tendered various sums of money so as to enable them to purchase comforts on the way home.\n\nThe steamer left during the night. I append the following report of Surgeon-Major Bell, giving the details of the journey from Saskatoon to Selkirk, via the Saskatchewan River and Lake Winnipeg:\n\nWINNIPEG, July 16th, 1885.\n\nT. G. RODDICK, Esq.,\nDeputy Surgeon-General,\nMilitia of Canada, Montreal.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report of the transport of the wounded from Saskatoon (and two or three others admitted to Hospital en route). Seventeen patients were put on board a barge specially prepared for the purpose on the night of the 3rd inst. The barge was lashed alongside the steamer \"Alberta,\" and on board the latter were four nurses, one servant woman, three dressers, Dr. Willoughby (with the balance of the Saskatoon Equipment) and myself. On another barge were two cows and a man to look after them.\n\nWe sailed at daylight (July 4). At Clarke's Crossing we took on Dr. Fraser, 7th Fusiliers, Capt. Tracey, 7th Fusiliers (who had superintended the construction\nof the barge), and two privates of the same regiment, Pte. Dignam, suffering from abscess of back, and Pte. McClintock, acute rheumatism.\n\nThe patients were all very comfortable on board the barge, and we had a pleasant sail and good weather, reaching the \"Forks\" on Sunday morning, July 5th, about nine o'clock. Here we waited until Wednesday evening, July 8th, when General Middleton with the Troops from Pitt arrived in the \"Marquis,\" \"North-West,\" and \"Baroness.\"\n\nWe sailed again at daylight, the \"Marquis\" keeping us in sight. We also took on here Pte. Hope Hay (Boulton's Horse), wounded in forearm at Batoche, and M. Vining of the Transport Service, also wounded at Batoche\u2014flesh wound of thigh. Both were convalescent, and did not require beds in the Hospital Barge which was already full.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon we reached Cedar Lake, and after conferring with the General and the captains of both boats, we transferred the patients all to the \"Marquis,\" the officers giving up their staterooms to them. On Sunday morning we reached Grand Rapids, and by evening had all transferred to the \"Princess.\" On this boat the wounded occupied the ladies' cabin and two staterooms above. Several of the convalescents had beds made for them in the passage in front of and around the ladies' cabin. They were transferred by train across the neck of land (six miles I believe) without accident, and were very comfortable on the \"Princess.\"\n\nHere again Pte. Lemay, 65th Battalion, who was just convalescing from a bullet wound through chest, was admitted, and Pte. Warren, Q. O. R., with pleurisy. Just before starting, Pte. Bell, \"Midland,\" was also admitted. He had obscure head symptoms, believed to have been produced by a fall from a barge at Clarke's Crossing. We crossed the lake without accident, two or three of the patients, and some of the nurses, suffering from sea-sickness, although the weather was fine.\n\nOn the morning of the 15th, we arrived with all well at Selkirk. Here Ptes. Lemay, Dignam and Bell were allowed to rejoin their regiments, to go on home with them.\n\nHere, also, as you know, we transferred the others with attendants to the \"Marquette\" and arrived safely in Winnipeg at half-past six, and had all transferred to the Winnipeg Hospital by half-past eight p.m.\n\nAt the Forks, owing to the delay waiting for General Middleton, we were obliged to buy two small steers (all we could get) to provide fresh meat for the patients. At Grand Rapids most of our surplus supplies, drugs, matrasses, etc., were left behind for further orders, as the boats were too crowded to carry them, and they were besides on the \"Alberta,\" which had been detained by bad weather in Cedar Lake.\n\nAt the end of the voyage no one was the worse of the trip, and many I believe were much better for it. The transhipments were made without much or any discomfort to the patients, and no accidents occurred to any of them.\n\nCaptain Doucet had a slight fainting fit from keeping him too long in the upright position, going on board the \"Princess,\" but was over it in a few minutes and was none the worse after.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJAMES BELL,\nSurgeon in charge.\nLIST OF SICK AND WOUNDED WHO LEFT SASKATOON FIELD HOSPITAL\n\nOn July 4, 1886, and took passage by boat to Winnipeg.\n\nCaptain Doucet, A.

Dr. Boyd was also anxious to see the battle-fields, and carry out the instructions of Her Royal Highness, to render assistance to foes and friends indiscriminately. Accordingly, accompanied by Captain Leonard and Mr. A. D. Stewart, we started immediately after the departure of the steamer, reaching Fish Creek about noon that day; visited the house then occupied by Madame Tourand, her own dwelling having been destroyed during the engagement. I found one of her sons suffering from an affection of the lungs, which had been much increased by recent exposure. I gave him the necessary advice and medicine. Then we proceeded to Batoche and put up for the night at Batoche's House where we were warmly welcomed.\n\nThe following morning we visited the priest, and learned from him that the wounded in his parish, numbering in all about ten, were mostly convalescent. He asked me however to see a Half-breed named Gardapuy, who had been wounded through the lung. After some trouble I found him, because he feared arrest and on examination discovered that he had a chest filled with fluid. I did not feel justified in operating under the circumstances, but gave him a letter to the police surgeon at Prince Albert, assuring him that every attention would be paid him. Dr. Boyd kindly furnished him with the means necessary to get there. I left with the priest a stock of dressings, bandages, etc., and Dr. Boyd presented him with a considerable sum of money to be distributed among the sick and destitute in his parish.\n\nReturned to Saskatoon on the 7th, and spent a couple of days closing accounts with the settlers, and shipping by trail goods of various kinds, which the steamer had been unable to carry. I then proceeded to the Base, reaching Moosejaw by trail on the 10th July.\n\nI found the Base Hospital closed, in obedience to your instructions, the staff, with the exception of Purveyor-General Sullivan, having gone on to Winnipeg, with orders to proceed home. I pushed on to Winnipeg, so as to be in readiness to meet the wounded on their arrival there.\n\nJuly 15.\u2014Major-General Middleton, with Troops and wounded, arrived at Selkirk this morning, all well. The steamer \"Marquette\" was in readiness, under my orders, to receive the wounded, who were accordingly transferred directly from the \"Princess,\" the steamers being moored together.\n\nDr. Kerr awaited the arrival of the steamer at Winnipeg, having a number of comfortable waggons provided, in which the men were taken to the Winnipeg General Hospital.\n\nI found all the wounded looking better for the journey, and it is gratifying to be able to state that all the transhipments were made without the slightest accident.\n\nThe next three or four days were fully occupied in Winnipeg, paying off the Field Hospital Corps, drafting the wounded men home, etc.\n\nIt was my intention to have returned to Moosejaw, where several claims in connection with our Department awaited settlement, but on July 22nd I received\nan order from the Minister to return home, leaving Purveyor-General Sullivan to close the accounts, etc.\n\nAug. 3.\u2014Accompanied by Dr. Boyd, reported to you at Ottawa. At your suggestion, and with the concurrence of the Minister, I subsequently returned to the North West (leaving Ottawa Aug. 10), for the purpose of assisting the Commissariat Officers stationed there in the settlement of accounts, having special reference to our Department. I travelled along the line of railway, as far as Calgary, settling all claims presented. I am convinced that in this way much trouble and expense, besides costly litigation, were saved to the Department. Returned August 31, 1885.\n\nI think it must be conceded on all sides that the campaign on the whole has been a most successful one. It is difficult to conceive any expeditionary force similarly equipped and circumstanced coming out of such an ordeal in such good form and with so few losses. The Canadian Volunteer has proved himself to be a soldier of no mean order. His powers of endurance and fortitude, whether confronting the enemy or in the hospital ward, have been thoroughly tested and found not wanting. Again, the remarkable rapidity with which wounds healed, and the very small mortality of sick and wounded, go far to prove the excellent physique of the men and their extraordinary powers of recuperation.\n\nIt affords me much pleasure to put on record my high appreciation of the valuable services of the medical staff engaged in the campaign. Where so many are distinguished it is difficult to individualize, but it may be safely said that as a body they have shown themselves to be devoted, self-sacrificing, unflinching in the face of danger, and, where occasion offered, prompt and able surgeons. I desire to acknowledge their cordial co-operation on all occasions, my anxieties and responsibilities having been considerably lightened thereby.\n\nThe dressers and orderlies attached to the different columns and hospitals also deserve mention. During the engagements at Batoche and Cut Knife Hill, more especially, they are reported by the respective Brigade Surgeons to have done excellent service, and in some cases to have displayed undoubted bravery in removing the wounded from exposed places in the field. In the case of those attached to the Hospital at Saskatoon I can testify to their unwearied attention to duty.\n\nThe Commissariat and Quartermaster Departments are justly entitled to our thanks for their prompt and efficient aid in furnishing supplies and transportation.\n\nTo the Major-General Commanding we owe a debt of gratitude for his uniform kindness and consideration. His constant care of the soldiers serving under him and his untiring solicitude for the wounded are now proverbial. Where the comfort or safety of the latter was concerned he was never slow in granting a request.\n\nIn conclusion, I may be excused for saying that if my work in connection with the recent campaign in the North West has been performed to the satisfaction of the Minister and yourself it is due in great measure to the hearty co-operation and support which you have both extended to me. Without them I must have signally failed in many particulars. The excellent selection which you personally made of supplies of various kinds and the prompt manner in which they were placed at the disposal of the Purveyor-General tended not a little to lessen my anxieties and added materially to the well-being and comfort of our sick and wounded men.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. G. RODDICK,\nDeputy Surgeon-General.\n\n* Here, however, I cannot refrain from specifying the valuable services of Dr. Bell, whom I recalled from the front to take charge of the hospital at Saskatoon. For a time he was one of the most responsible positions in the force, having some eighty sick and wounded men under his care.\n(H).\u2014REPORT OF PURVEYOR-GENERAL, HON. DR. SULLIVAN.\n\nOTTAWA, May 11, 1886.\n\nSir,\n\nIn compliance with your request, I have the honor to submit a brief resum\u00e9 of the operations of the Purveyor's Department N. W. Forces during the late Rebellion. I regret very much that, being almost entirely drawn from memory, it will not be as minute as it should. I have, however, sent so many reports and letters, that I may refer to them for full and complete details of every transaction.\n\nI arrived in Winnipeg on the 9th of April. After reporting immediately to Col. Jackson, who expressed his entire ignorance of my position and duties, or even the existence of such a Department as had been entrusted to me, I reported to the Deputy Surgeon-General, Dr. Roddick, and called on Dr. Douglas.\n\nI accompanied Dr. Douglas to the C. P. Railway stores, and looked at the four sets of medical outfit, each set consisted of a large number of boxes or small cases containing medicine, medical appliances, and instruments. I proposed to check them, but he declined, on the ground of want of time, also, \"there was no necessity.\" He said he would take two sets with him, and I could send on the remaining, as he required them; there was no use opening nor examining them.\n\nThe following day I removed the goods to a convenient store, rented for the purpose, and opened and examined them. I was surprised at the selection, and the quantity so different from what I thought required. I have reported fully on them, their quality, price, etc. I then used every means in my power to inform the Surgeons of the different corps of my desire and ability to supply their wants. Many applied, some were doubtful, while a few positively refused and \"would buy their supplies.\" I was the more anxious to notify them, because I was asked and refused to pass an account of nearly $500 incurred by a Surgeon of a battalion for instruments, medicines and appliances, out of all reason, and sufficient for several regiments. It also surprised me to find so many Surgeons coming up with their corps entirely, or almost entirely, destitute of the commonest instruments and appliances required in every-day work.\n\nI examined Major White's Company of Scouts, and visited the Hospital in addition to my other duties. I knew the solicitude of the Surgeon-General to provide hospital accommodation, and when I received your message to that effect, viz., to establish one, I examined carefully all the available localities and buildings in the town. I saw that the Winnipeg Hospital was new, clean, and well attended, equal to the best in Canada, and had been informed by Dr. Roddick that he had made an arrangement at $1.50 per diem for each soldier, to be paid Surgeon and Assistant-Surgeon. While I was most anxious to carry out your suggestion, or rather orders, and inclined to your views strongly, still I hesitated to accept the great responsibility and expense, and urged, as being much the best, the arrangement of Dr. Roddick, at the same time recommending a vigilant inspection.\n\nI was engaged daily in giving supplies to the different Battalion Surgeons, they were granted on requisitions duly signed; they required, according to your orders, the signature of the Deputy Surgeon-General. Very few of them had it, because that officer was not often on the same station with me, and it would be foolish to wait for him, otherwise they were all duly signed. On the day following the battle of Batoche, a public meeting of the citizens of Winnipeg was held, at which, by request, I was present. I informed the meeting of the solicitude of the Government, and the abundance of necessary comfort in my charge, the only difficulty was that of transport,\u2014that I had several boxes ready to go forward and all I asked was their aid to send them. I was enabled to send them on the next day. I had also the honor of transmitting to you the generous offer of the Sisters of St. Boniface to nurse the sick and wounded, and also the offer of the ladies of Winnipeg to send seven volunteer trained nurses at once. The next day\na car filled with supplies arrived from Ottawa or Montreal addressed to me; the railway officials refused to let me have it without an order from Col. Jackson, Chief Supply Officer. On application to Colonel Jackson he refused, saying he had no authority or orders to recognize me. I appealed to him, in view of the urgency, and offered to give my own bonds, but in vain, until I wrote him, disclaiming any further responsibility and transferring it to him. When the order was issued, I had no fault to find with Col. Jackson, who treated me always very courteously, but attributed it to his not having received any orders. I may be permitted to state here the obligations I was under to the Superintendent, Mr. Egan, the Deputy Superintendent, Mr. Shields, and all the officials of the Canadian Pacific Railway, for many acts of kindness, and I can bear cheerful testimony to their zeal in forwarding all the supplies with promptitude and care, always good, natured and agreeable. I never applied to them in vain, and they could not have done better if for themselves.\n\nI frequently asked for letters of credit and authority to purchase goods, but did not receive a satisfactory reply. I could not, therefore, pay the hotel and other expenses of dressers and surgeons which I was asked to do. They were constantly arriving and going forward, and were much dissatisfied when I could not pay their bills.\n\nOn the 1st of May I received orders to proceed to Swift Current, and lost no time in packing up our stores, filled two cars and part of another. On my arrival at Swift Current I found the hospital car used as a dormitory by dressers, orderlies and surgeons, while the caboose was used as a dwelling by the Commandant-General Laurie, and the Surgeon in command of the Hospital Corps. On further examination, I found that an old dirty, dilapidated car, deeply imbedded in the mud, was used as a hospital. It was close to the Railway latrines, the odors from which it could not escape; there were two or three sick soldiers in this, and they were attended by 19 (nineteen) dressers and 4 surgeons. I immediately determined to make a change, and had two marquees or hospital tents and four small ones pitched on an elevated situation, and had the patients removed. I wrote out a set of rules and regulations, a copy of which I submitted to you for approval; tin stoves were put up as the nights were very cold; I had more than once to procure wood, and prepare it, and gave my own blankets to a patient, which were never returned. I mention these things to show the difficulties I had to contend with. In addition I had to look after the stores, and ship as quickly as possible the orders which came from different sources. Our great difficulty here and all through the Rebellion was the want of means of transport; had I not taken great pains to secure it, very little would have been sent. I also ordered the hospital car to be cleaned, and ready to start at any moment during our stay. One man died, named Marais, he had had heart disease and was left in Hospital by the 9th when they left. No post-mortem was held, the body was embalmed and sent to Calgary.\n\nFrom Swift Current detachments were being constantly sent to different points, and each of these requiring a surgeon, dressers and outfit, the number of surgeons and dressers were soon diminished, and having fewer in number at the Hospital, it was better attended, and soon became as perfect as a hospital situated where it was could possibly be. When I was beginning to feel proud of the Hospital, we were suddenly ordered to Moosejaw. On the twentieth (20th) of May, I immediately ordered the car for the sick to be put in readiness. We transferred the patients to it without any difficulty; they were very comfortable, very well attended to, and were removed without a single complaint.\n\nGeneral Laurie had previously selected buildings (a number of which were vacant), for hospital offices and stores; the store for me was too small, and I had to engage another to protect the goods. A Base Hospital was established here. All being comfortably settled, and Dr. Roddick being in charge, I, as you had ordered a short time previously, undertook to make a tour of inspection as far as Calgary, visiting Medicine Hat, in charge of Dr. Tobin of the 9th, Crowfoot in charge of Dr. Cloutier and Calgary in charge of Dr. Tracy\u2014the latter, the largest, I recom\nmended be closed, and Dr. Tracy with his outfit removed to Moosejaw; after a day or two this was done. I found everything working satisfactorily and no complaints. Of this visit, I submitted a full report. Soon after our removal to Moosejaw, the Superior and 4 sisters of St. John arrived, from Toronto, in charge of Dr. Canniff. As might be expected, their services were of great value, they established order, regularity, and vigilance, and won the respect and affection of all. We received, from time to time, wounded and sick who could be carried from Saskatoon. Boards of examination were held. Agreeably to the orders of the Surgeon-General, several of these I attended, and in every case those who requested to be sent there, and in fact all, were made to understand that any further surgical or medical assistance required by them would not be at the expense of the Government. Many were sent to Winnipeg Hospital who had resided in that locality; contracts were made for washing. As the patients were gradually convalescing, and the Saskatoon patients were to be removed with the troops by water to Winnipeg I was enabled, with your authority, to close the Hospital, on the 20th of June. I regret to say it was left in a filthy condition, some goods missing were said to have been burned for sanitary reasons, without my knowledge; some few were broken or lost, and the remainder sold by auction. I received from you orders for the final disposition of the goods in my charge. These were to sell a portion, to store a portion, and to bring a portion home; these instructions were faithfully executed.\n\nThe new and choice goods, likely to be required for Government service in the future, I had carefully packed in Col. Peebles' store, and we have his receipt therefor. The remaining portion, viz., instruments and valuable drugs, were carefully packed by Mr. Tobin, brought home, and handed over to you. I visited the Winnipeg Hospital daily, when Dr. Roddick was absent; I also attended Examining Boards, and, on the 31st of July, sent you a full statement of the history, present condition, and probable results of each case.\n\nFrom Dr. Willoughby, acting as Purveyor at Saskatoon, I received the store remaining from that Hospital. On the 11th July, having arranged everything satisfactorily, we packed up and left for Winnipeg. I reported fully on these goods, their condition, as well as my examination of some of the accounts of the Hospital at Saskatoon.\n\nA few days after, I returned home with the goods, as ordered by you. As you are aware, sir, I had to forward all parcels sent by friends to their relatives and friends in the North-West. Troublesome and unpleasant as it proved to be it was faithfully done. Unfortunately, I had no authority to pay any charges due when they reached me, and regretted I could not send them on promptly. When such was not the case, they were sent on the first opportunity which offered. To me also was entrusted the receipt and distribution of the donations and gifts from cities ladies' societies. This added very largely to our work; it was equal almost to my proper work, and entailed great labor and anxiety. Still it was agreeable, the labor seemed a pleasure. Were it otherwise, it could not have been done, because, as you know, I had only one assistant and no outside help.\n\nThe department being a new one, there was difficulty in having it recognised, and its importance estimated. I have often asked the issue of an order to those concerned, of the necessity of communicating with us. In many instances, Surgeons refused to deliver up the medical stores in their possession. This condition was, no doubt, largely due to the existence of two medical organizations, the one Regimental, the other, a separate Army Medical Department. I may remark, that experience and close observation made me a strong supporter of the latter. Under the direction of a good head, harmony and a high state of efficiency can be readily secured by the latter. The failure of the Regimental service to at all meet the requirements of the Rebellion could not be more fully shown. Had it not been for the Staff Surgeons, the complaints would have been many, severe and grievous. I have not time or occasion to discuss it at length, but, I think I can easily prove by my experience, the superior advantages of a separate Army Medical Department.\nIn my opinion, too many dressers were sent; they did not prove equal to the trained female nurse, and could, if not dispensed with altogether, be reduced to a very small number. I also strongly recommend that the Surgeon in charge should be responsible for the management of his hospital or ward, and accountable for instruments, appliances, etc., supplied to him. It is impossible for a Purveyor to take charge of articles that are in the hands of others, and discharge his other duties.\n\nMany other suggestions I could make, but this is not the occasion. If a special inquiry be made, I will gladly give my opinions, if required. I believe we should not lose an experience so peculiar and varied.\n\nThe plan of a separate Army Medical Department was wise and beneficial; its defects were few and readily remedied. I can honestly congratulate you, sir, on an efficiency which elicited the approbation of all. All that the most improved modern science could suggest was furnished, and in a liberal manner.\n\nThe number of requisitions filled shows how extensively the supplies were distributed; it would have been much greater had facilities for transport been present.\n\nWhen so much care on the part of the Government, we add the munificence and generosity of the ladies of the Dominion\u2014prominent among whom were those of Montreal and Niagara Falls\u2014we need not wonder that those most interested, viz., the sick and wounded, expressed not only sentiments of satisfaction, but of astonishment and admiration.\n\nWith the assurance of my gratitude for your courtesies, I have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. SULLIVAN.\n\nTo Dr. D. BERGIN, M.P.,\nSurgeon-General, &c., &c.\nREPORT OF THE BRIGADE SURGEON, ON THE STATE OF THE COLUMN UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR-GENERAL MIDDLETON, C.B., FROM THE FORMATION AT TROY UNTIL ARRIVAL AT PRINCE ALBERT.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, 21st May, 1885.\n\nThe 90th Battalion Winnipeg Rifles left the city in detachments on the 23rd March, 1885, and the three following days, as also the Winnipeg Field Battery, and assembled in camp at Troy, which place they left for Fort Qu'Appelle on the 28th March. At this time the weather was very cold, and the men suffered much from sore throat and sore eyes, caused by the keen wind and exposure. On the 6th April, the 90th, 316 strong, and the Winnipeg Field Battery, 60 strong, also French's Scouts, 30 in number, left en route for Prince Albert, and, owing to the stormy weather, together with the mid-day thaw, the men had a very hard time on the line of march. At the outset I may just remark that most of the men composing the 90th were taken away direct from the desk and the counter, and many of them are also very young, and had received but little training, the regiment not having been long formed. A change so sudden might have been expected to produce disastrous results, but I am happy to be able to report that such has not been the case, as the men, though young, were of fine physique.\n\nOn the 9th April, I joined the Column near Touchwood Hills, and we were at the same time strengthened by \"A\" Battery, R.C.A., 120 strong, and part of \"C\" Company Infantry School, numbering about 35.\n\nWe continued the march to Humboldt by way of the Salt Plains; a very wild and bleak part of the country, the march over which was very trying to all hands, as the ice gave way in the pools on the trail, and the sloughs had commenced to fill with water, which caused the men to tramp all day in wet boots and pants, with little or no means to dry them for the next day.\n\nOn the 13th we reached Humboldt, having marched 87 miles in four days. It was necessary in order for supplies to overtake the Column to remain one day\u2014Sunday\u2014at Humboldt, during which I had stretchers made to supplement those in the ambulance waggon. I instructed the bandsmen of the 90th in their duties as an Ambulance Corps for the field; caused bandages and other requisites to be issued to them and to the non-commissioned officers, ready for emergencies, and further prepared the general medical and surgical outfit for immediate service. On the 16th April, we were joined by Major Boulton's Mounted Infantry, in number 70, with Dr. Ralston in medical charge. On the 17th April, we reached Clarke's Crossing, where we were joined by the 10th Grenadiers, about 260 strong. On the 22nd April, we marched for Batoche, and on this day the weather, which had previously been bitterly cold and windy, became warm and genial, and on the 24th April, at about 9.30 a.m., we had our first engagement at Fish Creek. The day was most trying on the strength of the men, as they fought all day without any food or drink other than what was taken at the morning meal, at about 5 a.m., and, though young, the men stood the hardship both well and bravely. Immediately after the first shot was fired, the ambulance was well up to the front. The 90th were in the advance, and the first man wounded was Captain W. Clark, and, being mounted, I hurried to the spot and caused him to be removed from under the heavy fire of the enemy, ordering at the same time the Ambulance Corps and all the Medical Staff forward to a point where they could be most effective, and at which point Dr. Ralston had already two wounded scouts in dressing. The Bands of the 90th, under Bandmaster Gooding, proved themselves most valuable during the day in bringing the wounded and dead from the field, which they did most fearlessly, while under a heavy and continuous fire from the enemy. During the day we had 46 killed and wounded, who were well and promptly dressed, just outside the range of fire, but at the outset we were so suddenly attacked that we were compelled to commence operations at once under cover of the nearest bush, with skirmishers to protect us. To attend to this large number, of whom 40 were wounded, I was ably assisted by Dr. Whiteford of the 90th, Dr. Grant of \"A\" Battery R.C.A.,\nand Dr. Ralston of Boulton's Mounted Infantry. The 90th Battalion hospital outfit and appliances in general for surgical operation and dressing in the field were most complete, and were instantly ready and brought into use. Hospital Sergeant Gosling and Dresser D. W. Cowan, a medical student from Winnipeg, made themselves very useful in assisting the Medical Staff in their operations, and I have to report that the wounded men were very promptly and efficiently attended to. The day ended by heavy rain, wind, hail and snow, when the General found it necessary, for Military considerations, to retire the Column to a more convenient position, when we had to commence the removal of the wounded who had been placed in tents, the camping ground being about a mile away, where we further attended to the wounds and otherwise afforded what comfort was possible under such very disadvantageous circumstances. The following day was occupied in more carefully examining and dressing them and in amputations, &c. We found it absolutely necessary to amputate three arms and to make one excision of the elbow. Early on the second morning after the battle, Private Darcy Baker, of Boulton's Mounted Infantry, shot through the lung, died, also Gunner Arnsworth of \"A Battery,\" shot through the abdomen; on the 20th April, Lieut. Swinford of the 90th, who was shot through the head, died. Preparatory to removing the wounded to the rear, I had constructed stretchers of canvas and fresh cowhide to sling to the sides of the waggon boxes, protected by canvas awnings supported by bent willows with a plentiful supply of hay, thus extemporising really very comfortable ambulance waggons in addition to the two which accompanied the Column, and on the 1st May we had all the wounded removed to Saskatoon, where I had advised the location of the first rear or Base Hospital. Dr. Moore, who had been indefatigable in assisting us with the wounded after the battle of Fish Creek, and whom I asked the General to appoint Acting Assistant Surgeon, accompanied me with the wounded, whom we delivered up on the 2nd May to Dr. Douglas, who had arrived a few hours before us at Saskatoon. At midnight of Saturday, Dr. Roddick, accompanied by several other medical men and dressers, arrived. The journey from Fish Creek to Saskatoon, a distance of 42 miles, was borne remarkably well by the wounded. I remained until I saw that all the attention and arrangements needed were secured, and put into operation and working order, when I returned to the Column. At Fish Creek we were joined by two companies of the Midland Battalion, about 80 strong, who arrived per steamer \"Northcote,\" which also brought us in supplies. The \"C. Company\" Infantry School, in medical charge of Acting Assistant Surgeon Dr. Moore, were ordered on the steamer, which had been made bullet-proof and otherwise impregnable, in order to proceed and act in concert with the main Column in an attack upon the enemy at Batoche. On the evening of the 8th May, Dr. Horsey, of the Midland Battalion, joined the Column while in camp. On approaching Batoche, on the morning of the 9th May, heavy firing was heard between the enemy and the steamers, shortly after which the whole Column was brought into action, and fought till about 8 p.m. The men lay under arms all night until next morning at 7 a.m., when the attack was again made, which continued until late at night, and the same course was pursued until the final charge on the fourth day, during which we had 8 killed, 40 wounded and 3 otherwise injured on the field. On the 11th we were joined by the Intelligence Corps, about 60 in number. During these four days, I was ably assisted by the Ambulance Corps of medical students, under Drs. Bell and Gravely, who joined us on the morning of the departure from Fish Creek. In addition to the Bandsmen of the 90th and the ambulance men of the 10th Grenadiers, too much praise cannot be given to the ambulance men of the 90th and Grenadiers, as well as the students, who, under heavy fire, were prompt in removing the wounded from the field. I found them, indeed, close to the advance line in the brilliant charge on Batoche on the 12th May. During the attack upon the \"Northcote\" there were wounded by gun shot:\u2014J. McDonald, one of the crew; Mr. W. F. Pringle, medical student; and Mr. Vines, of the Military Transport Service. In addition to the Troops, there were also wounded during the Batoche attack, Rev. Father Moulin, a priest, who is now doing well.\naboard the \"Northcote,\" also 3 Half-breeds and two Indians, all of whom were brought into our camp and attended to by the medical staff. One Half-breed and the two Indians died of their wounds and were interred by us. On the evening of the 12th we were further increased by two companies of the Midland Battalion, about 80 in number. Taking into consideration the great number wounded, 82 in all, we have great cause to be thankful for so few cases of death among them.\n\nAfter the termination of the Batoche affair, we proceeded on our way to Prince Albert, which place we reached on the 19th May, when I had a medical inspection of all the Troops in the Brigade, and it affords me great pleasure in being able to state that, as a body, they appear to be healthy and fairly well nourished, especially when we take into consideration that most of the men have now been near two months without taking off their clothes during the night, and sleeping on the ground the whole time.\n\nDuring the march I found it absolutely necessary to make arrangements for the treatment of the teamsters and other non-combatants of the Column, in number about 250, which I attached for treatment to the 90th Battalion, and therefore made that into the Brigade Hospital under Private Henry Gosling of the 90th, who I have recommended to the General to be appointed Hospital-Sergeant on the Staff. In addition to the transport men, I also attached to the 90th, for medical treatment, the men of the Infantry School and French's Scouts, as also the Midland, prior to the arrival of Dr. Horsey.\n\nFor the information and guidance of the Medical Department of the Army, I have the honor to refer to several matters which may be worth consideration, with a view to remedy or prevent a recurrence in the future of shortcomings or irregularities.\n\nThe men of the 90th, in particular, were put into the field at a time of the year when, although the reading of the thermometer is not so low as midwinter readings, yet, owing to the humidity of the atmosphere, the cold is very intense, and is more intensified by the winds. The clothing was not sufficiently warm, and had it not been for the heavy and continuous marching made during the cold days, the consequences would have been serious; the great coats ought to be lined with fur, leather, or some material to prevent the wind passing through, even broad leather belts to pass round the chest answer the purpose. Buckskin gloves ought to be supplied to the men, in order to admit of the free use of the fingers in handling the rifle; moccasins ought to be supplied to all the Troops to wear during the night to keep the feet warm and at other times on the march. I would also recommend that a flannel belt be issued, about 12 inches wide and double thickness, to prevent bowel complaints; I would also suggest that each soldier be supplied with a water-bottle\u2014the 90th suffered very much from intense thirst during the four days they were engaged, owing to this want, as there were no means of supplying the line of skirmishers with water who were out the whole day; I would also suggest the adoption of a light-colored soft cloth or felt cap, with a peak to protect the eyes and a projection to cover the nape of the neck; I would also recommend an efficient and responsible person, whose duty it would be to see that the men made the best use of their rations, so as to obtain from them the most nourishment possible on the march, and not cook them in a way that is hurtful to digestion and waste in various ways, also to see that the early morning meal be ample and hot and time to take it before the march out. This is most important, as all our engagements were fought under this meal. I think oatmeal would be a cheap and excellent addition to the rations.\n\nAs regards medical and surgical field appliances, I have to remark that the ordinary field pannier is quite inadequate for field service, it is only suitable for a very short service or a review, and had it not been for the supplemental chests which I took with me from Winnipeg, the 90th would not have been in a position to take the place they did in supplementing the other corps, and in attending to the requirements of the other parties attached to them. Therefore, it would be well for the Medical Department of the Militia to consider this matter, so that a supply of\nimperishable requisites be kept at each military station in chests of an approved construction and ready for use, with all the necessary bottles, fitting, etc., ready for filling with the requisites ready for use which need to be supplied fresh, so that in the event of their being required for use, the medical officers can at once supply what is needful for the expedition and the number of men composing it, and the time expected to be on service.\n\nThe men have very frequently, for days together, been without sugar, salt, pepper and apples, and as the food is very insipid without these articles, I would urge the Department to issue orders that these supplies in future be kept up to the requirements of the Column.\n\nI am of opinion that less animal food might be supplied, but that tinned vegetables be served in lieu thereof, with considerable advantage to the men and with little or no additional cost to the Government.\n\nOn any long campaign, such as the one we are now on, lime juice ought to be served as a ration at least twice a week.\n\nDuring the march of the Column, we have been very free from any serious ailments, the principal being excoriations, sore eyes and sore throat, although the men were supplied with goggles and mufflers.\n\nIn conclusion, I may remark that several other matters, which may be worthy of consideration connected with men in the field, have suggested themselves to me, yet I will not extend this report, but in the event of a committee of enquiry as to such like service, I shall be happy to supply any information required of me.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGEO. T. ORTON,\nBrigade-Surgeon.\n\nTo Surgeon-General, Militia Department,\nOttawa.\nFacsimile of a Plan, showing the position of the Canadian Forces at Clark's Crossing, found by Major-General Sir Frederick
