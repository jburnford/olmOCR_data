On reviewing our file, I find that this letter was directed to Dr. Truesdell, Indian Agent, Fort Simpson, N.W.T., and evidently he did not bring it to your attention. The main item in our letter of February 25 was our statement regarding Vera and Mabel Edwards and Thomas Ezea. The application forms submitted for these children showed that their religion is Anglican. Under these circumstances, they are not eligible for admission to the Providence Mission Residential School and their names should not appear on future returns from your school.

It is stated in this report that four of his children, Angelique, Bernadette, Sam and William, have been placed in the Providence Mission Residential School. The usual application forms and certificates of health should be forwarded for our file.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nSister Souka,\nPrincipal,\nProvidence Mission Residential School,\nFort Providence, N.W.T.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nIn a letter dated December 7th, 1944, Reverend Father Michel, principal of the above school, informs me that the Department has refused to allow the grant for three children who have been in this school for a year and a half. These children are Mabel and Vera Edwards, and Tommy Az\u00e9a. In view of the circumstances and facts related by Father Michel, I think that it would be possible to review the case of these three children and to allow grant for them, at least for the time that they have been in school.\n\nHere are the facts concerning these three children. Absolutely nothing was done by either the principal or by the Sister Superior of the school to recruit Mabel and Vera Edwards as they were brought to the school - or at least sent to it - by your Doctor-Agent Truesdell. Tommy Az\u00e9a was placed in school by his own mother. Apparently, the reason why the Doctor sent these two children to Providence although they were Protestants is that there is no Protestant school within eight hundred miles of Fort Simpson: this is the C.E. school at Aklavik; and moreover, that they are semi-orphans as their mother is dead. Tommy is an illegitimate child and it is stated that his mother can not take care of him as she is working as a servant for an American trapper. Edwards, the father of Vera and Mabel, had two daughters by his first wife, one of whom Elsie is now in the Providence school. A short time after the birth of the second daughter, Edwards separated from his first wife and took a second wife, this time a Protestant, but without the benefit of marriage. It is this second wife who is the mother of Mabel and Vera who were both baptized Protestants as their mother had been. The latter died at Fort Simpson last year. It was after the death of the mother that Dr. Truesdell decided to send these two girls to our school as there was no Protestant school in the region. It is possible that Dr. Truesdell decided to take these two girls away from their father because he felt that they were not morally secure in his care.\nFather Michel concludes his letter as follows: \"If the Department wishes to adhere to its decision not to allow grant for these children in the Providence school, let it indicate to us where they have to be sent; as we only accepted them on the recommendation of the agent. If the Department wishes to send them to Aklavik and pay their transportation thereto, we are ready to send them there; but in view of the orphan condition of these children, it is not enough to merely say that their names are not to appear on our school reports. There is no one to take care of these children, and we certainly can not put them out to die of cold and starvation.\n\nWill you please let me know your final decision as I have promised Father Michel to write to him with the least delay possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Crea was accepted in Providence at the request of his mother, who signed an application to that effect.\nOttawa, January 18, 1945.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, I checked our returns and find that the per capita allowance was paid for Mabel Edwards No. 0289; Vera Edwards No. 0290 and Tommy Asea No. 261 to March 31, 1944. No grant was paid for these children for the June and September quarters, 1944.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter, which indicates that these children were placed in the school at the express wish of the Indian agent and the further fact that it is impossible to transfer them at the present time, owing to weather conditions, it has been decided to allow grant for them from July 1, 1944, to June 30, 1945. In preparing the December quarter return of the Providence Mission Residential School, grant should be requested for each of these children for 184 days, namely, for the September and December quarters of 1944.\n\nIt is our intention to communicate with the Indian agent regarding these children, and their case will be reviewed at the end of June.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 18, 1945.\n\nDr. W.A.M. Truesdell,\nIndian Agent, Fort Simpson, N.W.T.\n\nI desire to refer you to our letter of February 25, 1944, regarding Vera Edwards, Mabel Edwards and Thomas Ezea. The application forms stated that these children were Anglican and you were then informed that we could not consider their admission as grant-earning pupils to the Providence Mission Residential School.\n\nWe received no reply to that letter and from a communication just received it appears that the children were placed in that school at your request, and no attempt has been made to secure other accommodation for them. The information received from our correspondent regarding the religious affiliation of the two Edwards girls is rather doubtful. It is our intention to allow grant for these children to the end of June, in order to give us time to review their status. I wish you would obtain further information regarding all three, especially regarding their religious affiliations and let us have a letter from you as soon as convenient.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Providence Residential SCHOOL DURING December QUARTER, 1944**\n\n| No. | NAME                  | Date of Admission | Age on Admission | Band | NAME OF PARENTS AND LIVING OR DEAD (Insert L for living, D for dead, after name) | Religion of Parents | State of Education upon entering the School | Place and period of Previous Education |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|     | William Bonnet Range  | Oct 11th          | 7                | Slave| Jean Baptiste D.

May 3, 1945.\n\nReferring to your letter of February 2nd, 1945, I beg to say that the girl you mentioned\u2014Angelique Bonnet Rouge\u2014was bereaved by the death of her father last October and had no home to which she could go at the time, and on advice received from the Father Superior of the Fort Providence Residential School and also the Constable in charge of the R.C.M.P. at Providence, I deemed it best that she be admitted to the school until some other provision could be made for her care. She is not very strong, but shows no sign of Tuberculosis, and I believe that regular meals of a nourishing type will soon build her strength up again. I believe she was living a very precarious existence before her admission, as they had very little food in the house, as the father was the mainstay of their existence and without him very little support for the family was available and only that through the generosity of neighbors. This girl had had very little previous schooling and is showing a very commendable eagerness to obtain some education. In the summer during my Annuity paying visit to Providence, I will endeavor to obtain a home for this girl with another family, but until that time I believe she should remain at the school.\n\nI have notified the Principal of the school of the error in using the wrong number of days in December quarter and also have notified her to show date of admission to school exactly and of her failure to show this on her December return.\n\nW.A.M. Truesdell,\nIndian Agent.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFort Simpson, N.W.T., May 3, 1945.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nReferring to your letter of January 18th, 1945, re the two Edwards children and Thomas Ezea\u2014the latter should be Isaiah\u2014as in our Treaty Book.\n\nAs I answer this letter, I am under a strong impression that I wrote you a letter concerning these children after receiving your letter of February 25th, 1944; but I have searched my files and can find no copy of it among them.\n\nThe two Edwards children are the children of William Edwards second wife who had attended the R.C. Church in Simpson and in Fort Liard, but joined the Anglican Church in Simpson two years before her death. From information I have received she was buried as a Roman Catholic by the Priest at Fort Liard after her death and I believe was given final rites by him before her death. Their father still claims that they are Protestants, but would only consent to their going to school if they could go to the Providence School, as he is very fond of them and wishes to visit them when it is possible for him to do so. As the only Anglican School in the Territories is at Aklavik 1035 miles distant from his home in Fort Liard, he was bitterly opposed to them going that far away from him, and I may say that I am very much in sympathy with him, as the climate there is much different from that at Fort Liard, being at sea-level, and they seem to be almost out of this world to our local Indians. While the Anglican School was still being conducted at Hay River, there was no objection to the children going there as the distance was not great from their homes, but Providence is so convenient as to distance, that most Indians are glad to send their children there. The same applies to the mother of Thomas Ezea, who resides only 85 miles from the Providence School and can see her child on occasion there. This mother is living with a white man and has been for nine years a few miles above what is called the Head-of-the-Line on the Mackenzie River, but Thomas is a child of a previous liaison and the mother is much opposed to him going further away from home.\n\nI believe that under the circumstances, an exception should be made in cases of this kind, and allow them to go to the nearest\navailable school, provided their religious beliefs are not interfered with.\n\nThe two Edwards children, Vera and Mabel are both of the Anglican religion and Thomas Ezea belongs to the same faith, as his mother is Anglican as are all members of her family.\n\nI should be pleased to hear that this matter has been discussed with the necessary authorities and a reply favorable to their remaining in the School be soon forthcoming.\n\nW.A.M. Truesdell, M.D.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 20, 1945.\n\nDr. W.A.M. Truesdell, Indian Agent,\nFort Simpson, N.W.T.\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the Edwards children, and note that their religious affiliation is doubtful. Am I to understand that the children are illegitimate? If so, they would probably be eligible, in view of the information given in your letter regarding their mother. If they are legitimate the father, of course, has the right to direct their education, but, as he is a member of the Church of England, it will not be possible to approve their admission to the Providence Mission Residential School. In this connection, I would refer you to Section 10 (2) of the Indian Act. I note, however, from your letter that he insists on having them attend the Providence School, due to the distance the Aklavik C.E. School is located from his home. Please secure and forward a definite statement from the father to that effect. This should be signed by him, and, when received, the matter will be given further consideration.\n\nWith regard to Thomas Ezea, what has been said in connection with the Edwards children applies also in this case, and a signed statement from the boy's mother should also be submitted to us.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, June 20, 1945.\n\nDr. W.A.M. Truesdell, Indian Agent,\nFort Simpson, N.W.T.\n\nI have your letter of May 3, with reference to Angelique Bonnet Rouge. In view of the information given in your letter, the Department approves her remaining in the Providence Mission Residential School until June 30, 1946, at which time her case can be reviewed. Please inform the Principal of the School accordingly.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n## ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Providence Residential SCHOOL DURING JUNE QUARTER, 1945\n\n| No. | NAME          | Date of Admission | Age | Band | Name of Parents and Living or Dead (Insert L. for living, D. for dead, after name) | Father | Mother | Religion of Parents | State of Education upon entering the School | Period of Previous Education |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|-----|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n|     |               |                   |     |      |                                                                                  |        |        |                     |                                          |                            |\n\n## DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | NAME          | Date of Discharge | Age | Periods in the School | State of Education | Trade or Industry Taught and Proficiency in it | Remarks Upon Discharge Reasons for Same |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 0228 | Madeleine Rossie | June 30/45        | 18  | 9 10 22              | Nil               | Grade II                                        | Attained age limit                     |\n| 0229 | Celine Rossie  | June 30/45        | 18  |                       |                   |                                                 |                                        |\n| 236  | James Estey    | July 30/45        | 14  | 5 3 1                | Grade II          | To remain in School another year                 |\n| 250  | Victor St. Pierre | July 30/45       | 14  | 1 10 12              | Grade I           |                                                 |                                        |\n| 0289 | Mabel Edwards  |                   | 9   | 1 8 24               |                   | Not accepted by Department                      |\n| 0290 | Vera Edwards   |                   | 7   | 1 8 24               |                   |                                                 |                                        |\n\nOr more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 918-10, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, August 20, 1945.\n\nDr. W.A.M. Truesdell, Indian Agent,\nFort Simpson, N.W.T.\n\nI desire to refer to my letter of January 18, 1945, in connection with Vera Edwards, Mabel Edwards and Thomas Ezra. No reply has been received to that letter and in checking the June quarter return of the Providence Mission Residential School, which reached the Department today, I note that it is the school's intention to discharge Vera and Mabel Edwards. Unless home conditions have improved or other arrangements have been made, I believe it would be in the interests of these two children to remain at Providence Mission. You may so inform the Principal of the School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nCOPY SENT TO PRINCIPAL\nFort Simpson, N.W.T., July 19, 1945.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq., Chief, Training Division, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nReferring to your letter of June 20, file 139-3-10, in connection with Angelique Bonnet Rouge, onetime resident of the Fort Providence Indian Residential School.\n\nFor your information, this Indian girl was brought to the Fort Simpson Hospital suffering with Pulmonary Tuberculosis, dying a few hours after her admittance on June 13, 1945.\n\nIndian Agent.\nProvidence Residential School.\nSept 29th, 1945.\n\nTo Mr. Philip Phelan,\n\nSir,\n\nIn the last quarter report the school has asked the discharge of the child No 236 James Etetseye.\n\nThe boy is still kept at the school by the agent's orders, till he finds someone to adopt him. James is learning carpenter work, machinery, farming with the Oblate brothers.\n\nKindly let me know if you accept the maintenance of this child on the report.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSr. Lucile Baron,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, 16th October, 1945.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, James Etetseye may remain in the Providence Mission Residential School for another year.\n\nIn reviewing your Form No. I.A. 411 for the June Quarter, it is noted that in applying for discharge of this boy you gave his age as 14 and stated that he had attained the age limit. The age limit for discharge provided by the Indian Act is 16 years of age although the Act gives us the power to keep children for 2 years longer provided the Principal applies for such a permit and the Department considers the reasons given are satisfactory. Possibly you have some understanding to discharge boys when they reach the age of 14. If this is so, I would like to hear from you so I would have the situation in mind for the future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nSister Cecile Caron,\nPrincipal,\nProvidence Mission Indian Residential School,\nFort Providence, N.W.T.\nProvidence Residential School.\nProvidence, 2nd December, 1945.\n\nTo Mr. Philip Phelan,\nChief Training Division.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter dated October 16th reached destination on November 27th. No mail plane during the Fall period caused the delay in answering your letter.\n\nI am very grateful to you for having granted my request concerning James Etetsaye. In my opinion the boy had to attend school to be helped by the Department, so I wanted to notify you that James was not in attendance in the classroom, but prefers trapping and working with the Oblate Brothers. We seldom have boys of 14 years or over at school. They are taken back by the parents as soon as they can manage a dog or set a trap.\n\nThanking you for your favorable answer.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSr Cecile Caron,\nPrincipal,\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Providence Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Lisage John\nEnglish name: John\nAge: 13 years\nName of Band: Slave\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: Willie Lisage\nMother's full name and No.: Mary Canadian\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: R.C.\nDoes applicant speak English?

She has assured me that copies of these reports were sent in October and January to Fort Simpson, for the Agent's signature, with the understanding that he would forward them to Ottawa. When the principal learned that you had received neither report, she immediately sent us these, without attempting to have them signed.

Feb.21. 1946.\n\nPhilip Phelan Esq.,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nThe enclosed Return from the Fort Providence Residential School, is from the Principal, evidently in answer to a request from you for same. It is on the quarterly return form, but is evidently to intimate the number of pupils in attendance at the school at the time it was made out. I did not receive this Form nor the Admission & Discharge Form until this week's mail, and whether it has been delayed at Fort Smith or Edmonton I do not know, as there is no indication on the envelope other than the Fort Providence and Fort Simpson postal stamps. At the same time I received a letter from the Principal, Rev. Sister C. Caron asking me if I had received these Forms, as she had been twice interrogated from Ottawa, re their non-arrival there. This Form would have been of a lot of use to me in my Registration of pupils in attendance at the school through the quarter, but there is no doubt in my mind that the Sister forwarded it when she stated and that it has been lying somewhere in a mislaid mail-bag and has only now been received here.\n\nYours truly\n\nW.A.M.

It is understood that she did not return after the last summer holidays. Therefore, a family allowance cheque has not been sent to her father. We are told that Adele was kept home due to the fact that she was not particularly well and that she will be returning to school as soon as possible.\n\nCould we please be advised if this child has as yet returned to your school?\n\nInsofar as Alice Rose Cholo is concerned, her father has reported that she is being kept home to help around the house, as he was in need of someone to work around the house. We have recommended, therefore, that family allowance not be paid for this latter girl.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nB. F. Heary,\nSuperintendent,\nWelfare and Training.\nAIRMALL\n\nOttawa, January 9, 1947.\n\nDr. W.A.M. Truesdell, Indian Agent,\nFort Simpson, Northwest Territories.\n\nMrs. Elizabeth Meneza,\nFort Providence, Northwest Territories.\n\nWe have recently been requested by the Regional Director of Family Allowances for the Yukon and Northwest Territories to ascertain if Jonas Meneza is out of school for a justifiable reason. We have read your letter of November 13, 1946, in which you set out certain facts concerning this boy and advise that he has been out of school for some time, helping his parents. You are no doubt aware of the regulations of the Northwest Territories Council dealing with the attendance of pupils at residential schools in the Northwest Territories and their discharge therefrom. These regulations were sent to you on file 139-1-10 on March 11, 1935.\n\nThe Indian Agent concerned should write to the Department about each individual case of this nature. Then a decision can be reached as to the granting of authority for such discharge. It is not our intention to deprive these boys of proper schooling unless it can be definitely proved that their fathers or relations are going to teach them how to trap.\n\nIt is our further intention that only in very exceptional cases will authority ever be granted for boys of 12 and 13 to be excused from school during the trapping season.\n\nYou will be interested to know that we are now experimenting with the teaching of trapping in three of our residential schools. If this experiment is a success, then it is our\n\n....... intention\nintention to do likewise in other residential schools of the North and to eventually eliminate all necessity of boys under the age of 16 being discharged from our residential schools.\n\nIn view of the above information could we please be advised if you consider that this boy is out of school for a justifiable reason and whether we should recommend that family allowances should be made on his behalf.\n\nBernard F.

If you refer to the instructions on the last page of the quarterly return, you will find that Principals are expected to prepare the return in the manner just mentioned.\n\nOn Form I.A. 411, the names and register numbers and other information regarding each pupil discharged during the quarter should be given. When a pupil is not in residence for the full quarter, dates between which he or she is absent and the reasons for such absence, should be entered in the column headed remarks.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nProvidence Residential School.\nMarch 7th, 1947.\n\nTo Mr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nKind Sir:\n\nI acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated January 14th. Many thanks for the Quarterly Returns, also for the Circular letter for the year 1947. I am delighted to have it for reference.\n\nConcerning the children's numbers: I was told when pupils leave school and re-enter a year or two after, we were suppose to give them the same number and place them after the last entry. So I did.\n\nFrom the form IX4II for the discharge of pupils, I filled the blanks as you say: But the reason for the absence, I cannot write it: \"They left for vacation and did not return.\"\n\nI thank you for the remarks, I will do all I can in the future to comply to the rules given, so as to lighten the burden of those in charge.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSr. Cecile Baron.\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 918-10, part 3)\nOttawa, March 18, 1947.\n\nRev.

I was called to see a patient, and on making the call I found the man ill, necessitating his removal to hospital and the family in destitute circumstances, and as this Indian will be unable to do any work for sometime to come, therefore I thought it wise to place the children in school where they would be cared for. This family lives a distance of five miles from the Fort - across the river, and it is difficult to keep them supplied with the necessary food. Therefore, will you please pass this voucher for payment.\n\nIndian Agent.\n### Admission of Pupils at Providence Residential School During December Quarter, 1947\n\n| No. | Name          | Date of Admission | Band |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|------|\n|     |               |                   |      |\n\n**Name of Parents and Living or Dead**\n- Father: Paul Landry\n- Mother: Coline Sabourin\n- Religion of Parents: Nil\n- State of Education upon entering the School: Providence\n- Place and period of Previous Education: 4 months\n\n### Discharge of Pupils\n\n| No. | Name          | Date of Discharge | Periods in the School | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge Reasons for Same |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|     |               |                   |                       |                    |                                        |\n\n**Periods in the School**\n- Years Months Days\n- On Admission\n- On Discharge\n\n**Trade or Industry Taught and Proficiency in it**\n\n**Note:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 918-10, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, December 2, 1947.\n\nDr. W.A.M.

Truesdell,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Simpson, N.W.T.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Mrs. Jerome Bonnet Rouge,\nF.A. #10-J-1194,\nFort Simpson, N.W.T.\n\nOn August 27th last we wrote to Sister Leduc, Superintendent of St. Mary's Hospital, Fort Simpson, pointing out that we had noted on her July, 1948, report that the child Therese Bonnet Rouge had been discharged on July 10th. We called her attention to the fact that on reviewing this child's file we found that the mother, Mrs. Jerome Bonnet Rouge, had died during the winter of 1944 and 1945, and since the father is also deceased, we are wondering in whose care Therese was placed on her discharge from the hospital.\n\nWe have now received a report to the effect that Therese was released during her vacation period to the care of her sister and that she came back to the hospital on August 15th and was once more discharged on September 1, 1948.\n\nApparently she was to be discharged from the hospital for admission to the Residential School in Fort Providence but Celine Bonnet Rouge, the child's sister who is living with one Alfred Edjus, wanted the child at home to help her and, therefore, took her away from the hospital. According to Sister Leduc, Therese is a sickly child not fit for the life in the bush and she states \"as Therese is of school age, 12 years old, the Agent should be notified and the girl sent back to school\".\n\nThe above information is sent to you for whatever action you deem necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. F. Hendershot,\nRegional Director,\nFamily Allowances for the Yukon & Northwest Territories.\n\nc.c. to H.M. Jones for transmission to Educational Authorities.\n\nRMB/DC\nProvidence Residential School,\nFort Providence, N.W.T.\nOctober 3rd, 1948.\n\nTo The Secretary,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nMines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\nEnclosed find Returns for the September Quarter.\nYou will notice that several pupils have not yet returned to school, I have maintained them on the report in case they return during the month. If not they shall be discharged on the December Quarter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSister Mary Mack, S.G.M.\nPrincipal.\nOctober 14, 1948.\n\nDear Sister Mack:\n\nWe have reviewed the enclosed Return and we feel that you are not fully conversant with the manner in which Quarterly Returns should be prepared. As a result, we feel that you are not requesting as much grant in many cases as you are entitled to receive.\n\nI am, therefore, enclosing a copy of our circular dated December 29, 1944 regarding the preparation of Quarterly Returns and I would also refer you to the instructions contained on the back page of the Quarterly Return form. May I take as an instance the case of Patrice Nadli No. 248, who apparently was in school during the June Quarter until it closed for the summer holidays. From the information we have, the school closed for holidays about the 24th of June and as you are only entitled to take two months' holidays, it is presumed that it re-opened about August 24th. Therefore, pupils who are in the school at the time the school closes for summer holidays are entitled to receive sixty-two days holiday grant on the September Quarterly Return. From the information contained on the Return, it would appear that this boy returned four days late, consequently, you are entitled to grant for him for the following period:\n\n62 days holiday grant minus six days taken in June Quarter - 56 holiday grant and in addition 26 days during which it is presumed that he was in school during the September Quarter, therefore a total of 82 days instead of the 17 which you requested.\nIt is important as far as the school is concerned to request the correct number of days under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during the Quarter\" as the grant is paid on the aggregate number of these days.\n\nFrom the circular and the information given above, I feel certain that you will be able to revise the Return. I might add that in cases like No. 277 Henry Simba where you mention \"At home may Return\" if this pupil was in the school when it closed for the summer holidays, you are entitled to fifty-six days on the September Quarterly Return.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nRev.

If not, you should explain under the column headed \"Remarks\" why you ask 86 days.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nAttach.\nChief, Education Division\nProvidence Residential School,\nFort Providence, N.W.T.\nJuly 18th, 1949.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nEnclosed find the Quarterly Returns for the June Quarter.\nI am asking the Discharge of the following pupils:\n\n0304 Corrine St. Pierre\n0318 Sarah St. Pierre\n285 Philip Canadien\n294 Gerard Bonnet Rouge\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSister Mary Mack, S.G.M.\nSister Mary Mack, S.G.M.\nPrincipal.\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | NAME               | Date of Discharge | Age at Discharge | PERIODS IN THE SCHOOL | STATE OF EDUCATION | Trade or Industry Taught and Proficiency in it | REMARKS UPON DISCHARGE | REASONS FOR SAME |\n|-----|--------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n|     |                    |                   |                  | Years Months Days     | On Admission       | On Discharge                                   |                        |                 |\n| 0304| Caroline St. Pierre| June 30           | 15               | 3 10                  | Nil                | Grade III                                     | Taken by parents - ill | At hospital      |\n| 0313| Sarah M.

MacKay, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nJoe Zaul an Indian of Fort Norman is seeking information regarding his right to place his three children to the Residential School at Fort Providence, while the local Indian Agent is opposing in order to keep the said children at the Norman Indian Day School.\n\nFather Beauregard, on behalf of Joe Zaul, asked me advise on the case and requested that information be sought near the proper authorities.\n\nI presume that the motives of Joe Zaul to place his children to The R.C. Residential school at Fort Providence is either one of conscience or of the difficulty of boarding his children in town during the school year.\n\nIn any case, since the section (118) of the new Indian Act provides that the Minister may designate such school to which every Indian child shall attend, I deem advisable to submit to you Joe Zaul's request.\n\nYou may recall that a similar case has been submitted to the Deputy Commissioner some years ago when a parent of Catholic Faith refused to place his children in a neutral school for reasons of conscience and was not compelled to comply with the wishes of the local authorities that the said child be placed to the local neutral school. I am referring to the Tuktuayuktuk Territorial School.\n\nApparently, Joe Zaul wants to send his 3 children to the Residential School at Fort Providence on the Mission's Boat which is due back at Fort Norman from Aklavit about the 10th of this month and will not make a second trip down there. Therefore, I beg of you to give this case your earliest attention and, if at all possible, inform by telegram Joe Zaul of your decision or of the Minister's decision as to whether or not his children are authorized to attend the Residential School at Fort Providence during the coming school year.\n\nI fully realize, dear Mr. MacKay, the implications of my action, since the authority of one of your Agent is concerned. However, you will agree that your Department is entitled to all information for its own interest as well as for the interest of the Indians.\n\nI may add that having incidentally met here today Mr. J.A. Simons, M.P., I sought his opinion with regard to the case of Joe Zaul and was advised by him to refer the matter to yourself. I feel then that you will welcome this opportunity to clarify the application of one section of the new Act regarding Indians.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCopy to Rev. A.

This office does not recommend Admission of this child to Residential school for the following reasons:\n\nOn July 2, 1951 the Father in charge of the local R.C.Mission came to this office and stated that it was his intention to have Walter Blondin go to Providence Residential School when the Mission boat passed this Settlement. I informed him that the father of the child had not called at this office and further that this child was in a position to attend our Day school here at Fort Norman. The father in charge of the local Mission was apparently of the opinion that this office had no say in the matter, I therefore wired your office under date of July 2, 1951, requesting a ruling. Letter from your office under date of July 6, 1951, was received at this office outlining the general policy, however neither the parents or the Father of the R.C. Mission came to this office and on July 22, 1951, the Mission boat picked up this child Walter Blondin taking him to the Providence Residential School. The attached Application being handed to me for signature the following day.\n\nThe father of the child Walter, Joseph Blondin, is presently employed as a pilot with the Northern Transportation Company, the mother and the remainder of the family are living in the Settlement. As you are aware we operate the Fort Norman Indian Day school throughout the summer months, in an effort to give education to children such as this child Walter. I would venture to say that the Blondin family will be residing within the Fort at least seven months out of the year, I therefore do not agree that the Department should be charged for the keep of this child at a Residential school.\n\nI have received information that the R.C. Mission have entered Metis children in the Residential school, for the sum of $3.00 each per month plus the Family Allowances. I would suggest that\nthe R.C. Mission be advised that Blondin be responsible for the payment of tuition for his child Walter. As stated previously Joseph Blondin is employed with the Northern Transportation Company and receiving a salary of Approximately $225.00 per month.\n\nMay I please have your decision in this matter. If we are to allow the Indians to send children to and from Residential schools, using that institution as a Hotel for their convenience, there is little hope that our day schools will succeed.\n\nIt has always been our practise to encourage all children, who are orphans or even of a family where one of the parents are deceased, to go to residential school. I feel safe in saying that there are sufficient number of children in the Agency under this category to more than fill all residential schools.\n\nL.C.

In connection with this boy Mr. Hunter writes as follows:\n\n\"On July 2, 1951, the Father in charge of the local R.C. Mission came to this office and stated that it was his intention to have Walter Blondin go to Providence Residential School when the Mission boat passed this Settlement. I informed him that the father of the child had not called at this office and further that this child was in a position to attend our Day school here at Fort Norman.

As you are aware we operate the Fort Norman Indian Day School throughout the summer months, in an effort to give education to children such as this child Walter. I would venture to say that the Blondin family will be residing within the Fort at least seven months out of the year. I therefore do not agree that the Department should be charged for the keep of this child at a Residential school.\n\n\"It has always been our practice to encourage all children, who are orphans or even of a family where one of the parents are deceased, to go to residential school. I feel safe in saying that there are sufficient number of children in the Agency under this category to more than fill all residential schools.\"\n\nFrom the above information it appears that this Blondin family is well able to look after their own children and send them to the day school. You will also note that Mr. Hunter considers that there are a sufficient number of children in the agency who are orphans or otherwise do not receive proper care and consequently are suitable children to be placed in residential school.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Walter Blondin\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th inst. regarding attendance of Walter Blondin at the Fort Providence Indian Residential School, I would say that in my opinion, there is sufficient reason for his presence there.\n\nFrom my personal conviction, as well as that of all our missionaries, and without blaming altogether the report of Mr. Hunter, I believe I am right in saying that the Indian Act provides Boarding or Day schools for Indian children, without specifying to which of the two kinds of schools a particular child is obliged to go. If I remember well, I have never noticed, in reading the Indian Act, that Boarding Schools are to be provided only for orphans and abandoned children.\n\nIt appears to me that Indian parents enjoy the privilege guaranteed them by their Treaty, of sending their children to the school of their choice, whether it be a Boarding School or a Day School.\n\nThere is no doubt that a residential school is better equipped in the long run, than a day school, to supervise the instruction of children in general, and more particularly in the case of Indian children. These children have a more balanced diet, are taught to develop habits of cleanliness; they attend classes with greater regularity; they receive a general and practical education in such things as cooking, sewing, laundry work, manual occupations etc., beside the ordinary classroom studies.\n\nHow then could we blame Indian parents if they choose a residential school for their children? Should we not encourage them in their choice?\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 918-10, part 4)\nAs regards Mr. Hunter's main objection, the expenses involved, I am under the impression that the maintenance of a day school is costing the Government more per capita and per day of attendance of pupils, than keeping them in a boarding school, where the cost is presently calculated at less than a dollar per day per pupil.\n\nIt would therefore not seem to be the presence of the parents in the Fort for a considerable portion of the year, which should determine the choice of the school, but it ought to be rather the choice of the parents which determines it. Although the right to choose is not specified as such in the Indian Act, it is likewise not denied to them either, but is more or less upheld by the Act, in principle.\n\nThe fact is that some parents do not yet realize the benefits of sending their children to a residential school. They keep them in the Fort with them, either to profit by the family allowance or under pretence of sending them to school, and thus carry on a rather precarious existence, being frequently compelled to ask for Government support. This would be avoided if the parents were in the bush hunting or trapping.\n\nWith all these reasons in mind, Father Beauregard took advantage of the passage of the mission boat on its way to Port Providence, to send Walter Blondin to the residential school there, having in view rather the interest of the child, rather than to counteract any policy of the Department.\n\nI trust that these reasons will convey to you the expression of my position in this instance, and remain,\n\nvery truly yours,\n\nBishop J. Trocellier O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie,\nTitular Bishop of Adramyttium.\nOctober 24, 1951.\n\nMr. L. G. Hunter,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\n\nRe: Providence Mission Residential School\n\nWe received your letter of August 1st in regard to the admission of Walter Blondin to the above school.\n\nI communicated with the Most Reverend J. Trocellier, O.M.I., in connection with the matter and I had a personal interview with him yesterday when he visited Ottawa. I agree that you should have been consulted in the first place. As the boy is now in the Providence Mission School, I think you will agree that there is no necessity for returning him to his home.

Resolution R.C. Mission Residential Schools.\n\nPlease note that there are some application for Admission forms for children from the Ft. Norman Agency. These children could have attended the Day School at Ft. Norman and in fact, one by the name of Walter Blondin had attended for two years at that point and could very well have continued according to a letter I have received from Mr. Hunter. He has written you on this score and I cannot approve the application, but as the child is on my quarterly return I do not approve of his tuition unless you wish him to be included.\n\nWe have a number of day schools in this country and all the teachers are R.C. where the majority of the children are of this faith and in accordance with the Indian Act. Where these are provided and the family can look after the children I do not see any reason why we should pay for them at Residential school. We have many children who are orphans or whose fathers or mothers are in hospital and these should be the ones taken into the Mission schools, also children whose homes are back in the bush and school attendance not possible.\n\nI have found that the Missions are very reluctant to let the school children go home for the summer holidays for fear they will not come back and if they do they may have to pay for the transportation. This condition has made it difficult to get some of the Indians to send their children back to school once they get them home because they say the Mission never sends them\nback for the summer. This is partly true due to our difficulties in transportation with its high cost. I was able to take a number of children home this summer with my boat but it is not a passenger boat and is not always available. Not to send the children home is bad both for the children and the parent. If when the children do not return to school and we demand that they go back to school someone has to pay the transportation and I wish to know whether it is authorized to transport children to and from Residential school at Government expense. It is realized that we spend a great deal on the Indian but where they live off the land they, as a rule, have little or no money and if we are to make the younger Indians better citizens and better equipped to look after themselves then I feel that we should be able to transport school children to and from school where they live in isolated points. In this respect I refer to Snowdrift and Ft Rae in particular as the other settlements either have the schools or can get there without much trouble.\n\nI.F.

Kirkby that he is having difficulty recruiting children for the Indian residential schools in the North as the schools do not allow the children to go home for holidays during the summer. He writes in part as follows:\n\n\"I have found that the Missions are very reluctant to let the school children go home for the summer holidays for fear they will not come back and if they do they may have to pay for the transportation. This condition had made it difficult to get some of the Indians to send their children back to school once they get them home because they say the Mission never sends them home for the summer.

Kirkby,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.,\n\nWith reference to the September Quarterly Return for the Providence Mission Indian Residential School, it would be appreciated if you would bring to the Principal's attention the following points:\n\n1. Pupils 0321, 0328, 274, 275 and 286 were shown on the Return with no explanation as to who these pupils were. They are not included on Form I.A. 411. It is presumed these pupils are re-admissions. However, for pupil 0321 the Principal has claimed ninety-two days and for pupil 275 sixty-two days. As these pupils were not in residence during the June Quarter this grant can not be allowed.\n\n2. It is noted that some pupils shown on the Return have been in residence for less than the prescribed number of days. It is presumed that these children were late in returning to school. Would you kindly advise the Principal when preparing future Returns to indicate in the \"Remarks\" column the reason for pupils being in residence for less than the prescribed number of days and the dates the pupils left or returned to residence.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nThe instances cited by Mr. Kirkby, of children from isolated points such as Fort Rae and Snowdrift, present even greater difficulties for us. Our boat no longer makes the trip to Fort Rae, as there has been too much demand for it elsewhere for the past three years, and the people around Snowdrift are so scattered during the summer months that it is almost impossible to find them on some occasions. What is just as disconcerting, is the fact that even when their children are sent home for the summer, they are nowhere to be found when the children arrive. It is little wonder then, that such children have had to be brought back to the school, for obviously they could not be left at a deserted village.\n\nOur missions are quite willing and ready to cooperate with the Department in every way possible, to assure the children a pleasant vacation, to the complete contentment of their parents or guardians, and we are just as ready, as we have always been, to make even extraordinary efforts to have the children return to school in the fall, but we must not entirely lose sight of the intervening difficulties which are still to be met with as regards this matter of summer vacations. I believe the missions are doing their part to offset these difficulties, and I will welcome any further suggestions the Department may have to make, in diminishing them still further.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nvery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop J. Trocellier O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie,\nTitular Bishop of Adramyttium.\nNovember 9, 1951.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFile 918-10 (F6)\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd inst. regarding the recruiting of Indian residential school pupils in the North, I feel that in cases where the missions are reluctant to let the children return home for summer holidays, there is usually a very good reason for such reluctance. A certain number of these children are orphans, or have no one interested enough in them, especially the younger ones who are too small to help with household work. Others I have seen waiting more than half the summer for parents or relatives who promised to come for them to take them on vacation, and then showed up about the time school was beginning in September. On more than just a few occasions, the Indians requested the return home of their children for the summer, and expected the missions to pay the transportation by plane, with no intention of refunding such expenses, even after they had more or less promised to do so.\n\nI know very well the remarks of the Indians who are inclined to blame the missions for not sending the children home for the summer, and I would be very much gratified to see the foregoing reasons considered by Mr. Kirkby and the Department, alongside the complaints of the Indians.\n\nWe realize very well, since it occurs every summer, that many Indian parents will not avail themselves of the opportunity of sending back to school children who have already spent several weeks at home. They are advised well beforehand when the Mission Boat is due on its last return trip, and if the children (and even the parents) can be found at all when the boat arrives, they insist that the children are not ready, or they are sick, or they will bring them later on themselves, or they are needed at home this year, or simply that they are not returning to school. Our boat has frequently been retarded for hours, waiting for children who were certainly returning to school; it has even made special trips which proved useless, in order to call for children whose parents had \"changed their minds\" about sending them.\nNovember 14, 1951\n\nMr. I.F.

Kirkby,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.,\n\nWith reference to the September Quarterly Return for the Providence Mission Indian Residential School, as we have not received the necessary applications for admission for pupils # 0359 Bella Sambelle, # 0360 Denise Moses, # 0361 Adeline Nahany and # 0362 Phoebe R. Nahany, their admission to the Providence Mission school has not been approved, consequently we are disallowing the per capita grant claimed for them.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would secure these applications and forward them to this office for consideration. When the admissions are approved the Principal may claim retroactive grant for the children on the December Quarterly Return. For your information the Principal neglected to include # 0359 on Form I.A. 411. It will be necessary for him to do so on the December Return.\n\nIt is noted that in many cases, the pupils returned to school later than September 1, however, the Principal has neglected to indicate in the Remarks Column the exact dates these pupils returned to school. We will pay the per capita grant payment on the Return as presented, however, in future it will be necessary to return the document to the Principal to indicate the dates the children returned or were truant during the quarter.\nThe Principal has claimed 39 days grant for pupil # 0290. As this pupil was in residence during June 1952, the school is entitled to the per capita grant for July and August which is a total of 62 days, consequently we are increasing the grant to 62 days for this pupil.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Sacred Heart Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Denyska\nEnglish name: Denyska\nAge: 13 years\nName of Band: Plains\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: \nMother's full name and No.: Julie Denyska\nParents living or dead: Mother living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Roman Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?: Yes\nPreviously attended: 2 years, here school for years\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

Because there's no Protestant school around here, I want them to stay there as long as I want them to stay. Me and my husband want that. We live six miles from town, and they will remain Protestant. I told Father all about it too. Any school is just for anybody too. I just want them to learn to write, that's all. And I know they will keep them the way I want them.\nI want to fix up everything with Father before they went to school.

Indian Agency,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.,\n\nWith reference to the December Quarterly Return for the Providence Mission Indian Residential School, please advise the Principal that we are allowing the grant claimed on the September Quarterly Return but disallowed due to the fact that the admission of these children was not approved at that time. The children involved are #0359, 0360, 0361 and 0362.\n\nWith reference to pupil #0357 it is noted that this pupil was admitted to hospital and died on November 10, consequently grant can be allowed for forty-one days - thirty-one days for October and ten for November.\n\nAs the admission of pupil #0363 has not yet been approved we are disallowing the grant for this girl.\n\nWe are allowing forty-five days grant for pupil #0313.\n\nThe Department approves the discharge of the following:\n\n#270 #0316\n274 0357\n288 027\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nFort Norman, N.W.T.,\nJanuary 26, 1953.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThe following wireless message has been received from Dr. E.J. Baker, Medical Health Officer at Fort Simpson.\n\n\"Louis Betsidea refuses send Camilla and Marie Therese to Providence stop can I send them as they need further nursing care and we need the hospital beds.\"\n\nLouis Betsidea and his five children have all been confined to Fort Simpson hospital since July of last year. The mother is deceased. The two children referred to are now ready for discharge but require daily rest periods. Marie Therese is 12, and Camilla is 8 years of age. Doctor Baker proposes to send them to the Residential School at Fort Providence where they would receive nursing care, as he requires the hospital beds, but the father refuses to let them go. The family is from Fort Franklin, and there is no one there who is willing to care for the children.\n\nAs Mr. Betsidea is confined to hospital and unable to care for his family, it would appear that he is hardly in a position to refuse, and I would appreciate your advice as to whether or not they may be sent to Fort Providence school without his permission. The cost of maintenance in the hospital amounts to $4.50 per day. They are Roman Catholics, so there is no reason why they should not be admitted to the Providence School.\n\nIf you approve their admittance, would you please advise by wireless message, in order that I may make the necessary arrangements. The cost of transportation would amount to $38.00.\n\nA.V. Cottrell, Superintendent,\nFort Norman, Indian Agency.\n\nc.c. Col. H.M. Jones\nG.H. Gooderham.\nFebruary 25, 1953\n\nMr. A.V.

Father V. Phillipe of Fort Franklin.\n\n\"Ferdinand and Joe Kenny asking for their boys John and George, about five years old, to go to school stop have contacted Mission Fort Smith regarding new kindergarten orphanage this their reply quote arrange with Agent for their admission and transportation to here\".\n\nThe children referred to by Father Phillipe are John Ferdinand, born May 28, 1948, and George Kenny born April 7, 1950. The fathers of these children are both widowers and maintain that they are unable to care for the children and do their hunting and trapping.\n\nI have information that Mr. Kenny expects to remarry in the near future and I cannot see the need of sending his child to Fort Smith. I am aware also that the child has been maintained by another family since shortly after birth, so it is not a question of having him cared for.\n\nThe child John Ferdinand is five years of age, and it would appear that the best solution would be to arrange for his admission to a Residential School, rather than a kindergarten, as his father is actually finding difficulty maintaining him. If you approve, we\nwill endeavor to have him admitted to the Residential School at Fort Providence. His transportation would amount to approximately $120.00.\n\nIt is not understood why these men have delayed so long in requesting that their children be sent to school. If the request had been received a month earlier they could have been sent to Fort Smith with the R.C. Mission boat at no cost to us. To have them sent to Fort Smith by air would be very costly and it is not considered that the expense would be justified.\n\nA.V.

It was considered therefore that their admission to the Providence school would be approved under Section 117 of the Indian Act, as the parents gave their consent.\n\nThe children were transported to Fort Providence by the Roman Catholic Mission boat in August. We have allowed this practice in order to save transportation costs of sending the children by air. However, we will instruct the Mission authorities to forward Application for Admission Forms for approval before transporting new admissions to school, in future.\n\nWill you please advise us regarding the children's return transportation to Fort Wrigley. The parents are not in a position to pay the transportation costs. We had no knowledge of the children's admission to school until we received the application forms and by that time they had already been admitted.\n\nA.V.

These members of the Board shall, in each other's presence, complete this memorandum, which shall then be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, in one copy.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry shall, if at all practicable assemble within 48 hours of the pupil's death.\n\nThe parents or guardians of the deceased pupil shall be given notice of this inquiry and be permitted to attend it or to send a representative. They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nFORM No. 414.\nA.

When and to whom did he or she report this illness or accident? To the sister in charge.\n\n4. What means were taken to afford relief? Purgative given for the night.\n\n5. What medicines were used for this purpose and in what dose or quantity? Influenza treatment was followed as it seemed to be a serious case of grippe.\n\n6. When was the doctor called? By first plane in March. Impossible for doctor to come.\n\n7. If the pupil was removed to hospital, at what time was this done and by what means of transport?\n\n8. If the pupil was not removed to hospital, what measures were taken for his or her care at the school? Isolation and previous treatment followed.\n\n9. Add any other useful information here. The patient slightly improved but soon showed symptoms of tuberculosis.\n\nSister Mack Principal.\n\nNote: If the deceased pupil dies in hospital at a distance from the school, under the care of the physician or surgeon who attends him at the hospital, a clinical report of the patient's illness and death in the hospital is to be secured and attached to this memorandum.\n\nB.

Tuberculosis.\n\nThe contributory cause:\n\nDo you consider that the physicians exercised reasonable care and judgment?\n\nDid they follow out your instructions?\n\nIf in either respect, you have any suggestions, please state them in your carefully considered opinion.\n\nAct openly and examine case hope-\n\n* This should not be a criterion.\nB. STATEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED\nTHE DECEASED PUPIL\n\nI attended Julie Lantagne from February 7th, 1935\nto August 12th, 1935. The immediate cause of death was\nTuberculosis.\n\nThe contributory cause of death was Influenza.\n\nDo you consider that the Principal of the School, and the members of the School staff exercised reasonable care and judgment in regard to the illness and death of this pupil? Yes.\n\nDid they follow out your professional instructions? Yes.\n\nIf in either respect, you consider them to have been at fault, it is required that you express your carefully considered views as follows:\n\nAct upon water, three doctors passed and examined the patient and declared her case hopeless.\n\n* Then surely not a citizen.\n\nSister St. Cyr, R.N.\nM.D.\nC.

Yes. If not, you are required to add here any further particulars which strike you as essential.\n\n2. In this space record any recommendations which the Board consider should be made to the Department in relation to the health or safety of the pupils of this School.\n\nI consider it advisable that during the winter months, at least one trip be made to residence by a doctor - and if possible two trips - one in early winter and one in the late winter.\n\nChairman\u2014Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 918-23, part 1)\nOctober 25th, 1935\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received your memorandum of inquiry into the death of Julie Fantasque, who died at the residential school at Fort Providence on August 12th, 1935. This was, of course, before your time, but I wish to point out that inquiries of this kind should invariably be held immediately following the death of the pupil.

At his request I am submitting the following information, and would respectfully request that same be forwarded to him.\n\nAt present time Eskimo children of school age are sent to the Church of England Mission boarding school at Hay River for periods of four to five years. Owing to the great distance, the parents cannot see their children during that period, and are generally adverse to sending their children to the school. Last summer the Eskimo of the Mackenzie delta offered to build a school at Aklavik and pay the salary of a teacher if only the school could be located at that point or on the coast. I would estimate that there are about seventy-five hundred children of school age among the Western Eskimos. The Church of England Mission are building a hospital at Aklavik this next year, and Doctor Doyle will be stationed there.\n\nThe Mission, I understand, are anxious to build a school for the Eskimo exclusively, but are faced with the fact that whereas at Hay River potatoes and other vegetables can be grown in sufficient quantities to feed all the children the year round and with fish form the main articles of food, it would not be possible to raise any vegetables at Aklavik. Therefore, all articles of food would have to be purchased and shipped into the country. A large amount of fish can be supplied at Aklavik, and the coast. The present government allowance to the Mission of $200.00 per child per year in residence would not, therefore, be sufficient under the circumstances, and I would suggest that it be doubled, with a view to encouraging the Mission in erecting a school.\n\nThe Eskimo are most anxious to send their children to school. It has been noticed that some Eskimo children on return from Hay River school have adopted some of the worst traits of the Indians.\nAgain an Eskimo child returns after four or five years at Hay River school, cannot speak the Eskimo language, is unused and dislikes the Eskimo food and mode of living; cannot hunt or trap, and is in fact a stranger to the parents and the country.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector,\nFrom: Cortlandt Starnes.\n\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nOffice of the Commissioner\n\nRef.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nCortlandt Starnes, Esq.,\nAsst. Commissioner,\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Executive Committee of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada has instructed me to place before you a formal and official statement in relation to the question of the educational facilities required for the Indian and Eskimo population of the North West Territories.\n\nThe Church of England sent its first missionary to the Takudh Indians of the Peel River in the year 1861, and has been in continuous missionary occupation of that region, therefore, for over 60 years.\n\nThe Rev.I.O.Stringer, now Anglican Bishop of the Yukon, founded the Herschel Island and Mackenzie River Delta Mission to the Eskimo in the year 1894. This mission has also been continuously carried on by the Church of England.\n\nIn the year 1915 the Rev.H.Girling, and his associates, took up their residence at Bernard Harbour, Coronation Gulf, and founded our existing mission to the Eskimo of those regions.\n\nWith the possible exception of a few employees of the trading companies there are to be found, along the Peel River and northwards, we believe, no adherents or members of any religious body other than the Church of England. Until a few months ago the most northerly\nmission station of the Roman Catholic Church was at Arctic Red River. The authorities of the latter body, we are informed, have recently occupied the new trading centre of Aklavik in the Mackenzie River Delta; and, if rumour is to be credited, have already submitted the proposal, or suggestion, to your Department that an Indian Residential School be established at Aklavik under their auspices.\n\nOur Executive Committee, and also our Indian and Eskimo Commission, has given very careful consideration to the entire question under discussion with particular reference to the fact that about 85% of the pupilage of the existing Church of England Indian Residential School at Hay River, Great Slave Lake, is brought from Fort MacPherson on the Peel River and the surrounding regions of the Mackenzie River Delta. The Committee also has in mind the fact that, while the Church of England community among the Indians of the region of Great Slave Lake is comparatively small, the whole of the Christian Indians and Eskimos, northwards of the Roman Catholic Station at Arctic Red River, are members of the Church of England. The members of our Executive Committee, and of our Indian and Eskimo Commission, are unanimously of the conviction, therefore, that immediate steps should be taken with a view to securing proper educational advantages for our people and for the non-Christian Indians or Eskimos of the region of the Mackenzie River Delta and the Arctic Coast of the North West Territories.\n\nThe Executive bodies mentioned have also given careful consideration to the question as to whether such educational advantages would be best provided through the establishment of a new Church of England residential school at Aklavik or some other suitable point in the Delta, or by the transfer to such suitable point of our existing institution at Hay River, Great Slave Lake. The Executive Committee, and the Indian and Eskimo Commission came unanimously to the decision that, providing satisfactory ways and means are provided for the maintenance of such an institution at\nsuch distant and isolated point can be satisfactorily worked out, our interests will be best served by the transfer of the existing Hay River institution.\n\nThe Executive Committee instructed me to take up these questions further with you, with a view to an investigation of the conditions under which such an institution, if established in the Delta, must be administered and maintained; and with the object of arriving at a basis of agreement, in connection with these matters, as between your Department and the Missionary Society in the hope that, in due course, you will see your way clear to approve the proposed transfer of the Hay River institution and to provide the capital and other sums connected with the carrying out of the plan.\n\nI shall hope to have an opportunity of discussing these matters personally with you on the occasion of my next visit to Ottawa.\n\nA similar situation to that described above exists on the East shore of James and Hudson's Bay. The Church of England first occupied these regions in the decade of 1850-60 and have been in continued missionary occupation since that time. One of our chief stations at Fort George has recently been occupied by Roman Catholic missionaries. We understand, however, that the Anglican Bishop of Moosonee has lodged a formal petition with your Department for an Indian Residential School to be located at Fort George, or other suitable point in the region, to be administered by the Church of England. The Executive Committee M.S.C.C. endorses this application of the Bishop of Moosonee and considers the fact of its lodgement with your Department as a sufficient interim safeguard of our interests in the regions affected, viz\u2014the East coast of James and Hudson's Bay.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nJune 12, 1924.\n\nDear Canon Gould,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 30th conveying your formal and official statement in relation to the question of the educational facilities required for the Indian and Eskimo population of the Northwest Territories.\n\nI am glad to take communication of the facts of your statement, which are of value to the Department and will be given every consideration in due time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.C.L.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada,\nThe Church House,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto, Ont.\nD.C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott;-\n\nThe Board of Management M.S.C.C., at its annual meeting last week, gave very careful consideration to the tentative proposals which have been laid before you with regard to,-\n\n(1) The educational and medical needs of the Anglican Indians and Eskimo of the Mackenzie River Delta, and the adjoining Arctic Coast.\n\n(2) The future, in relation to the foregoing, of the existing Hay River Residential School.\n\nThe Board decided;-\n\n(1) That the pressing need is the provision of a residential School for Eskimo, with a small hospital attached; the same to be located at Herschel Island or some other suitable point on the Arctic Coast.\n\n(2) That the existing Hay River School should remain at its present general location.\n\nI am leaving this evening to attend, at London, Ont., the Triennial Session of our General Synod. On the conclusion of the latter, in about ten days time, I shall hope to visit Ottawa and consult you, personally, on the above important decision of the Board of Management.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nSome two years ago I had the pleasure of meeting you and discussing with you the need of a school for the Eskimo children in the vicinity of Aklavik, MacKenzie River delta and Herschel Island. In July of this year I was transferred here after five years residence at Herschel Island during which period I became thoroughly acquainted with the Eskimos on the coast as far east as Tree River and have always been keenly interested in their welfare. As I pointed out to you at the time of our last interview, the parents are reluctant to allow their children to go to the Mission school at Hay River owing to the great distance and the period, usually three to five years, the child is retained at the school. Needless to say that the parents cannot visit their children during this period owing to the distance and it is usual that they demand their children back after the first year or two which of course is not in the best interests of the child. I neglected to mention that all Eskimos of the MacKenzie delta and coast are confirmed members of the Church of England.\n\nI am informed that at last efforts are being made to build a school for Eskimos only, either in the delta or on the coast since it is generally agreed that the Indians and Eskimos should be kept in separate schools. Aklavik, in the delta, is the dividing line between Indians and Eskimos, in fact both live and trade there and I believe some people are in favor of building the school at this point rather than on the coast; however, this is not the natural hunting ground of the Eskimos as it is heavily timbered and some ninety miles from the coast. Fishing is poor at Aklavik while the seal, white whale and fish are abundant on the coast only and are the natural food of the Eskimos. Aklavik is too near the hunting grounds and settlements of the Indians at Hay River and Macpherson who, for the same reason as the Eskimos, are reluctant to send their children long distance to Hay River school. On the other hand the Indians will not go on the coast nor can they live on the Eskimo food of seal or whale. As I said before fishing is poor at Aklavik and caribou never come within striking distance.\n\nIn my opinion Herschel Island is the only place for a school, 200 miles from Aklavik. Here is the largest Eskimo permanent settlement on the coast or interior, namely about\nten families; all the staple foods of the Eskimo are obtained here, seal are plentiful, also salt water fish such as herring, salmon and white fish; white whale and bowhead whales are hunted here in summer; caribou are very plentiful on the mainland less than one day's travel at any time of the year, white foxes and polar bear are usually as plentiful here as anywhere on the coast; in short the Eskimo children would be 'at home' in a school at Herschel Isl., and the parents would be able to visit them once a year about August.\n\nShingle Point might be mentioned as a suitable place for the school since it is just at the mouth of the Mackenzie River on the coast, however there is this disadvantage about Shingle Point in that it is so close to the river that the water is partly fresh and therefore no seals or big whales come near there. The fishing is very good and caribou are never far off but not as good as at Herschel Isl., 63 miles to the westward. There is no permanent settlement of Eskimo at Shingle Point as at Herschel, also in past few years there have been four epidemics of typhoid fever which are believed to originate at Shingle Point since the water supply is bad at that point.\n\nI have seen many sad cases of Eskimo children returning to their parents after three and five years at the Hay River school. They could not eat the native food; could not speak enough Eskimo to understand their own parents and knew nothing of making the Eskimo boots, clothing, working skins, in fact anything that would be useful in their everyday life among their own people. In consequence they were looked upon by their own parents and others as useless and in several instances parents who had attended Hay River school in their youth, refused to send their own children to the school in view of their own experiences. That is more Eskimo children seem to have adopted the worst traits of the Indian while at Hay River school.\n\nI have on several occasions lately officially reported the manner in which the Eskimo are exploited by traders, particularly in Coronation Gulf, and I hope these reports have been placed before you. I have the greatest admiration for the Eskimo and hope to get back to the Arctic first opportunity. If there is any information you should want concerning these people and the country, I would be only too glad to give it to you to the best of my ability, in the meantime I hope that what I have said concerning the school may be of some use to you should the matter come to your attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS. Wood\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 919-1, part 1)\nOctober 27th, 1924\n\nMy dear Inspector Wood:\n\nI have read your letter of the 10th instant with a great deal of interest.\n\nI recently had the opportunity of having a very full conversation with the Right Reverend Stringer, Bishop of the Yukon, and with Canon Gould, with reference to the needs of the district. All the information I have received goes to confirm your own view. There was a little doubt about the proper location of the school, but I note that you are strongly in favour of Herschell Island.\n\nI may say that we find it very difficult to secure funds for the establishment of new Indian schools, and I cannot yet tell how the Government will view the suggestion to establish boarding schools for the Eskimo. The question is bound to come up from time to time, however, as the interest in these people is developing, and it is my earnest desire to promote their interest in every way. You are no doubt aware that at the last session of Parliament, Eskimo affairs were, by amendment of the Indian Act, placed under the direction of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nI have to thank you for your letter and your recommendations, which will receive due consideration as soon as it is possible for us to extend our educational facilities.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nInspector S.T. Wood,\nR.C.M.P. Barracks,\nRegina, Sask.\nAll Saints' Mission\nAKLAVIK, N.W.T.\n(VIA MCMURRAY, ALTA.)\n\nJuly 31st, 1826\n\nMr. Duncan,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nBishop Lucas having resigned from the Diocese of Mackenzie River, the Archbishop of Rupert Island commissioned me to visit the same this year, to take note of conditions, as well as to administer it.\n\nThere are one or two observations that may affect your department which I take the liberty of making.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has erected a large building at Aklavik, designed probably for a boarding school, and have taken some 18 or more children from Good Hope and Red River to train. This is all to the good, but their main object seems to be to secure Eskimo children from Aklavik and the Delta, where they have not one adherent of their church.\n\nTheir representative, Mr. Gui, is here now, professedly to examine the school situation for the Government, and may report that the school facilities are already adequate. From his point of view they may be, but not from the point of view of the natives.\n\nI have in my possession two largely signed petitions, one by the Eskimos and one by the Indians of McPherson, asking for schools where their children may be trained, free from the Roman influence. These petitions will come to you in due course, through the proper channel.\n\nThere were at McPherson this summer 321 Indians, of whom at least 60 were of school age, 6 to 15, and the petition contains names of parents of 160 below the age of 16, none of whom can on any account be induced to attend the Roman Catholic School at Aklavik.\n\nThey are exceedingly anxious to have a school at their own place, and from the above, you will see that there is sufficient material available, both for the present, and as to the future, the births at McPherson during the past 30 months number 52, of whom only 3 have died during that time.\n\nThis, Mr. Scott, is for your information in case any representations are made from the other side. You know, of course, that they have no standing with the people either at McPherson or in the Delta of the McKenzie River.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 919-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 27, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Whittaker:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the building which has been erected by the Roman Catholic Church at Aklavik and concerning petitions that you have received from the natives of McPherson. Your representations will not be overlooked when the Department has under consideration an educational programme for these people.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D.

It may be well to point out that the one mission of McPherson alone has supplied perhaps 70% of all the children entering the Hay River School for the past twenty years. The parents complain of the great distance, and of their inability to see their children in times of sickness.\n\n\"If it were possible to establish a school here (at McPherson) of the capacity of the Hay River School, there are sufficient children on hand at this moment, and barring epidemics, a practical certainty that there will be for years to come, children that would be gladly given, to fill it to capacity.\n\n\"The fish here are not so good as at Hay River, but would yield a good deal. Also there would be no potato crop, but these are handicaps to be overcome.\n\n\"An attached list shows the children who at present make this their summer gathering place. This summer there were some 350 Indians visited here. It has the further advantage of an old established mission, with practically new residence and church, and over fifty Indian residences.

McPherson, which is near the mouth of the Peel river. The petition is signed by the parents of 160 children, 36 of whom are stated to be from 1/8 to 3/4 white. Most of the parents are Indians or halfbreeds.\n\nThe other petition, which is also supported by the white residents, is signed by Eskimos who are parents of 91 children and has reference to the establishment of a residential school at either Herschell Island or Shingle Point.\n\nRussell A. Herring\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJanuary 5, 1927.\n\nDear Bishop Stringer:\n\nI have your letters of the 30th ultimo and the petitions and other correspondence relative to the establishment of residential schools at Fort McPherson and at either Herschell Island or Shingle Point.

I have used them twice and return them by Express, prepaid, tomorrow.\n\nI am sorry no action is to be taken this year re the schools asked for by both Eskimos and Indians. The people will be much disappointed. It is difficult for them to understand the cause of delay. Whatever the general policy to be pursued regarding Eskimos, those already so far advanced, in the Delta, would, I think, benefit greatly by a school. I trust the difficulties will soon be overcome.\n\nAgain thanking you for use of the slides,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSgd. C. E.

In this letter however, he makes some reference to the schools and as we have no record of any correspondence in this connection I am sending you a copy of his letter, as no doubt he is in correspondence with you in connection with this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nO.

Stringer, D.D.,\nBishop of Yukon,\nDawson, Y.T.\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nPursuant to our usual custom, I submit my understanding of the agreement reached at our interview held on Saturday morning the 7th inst.\n\nOur interview concerned in the main the situation brought about through the erection by this Society, at Aklavik N.W.T., of a residential school building, designed to accommodate the indian children from the lower Mackenzie Valley provided for in the past by the Indian Residential School at Hay River and also the eskimo children provided for by the existing Residential School at Shingle Point.\n\nWe agreed:\n\n1. That the opening of the new school at Aklavik with the receipt of per capita grants for the indian children in question; should not involve the abandonment of residential school provision for the anglican indian children resident in the Hay River area.\n\n2. That this provision for the Hay River area should take the form of an institution which I described as a \"Family Indian Residential School;\" that is a small school of probably not more than fifteen or twenty pupils, the staff for which would probably consist of the Principal (probably a married man) who would be the teacher, one supervisor, one kitchen matron; the Department continuing to provide the usual per capita grants in aid.\n\nN.B. Since all the lands and buildings in question are owned by this Society; we would be responsible for the cost of any reconstruction required.\n\n3. That you would take into sympathetic consideration\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs....2\n\nthe request for a small grant, say $2,000.00, toward\nthe equipment of the new Residential School at Aklavik.\n\n4. That the hospital at Hay River will be continued as at\npresent.\n\nWe expect, I may add, to have the Aklavik School ready next\nAutumn for the reception of the eskimo children from Shingle Point,\ntogether with new indian pupils from the lower Mackenzie. We think\nit best that the senior indian pupils now at Hay River should complete\ntheir education there; and the others be transferred to Aklavik by\nthe last boat of the summer of 1937.\n\nIf there are any points in which your understanding of the results\nof our interview differs from mine as set out above; please let me know.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSG-G\nDecember 27, 1935.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, setting forth your understanding of an interview with myself on the 7th instant, regarding the situation brought about through the erection, by your Society, of a residential school at Aklavik, North West Territories, to accommodate the Indian and Eskimo children from the lower Mackenzie Valley.\n\nAs agreed in my letter to you of May 14th, 1935, grant is being provided for a total of 50 pupils at Hay River, as from April first, 1937. In the event of the residential school at Hay River being continued for approximately 15 children from that neighbourhood, the Indian pupilage that can be provided for at the new school at Aklavik will be 35 children, or, the total number for which grant can be provided at both schools is 50 pupils. Payment of the grant to Aklavik could begin as from the time the pupils now at Hay River have been transferred to that school.\n\nThe Department would favourably consider continuing the residential school at Hay River for the benefit of the Anglican Indian children in that neighbourhood and provide grant for approximately 15 pupils - it being understood, however, as all the buildings in question at this point are owned by your Society, that the Society will be responsible for the entire cost of any reconstruction or repairs.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.D., D.C.L.,\nGeneral Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nor repairs that may in future be required.\n\nRegarding the request that a grant of $2,000.00 be provided towards the equipment of the new residential school at Aklavik, I would say, while no funds have been specially provided in our Appropriation for the coming fiscal year for this purpose, it will, no doubt, be found possible to grant some assistance towards the cost of furnishing the building.\n\nThe Department agrees that the senior Indian pupils from the lower Mackenzie Valley, now at the Hay River School, remain and complete their education and that the others from that district be transferred to the new school at Aklavik during the summer of 1937.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nOn behalf of Canon Gould, who is absent from the City, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 27th ult.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary to the General Secretary.\nMarch 6, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. MCGILL,\n\nRe: Grant for Furnishings at\nAKLAVIK C. E. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn a communication dated December 16th, last, from Reverend Canon Gould, of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, he states that their Society expects to have the school ready in the autumn of 1936 for the reception of the Eskimo children from Shingle Point and Indian pupils from the lower MacKenzie. He requested that the Department give sympathetic consideration to the providing of a grant of $2,000.00 towards equipping the new school.\n\nHe was informed that, while no funds were specially provided in our Appropriation for the coming fiscal year for the purpose, it would, no doubt, be found possible to grant some assistance towards the cost of furnishing the building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 919-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nGENERAL SECRETARY\nREV.

EAST,\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\n\nJuly 25, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving recently returned from a visit to Aklavik, N.W.T., I am able to inform you that the new school building built by our Church at this centre to combine the activities of the Eskimo School at Shingle Point, and some of the activities of our Hay River School, will be ready for occupation in August. Miss Helena Sowden, the Head Matron of our Hay River School, is now on her way to Aklavik to fill the same position there, and she will take a few girl pupils with her. The other lady agents will take with them the other pupils who are to be transferred this year by the next boat. It is important that class-room registers and forms for quarterly and yearly returns be sent forward at once, and I will be obliged if you will either send these to me, or direct to the Principal, the Rev. H.S. Shepherd, B.A.\n\nI enclose herewith a small photo of the school building itself, and three snaps of supplies and building material landed on the river bank about 400 yards away by the path which has to be followed. The workmanship throughout impressed me as being excellent, and I was more than surprised at the skill of the Loucheaux Indian carpenters who had been trained by the master-builders, Messrs. Somers and Quartermain, and who had greatly assisted in the erection of this spacious and suitable building. The building has easily a capacity of 150 pupils, but instructions were given by me to the Principal not to enroll more than 100 at the time of opening.\nAn enrolment of fully 150 could easily be effected at once, but I felt it prudent to begin with the lower number, and I trust this arrangement may be agreeable to your Department, and also to the Department of the N.W.T., to whom I am sending a copy of this letter for their information. Just now I am unable to say exactly how many of the pupils will be Indians and how many Eskimo, but am of the opinion the Indians will number between 60 and 70 and the Eskimo between 40 and 30 during the first year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nEnc.\nDecember 27, 1935.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, setting forth your understanding of an interview with myself on the 7th instant, regarding the situation brought about through the erection, by your Society, of a residential school at Aklavik, North West Territories, to accommodate the Indian and Eskimo children from the lower Mackenzie Valley.\n\nAs agreed in my letter to you of May 14th, 1935, grant is being provided for a total of 50 pupils at Hay River, as from April first, 1937. In the event of the residential school at Hay River being continued for approximately 15 children from that neighbourhood, the Indian pupilage that can be provided for at the new school at Aklavik will be 35 children, or, the total number for which grant can be provided at both schools is 50 pupils. Payment of the grant to Aklavik could begin as from the time the pupils now at Hay River have been transferred to that school.\n\nThe Department would favourably consider continuing the residential school at Hay River for the benefit of the Anglican Indian children in that neighbourhood and provide grant for approximately 15 pupils - it being understood, however, as all the buildings in question at this point are owned by your Society, that the Society will be responsible for the entire cost of any reconstruction or repairs that may in future be required.\n\nRegarding the request that a grant of $2,000.00 be provided towards the equipment of the new residential school at Aklavik, I would say, while no funds have been specially provided in our Appropriation for the coming fiscal year for this purpose, it will, no doubt, be found possible to grant some assistance towards the cost of furnishing the building.\n\nThe Department agrees that the senior Indian pupils from the lower Mackenzie Valley, now at the Hay River School, remain and complete their education and that the others from that district be transferred to the new school at Aklavik during the summer of 1937.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

I am also enclosing a photo of the building itself which will give you some idea of what it is like. I found the workmanship excellent throughout.\n\nAs no doubt you will require quarterly and annual reports, I shall be obliged if you will send an adequate supply of your official forms for these, either to me or to the Principal, the Rev. H. S. Shepherd, B.A. The School will be ready for opening not later than September 1st, and it is highly probable that some pupils may be admitted before that date. The Principal and three of the staff from the Shingle Point School will be there in August, and three other agents who are being transferred from our Bay River School will be there in August also. I instructed the Principal to keep careful record of the date of admission of all pupils, and of the time when the school work began. Three other agents, all ladies, will travel from asternways by the Hudson's Bay Company's steamer scheduled to leave there on August 13th. I trust, Sir, that your Department will authorize a per capita grant for not less than 50 pupils during the first year. I have stated in my letter to the Department of Indian Affairs that the number may not be so large, but in the opening of a new School...\nsuch as this, it is practically impossible to specify the exact number of children who will be admitted. During my visit to Aklevik, I discussed the whole situation with your representative, Dr. Urquhart, and he promised his fullest co-operation in connexion with the medical examination of prospective pupils, and all other matters pertaining to the opening of the school. A prompt reply will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nP.S.

D., Field Secretary, Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, regarding the number of Indian children for which per capita grant will be allowed at the new Anglican Indian Residential School which is being erected at Aklavik, N. W. T.\n\nFor your information, I enclose copy of official letter to Reverend Canon S. Gould, General Secretary of the above Society, setting forth the number of pupils for which per capita grant will be provided. I may add that Rev. Dr. Westgate was forwarded a copy of our letter to Rev. Canon Gould. We have recently forwarded Rev. H. S.

Lorne Turner, Esq.,\nDirector Lands,\nNorth West Territories & Yukon Branch,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Turner:\n\nOn the 25th ultimo I forwarded to you a copy of a letter which I had written on that date to the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs with regard to classroom registers and other official forms, as well as the pupilage which would be allowed at our new Aklavik School for the first year. The Indian Department replied stating that they were sending the registers and forms required by them, and I shall be glad to know if the registers and forms required by your Department are being sent also.\n\nWith regard to the grant-earning pupilage which will be allowed for this School, I have found it necessary to write again to the Indian Department, and enclosed herewith you will find a copy of my letter. It is a matter of supreme importance to our Society that a minimum pupilage of 80 should be authorized for the first year of this School's operations, and it will be highly appreciated if your Department will assist us to the fullest extent of your power in this important matter. As the Shingle Point School was not administered by our Commission, I am not aware of the pupilage sanctioned for that institution, but the expenditure which has already been met by our Society in providing the Aklavik School building, appears to me to fully justify the moderate consideration we are requesting in the matter of a minimum pupilage of 80 for this new undertaking. As definite information on this point is now a matter of urgency, seeing that the last boat going down the Mackenzie River this year is now about to leave Ft. Smith, I shall be glad to have your reply at your earliest convenience. If you will authorize an enrolment of 40 pupils for which the grant will be paid by your Department, I shall be glad to have a wire to that effect.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nT.B.R.W\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nP.S. I am taking the liberty of sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, for his information. T.B.R.W.\nAugust 19, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am deeply obliged to you for your prompt reply on the 25th ultimo No. 141-1-1 to my letter of July 25th re class-room registers, forms, etc., and the authorized pupilage for our new school at Aklavik.\n\nWith regard to the authorized pupilage for this school I pointed out in my letter of July 25th, that the building has easily a capacity of 150, and that I had given instructions to the Principal not to enroll more than 100 at the time of opening. During my visit to Aklavik last month I spoke to Dr. Urquhart about the admission of pupils, and informed him that our Society did not contemplate admitting this fall a larger number of pupils than they specified, and I received the impression that he considered this arrangement reasonable, and would support it.\n\nI was surprised therefore, to learn from a telegram just received from the Reverend Principal Shepherd who is in charge of our Aklavik School, that the Doctor has recommended \"grants for 75 only\". Principal Shepherd asks in his telegram if our Commission can possibly arrange for the children who are expected from the Hay River School to remain there another year. This request is based on the fact that there are a number of children living at Aklavik whose parents desire them to be admitted at once. I have already sent a short Lettergram to Principal Shepherd informing him that as food and clothing supplies have already been shipped to Aklavik for the children who were being transferred from Hay River, these children cannot remain there, but will be allowed to proceed to their homes at Ft. McPherson, and remain there until accommodation is available for them on a per capita grant-earning basis. As I can well believe that this arrangement may prove disappointing to the children from the Hay River School, as well as to their parents, I am writing for the specific purpose of ascertaining if your Department and the\nDepartment of the North West Territories can authorize for the first year's operations at Aklavik, a minimum pupilage of 80. So small a pupilage will not provide sufficient revenue to operate the school, as we have already appointed a full staff, and the agents who have not yet reached the school, are now on their way. You will know as well as I that problems of the kind in question are inevitable in connection with the opening up of a new unit of instruction such as the one at Aklavik.\n\nThe difficulties in the way of solving such problems are accentuated by the remoteness of the location from your Department in Ottawa, and our Commission in Winnipeg. The action, however, taken by our Society in providing the building, and the suggestion I have made that only 80 instead of 100 be admitted the first year, must surely convince you of the sincerity and willingness on our part to help in the solution of these problems, and I very earnestly hope that between your Department and the Department of the North West Territories, grants for a minimum pupilage of 80 pupils will be authorized for the first year of the Aklavik's School's operations.\n\nAs the steamer which is to take the pupils from Hay River to Aklavik is now due to leave Fort Smith in the N.W.T., and to reach Hay River, if it adheres to its schedule, in less than a week, it will be appreciated if you can let me have your reply to this letter in time for me to communicate with the Principal of our Hay River School before the children embark. It is not our intention to maintain at the Hay River School during the coming year more than fifteen pupils, but if authority is given for the enrolment of 80 children at the Aklavik School, some of those who would otherwise have to stay at home for a year, could continue on the boat and be received into the Aklavik School.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nP.S.

From an interview with Reverend Canon S. Gould, General Secretary, M.S.C.C., it is understood that, in the event of the residential school at Hay River being continued for approximately 15 children from that neighbourhood, the Indian pupilage that could be provided for at the new school at Aklavik would be 35 children only during the present fiscal year. No doubt, you will be informed, by the Director of the North West Territories and Yukon Branch of the Department of the Interior, regarding the number of Eskimo children for which they will provide grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

At the present time some privately owned lighting systems are in use, but the settlement is so small and compact that the noise of the motors required to operate these was causing a good deal of interference with radio reception. As the whole settlement does not extend over an area of approximately one quarter of a square mile, there can be no doubt about the advantages which this central lighting system would provide.\n\nThe interest of our Society in the matter centres chiefly around the fact that an electric lighting system will be required for the new Indian and Eskimo Residential School which we have just built there. The School building has been completed and will be in operation during the coming winter, but the lamps which will be used this winter should be superseded by a better lighting system before another winter sets in.\n\nFrom the interview I had with the parties mentioned, I received the impression that a central lighting system could best be handled by the Royal Canadian Corps Signals, and I am writing for the specific purpose of ascertaining if there is any possibility of such an arrangement being made. Speaking for our Society I may say that we would much prefer to secure\nin that way the lighting required in our School, than through\nthe installation of our own lighting plant. While the Church\nof England Hospital which is now being re-built at Aklavik\nwill not be administered by our Society, Bishop Fleming\ninformed me that he would prefer to have that institution\nand all the buildings in his Aklavik Mission lighted from a\ncentral lighting plant than from a separate plant which he\nwould have to install for the purpose. As the Hudson's Bay\nCo., the Northern Trading Co., the Roman Catholic Mission,\nin addition to other residents in the settlement, would\nprobably contract for lighting from a central lighting\nsystem, I have every reason to believe that a central\nlighting system of the kind I have mentioned could be\noperated without cost to your Department, apart from the\ninitial cost of installation.\n\nAs our Society must take steps to provide our School\nwith a fully modern lighting system next year, I shall be\nglad to know whether the central lighting system of the\ntype I have suggested for the whole settlement can be pro-\nvided or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTBRW/KH\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., August 13th, 1936.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on the activities of the Church of England at Aklavik:\n\nA School has just been completed there that will accommodate probably 150 children. They also had a new Principal's house and I was informed the old Church was to be torn down and rebuilt on a larger plan. They were also working on a new hospital. As only the frame of this was up I can say very little about this building, but I was very well pleased with the arrangement of the school, and must say it was very well laid out and it will certainly meet the requirements.\n\nWhat surprised me most was that there were only two white men working on these buildings; a carpenter and helper had been sent out a year ago by His Lordship Bishop Fleming of the Arctic, and in that short time they had trained something like 14 Indians from McPherson who were graduates of the Hay River School, to do carpenter work.

They also had a new Principal's house and I was informed the old Church was to be torn down and rebuilt on a larger plan. They were also working on a new hospital. As only the frame of this was up I can say very little about this building, but I was very well pleased with the arrangement of the school, and must say it was very well laid out and it will certainly meet the requirements.\n\nWhat surprised me most was that there were only two White men working on these buildings; a carpenter and helper had been sent out a year ago by His Lordship Bishop Fleming of the Arctic, and in that short time they had trained something like 14 Indians from McPherson who were graduates of the Hay River School, to do carpenter work.

I note that you were well pleased with the arrangements and layout of the new building and the work carried out by the Indians, under the supervision of a carpenter and a helper.\n\nI have noted, also, that the Indians expressed to you their satisfaction for the school facilities that are being provided for their children. I understand that the new school was ready for opening about the first of August, last, and the Department, this year, is providing a grant for 35 Indian children, only. I am not aware as to the number of Eskimos for whom grant will be provided by the North West Territories Council.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM.

Up to the present moment I am still in some uncertainty as to the exact number of pupils for which the per capita grant will be paid by your Department.\n\nIn making this statement, I am not unmindful of the information set forth in the following paragraph of the letter written by the Deputy Superintendent General on Dec. 27, 1935, No. 141-1-1, to the Rev. Canon Gould, General Secretary of our Society:\n\n\"As agreed in my letter to you of May 14th, 1935, grant is being provided for a total of 50 pupils at Hay River, as from April 1st, 1937. In the event of the residential school at Hay River being continued for approximately 15 children from that neighbourhood, the Indian pupilage that can be provided for at the new school at Aklavik will be 35 children, or, the total number for which grant can be provided at both schools is 50 pupils. Payment of the grant to Aklavik could begin as from the time the pupils now at Hay River have been transferred to that School.\"\nAfter returning from my visit to Aklavik this summer, I wrote to you on July 25th, and informed you that the new School building erected there by our Church has easily a capacity of 150 pupils, but instructions were given by me to the Principal not to enroll more than 100 at the time of opening. I further stated that an enrolment of fully 150 could easily be effected at once, but I felt that it would be prudent to begin with the lower number, and I expressed the hope that this arrangement might be agreed to by your Department and also by the Department of the N.W.T., to whom I sent a copy of my letter for their information. This matter is of such transcending importance to our Society, and to the Indian adherents of our Church at the Aklavik and Fort McPherson settlements, that I feel impelled to ask you to give it further consideration, and to make provision in your Estimates for a minimum pupilage of 130, namely, a grant from your Department for 65, and a grant from the Department of the N.W.T. Branch of the Interior for another 65.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to our General Secretary for his information, and in the hope that he may be able to discuss the matter further with you and with the Department of the N.W.T. sometime in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/KH\n13th October, 1936.\n\nDear Dr. McGill,-\n\nRe - Anglican Residential School -\nAklavik.\n\nEvidently you have provided for 50 pupils between the Hay River school and the new school at Aklavik. There are 15 Indian children at the Hay River school so this means that you will be supporting 35 at Aklavik. There is accommodation this year for 75 at the latter school and the Northwest Territories appropriation will be paying for 40 indigent children, plus 3 children of Lapp herdsmen. We are advised that next year 100 children could be accommodated in this school and evidently the Church authorities expect the Government to support the Anglican school to that extent.\n\nWill you be increasing the number of Indian pupils at the Aklavik school in 1937-38? Please advise me at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Commissioner.\n\nH.W.

We have, however, included an item to the amount of $2,000.00 in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year, towards the expense of furnishing this school. Our Estimates are now before the Treasury Board, and I am not in a position to state whether this item will be finally allowed. The Department has had numerous urgent requests for unforeseen expenditures and our appropriation for the current fiscal year is practically assigned. We will have no funds towards the cost of the furnishings.\n\nI would suggest, should the purchase of the furnishings already be made, that itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the expenditure, to the amount mentioned, be kept on hand by the authorities of your Missionary Society. Should the amount placed in our Estimates be available next fiscal year, the accounts could then be forwarded and reimbursement made to your Society of an expenditure to the above amount.\n\nOwing to the absence of the Minister and his present illness, I have been unable, since your recent interview, to obtain his view regarding the Moose Factory proposal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

H.G. Cook, Missionary and Teacher of our Church at Fort Simpson, N.W.T., and with it a copy of my reply. It is regretted that the local Indian Agent was not available for consultation before the message was sent, but as the steamer \"Distributor\" might arrive within a few hours after the message was received, it was quite impossible to refer the matter to you before taking definite action. I trust, however, that under the circumstances, the action we have taken may be approved.\n\nFor your information, I may say that the name \"Gifford\" was mentioned in my reply as he has contracted to take a barge-load of vegetables this fall from Fort Simpson to our Aklavik School, and it occurred to me that if the \"Distributor\" had passed Fort Simpson before the message arrived, Mr. Gifford might be able to take the children with him, and thus save us the heavy expense of sending them through at a later date by plane.\n\nIt is my understanding from Dr. McGill's letter of Dec. 27th, 1935, No. 141 - l - l, to the Rev. Canon Gould, General Secretary of our Society, that your Department would provide the per capita grant for 50 pupils at our Hay River and Aklavik Schools. As the Residential School at Hay River is being superseded by a Day School, I am assuming that your Department will provide the per capita grant for at least 50 pupils at the Aklavik School.\nYour approval of our action in sending the two Grosstete children from Fort Simpson to Aklavik, and your confirmation of my understanding that the grant for 50 pupils will be allowed for our Aklavik School, will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nEncs.\n\nTBRW/KH\nOttawa, August 31, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 28th instant and also copies of telegraphic communications that have passed between you and the Reverend H. G. Cook, of Fort Simpson, enclosed therewith.\n\nI note that it is your intention to operate an Indian day school, rather than a residential school, at Hay River, on the understanding that the Department will pay per capita grant on an enrolment of 50 pupils at the Aklavik Residential School. This is the first intimation we have had of this change. We would like to have a letter indicating the exact date on which this change will take place.\n\nI can see no serious objection to the payment of a per capita grant for 50 pupils at Aklavik, if the school at Hay River is operated as a day school and if the pupils in attendance at Aklavik are drawn from the immediate neighbourhood of the school. I cannot convince myself that the practice of transporting Indian children hundreds of miles to a residential school is a wise one. In addition to this, I am not at all satisfied with the course of instruction provided at Indian residential schools in the North West Territories. P. W. Head, M.D., Indian Agent, Fort Norman, in a letter to the Department dated July 9th, states:\n\n\"The one complaint of the Indians that I have to draw to the attention of the Department is the question of school instruction. They claim their children are taught nothing useful to them in their mode of living and that when they come home they are useless for work in the bush. Some even go so far as to state that they will not let their children return to school.\"\n\nRev. T.B.R.

I do not know that there is anything we can do about it now that they have been sent, other than ask that these children be returned to Fort Simpson at the end of the school year.\n\nThe records indicate that we are making a contribution of approximately $600.00 to the salary of a teacher at Fort Simpson.\n\nThe mother of these children, it is true, may experience considerable difficulty in providing them with the food and clothing necessary to enable them to take advantage of the local day school facilities. In this respect, however, the children do not differ from hundreds of other children throughout the Dominion. The appeal of an Indian agent for relief allowances for a family such as this is always sympathetically considered by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 7, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of May 18th last enclosing copy of order placed with Moyer School Supplies Limited, Edmonton, for new desks for the Aklavik Residential School.\n\nThe firm mentioned was instructed to forward their account to you in triplicate and you were expected to certify the account and send it to the Department for payment. We have not yet received this account from you and as a result the Moyer School Supplies Limited have not yet been paid. If the desks have arrived at the school, please certify and forward the account at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. H. Sherman Shepherd,\nPrincipal,\nC.E.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWith further reference to the second paragraph on Page 2 of your letter of the 31st ult. No. 141-1-1 re the sending of the two Grossetete children from Fort Simpson to our Aklavik School, I beg to state that I have this morning received a letter from our Church's missionary at Fort Simpson, in which he informs that the children were not sent. His letter reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The mother only made up her mind the day before the boat was expected, so time was scarce. Unfortunately when the time came for the kiddies to leave the parties concerned changed their minds, and so the Grossetete children have not gone to the School.\"\n\nWhile this information fully clears up the situation regarding these two children, our Commission would be grateful for a specific statement from your Department that the p.o. grant will be paid during the fiscal year 1937-1938 for fifty pupils at our Aklavik School. This is my understanding of the agreement reached between our General Secretary and the Director of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nX: See Dr. McGill's letter to Canon Gould, Dec. 27, 1935--No. 141-1-1.\nSeptember 24, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant and it is noted that the two Grossetete children were not sent to the Aklavik C.E. Residential School. The Department has already paid grant for the pupils who were in attendance at the Hay River Indian Residential School for the quarter ended June 30, 1937.\n\nIt is presumed that no further returns will be received from the Hay River Residential School and, under these circumstances grant for fifty pupils will be allowed from July 1, 1937, at the Aklavik C.E. Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T.B.B. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.,\n39-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nReferring to our correspondence concerning the transfer to Aklavik of our main pupilage from the Hay River Residential School, and the consequent erection at Church expense of a fully equipped Institution at Aklavik, with accommodation for at least 100 pupils; you will doubtless remember our agreement concerning the subsidiary proposal that a small Residential School, on a Family basis, for 15 pupils, with per capita grants, be continued at Hay River.\n\nThis latter proposal has been fully examined with the result that we have come to the conclusion that a Day School is the best and sufficient provision for the children at Hay River. We, therefore, abandoned the proposal to establish a Family Residential School.\n\nI now beg to make application that the 15 per capita grants reserved for the proposed Family School at Hay River be transferred to, and made available for, the Aklavik School, thus enlarging by that number the per capita earning pupilage at the Aklavik Institution. I shall be obliged if you are able to give this important matter your early and favorable consideration.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nSG:G\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nP.S. I have been confined to the house for several days by a \"lame leg\" and am, in consequence, unable to refer to the date and file number of the correspondence relating to the above matters.\n\nS.G.\nOTTAWA, September 25, 1937.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 22nd, I was informed by a letter from Dr. Westgate that Hay River School had closed as a residential school and I recently had a visit from His Lordship, Right Reverend Arthur Sovereign, in connection with the Day School at Hay River. I requested him to let me have some further information regarding the probable number of children that would attend a Day School if one were started. If the number is reasonable, I am prepared to authorize a salary for a Day School teacher at this point.\n\nThe per capita allowance for the fifteen pupils at Hay River will be transferred to your Aklavik School. The last returns from Hay River covered the quarter ended June 30th, 1937. It is presumed that no further returns will be received from that school and, consequently, the pupilage of fifty will be allowed at Aklavik from July 31, 1937.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nVery Reverend Canon Gould,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMissionary Society of the Church of England,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to Departmental letters Numbers 141-1-1 of the 24th and 27th September respectively. The former addressed to the Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D., and the latter to the Rev. Canon Gould.\n\nIn both instances, mention is made of the point that per capita allowance for the 15 pupils at Hay River was made for the quarter ending June 30th, 1937, and that the pupilage of 50 will be allowed at Aklavik from July 31st, 1937.\n\nThe Commission strongly incline to the opinion that the latter date is a typographical error and should read from July 1st, 1937.\n\nMay I be favoured with confirmation of this opinion, if correct, at your convenience?\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.\n\nEWM/KH\nDr. Harold W.

Mermagen, Assistant Secretary-Treasurer, of our Commission on the 20th ultimo. On my return to Winnipeg I find that the grant has not been paid, and will be glad if you will kindly give the matter your own personal attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nMR.

EX'D.\nOttawa,\nMarch 17, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn reviewing your annual report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1937 I note that under the heading \"Industries Taught\" you wrote as follows:\n\nCooking\u2014Laundry work\u2014Sewing of native costumes; Shoemaking (Native)\u2014Fishing.\n\nI would appreciate receiving more complete information from you in connection with the industries taught at the Aklavik C. E. School. I am particularly interested in knowing the number of hours a week the pupils are engaged in industrial pursuits.\n\nThe Department is being continually urged to make the training in Indian Residential Schools as practical as possible in order to properly fit the pupils for their future life. It is, therefore, necessary that we should have full information regarding your efforts in this regard and also any plans that you may have to increase the utility of the instruction given at your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nFile 141-1-1\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 17, asking for more information regarding the industries taught in our school I reply as follows:\n\nAll girls twelve years or over have half a day in the class room and half a day in Industrial training, following these pursuits I have listed in my report. Girls younger than twelve spend the full day in the class room. The training we attempt to give them girls is as far as we are able just the sort that will be of help to them in their life after they have returned home.\n\nAll boys ten years or over receive instruction in fishing, net making and the care of nets, in season; the care of dogs, dog driving, harnessing, feeding, etc.; the handling of boats in summer; muskrat trapping in the spring, wood work, as often as much as we have opportunity, and in the procuring of firewood, water, and ice for summer water.\n\nIt is not possible to keep the boys out of school for half of each day, but they are taken in relays of twos or fours by my assistant for half a day as often as their turn comes.\n\nI have spent eight years living in close contact with the Eskimo people on the Arctic coast, and two further years here in this settlement, and realize fully the need of practical training for these children. Judging from the children we have sent back to their homes, I think our training has been very good. Keeping the children too long a period from their homes does more harm, I think, toward unfitting them for their native life than any other factor. This needs to be watched very carefully, but with children who are orphans, who have to be taken into the school while they are still babies and have no home to go to for summer holidays, the difficulty is hard to overcome.\n\nA native seamstress who could instruct the girls in the making and care of fur clothing, and a practical man who could instruct the boys in wood work, engines, nets, trapping and other practical things would undoubtedly help our school. I intend to take these matters up with our office in Winnipeg and see if it cannot be arranged.\n\nI hope this answers your letter fully, and assuring\nYou of my earnest desire to make the training of our school as beneficial to the Eskimo and Indian peoples as possible,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nR.A.

Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nAs I feel certain you and your Department will be interested in some of the worthwhile results achieved at the Schools in the Canadian northland, I am making the following extracts from a letter just received this morning from the Head Matron of our Aklavik School, and written on the 6th inst.:\n\n\"One of the older Eskimo boys of two year's schooling, and who was somewhat conversant with English before he came into residence, was able to act as an interpreter for the Police here in an emergency. We understand that both the English and the Eskimo were interpreted very well, and the boy himself was pleased to have been of service in this respect.\"\n\nIt will be gratifying for the former workers of both the Shingle Point and Hay River Schools to know that this summer we have received many laudable examples of the success our old Scholars are making of their time. From Cambridge Bay came written word that David, who started his schooling at Shingle Point, expected to act as organist for each of the Easter Services to be held at the Mission Church, whilst George Grover, of both Hay River and Shingle Point Schools,\n\"hoped to be used by the Missionary to interpret the Easter message into Eskimo for the people there.\n\nCiting the case of Angus (Eskimo) it is understood that he was one of the most successful at White Fox trapping last year, bringing into Aklavik for trading, large catches of this valuable fur.\n\nFrom Fort McPherson we learn that Peter (Indian) is his father's \"right hand\" - so dependable, and a Muskrat trapper in earnest.\n\nThe two pupil nurses in training here at the Mission Hospital are both from the Loucheu Band, and they give evidence of taking up their duties in a keen and praiseworthy manner. These girls Luoy and Jane have both had the advantage of School routine.\n\nQuite proudly, Mary, coming to Aklavik a few days after her marriage at Fort McPherson to one of the former Hay River School boys, said, \"Did you know that three of your old Hay River girls were married at the same time to three of the Hay River boys, and I was one of them?\" We feel certain that these young people will endeavour to set up the Christian standard of living in their homes.\"\n\nThe statement sometimes made by badly-informed people that the Residential Schools unfit the pupils for hunting and trapping, is not supported by these quotations, and I am deeply convinced that this class of school is conferring on the Indians and Eskimo of Canada one of the greatest benefits they are receiving.\n\nWith the Season's Greetings,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW/KH\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 919-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 18, 1939.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 14th instant, in which you send forward for my information a number of excerpts taken from a letter received by you from the Head Matron of the Church of England school at Aklavik.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that I have found these excerpts very interesting and very encouraging. It is particularly gratifying to note that there seems to be a tendency at all our residential schools to move gradually in the direction of worthwhile vocational courses.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to wish you a very enjoyable Christmas and a happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

Phelan,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nRe - Anglican Residential School at Aklavik, Your File - 141-1-1\n\nReferring to your telephone inquiry to Mr. Cumming, I wish to advise that for the fiscal year 1940-41 we are providing for the maintenance of a total number of 50 white, Eskimo and half-breed children in the Anglican residential school at Aklavik. Reverend T.B.R. Westgate, D.D., Secretary, M.S.C.C., was advised to this effect on the 20th February last.\n\nDirector.\nAll Saints Residential School,\nAklavik, N.W.T.,\nSeptember 17th, 1942.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,- Attention Mr. R.A.Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 2nd, and August 21st, the following is the list of the subjects taught in our class rooms, to Indian, Eskimo and half-breed children:\n\nReading, writing, arithmetic, health, scripture, physical training, spelling, language, history, geography, music, art, sewing, citizenship.\n\nParticular emphasis is placed on reading, writing and arithmetic. By far the greater part of the time spent in the class room, is devoted to the teaching of these subjects. In addition to the list above noted, as much practical training as we are able to give, is given to the boys in fishing, trapping rats in season, procuring of fire wood, and all other routine work, which is a part of the living in this Northern country. The girls are taught to sew, wash, preparation of meat and fish, for meals; here we make native parkas and boots.\n\nMost of the children who attend our school, stay for only three years, and in most cases I do not encourage them to remain longer. Exceptions have to be made in the case of orphan children. When we receive a child at nine years of age, and keep the child for three years, I consider that the child has acquired sufficient knowledge of the subjects that can be taught in our school, to give him or her, the maximum benefit of the school training, and the child is not handicapped, by this shorter period, in fitting back into their native environment.\n\nIt's clear that an extensive education can be imparted to a child in three years, but I feel that a knowledge of English and a small knowledge of school subjects, is much better than a long period away from their natural home life, and a more extensive education.\nOn the other hand, I would very much like to see some provision made for high education for promising boys and girls, who are mostly \"white\", have no home to return to, and who, given a chance, might very well develop into a much finer type of Canadian citizen, than they could possibly become with the limited opportunities available here in the North.\n\nI trust this information will be of value to you, and anything further I can do to assist you in this survey, I will be very glad to do.\n\nWith kind regards, I am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nExperimental Sub-Station\nFort Vermillion, Alberta.\n\nNovember 14, 1942.\n\nE.S. Archibald, Esq., B.A. B.S.A. LL.D. D.Sc.,\nDirector,\nDominion Experimental Farms,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Archibald:\n\nThe most outstanding garden this season was at the Anglican Residential School in charge of the Reverend H.S. Shepherd. A small greenhouse constructed of storm sash and heated with a wood burning heater was used to start cabbage, cauliflower, tomato and some of the more tender varieties of flowering plants. These were all seeded during the last week of May and transplanting to the open garden was done one month later. After the cabbage, cauliflower and flowers were removed, the tomato plants were reset in the greenhouse, spaced three feet apart and allowed to remain for the season, these were producing ripe fruits by end of August and a heavy crop of large green fruits were picked September 12, when all were harvested. Transplanting of cabbage and cauliflower was quite successful and seasonal development fair, cabbage 6-7 inches and cauliflower 5-6 inches in diameter were quite common. Carrots and turnips were large and of excellent quality. The crop of Warba potatoes was exceptional, as to size, quality and yield, being quite equal to any I had seen on the trip down stream. The annual flowers also did quite well and bloomed profusely.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Albert Lawrence,\nSuperintendent.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nBRANCH INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nDATE Feb. 22nd., 1944.\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Receiver General of Canada | 200.00 |\n\nSTATE BELOW WITH DETAILS IN EVERY CASE, WHETHER (a) STANDING ADVANCE, (b) ADVANCE FOR SPECIFIC JOURNEY\u2014ESTIMATING NUMBER OF DAYS, (c) OTHER ACCOUNTABLE ADVANCE OR (d) AUTHORIZED PAYMENT.\n\nRemittance from the Missionary Society of Church of England re Jimmy Nahkooyuk son of Angalilik, Aklavik, N.W.T.\n\nVOTE T.F.

Mr. Mackenzie by Miss Eden Corlett (or Corbett?), for the past two years Senior Teacher at the All Saints Residential School at Aklavik now resigned, due to bereavement and financial conditions.\n\nI note from our files that this School is the property of the Missionary Society of the Church of England, and that it was established (under Order in Council) as a Boarding School, as and from the 26th of August, 1936, to be known as \"The Aklavik Church of England Indian School\", and to provide educational facilities for the Indian, Eskimo and white children in the vicinity of Aklavik.\n\nIn the letter you will note Miss Corlett cites what are most appalling conditions existing at this School as regards the all-important matter of HEALTH. Secondly, the subject of FOOD, which would seem to be inadequate. Thirdly, FIRE PROTECTION, which, at best, would seem to be most inadequate. She also states there is no PRACTICAL TRAINING at the School.\n\nI quote from Miss Corlett's letter: \"I am not asking you to accept these facts without verification but I appeal to you, for the sake of these children, to request that your government representative, Dr. D.L.

Ralph T. Gibson be appointed Principal of the Aklavik School.\n\nMr. Gibson was born at Bradwardine, Manitoba in 1908. He lived for some years in the Residential School at Chapleau where his father was Principal. He later acted as Cadet Instructor and also Farm Instructor both at the School at Chapleau and the Mackay School at The Pas. He holds a Second Class Teacher's Certificate. He has also taken special teacher's course in Agriculture. He has taught school for 4\u00bd years. His Theological studies were taken at Wycliffe College, Toronto, of which he is a graduate. He has now just completed four years Mission work at Churchill, Manitoba, where his duties have included teaching in the Day School.\n\nFrom all that we know of Mr. Gibson we believe that he would be a suitable man as Principal of the school at Aklavik and therefore request that he be so appointed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nLAD K.\nOttawa,\nMay 6, 1944.\n\nDr. J.P.

Mines & Resources.\n\nHAROLD W MCGILL\nAklavik, N.W.T.,\n22nd May, 1944.\n\nHarold W. McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI have your letter of April 4th, and have read Miss Corlett's report on the conditions in All Saints' Residential School. I give you herewith the following report:\n\nSanitary conditions and health of the pupils.\n\nProbably the most undesirable factor in conditions began with the construction of the building itself. This building (2 storey) is constructed with class rooms, dining room, laundry and kitchen on the first floor and sleeping dormitories for both children and staff on the second floor. Due to an improper circulation of air and no doubt improper insulation in the roof, and especially due to the laundry being with the building, large amounts of moisture condensed underneath the roof. This freezes during the winter, keeps the place damp and cold and in the spring the melting of enormous quantities of ice keeps the place in a damp condition for a large period of time. I think that one of the first essentials would be the remodelling of this building to such an extent that this moisture would be eliminated. This would mean substantial changes in the construction of the roof of the building and also the removal of the laundry outside the building altogether.\n\nWith reference to the statements of Miss Corlett regarding other sanitary conditions such as drinking water, washing facilities and toilets, these, as they are, or as she states they are, are no doubt due\n\nmore......\nmore to carelessness in supervision than in equipment. I am sure that their equipment includes ample washbowls, soap, towels etc. They are supposedly supplied with toothbrushes and were using salt and water for cleaning their teeth. Following these complaints however, I supplied them, from our medical stores here, sufficient sodium perborate and soda bicarb. to be used as a tooth cleansing powder.\n\nThe adequacy of the food provided for the pupils enrolled and the members of the teaching staff.\n\nMy position in looking after the health of children in two schools of different denominations is such that any criticism I make of one school is no doubt used as propaganda by the other school for the procuring of children in the school. The food no doubt has been inadequate and I informed Bishop Fleming that the natives themselves all claim that the children are better fed in the Roman Catholic School than in the Anglican school, and of course to these primitive people food is taken more into consideration than schooling, sanitary conditions or anything else. However, the amount of fresh vegetables and especially fresh fruits is not nearly adequate for the number of children and staff that they have. I am sure that I personally in my own house have at least as much fresh fruit shipped in as they use in the school for about ninety children and a staff of about ten.\n\nThe amount of milk supplied is not sufficient and apparently has not been mixed to a proper strength. Very little cheese and no butter are supplied. These four essentials, fruit, milk, cheese and butter, I think are very important and should be increased.\n\nAt the present time I am developing a dairy farm here which was started with the intention of supplying at least a pint of milk per day to each child in both schools. Staff diets are also inadequate and this is an important factor where the staff with a large percentage of girls are brought in from outside and I frequently have had to treat them for neurosis no doubt due to environment and diet.\n\nThe adequacy of the fire protection and fire fighting equipment proved at the institution.\n\nThe escape shoots in the school along with proper fire drill I think is sufficient at the present time and....\nand if these are not functioning properly it is again due to carelessness on the part of the staff. Outside of the school we have a fire engine and hose properly manned sufficient to handle fires in school areas. However, like many buildings constructed in the north the chimneys are of inferior build and not properly insulated. This should be very essential where they are burning as fuel spruce wood, which is full of creosote and causes many chimney fires unless pipes are cleaned very frequently.\n\nThe health of the children at the present time, and for the past several years, has been fairly good. With the exception of the two influenza epidemics this winter sickness in both schools has been small. The first year that I spent here I had a large number of deaths of school children which I attribute to a large extent to infective tonsils which undermined their general health and also was a source of continuous infection among the pupils. Since that time I have removed the tonsils of most of the children on admission or shortly afterwards and the improvement through the years has been quite marked, especially so in the lowered death rate of school children during this period.\n\nDuring the past year, due to a shortage of labour, I have used two school boys to help with the routine work around my residence and farm. These boys have been staying at the school but get the majority of their meals in my house here. One of them, a boy of fourteen years of age, had a T.B. hip and had been in hospital and school for several years. The other one in hospital most of the time with very bad eyesight. These boys were put on what I considered a suitable diet of fresh meat, cows milk, cheese, butter and fresh fruit etc., and the improvement has been so marked that there is no doubt that diet to a large extent is responsible for the health of residential school children. The boy with the T.B. hip has grown and improved in all ways. The other boy, although practically unable to see, is now perfectly alright and has also grown greatly in stature during the past six months.\n\nI might state, however, that in my medical care of the Anglican school much of my work is the care of the female staff. A great deal of the trouble is due to neurosis......\nneurosis, caused no doubt to environment and diet and I would suggest that the period of four years be cut down. I think two years here is long enough for any girl.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.D. Livingstone, M.D.C.M.,\nMedical Health Officer.\nOttawa, June 21, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Livingstone:\n\nI desire to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of your report on the Aklavik Residential School, dated May 22, 1944. It is unnecessary to state that the information sent forward by you, on conditions at the school, is very much appreciated.\n\nI note that you did not return Miss Corlett's letter. Inasmuch as this is an official letter, addressed to the Minister of Pensions and National Health, it will be necessary to secure its return, so that it can be placed on file. Owing to the limited staff at our disposal in this critical period, no copy of the letter was made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nL. D. Livingstone, Esq., M.D.,\nAklavik, N.W.T.\nThe Honourable Ian A. MacKenzie,\nDepartment of Pensions and National Health,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to call your attention to three factors concerning the welfare of the Eskimo and Indian children in this, the All Saints' Residential School, Aklavik.\n\nTwo years ago I was appointed senior teacher here. Prior to that, I was on the staffs of two large towns in Alberta, and have done substitute teaching in the city of Edmonton. I have been accustomed to working among the highest of standards.\n\nFrom the beginning I was appalled at the health conditions here, and set about to exercise an influence, by making the subject of health, a prominent topic in the classroom. Persistently as I endeavored, progress was stunted outside, as those in charge of the children, did not seem to consider hygienic conditions, as part of their welfare. This condition has persistently existed, in spite of my efforts to get cooperation with the Matron and Principal, both of whom agreed but whisked the affair into the background, by only a short, temporary readjustment.\n\nI will enumerate the conditions, as I have witnessed, totally unexaggerated, most of which can be observed today.\n\n1. The drinking pail, is a container rimmed in dirt and lying anywhere on the playroom floor. If a cup is handy, also found on the floor, it is used, otherwise the jug or pail is lifted to the individual mouth, for a draught.\n\n2. Containers were always provided in the dormitories for excretion purposes. These were mostly left uncovered and the air became foul, the children breathing it while sleeping. This has been eradicated.\n\n3. The toilets are smelly, with insufficient disinfectant for cleaning and no toilet paper\u2014no paper of any kind\u2014is ever...\nprovided. At Christmas I saw the children tearing up their paint books in an effort to be clean.\n\n4. Wash bowls, soap and towels have completely disappeared in the playrooms. In other words the children are only able to wash in the morning and at night in their dormitories. Washing before meals or the classroom work begins is not observed. If, while I'm supervising the dish washing, in the dining room, a child asks to leave the room, I cannot ask him to wash his hands before returning, for there is no equipment.\n\n5. Toothbrushes, which were given out at the beginning of the year, have completely vanished. Never has any dentifrice been given to the children. No wonder there are large dentists' bills, when no attempt is made to preserve the teeth.\n\n6. Handkerchiefs are never provided but \"nose rags\" instead, which under the circumstances maybe considered more sanitary, but there are too few of them.\n\n7. Sleep is a problem which depends on whose on duty, whether the children get to sleep at 8:30 or 10 p.m.\n\n8. Clothes might well be described as floor mats.\n\n9. Destruction of property due to non supervision.\n\nThese points succinctly cover the health problem. Now for the second factor\u2014food. I am enclosing a menu\u2014the exact contents of which I ate myself for one whole week last August\u2014to ascertain, whether or not it was sufficient, and I can truthfully say I was hungry. The menu has been slightly changed since, milk now being given on the porridge and an extra small bowl of soup given at night. Of the one hundred dollars ($100) allowed by the government, for each child, in this school only twenty dollars and fifty two cents ($20.52) is spent on food per year, as compared to the one hundred sixty two dollars and nineteen cents ($162.19) for each staff member. That's a fact that can be proved. I studied all invoices and checked off the foods allotted to the children. This diet has been in force, since the school was established.\n\nThe most poignant problem concerning the food is that the next year's supplies have already been ordered and unless the Commission are immediately authorized to increase the diet, to a worthy standard, these children will be undernourished for another year to come. Surely the evidence is conclusive evidence of deficiency.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 919-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIs the administration of this school, bettering the welfare of these races with hygienic and food conditions, as I have described? These people are subject to tuberculosis and the diet, given here and health conditions observed, foster it. The essential products of milk, butter, eggs and cheese are denied these children.\n\nI have no desire to turn these people into an adaptation of white man's living, but when much of their former food is being lost by the influx of population and their food habits being changed, the opportunity to teach them proper living conditions including food and hygiene should be administered from the school. There's where we fail.\n\nThe third factor concerns fire. The Commission have now become exceedingly nervous concerning the question, due to the recent losses among their school, yet they have never taken the trouble to install a proper fire alarm here. They evaded the issue by suggesting that a temporary alarm be constructed. Well its temporary alright, completely disabled now and has been for months and even when in operation couldn't be heard in all parts of the building, as cited by the experience of one staff member, who having worked nonchalantly on in her room, afterwards learned there had been a fire drill. That is just an example of how much the Commission consider of the welfare of these children.\n\nThe unprotected laundry stove pipe goes straight up through a dormitory, with a bed not three feet away. When the children fled out of there one night recently, they had to pound on a locked door to waken a staff member. Firedrill here is as rare as a sandstorm and we have only one bell to ring, the dinner bell.\n\nI am not asking you to accept these facts without verification but I appeal to you, for the sake of these children, to request that your government representative Dr. D.H. Livingston, resident here, be authorized to enter this building and ascertain these facts.\n\nEveryone of these facts I disclosed to the Commission last August after repeated failure to get little cooperation here, but they have taken an attitude of complacency and apathy. Other workers were asked to ascertain the food and hygienic problems last November but their resumes could only have been cursory, without any understanding of true values and since then, the Commission have refused to believe such conditions exist. If they were condemned they would blame the shortage of\ndependence on native help, to which my reply is \"an added atrocity\", such conditions of everyday common health habits and nutrition have nothing to do with a depleted staff. I can only say I wouldn't bother crusading, if there was not a just cause.\n\nAs senior teacher, I feel that the position is one, which exercises probably the greatest influence on the future lives of these children and ultimately the race, but I have certainly been unable to forward the health problems.\n\nOne hears constant criticism, from outsiders, of course, the advisability of residential schools. Definitely it is the only way the children can be educated, but I consider the system, as it is now in force, definitely does not meet the requirements of the native. Where, in a ten month academic period, does a child get any contact with its practical life? How is a child, after a four to ten year period in a school, supposed to adapt itself to the environment of its parents, when the language, habits and arts have been severed, for such a length of time? The child is an alien and the situation is pitiful. Is that practical Christianity?\n\nA strong indictment you say, against my own church. Definitely yes, for I fail to see how segregation from all family bonds, where language habits, customs and arts are not fostered can be called a practicing Christianity. It is contrary to the ideals of Christ's teaching.\n\nInstead the children might well be given a seven month's intensive course, academic and practical, outlined definitely to adjust itself to their mode of living and then for the remaining five months be allowed to rejoin their parents, especially for the ratting season. During this period the school staff could go out among the people, as social service workers. This, of course would require special training, but its about time the Commission were made to realize, that non trained workers, are a menace rather than a help.\n\nIn this school there is no practical training. What the girls learn in the laundry and kitchen is incidental, there is no formal teaching. The opportunities being lost in this one school alone are heart rending.\n\nThis school and its two former foundations, Hay River and Shingle Point have been in operation for fifteen years. That seems a long period\nof time, yet never has any attempt been made to further educate these children. I have taught a number of races, European and white and I know, that these children are as brilliant, as any I've ever encountered. Given a chance they could become doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers, ministers, artists or enter any trade or profession they chose and show remarkable aptitude, returning to their own field to replace the white man. One Eskimo in my classroom now, could with little training become a leading artist, of whom any country might be justly proud.\n\nIs there no one anywhere in Canada, interested in fostering these latent talents and smothered possibilities? We have two great native races in this country but so much of their art and potentialities are being lost because of men who take only a cursory glance and administer from far off fields.\n\nExcept in length, there is no difference in the Edmonton climate and here. What a thriving city to begin an academic centre for the born leaders of two races. Why doesn't someone take a tangible interest in furthering the welfare of races, of which Canada should be justly proud?\n\nIf I have sent this letter to the wrong department, would you kindly forward it, without delay, to whichever party handles this administration. Only immediate action can be of any benefit.\n\nDue to bereavement and financial conditions, I have been forced to resign and resume a former position but I am grieved to think I must leave these children, in the same condition I found them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Miss) Eden Corlett.\nMenus\n\nBreakfast\n\nMonday\nBowl of porridge (no milk)\n1 slice of bread with tallow\nCup of cocoa\n\nDinner\nPiece of boiled fish\n1 slice of bread with tallow\nCup of water\n\nSupper\n2 hard boiled eggs\n1\u00bd slices of bread with tallow\nCup of tea\n\nTuesday\nBreakfast\nBowl of porridge\n1 slice of bread with jam\nCup of cocoa\n\nDinner\nPiece of boiled fish and dehydrated potatoes on plate\n1 slice of bread with jam\nCup of water\n\nSupper\nBowl of corn starch pudding\n1\u00bd slices of bread with jam\nCup of tea\n\nWednesday\nBreakfast\nBowl of porridge\n1 slice of bread\n1 cup of cocoa\n\nDinner\nBowl of soup (barley, meat, vegetables)\n1 slice of bread with jam\n1 cup of water\n\nSupper\nBowl of fruit (prunes, apricots and oranges)\n1 slice of bread and jam\n1 pilot biscuit\n1 cup of tea\n\nThursday\nBreakfast\nBowl of cream of wheat\n1\u00bd slices of bread and jam\n1 cup of cocoa\n\nDinner\nPiece of fish and beans on a plate\n1 slice of bread and jam\n1 cup of water\n\nSupper\nBowl of rice\n1\u00bd slices of bread and jam\n1 cup of tea.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 919-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFriday\n\nBreakfast\nBowl of porridge\n1 \u00bd slices of bread with jam\nCup of cocoa\n\nDinner\nBowl of soup (meat and beans)\n1 slice of bread and jam\n1 cup of water.\n\nSupper\nBowl of chocolate pudding\n1 slice of bread and honey\n1 pilot biscuit\n1 cup of tea\n\nSaturday\n\nBreakfast\nBowl of porridge\n1 slice of bread and tallow\n1 cup of cocoa\n\nDinner\nFish and baked potato on plate\n1 slice of bread with tallow\n1 cup of water\n\nSupper\nBowl of fruit\n1 \u00bd slices of bread and honey\n1 cup of tea\n\nN.B.

There are two schools in Aklavik attended by a number of Eskimo as well as Indian children, one operated by the Roman Catholic Church, the other by the Anglican Church. You could obtain detailed information about these schools from Lt. Col. Bernard F. Neary, Supt. of Welfare & Training, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\"\n\nReferring to the above I should appreciate if you would kindly give me some information concerning these two schools, hereunder whether one of or both of these schools are boarding schools, and whether there might be a possibility for employment of a very qualified Danish nursery-school teacher, Miss Birthe Gad, Copenhagen at the school.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 919-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI beg to add that I have on file an application from Miss Birthe Gad together with copies of recommendation letters, from which it appears that she specialises in working with difficult children.\n\nThanking you beforehand for your courtesy in the matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 919-1, part 1)\nOttawa, September 3, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI enclose copy of a self-explanatory letter received from the Royal Danish Consulate General.\n\nRealizing the difficulties you are under in getting teachers, I am passing the letter for your consideration.

There are two Residential Schools at Aklavik, N.W.T., in which both Indian and Eskimo children receive their education. The Aklavik Roman Catholic School has an attendance of approximately 40 children and the Church of England School has an attendance of approximately 50 children.\n\nPresuming that Miss Gaud is a Protestant, I have sent a copy of your letter to the Reverend H.A. Alderwood, D.D., Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, Missionary Society, Church of England in Canada, with offices in Winnipeg. I have asked him to write directly to you so that he can get further details as to Miss Gaud's qualifications. If Miss Gaud is Roman Catholic, then I can refer the matter to the Reverend Father J. O.

She holds a First Class Superior teacher's certificate for Saskatchewan, and has ten years of experience. She teaches forty residential pupils and sixteen day pupils, the classification being as follows:\n\n| Grades | Boys | Girls |\n|--------|------|-------|\n|        | Ind. | Eskimo | H.B. | White | Ind. | Eskimo | H.B. | White |\n| 1      | 4    | 8      | 5    | 2      | 9    | 7      |\n| 2      | 6    | 2      | 1    | 4      | 6    | 1      |\n|        | 10   | 10     | 5    | 1      | 6    | 15     | 8    | 1      |\n\nMiss Harrington is a very capable teacher. The atmosphere and tone of her classroom is excellent, the pictures and decorations about the room are educational, and the children are most interested in their work. Miss Harrington makes good use of the enterprise method of instruction, and has the children working on a number of projects. She has taken some special training in woodworking, and I was able to examine a fine display of items made by the pupils, including book ends, door stops, coat hangers, tooth brush holders and so forth. This type of activity appeals particularly to the children because they have a natural bent for hand work.\n\nI examined the work books and found them to be kept in good order. The writing was of excellent quality and the work was neatly done. The children took great enjoyment from singing, and I listened to their rhythm band.\n\nMiss Harrington has secured a set of the new basic readers which are authorized for seven of the nine provinces of Canada. Their worth is indicated by the fact that she has been able to teach such a large class of children to read efficiently. I am of the opinion that these basic readers should be used in all the schools.\nMiss Marjorie Neales - teaches grades two to eight, and holds a First Class Superior teacher's certificate from New Brunswick. She has been teaching for nineteen years, fourteen of which have been spent with Indian children. The classification of her pupils is as follows:\n\n| Grades | Boys | Girls |\n|--------|------|-------|\n|        | Indian Eskimo | Indian Eskimo H.B. |\n| 2      | 3    | 6     |\n| 3      | 4    | 7     |\n| 4      | 1    | 4     |\n| 5      | 3    | 1     |\n| 6      | 1    | 3     |\n| 7      | 1    | 1     |\n| 8      | 1    | 2     |\n\nThe discipline in her classroom is good, and she has been quite successful in adapting the Alberta school curriculum to the Northwest Territories.\n\nMiss Neales maintains the interest and enthusiasm of her pupils. She employs the enterprise or project method of teaching, and I noticed about her classroom various projects dealing with such topics as the history of clothing, the story of transportation, and so forth. Her pupils read well and were proficient with their mathematics.\n\nBoth these teachers are of the opinion that the Dominion Government should assign to the school a definite trapping area in order that the children may be encouraged to participate in this activity.\nThe teachers pointed out that contrary to the viewpoint held by some residents of the Territories, children who graduate after their 15th birthday will become good trappers. A boy named David Kuliktans left school after his fifteenth birthday and succeeded in catching sixty-five white foxes during his first season of trapping. Miss Harrington states that the best hunters and trappers are former school pupils.\n\nThe staff also pointed out that because of the closed season on moose there will be no moose hides available this year. Therefore the schools are anxious that the Government provide them with moose hides in order to encourage leathercraft. It may be noted that the leathercraft industry appears to be dying out, and that the schools could play a large part in its revival. An arrangement might be worked out whereby the Government would be recompensed for the cost of the hides as the various leathercraft articles were completed and sold.\n\nThe school has recently purchased a sound film projector. Atmospheric conditions here are not suitable to radio reception. The children receive annual medical examinations and are X-rayed for T.B. They also receive dental treatments.\n\nJ. W.

Miss Harrington divides her class into various groups depending upon their abilities, and in this manner given them an incentive to progress at their own level. Her pupils read well, express themselves freely, and have mastered a considerable amount of number work.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints Anglican School for the Quarter ended January 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: H.

Sharp\n\nDated July 23, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: H.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1943.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated April 1st 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis 1st April 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA-403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints, Akimiski, N.W.T., School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1944.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDated April 2nd, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDated at Akimiski, N.W.T.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINTS AKLAVIK N.W.T School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31ST 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 5th 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Aklavik N.W.T.\n\nthis 8th day of January 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints, Aklavik, N.W.T., School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 5th, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Aklavik, N.W.T., this 8th day of January 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI declare Ccverly that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINTS, AKLAVIK, N.W.T., School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31ST, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: APRIL 2nd, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor the Indian Agent\n\nDated at: Aklavik, N.W.T.\n\nthis 4th April, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints Aklevik School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1945.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: November 7th 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nFor the Indian Agent\n\nDated at Aklevik, N.W.T., this 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SANTIS, AKLAVIK, N.W.T., School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30TH, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: NOVEMBER 7, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at AKLAVIK, N.W.T., this 10th day of November, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINTS AKAIVIK N.W.T.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints' Aklavlk School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nfor the Indian Agent\n\nDated at Aklavlk, N.W.T., this April 3, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal R.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINTS' RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginate it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Gibson\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Anoint Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 2, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Aklanik, N.W.T.\n\nthis July 3, 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints' Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated July 2, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at Akimiski, N.W.T., this July 3, 1947.\n\nNOTE:\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints' Aklavik School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: R.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINTS' AKLAVIK School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 31 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Norman, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINTS' ACHAVIK School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: OCTOBER 2nd, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: Fort Severn, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Salers School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: October 2, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Thomas, N.W.T., this December 27th, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the A.T.E.

CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 2nd 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Norman, N.W.T.\n\nApril 1st 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, can payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints' School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 3, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is arrived at by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, therefore, will provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of pupils during the quarter, and is arrived at by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINTS' RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 7, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated July 15, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints' School for the Quarter ended April 30th, 1957.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: March 31st, 1957\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated: April 20th, 1957\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints' Akwir School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1951.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated July 2, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Fort Norman, N.W.T., this July 12, 1951.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Fort Norman Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the All Saints' Residential School at Aklavik on N.W.T.

file 919-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints' School for the Quarter ended... July 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. H.T. Gibson\n\nDated: July 30th 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Fort Norman, N.W.T.\n\nthis...

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 1932.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: September 30, 1932.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at this October 15, 1932.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints' Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: September 30, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints' School for the Quarter ended Sept. 28, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 2, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 20, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Boys**\n\n**Report of the All-Saints' Residential School at Aklavik**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended September 30, 1952**\n\n| Register Number | Names of Pupils       | Age | Boy | Girl | Band or Reserve | Class or Study | Standing in Class | Trade or Other Industry | Date of Entry into School | Attendance |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 21              | Samuel Smith          | 16  | x   |      | Loucheux#7      |               |                   |                         |                           | 36-7-1     | 62         |\n| 38              | George Kumunizzi       | 14  | x   |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                           | 41-9-8     | 92         |\n| 43              | Ephraim Bonnetplume    | 14  | x   |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                           | 43-2-20    | 92         |\n| 52              | John Ed.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints' Akland School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 1, 1953\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nthis ........................................... 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE | DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 38              | George Kunnizzi          | 14  | X   |      | Lousheux#7     |                   |                        | 92/60      |                                                  |                                             |\n| 43              | Ephraim Bonnetplume (Kendi) | 14 | X   |      |                |                   |                        | 92/57.5    |                                                  |                                             |\n| 52              | John Ed.

Doucet - Training Division)\n\nReference is made to your 141-1-4 of the 20th ultimo, in which you list some items of hardware to be purchased in Calgary and shipped to All Saints' Indian and Eskimo Residential School, Aklavik, N.W.T.\n\nI regret to say that I was not able to purchase the complete order at any of the wholesale and retail houses here. Further, on April 23rd I wrote to Marshall-Wells Wholesale Hardware at Edmonton, asking them to do their utmost to fill the order, and to pick up the plywood from a lumber dealer, adding the cost of same to their invoice. I now have a reply from Marshall-Wells, Edmonton, in which they state that they were unable to supply coping saw frames and blades and so could not complete the shipment.\n\nJudging from the list of items, it would appear to be useless to make the shipment without the coping saw frames and blades, unless, of course, the School has some of these items on hand. Do you advise me to have Marshall-Wells ship the rest of the order, keeping the frames and blades on back-order for shipment at a later date?\n\nI shall await your further instructions before taking any action in this regard.\n\nG.H.

Driscoll,\nSuperintendent of Stationery,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nThe Supervisor,\nWelfare and Training Service,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour First Indian School Bulletin has just reached us. It is a very real indication that the education of the Indians of our country are being considered to a greater degree than ever before. We who have tried to do our best for them are very grateful for the renewed interest from Headquarters.\n\nYou may be assured that we at Aklavik will do our best to follow the instructions of the Bulletin and look forward to the following ones with interest.\n\nWhen Mr. J. MacKinnon was here we discussed the text book question and he gave us several recommendations. I had previous to his coming been teaching for some months in the classroom during a vacancy in our teaching staff. There was a dearth of texts of modern trend and what were here were so lacking in unity that I began using the Alberta Course of study. We have so far gathered numerous books for this course and are working more closely with that Department.\n\nOur present pupilage is mainly Eskimo 60-40. Can you inform me of certain things that I have been concerned with.\n\nIn the past I have always followed my predecessors example and obtained all school supplies from the Indian Affairs Branch. Do we continue this and use the outline of texts in the Bulletin for the whole school. It would be confusion not to.\n\nSome of the texts do not seem to be the same as recommended by the Inspector. We have had no word from him since his visit so do not know the outcome of his survey.\n\nYou see we are in quandary being responsible to two Branches of the same Department with no definite precedent to go by.\n\nHoping you can clear this up for me,\n\nI remain yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDecember 9, 1946\nOttawa, 30 December 1946.\n\nRev.

If you can, will you please send me the cheque for transmission to Rev. R. T.

R. T. Gibson, Principal of our School at Aklavik, N.W.T., which reads as follows:\n\n\"During the winter months just past, we have received and stored in our warehouse at Waterways pending shipment during the 1949 navigation season, certain freight consigned to yourself at Aklavik. We now wish to remind you that this freight is stored at owner's risk of damage by fire, flood and frost.\"\n\nAs we had specifically instructed our suppliers that their shipments to our school at Aklavik must not reach Waterways, Alberta, before 6th May, 1949, we wired Northern Transportation Company for the names of the firms whose shipments addressed to Rev. Mr. Gibson, Aklavik, had already reached Waterways and today we received the following reply:\n\n\"We wish to acknowledge receipt of your wired request for further information on shipments at present stored in our Waterways warehouse for furtherance to the Rev. R. T. Gibson, Aklavik.\n\nOn checking through our records, we find we have the following on hand:\n\n1 carton School Text Books, 60 lbs., ex Ginn Co., Toronto\n1 carton School Supplies, 19 lbs., ex Moyer School Supplies, Edmonton\n2 cartons Books, 127 lbs., ex School Board, Edmonton\n2 parcels Sports Wear, 5 lbs., ex Sport Shop, Ottawa.\"\nNo orders for the above were placed by this office and it would appear from the nature of the supplies listed that these orders were placed by, or on behalf of, your Branch.

This is expensive as the parcel to Aklavik weighs 19 lbs. @ $1.21 per lb. and the Arctic Red River parcel weighs 38 lbs. @ $1.13 per lb.\n\nIn this connection perhaps we should advise that normally any shipments for the North country i.e. North of Waterways, should be in Edmonton, ready to ship, not later than the end of July at the outside in order to catch rail and boat facilities.\n\nWe will hold these two parcels pending your instructions re their disposal please.\n\nH.

Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe wish to express our thanks to your Branch for its attempt to supply us with fire protection and pressure system equipment. As you will know, through the Indian Superintendent, at Norman, the Fairbanks-Morse invoiced some items which did not arrive. We have been able to borrow a pressure tank from the R.C.O.S. and are trying to get the pressure system set up.\n\nThe Bulletin requested that we inform on any shortages in School Supplies. This has been the worst year for shortages that I have experienced. There is no need nor wisdom in trying to fill any shortages at this date due to high express rates by air but I would like you to know the following.\n\nInvoice Dept., of Pub.P.& S. Requisition #59 335612304\n\n4153 Multiscript Paper 3 pkgs invoiced one received.\n(We may not be able to issue a school paper)\nOn my requisition I ordered filing folders. They were requisitioned by you but not supplied. I hope they will be forthcoming next year as my files are getting dog-eared with up to seven years use.\nNo exercise books came though my copy of the requisition shows some C Books ordered.\nI asked for a Giant Stride Merry-go-round fitting.\nWe are very short on playground equipment. We purchased one ourselves for the girls and had hoped that the Dept. would supply one for the boys playground.\n\nI am very pleased with the standard requisition form and the supplies received in the line of texts. I thank you and your Branch for its up to date attitude in this line. However we received no library books this year. The spring I was out on holiday this requisition was missed and I was reprimanded by your office for overlooking the spring requisition and ordering in December. The shoe is on the other foot. Somewhere between requisitioning and receiving there has been a slip up or loss. I think the library requisition should be traced. Shipment may have been made and lost.\nSince we no longer receive shipping bills in advance we do not know what to expect.\n\nIn connection with the library requisition. We were entitled to a set of the Book of Knowledge last year and I ordered it. I hope there will be permission granted this year for it to be sent to us.\n\nAs I said before I am not asking for any mail shipment of shortages or omissions as the cost is excessive. We can manage though possibly with fewer good results and less ease.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.G. Gibson.\n\nA copy of your letter to the Indian School Administration (Canon Cook) regarding a typewriter with wide margins has reached me. Thank you! It will be a real help in the office work.\n\nR.G.\nMr. P. N. Phelan,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Typewriter for Aklavik\n\nYour File: 919-4(36)\n\nYour action in promising to supply a typewriter for the Anglican Residential School at Aklavik is greatly appreciated. It is understood that because of transportation difficulties at this season the machine will not be forthcoming until summer navigation opens on the Mackenzie.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHGC/PAL\nSuperintendent.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Long-carriage Typewriter for Aklavik.\nYour File: 919-4 (E6).\n\nIn your 919-4 (E6) of 28th September, 1951, you advised us that you proposed to send a long carriage typewriter to All Saints' Anglican Indian School, Aklavik, N.W.T., this year.\n\nWe have been informed by the Northern Transportation Company that articles for despatch to Aklavik on the first boat of the 1952 navigation season should reach Waterways, Alberta, between 6th and 24th May, 1952. We are passing this information on to you with the request that the typewriter be shipped in time to go forward to Aklavik on the first boat so that it may be taken into use by the Principal as early as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook, Superintendent.\nFebruary 28, 1952.\n\nGeneral G.R. Turner,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank St.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 21st, please be advised that we are requesting the Department of Public Printing and Stationery to forward a long carriage typewriter to the Aklavik Indian Residential School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr. P. Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are herewith submitting our School Requisitions.\n\nThe Indian School Bulletin stated that our requisitions should be in at the beginning of the year. Also that the proper forms would be sent. We have not yet received our copies of these forms. This means that our requisition could not possibly arrive in Ottawa until some time in February unless I used old forms at hand. This I have done. I hope they will be satisfactory.\n\nI have again included on Form I.A.413 the items omitted last year of which I wrote you Oct. 29, 1951.\n\nThe Forms enclosed are as follows:\n\n| Requisition for | Standard Text Books | Copies - two |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------|\n| 2.              | Standard School Supplies - Stationery | two |\n| 3.              | Text Books Required by Provincial C.of S. | one |\n| 4.              | Supplementary to Std.Textm | one |\n| 5.              | Supplementary to Std.School Supplies | one |\n| 6.              | Requisition for School Material | three |\n\nWhere I had the copies at hand I used the number required.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 919-4, part 1)\n### STANDARD SCHOOL SUPPLIES - STATIONERY\n\n(Two copies required in Ottawa)\n\n| Item | Quantity | Description |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| 3219 boxes Chalk, white | 4 | 4001 Blotters, 4 x 9, (25 per pkt.) |\n| 3220 \" Chalk, asst. colours | 4 | 4002 Blotters, Desk, 18 x 24, Green (Teachers only) |\n| 3226 Blackboard brushes | 4 | 1879 Rulers, 12\" plain |\n| 4332 4406 Pencils (1917 H.B.) | 4 | 4030 boxes Paper clips (med.) |\n| 400 4213 Pencils (Primary 308) | 4 | 4341 boxes Thumb tacks |\n| 4214 Pencils (Checking Blue # 76) | 4 | 1875 pks.

Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe forms for the requisition of Library Books has reached us only a few hours before the last plane before the break-up of winter transportation. This means that through ordinary channels this requisition could not reach you until well on to the end of June.\n\nBecause of the total absence of library books as requisitioned last spring I am taking the liberty of getting this year's requisition in to you now.\n\nThis means it by-passes the Indian Superintendent Mr. Hunter of Norman Wells. However I am sending him a copy of the requisition and a copy of this letter.\n\nI hope you will allow this breach of regulations because of our unfortunate geographical position.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 919-4, part 1)\nApril 30, 1952.\n\nMr. E.N. Grantham,\nNorthern Administration\nand Lands Branch,\nDept. of Resources & Development,\nNorlite Building,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Grantham:\n\nWith reference to the attached requisition for library books received from Reverend R.T. Gibson, Principal of the Aklavik C.E. Indian Residential School you will note that he has asked for approximately one hundred and seven books, however there are but fifty-four Indian pupils at this school. With this in mind we have requested the Department of Public Printing and Stationery to ship fifty-four books to this school. We have deleted the books which we are forwarding to this school.\n\nWe are forwarding this requisition to your office in order to show you what books Reverend Gibson requires and what books we are prepared to supply for the Indian children. It is presumed that you will make arrangements to forward him suitable library books for the Eskimo children in the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 30, 1952.\n\nRev. R.T. Gibson,\nPrincipal,\nAklavik C.E. Indian Res. School,\nAklavik, N.W.T.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your requisition for library books for the Aklavik C.E. Indian Residential School, you are advised that we are asking the Department of Public Printing and Stationery to ship fifty-four books, which is one book for each Indian child.\n\nWe are forwarding a copy of your requisition to the Department of Resources and Development explaining to them what books we are supplying for the Indian children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr. P. Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours of April 30 received informing me that the Indian Affairs Branch is supplying library books for Indian children only.\n\nIs this a change in source of supply or have I been behind time in discovering that your branch does not supply Library Books for our Eskimo children? I have never received any information on source of supply from Ottawa. When I took over the School eight years ago I was given to understand that all classroom supplies came from the Indian Affairs Branch and that costs were shared in proportion to the numbers with the N.W.T. Administration.\n\nWe would appreciate some written instruction on this matter, of Supplies and Library Books, from your office. Being a school housing both Indian and Eskimo children the Bulletin instructions apparently do not always apply to us.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa for a few days early in July. If time permits and it should I will pay a visit to your office hoping that you will not at that time be on your own vacation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMay 22, 1952\nJune 11, 1952.\n\nRev. R.T. Gibson,\nPrincipal,\nAklavik C.E. Indian Res. School,\nAklavik, N.W.T.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 22nd regarding school supplies for the Aklavik C.E. Indian Residential School, you are advised that it has been the Department's practice for many years to provide textbooks and school supplies for the Indian children only and the supplies for the Eskimos and other non-Indian children to be provided by the Northwest Territories Administration.\n\nWe have reviewed our files with regard to former requisitions for school supplies for this school and find that in most instances only sufficient supplies were shipped for Indian children. It is possible that you continued to use these supplies for the Indian and non-Indian children without requesting the Northwest Territories Administration to provide their share of the supplies.\n\nFor your information this practice is followed in all schools where both Indian and non-Indian children are enrolled and in future, it would be appreciated if you would prepare two requisitions - one for the Indian children and one for the non-Indian children and forward the one for the Indian children to Mr. L.C. Hunter, Superintendent Indian Agency, Fort Norman, Northwest Territories and the other to the Northwest Territories Administration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nThe Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nIt is with pleasure that I use this typewriter which was received from the Indian Affairs Branch. It is hard to realize how much effort was expended pounding on the old affair we had here.\n\nFor the second year, Sir, we have received absolutely no library books. You wrote me that you were supplying some of the books and asking the N.W.T. Administration to supply the rest. Though we received a list of the books that the Administration were to ship books came from neither place.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, File 919-4, part 1)\nSept. 20, 1952\n\nRev. R. T. Gibson,\nPrincipal,\nAklavik C. E. Indian Res. School,\nAklavik, N.W.T.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of September 2nd and am pleased to note that you have received the typewriter which the Department provided through the Department of Public Printing and Stationery.\n\nWith reference to the Library Books our record indicate as follows:\n\n(a) Approximately 86 library books were forwarded to this school on August 24, 1951. These books were packed in one carton and were shipped by CNX in care of the Northern Transportation Co. Waterways Alberta.\n\n(b) On August 5, 1952 another carton containing approximately 54 books was shipped to this school. This parcel weighed 25 pounds. Your requisition at that time indicated that there were approximately 54 Indian children, consequently the Library Books of that quantity were ordered.\n\nIt is expected therefore that these books were received and constitute the complement of the Supplementary Books which the Department can allow for this school for the two years.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent Education\nOctober 9, 1952\n\nMr. P. Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nThank you for your letter of Sept. 20 in which you give me information regarding the library books shipped to this school.\n\nIn August 1951 you shipped 86 books. The books were shipped August 24 which is after navigation closes. They should have been lying around Wtareways all winter and come down in the spring. We did not receive them.\n\nThe books shipped August 5th this year would not reach Wtareways in time for the last boat. So it is not surprising that we have not received them. There are no books in evidence here and on checking back on B/L from the boat I find no 25 lb. parcel listed.\n\nThanks all the same for your attempt to get these books to us.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 919-4, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIt is felt that this procedure is necessary in order for you to obtain your allotment of books.

School,\nAklavik, N.W.T.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 9th regarding library books for the Aklavik C.E. Indian Residential School, it would be appreciated if you would contact the Northern Transportation Company at Waterways, Alberta asking them to advise you whether there is a parcel for the Aklavik C.E. School. Should there be such a parcel, please instruct this company to forward this parcel to your school by air express. When this parcel is delivered it will be in order for you to prepay the charges and forward the receipted account to this office for reimbursement.\n\nAs the Aklavik C.E. Residential School was deprived of library books to which it was entitled in 1951, the Department is prepared to consider supplying fifty library books for this school. It is suggested that you prepare a requisition for library books by consulting the library list which is available from the Provincial Department of Education in Edmonton and Victoria. You should forward to this office the list of library books you feel should be provided for your school and suitable for classroom activities together with the name of the publishers or suppliers, where these books can be secured. On receipt of this requisition we will forward it to the Queen's Printer for necessary action instructing them to forward these books to you by air express.\nIt is felt that this procedure is necessary in order for you to obtain your allotment of books. The cost of these books should not exceed $60.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nFort Norman, N.W.T.,\nNovember 12, 1952.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRev.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nFrom my letter to you on the 21st ultimo, you will understand my concern over the financial condition of our Commission in connexion with the administration of our Society's Indian Residential Schools. While your letter of Dec. 30th (marked \"Personal\") gave me some hope of receiving the grant promised for furnishings at our Aklavik School, the grant itself has not yet come to hand, and I greatly hope it may reach me in the early future.\n\nAs it is my duty as Secretary and Executive Officer of the Commission to discover either new sources of revenue, or ways of curtailing expenditures without affecting efficiency of management, I am writing for the specific purpose of ascertaining if the government tax on gasoline used at our Schools could be either cancelled or refunded.\n\nAt the present time the tax on gasoline used at our Schools in the Province of Ontario, except that used for automobiles, is refunded, and it would afford us considerable relief if we received the same consideration from the other Provinces and territories where our Society's Schools are located. For some time the Prairie Provinces granted us exemption from this tax, but the exemption, for some reason...\nor other, was cancelled some years ago, and has never been renewed.\n\nI need hardly say that any help which you and your Department may be able to give in having this exemption restored will be highly appreciated by me and by our Commission, especially in the present time of anxiety and acute concern.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW/KH\nOttawa,\nJanuary 26, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant present regulations require our securing an Order-in-Council when making special payments to Church owned Residential Schools. I expect to secure in the near future the necessary Order-in-Council in connection with the equipment purchased for the Aklavik School. As soon as this is received payment of the grant promised will be made.\n\nI understand that all Provinces in Canada allow a rebate of the gasoline tax when the gasoline is used for other purposes than the operation of automobiles or trucks. I believe each of your Principals can secure this rebate by making application to the Government of the Province in which the Indian Residential School is located.

To get around that difficulty I increased the wages last year, but shortened the time. This year I have needed to do the same thing. We do not need a Night Watchman really for October.

Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\nThe Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMiss Shackleton Replies to Bishop Fleming\n\nTo the Editor of The Tribune,\n\nSir,\u2014I was glad that Bishop Fleming in his letter mentioned the lighting of All Saints school at Aklavit. I only hope that the \"powers\" will be willing to see that plant installed. I note he is reported in The Tribune as saying that \"the school plant is not under our jurisdiction but the government.\"\n\nI knew the hospital and the church were under the auspices of the Diocese of the Arctic, but I was under the impression that the school building was constructed with funds supplied by the M.S.C.C. under the direction of the Inuit and Eskimo Residential school commission and even school teachers and other members of the staff were Inuit and sent to the school by that society. Hence my general reference to missionaries.\n\nI suppose when Bishop Fleming referred to \"tourist\" he meant me. Well, I have never been a tourist, and I was on my job in the North as a hard-working artist, and my criticism I do not consider in the least \"destructive.\"\n\nUnless the whole face of nature changes in the Aklavit district (I did not refer to other parts of Northern Canada) the natives will have to earn their livelihood by trapping, hunting and fishing. To say that one has to begin when very young.\n\nThe present school curriculum as far as I see it gives no training in this direction. \"Chores\" learned on institutional lines are useless to people living in huts, boats and igloos. A great part of the daily routine of the school is such work on the grand scale.\n\nMy constructive suggestions were that small log cabin schools at strategic points, missionary bases, and particularly itinerant medical missionaries would be suitable for this land of water, bush, mud and muskeg.\n\nBishop Fleming spent many successful years travelling and living the simple life among the natives in igloos, etc. Surely he must remember that while they need what can use what the white man can give them, except the Gospel and some tips on hygiene.\n\nAs for the \"white invasion\" it is the native people who have to learn so much when they go \"down north,\" how to live in the face of nature, how to dress and how to make a living. This the native can teach them.\n\nThe Bishop points out that \"we have the young men who have been at our schools in Canada in employment with the Hudson's Bay Company and the government.\"\n\nNatives have always worked for the H.B.C., that I know, and often I worked for the government, not because of white school training, but because of their value as experts in the field.\n\nI still hold that the welfare of human beings, the \"Temples of the Holy Ghost\" is more important than having a big church building. The Gospel can be preached or lived anywhere.\n\nKATHLEEN SHACKLETON,\nWinnipeg, March 1, 1938.\nMoyer School Supplies Limited\nCanada's School Furnishers\n\nSold to: Mr. R. A.

May 3, 1940\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe Principal of our Aklavik School has directed the attention of our Commission to the need of two fire escapes and two electric gongs to be used as alarms in the event of a fire.\n\nAt a meeting of the Commission's Finance Committee held here yesterday, I was instructed to ascertain if your Department could meet the cost of these items of equipment. The Principal suggested that for safety an enclosed slide is the only equipment which would provide a satisfactory emergency exit from the dormitories. One would be required at each end of the building, and it should have an approved entrance door from the building at the top, which door should be constructed so that it could never jamb with any movement of the building.\n\nWe have consulted the Winnipeg Fire Chief and leading firms in Winnipeg who manufacture the canvas slide fire escapes, but not one of them recommended such for any school. As children love toboggan slides, it was suggested at our meeting that wooden chutes might serve the purpose and I will be glad to have your opinion of the same.\n\nAt the present time a steel triangle is used as a fire alarm, and while this is sufficient during the day time, the Principal fears it might not be sufficient to awaken either staff or children when sound asleep at night.\nYou may recall that at the time of my last visit to Ottawa I mentioned to you and the Superintendent General the earnest desire of our Commission to have the Eskimo pupilage at this School increased from 50 to 60 and the Indian pupilage decreased from 50 to 40. It was thought at that time that the administration of the N.W.T. would soon be placed under one department of government and when that action had been taken, our request for the alteration in the pupilage would be granted. As the change has not yet been made (so far as I am aware) our per capita earnings are reduced by approximately $2,000.00 a year below what they would be if the altered pupilage were authorized.\n\nI am furnishing you with this information in order that you may understand our Committee's desire to receive any help you may be able to give in providing the fire escapes and electric gongs.\n\nYou will be pleased to know that the Principal reports \"the results of our drills to date (March 18, 1940) have given us all confidence that in the event of a fire there is already a much greater measure of personal safety for all\".\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW/kh\nOttawa,\nMay 9, 1940.\n\nEX'D.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to fire escapes and electric gongs which you state are required at the Aklavik C.E. Residential School.\n\nIn our appropriation for the current fiscal year it was found possible to include an amount of $550.00 only for repairs and improvements and purchase of new equipment required at the above-mentioned school.\n\nI am prepared to recommend to the Minister the expenditure of this money in whatever manner you consider will be most valuable to the school. If your Society is prepared to install the fire escapes and electric gongs, and I presume they will cost more than the amount provided by the Department, I will, on receipt of advice from you, recommend to the Minister that we allow $550.00 toward their cost.\n\nWith regard to the Eskimo pupilage at this school you should communicate with Mr. A. L. Cummings, Superintendent Mackenzie District and Secretary Yukon Affairs. His office is in Ottawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. T.B.R.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn your letter to me on August 14th of last year, #160-2, you informed me that the sum of $450.00 would be available for \"repairs, improvements and the purchase of new equipment at our Aklavik School during the current fiscal year.\"\n\nCanon Shepherd, the Principal of this School, has urged our Commission to provide it with better laundry equipment, and our Commission desire to know if the $450.00 grant could be applied towards the cost of the same.\n\nFor your information I may say that an order has recently been placed with the J.H. Connor and Son of Ottawa, for a new cylindrical washer for our Moose Factory School at an estimated cost of $545.00, freight included. The freight on the same washing machine to Aklavik would be much heavier, but our Commission might possibly be able to provide their Aklavik School with this help if the grant mentioned above can be used for this purpose.\n\nA prompt reply will oblige.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 16, 1942.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the amount of $450.00 available for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Aklavik C.E. Residential School. I note your suggestion that this amount be granted as part payment for a washer for this school. I am recommending this action to the Minister and, if he approves, I will advise you immediately.\n\nWhile I advised you last August regarding the amounts available in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the schools conducted under the auspices of the M.S.C.C., it was understood, of course, that requests would be forwarded here in order that the articles required could be secured through our Purchasing Branch. We are required to follow the purchasing regulations and it makes it very difficult for us when Principals make purchases and then submit the accounts here for payment. I refer particularly in this regard to the accounts submitted for expenditures made at the Fort George School. Before a cheque can be issued I will have to obtain the Minister's approval. I feel certain that your office and the Principals of your schools will co-operate with us in this particular regard in future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. T.B.R.

January 7, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the matter of payment of the salaries of Night Watchmen at our Society's Indian and Eskimo Residential Schools at Aklavik on the N.W.T. and Fort George in Quebec, an order was given to the respective Principals of these institutions to submit monthly requisitions for the same through the local Indian Agent. In this connection I beg to state that I have just received a letter from the Rev. Canon H.S. Shepherd, Principal of our Aklavik School, in which he points out that it is impossible for him to forward such requisitions at the end of each month because of infrequency of the mails. He also points out that by sending the requisition through the Indian Agent at Fort Norman long delays are inevitable, and reminds me that one of the requisitions he sent through the Indian Agent at Norman did not reach Ottawa until six months after it had been despatched.\n\nOwing to the distant location of our Aklavik and Fort George Schools, and the absence of frequent mails, it has seemed to me that the most satisfactory way of dealing with the question of payment of the Night Watchmen's salaries at these Schools, will be for our Commission to submit quarterly requisitions, and in the hope and expectation that you will agree with this opinion, I am enclosing herewith requisitions in triplicate for the salary of this agent at each of the two schools mentioned, for the quarter ending December 31st last, and will send similar requisitions at the end of March next for the March quarter and the Month of April.\n\nShould there be any further specific information which you may require in connection with these requisitions, I will gladly endeavour to supply it during my visit to Ottawa the beginning of next week.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) T.B.R.

These batteries were \"Type W-11, Capacity 210 A.H., Serial No. 6964\".\n\nHe suggests that batteries with a larger capacity would be an advantage, and gives the following reasons:\n\n\"There is an average drain of 15 amperes from our plant during the six dark months, from 7 a.m. each morning until 8 p.m. in the evening. During a good part of the working hours of the day this drain increases to 20 amperes, and sometimes as high as 30 amperes. Of course we run the engine during most of each day all the winter through. Even so the batteries are worked very hard during all the dark period.\"\n\nIt will be appreciated if steps are taken by your Department to have these batteries forwarded by the first boat going down the Mackenzie River next summer so that ample time may\nbe given the staff to have them installed before the next long period of darkness begins.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW*WS\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 10, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to a new set of batteries required at the Aklavik C.E. Residential School. In our appropriation for the fiscal year 1943-44 we have included an item of $500.00 for purchase of new equipment at this school. I expect that this item will be approved and, if so, this will permit us to purchase the batteries.

In requesting a set of batteries of the capacity mentioned above the Principal gives the following reasons:\n\n\"There is an average drain of 15 amperes from our plant during the six dark months, from 7 a.m. each morning until 8 p.m. in the evening. During a good part of the working hours of the day the drain increases to 20 amperes, and sometimes as high as 30 amperes. Of course we run the engine during most of each day all the winter through. Even so the batteries are worked very hard during all the dark period.\"\n\nFunds to the amount of $500.00 have been provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1943-44 for the purchase of batteries for this school. If the above set costs more than that amount the balance will be provided by the M.S.C.C. which operates this school which is a Church-owned one. The order should be placed as soon as possible, in order that the batteries may reach Waterways in sufficient time to catch the boat for the North.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only. The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\u2014\n\nAPPROVED\u2014\n\n(SEE OTHER SIDE)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 919-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**RECEIPT FORM**\n\nOrder No. 17646\n\nFile No.\n\n---\n\nSupplies mentioned hereunder have been received and found satisfactory with exception of those listed under \"Remarks\".\n\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION | UNIT | TOTAL |\n|----------|-------------|------|-------|\n| 1 coil   | Nickel-iron cell, 50 cells, 120 volts, 10 plates per cell. | | |\n\n$500.00 to be paid by this Department.

E. Moore, Acting Superintendent of Medical Services, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe - Dental Services at Aklavik.\n\nYou will no doubt be interested in the attached report prepared by Dr. H. J. Mullett, covering his dental work at Aklavik this year.\n\nAs you know, the Church of England Mission arranges for a dentist to spend about two months each year at Aklavik and the Northwest Territories Council authorized a grant of $200 per annum for the work this dentist does for the school children of both the Anglican and Roman Catholic residential schools, also natives or indigent whites and half-breeds of the area. This arrangement has worked out very satisfactorily.\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner of the Northwest Territories.\nThe dental clinic at All Saints Hospital, Aklavik, was operated this year from June 5th to August 26th.\n\nAside from the excessive occlusal wear found in most of the mouths of the natives, the usual physiological and pathological conditions were in evidence among the patients visiting the clinic. The more primitive the life of the natives the better their dental condition; those who have had longer contact with so-called civilization, that is with the white man's diet and habits, have more dental caries and soft tissue disease. The work of the clinic is likely to increase with the years.\n\nA number of impressions and models were made of interesting cases showing particular dental conditions. Certain observations may be reported later in dental literature.\n\nThe children of both the Anglican and Roman Catholic Schools were examined and the necessary treatment given, the following figures indicating the amount and type of service rendered.\n\nRoman Catholic School\n\nNumber examined - Boys 21 (13 boys, no treatment needed)\nGirls 22 (12 girls \" \" \" )\n43\n\n16 children came to clinic for treatment.\n\nService rendered - 32 cement fillings\n19 amalgam \"\n3 extractions\n54 operations Fee - $98.00\n\nAnglican School\n\nNumber examined - Boys 24 (12 boys no treatment needed)\nGirls 39 (13 girls \" \" \" )\n33 students came to clinic for treatment\n\nService rendered - 42 cement fillings\n39 amalgam \"\n5 silicate \"\n8 extractions\n1 prophylaxis\n95 operations Fee - $194.00\nThe number of cement fillings may appear to be large but they were practically all in deciduous teeth; the object being to preserve such teeth if possible for another year at least, rather than perform extractions earlier than the time when such teeth should be normally lost. The children were good patients and it was interesting working for them.\n\nThe association with all members of the mission was very happy from my standpoint. I was accepted and treated as one of the family, and I will always have pleasant memories of the three months spent with the Anglican Mission at Aklavik.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(signed) H. J.

Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment Of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe are in serious trouble in regard to our annual supply of vegetables for All Saints' School, Aklavik, and I am writing to ask if the facilities of the Government can be extended to us to meet a real emergency.\n\nIt has been our custom to obtain vegetables from a garden north of Fort Simpson. This year we received a telegram on August 31st advising us that flood conditions had made it impossible to harvest the vegetables in time to travel by the last Hudson's Bay boat. Since then we have been in frequent communication with the grower, also with the Hudson's Bay Company and other transportation people. We had made special arrangements to charter a boat from Norman Wells in order that six tons of potatoes and carrots might have been carried to the school. This plan fell through when the Distributor met with an accident and was unable to reach Norman Wells. We have done everything in our power and now seem to have failed completely, with the result that a most difficult situation has been created at the school. A letter just to hand from Mr. J.W. Goodall of Fort Simpson, who has been doing his best for us, tells of the recent accident which befell the Distributor on Great Slave Lake, in which one barge was lost and another piled up on the shore. He tells us that Government planes have been flying in fresh vegetables, meat and other supplies to various Northern points and suggests that in such an emergency as this we may reasonably expect Government assistance in this way.\n\nI know how difficult it is for one department to secure the cooperation of another in this way but feel that in cases where a genuine emergency arises in which human values are concerned all the resources of the state are brought into action. We are making inquiries about dehydrated vegetables and are faced with sending this material in at a very high cost. We are told that supplies are not yet available and meanwhile the needs of the children in our school will soon be acute. If any of the Government planes now operating on the Mackenzie River could take some of the vegetables now lying at Fort Simpson it would greatly relieve the situation for some time to come.\nCommending this matter to your serious consideration,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A:WS\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, 11th October, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant with reference to moving vegetables and potatoes from Fort Simpson to the Aklavik C.E. Residential School.\n\nI note your suggestion that we endeavour to secure one of the Government planes to transport some of these at least. I have discussed your suggestion with various other officials today and I cannot see any immediate prospect of assisting you.\n\nHowever, our Medical Branch is endeavouring to secure a plane to transport meat from Aklavik to Fort Norman. If we are successful in securing this we will endeavour to have them take a load of vegetables from Fort Simpson to Aklavik. This movement may be delayed for a few weeks as I am informed that very few planes are flying until after freeze-up.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary of the Commission,\nMissionary Society of the Church of England,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOctober 16, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Vegetables for Aklavik. Your ref. 141-1-5\n\nI am grateful for your letter of the 11th and note that the medical branch of the department may be able to give us some assistance if a plane is secured to transport meat from Aklavik to Fort Norman. We are advising Mr. J. W. Goodall of Fort Simpson, who has acted as our agent in this matter and he will be prepared if we are able to give later word that something is possible. I assume that a plane would be travelling from farther South and would be able to pick up the vegetables at the grower's, South of Fort Simpson.\n\nIn the meantime we are endeavoring to secure supplies of dehydrated vegetables for shipment latter on.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Alderwood.\n\nSecretary.\nOctober 24th, 1945\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Robert:\n\nOn October 13th you wrote Mr. B.B.

Haig)\nOttawa\nOctober 31st, 1945\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Bob:\n\nRe: Vegetable supply for Aklavik\n\nI herewith enclose you the letter that I received in this matter. This will probably give you all the information.\n\nI am leaving tomorrow night for Winnipeg but if you will write my office here, my Secretary will forward it to me.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(J.T. Haig)\nOttawa, November 2, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY,\n\nThe letter forwarded by Senator Haig is the same as Dr. Alderwood forwarded to us on June 6, last.\n\nOwing to late harvest and subsequent damage to boats on the Mackenzie River, the vegetables which the M.S.C.C. purchased at Fort Simpson and intended for the Aklavik C.E. Residential School have not yet been forwarded.\n\nWhen Dr. Alderwood's letter of October 6 was received, I consulted the Medical Division and was informed that they were endeavouring to secure a plane to transport reindeer meat from Aklavik to the Fort Norman Hospital. At that time it was agreed between Dr. Moore and myself that if a Transport Plane could be secured the vegetables could be taken from Fort Simpson to Aklavik and the meat brought back from Aklavik to Norman.\n\nI spoke to Dr. Moore again this morning about the matter and he states that it has been impossible to make arrangements for plane service, although he has enlisted the co-operation of Director R. A. Gibson and also made another approach to the R.C.A.F. As the matter stands, no definite arrangements have been made for a plane and it is doubtful when these arrangements can be satisfactorily effected.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, November 2, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

It is unnecessary to add that I shall be glad to discuss this matter with you further any time at your convenience.\n\nI am returning herewith the letter received by Mr. Smith from Doctor Alderwood.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHonourable J. T. Haig,\nWINNIPEG,\nManitoba.\nJanuary 12, 1946.\n\nAttention Mr. Phillip Phelan\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Natural Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nReferring to your letter of August 30th last in which we were notified that the amount of $500 had been allocated to the above school for repairs etc., I now beg to enclose receipted accounts in quadruplicate from the W. H. Clark Lumber Co. Ltd., Edmonton for the amount of $564.95.\n\nI may explain that this lumber has been used for the construction of a new power house and laundry which was found to be necessary. The roof of the school has been giving a great deal of trouble on account of condensation and much damage has been done to the building by reason of water coming down the walls. It was concluded that much of this trouble came from the school laundry and that it would be better to have it removed. We are also endeavoring to reduce fire risk in our schools by having gasoline engines placed in a special building some distance away. The cost of freighting these materials has been exceedingly high and the total bill runs into something very much larger, but we shall be grateful if your allocation can be applied to the present account.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\nOttawa, 17th January, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nReverend Doctor Alderwood of the M.S.C.C. has forwarded the attached receipted account amounting to $564.95 covering cost of lumber purchased for urgent repairs at the Aklavik C.E.

It was necessary to send these to Aklavik for the signature of the Principal and they have just been returned.\n\nPerhaps I should explain that we found it necessary to have a skilled carpenter at Aklavik to attend to two important pieces of work. The school roof was leaking badly and much damage was being done. We were advised that while rough carpentry work could be done by local help there was no-one with the expert knowledge to carry out the scientific roof construction which appeared to be necessary. We also decided to build a joint power-house and laundry building to serve both school and hospital. This took the condensation from the laundry out of the school and also effected economy and efficiency by pooling the mechanical equipment. The school lighting plant had been breaking down and we are now securing new items for the combined work, with former equipment in reserve in case of emergency.\n\nIt was necessary to incur heavy expense in sending the builder in and bringing him out by plane so that he should have as much time as possible to do the work. In view of these facts, I trust that you may be able to give us assistance with the labour cost.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n**RETURN OF LABOUR on the**\n\n**ALASKA INDIAN SCHOOL**\n\n**on AKLAVIK N.W.T.**\n\n**Reserve**\n\n**for week ending**\n\n**DECEMBER 18**\n\n**1945**\n\n| NAMES       | Nature of Employment or Trade | No. of Hours | Mon. | Tues. | Wed. | Thurs. | Fri. | Sat. | TOTAL | PRICE PER | AMOUNT OF WAGES | RECEIVED PAYMENT | WITNESS |\n|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------|------|-------|------|--------|------|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|---------|\n| R.H.

G. R. Turner\n\nMr. P. N. Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nEssential Services, 1948-49\nAll Saints Indian Residential School, Aklavik\n\nAs you have certain amounts in your 1947-48 Departmental Estimates for miscellaneous services at our Church-owned Schools, I presume that you will make similar provision when preparing your estimates for 1948-49.\n\nWe have just received the enclosed from the Principal of our Aklavik School in response to a request for a statement of the services most urgently needed there. I would be glad if, on the basis of this, you would make as generous provision for this School as you can in your 1948-49 estimates.\n\nWill you please advise me, at your convenience, of the amount you propose to provide so that we may give consideration to finding the balance needed for essential services there.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\nDr. H. A. Alderwood,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian School Administration, M.S.C.C.,\nBank Street Chambers,\n102 Bank Street, Ottawa, Ontario,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn accordance with your telegram of Sept. 25 I am enclosing a list of requirements under headings given.\n\nData for cost is hard to get on short notice. There may be a plane in this week end. The list is skeleton in form and I will endeavour to supply more information in the following paragraphs.\n\nNew Building Construction.\nIn spite of the fact that you believe this school to be large in comparison to some we find ourselves very crowded with the addition of a third classroom. The original plans for the school had an additional sketch of a wing out from the back of the boys side to be used as a play room for the boys. The present playroom was intended as a classroom.\n\nNew Heating Water Supply etc.\nFurnace (J.P.H.) This is on order from Winnipeg Paint and Glass but did not come through. You have specifications? I have not.\nThe enlarging of the basement $50 will be for dressed lumber obtained locally for shoring the walls.\nThe jacket heater was also requisitioned, specifying that it must heat water to laundry temperature and have flat surface for boiler. The hot water tank another item on requisition was to accompany the jacket heater. A capacity of at least 60 gals.\nElectric pump (J.P.H.) We have an electric pump in the school.\nThere has been an initial request for a pressure system for the school from before my time. We have not pressed the matter as there were other things more urgent. However for fire protection and convenience this would be desirable. Should a pressure system be installed at the school a transfer of our present pump to the J.P.H. could be arranged; If no pressure system is forthcoming a second pump is needed for the laundry.\nI specify Wesco. The hospital has a Westco pump and there is only one moving part.\n\nGasoline Operated Extractor. We requested this before but were turned down. We know they must be expensive.\nI asked for a wooden tank to replace the one moved to the J.P.H., which left us with a supply used in less time than is convenient to pump in cold weather. We have gone as long as ten days melting ice because we could not pump. If fire occurred at such time we would be helpless.\nMAJOR REPAIRS TO BLDGS.\n\nPainting. I requisitioned paint. Did not even hear if it was ordered.\nThe roofing paper came. The 30 barrels of tar are somewhere between here and Werway. I received shipping bill but no invoice price.\nThe freight alone is $1350.\nThe roofing alone will not cure the frost. The new ceiling material referred to are at Eaton's prices.\nThe fire escapes are far from comfortable and are getting out of repair.\n\nMajor repairs to installations.\nThe wire running from the pow r house to the school is too light.\nThe fire boxes of our furnaces have cracked and are a menace to safety.\nNew boxes or some extensive repair must be done.\nThe battery plate on one set of batteries are beginning to fall apart.\n\nMajor Repairs to heavy equipment.\nWe requisitioned for repairs to the tractor, but nothing came.\nThe front tires for it are shot.\nThe axle was broken before I came. We have to tear it down at least once a year and patch it up with more bracing.\n\nTwo copies of this are being sent to you in case one must go to the Arctic Office.\n\nHoping that what I have given is sufficient.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.G.\n\nIt has been difficult to know where to place the items as much is necessary yet we have been getting along in a sort of way without them. Much criticism come upon me from the staff for not having certain things done on time, no playground equipment made for the children and so on. But the whole thing results from the fact that as we have no labour saving devices we must all work at chores.\n\nR.G.\nOttawa, November 7, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nWe have your letter of October 11th, with reference to the Aklavik C.E. Residential School.\n\nCareful consideration will be given to the contents of Reverend Mr. Gibson's letter when we are preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

F. Dawson, Esq.,\nDist. Res. Architect,\nDept. Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Anglican Residential School - Aklavik, N.W.T.\n\nThe following is a report and valuation of the Anglican Residential School at Aklavik, N.W.T.:\n\nThe building was erected in 1936, the work being carried out by native labour under the direction of a skilled carpenter foreman, sent in from Eastern Canada.\n\nThe building is well constructed and is in a fairly good state of repair.\n\nThe foundations consist of wooden posts sunk 8' 0\" into the ground, capped with beams on which the joists are laid.\n\nThere is really no basement except the space left under the first floor, by the natural fall of the ground. However, passageways have been excavated to give access to the different parts of the basement, which is used for storage purposes. Floors are earth.\n\nThe building is of frame construction and conforms very closely to the details shown on the plans. Framing lumber is spruce, finished lumber and floors, fir.\n\nAs is common with buildings in these parts, which are built on permanent frost, considerable settlement has taken place in the interior of the building, although there has been very little on the outside walls. Two years ago the beams were all jacked up level, packing put on top of the original posts, new posts installed on new mud sills and the building is now level, although some of the beams under the second floor show a slight sag.\n\nThe interior walls and ceilings are covered with tentest, painted, and are in a good state of repair, with the exception of the ceiling to the second floor. When the building was erected, the insulation was placed between the rafters instead of between the ceiling joists, with the result that considerable condensation took place, which melted onto the ceiling. It is intended to replace this ceiling and material is on hand to carry out this work next summer.\nThe floors are of fir and are showing signs of wear, particularly in the dormitories. The corridors and a few of the rooms are covered with inlaid linoleum. Floors should be covered with battleship linoleum before long.\n\nPlumbing: There is no water or sewer system in Akivik. Sanitary chemical closets are used by the staff, and are available for the children in severe weather. Otherwise the children use outside toilets.\n\nWater for washing etc., is obtained from the river, being pumped periodically into the wooden storage tanks in the basement, capacity, 3,000 gals. From these tanks it is passed into galvanized iron tanks on the floor, above from which it is drawn off and carried by hand to the different parts of the building. Drinking water is obtained by melting ice.\n\nHeating: The building is heated with forced circulation, hot air through exposed ducts on the ceilings. There are two furnaces, as shown on plan \"Economy No. 25 for Wood\" manufactured by Peace Foundry, Toronto, each with its own system of ducts and circulating fan. The furnaces rest on concrete foundations carried on posts entirely separate from the foundations of the building. Flues are of steel and are well insulated where passing through floor and roof. Approximately 200 cords of wood are used in a year and consideration is now being given to the use of coal, which can be obtained from a mine some 40 miles away.\n\nElectrical: Electric power is obtained from the Missions' own power plant and is 110 Volt direct current. Service consists of two main 40 amp. switches, one for each floor. Wiring is installed in flexible conduit, exposed on ceilings and walls and I am told has been installed by the Radio Operator. Additional wiring has been run, direct from the plant, to take care of electrical equipment, such as bread mixer, pumps, etc., which have been added later. The service is fully loaded now and any additional load placed on the existing wiring, would in my opinion constitute a danger.\n\nThe building should be rewired in rigid conduit in accordance with the Canadian Electrician Code, as soon as possible. At the same time, I would suggest that consideration be given to obtaining power from the Settlement Power Plant, which would provide alternating current, instead of direct. This would make possible the use of fluorescent lights.\n\nFire fighting equipment consists of 8 - 2\u00bd gal. Fire Extinguishers, 7 small Pyrene Extinguishers and 20 Fire Extinguishers Bombs.\n\nThe exterior of the building is in good repair. It was painted five years ago and paint is on hand to paint the whole of the exterior this summer. A new five ply felt and pitch roof was put on last summer, materials being obtained from Edmonton and installed by local labor, in accordance with the directions given by manufacturer.\nI estimate the value of the building as follows:\n\nI find the Administrative Building, which is in course of construction for the Government, is costing approximately $1.25 a cubic foot. On this basis, I estimate the replacement value of the School Building at $1.10 a cubic foot.\n\nReplacement value 182,000 cubic feet @ $1.10 = $200,200.00\n\nDepreciation at 2\u00bd% per annum\n30% of $200,200.00 = $60,600.00\n\nCost of rewiring building, replacing second floor ceiling and other minor work required to bring building up to standard. $15,000.00\n\nPresent day value $124,600.00\n\nI could get very little information regarding the value of land. Mr. Bouchard, Government Administrator, informed me there was no assessment of land and that it was practically worthless. He said a nominal sum of $25.00 was placed on lots. There was no one at the School who could give me any information on this subject, but it was presumed that there would be no difficulty in having a portion of the Mission property, on which the school building stands, transferred to the Government, in the event of the school building being purchased.\n\nWith reference to other Mission Buildings, as far as I could ascertain, the school building is the only building being considered in this transaction. The above valuation is for the school building alone.\n\nI am enclosing plan of the Settlement of Aklavik, showing location of the school, also plans of building and photographs.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.S.W. Wells\nArchitect\n\nLSWW/BJ\nEnclosure.\nMarch 3, 1949.\n\nDear Doctor Keenleyside -\n\nI am forwarding to you, herewith, two sets of blue prints showing the Indian Residential School at Aklavik, N.W.T. and two sets of photographs. This building was visited and inspected recently by Mr. Wells of the District Resident Architect's office, Victoria. This inspection was made as a result of requests from your Department for inspection of Indian Schools at Carcross and Aklavik, the Carcross School having been previously reported upon.\n\nI am also returning one set of blue prints forwarded to this office with your original request for this inspection.\n\nYou will also find enclosed a copy of the report of inspection dated February 8, 1949, included in which is the inspector's valuation of the Anglican School Building, shown as a present day value of $124,600.00. This is arrived at by estimating the present day cost and depreciating this figure at 2\u00bd per annum for the time the building has been standing. It is understood that the building was erected in 1936 and therefore shows a depreciation of 30%.\n\nYour attention is particularly drawn to the inspector's remarks relative to the electrical installation in which he says: \"The building should be rewired in rigid conduit, in accordance with the Canadian Electrical Code, as soon as possible.\" You will note that the inspector has deducted the estimated cost of rewiring the building from its present value, thus arriving at the net present value quoted above.\n\nYour attention is also drawn to the inspector's remarks on Page 3, relative to the valuing of land upon which the Residential School stands. This he has only shown as a nominal sum of $25.00, he having arrived at this decision after discussing the matter with Mr. Bouchard, Government Administrator.\nIt is hoped that this report and the information contained therein, along with the photographs and blue prints, will be sufficient for your purposes in arriving at a purchase price for these buildings from the Anglican Church Mission. If there is further information which you may require, I shall endeavour to obtain it through the District Resident Architect at Victoria.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.P. Murphy,\nDeputy Minister.\n\nDr. H.L. Keenleyside,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nExtract from report on Anglican Residential School, Aklavik, N.W.T., as submitted on 8 February, 1949, to the District Resident Architect, Department of Public Works, Victoria, B.C., by L.S.W. Wells, Architect.\n\nI find the Administrative Building, which is in course of construction for the Government, is costing approximately $1.25 a cubic foot. On this basis, I estimate the replacement value of the School Building at $1.10 a cubic foot.\n\nReplacement value 182,000 cubic feet @ $1.10 = $200,200.00\n\nDepreciation at 2\u00bd% per annum\n30% of $200,200.00 = $60,600.00\n\n$139,600.00\n\nCost of rewiring building, replacing second floor ceiling and other minor work required to bring building up to standard. $15,000.00\n\nPresent day value $124,600.00\n\nI could get very little information regarding the value of land. Mr. Bouchard, Government Administrator, informed there was no assessment of land and that it was practically valueless. He said a nominal sum of $25.00 was placed on lots. There was no one at the School who could give me any information on this subject, but it was presumed that there would be no difficulty in having a portion of the Mission property, on which the school building stands, transferred to the Government, in the event of the school building being purchased.\n\nWith reference to other Mission Buildings, as far as I could ascertain, the school building is the only building being considered in this transaction. The above valuation is for the school building alone.\nOttawa, March 10, 1949.\n\nReverend Canon L.A. Dixon, O.B.E., M.A., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Missionary Society,\nThe Church of England in Canada,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\n\nPurchase of Aklavik Residential School.\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nYou will recall previous discussions with regard to the purchase of the above school and attached property. While we do not have, at the present time, a sum in our Estimates for the purchase of this building, we would like to have from you an indication as to whether you are prepared to sell it and also as to whether you feel the evaluation set out herein to be satisfactory.\n\nPlease find attached a copy of an extract from the report of inspection dated February 8, 1949, included in which is the Inspector's valuation of your Residential School at Aklavik, shown as a present day value of $124,600.00.\n\nThis is arrived at by estimating the present day cost and depreciating this figure at 2\u00bd per annum for the time the building has been standing. It is understood that the building was erected in 1936 and therefore shows a depreciation of 30%.\n\nWe understand that some of these buildings will be required by you still for missionary use. Therefore, we would appreciate an indication from you as to which of the\nbuildings you wish to have included in the sale and also whether you consider the above prices acceptable to your organization.\n\nIt will also be necessary to arrive at a valuation for the furniture and equipment in the buildings and the property on which they are located. Therefore, I would ask that your Principal would prepare an inventory at this school listing the types of equipment and the value set thereon.\n\nWith regard to the land, it will be necessary for you to produce the usual proof of ownership so that the transfer can be arranged. You should also indicate the value set by you on this property.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\nEncl.\nTravelling Expenses of Mr. L.S.W. Wells\n\n517.40\nMr. Bernard F.

I visited this building and I consider $1,000.00 a fair and reasonable valuation of it.\n\nThe Principal's residence is a storey and a half building comprising six rooms, three rooms and bath room on first floor and two rooms on second floor with a porch on front and shed at back. The building is in good repair and comprises approximately 1200 cubic feet.\n\nMy valuation of present day value is 1200 cubic feet at .80\u00a2 a cubic foot - $960.00, which I consider fair and reasonable.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.S.W.

Return forms #61 in triplicate for all Eskimo and half-breed children in the school.\n2. Admission and discharge forms #78 in triplicate for the same.\n3. Applications forms #77 in triplicate for all Eskimo and half-breeds in the school except two.\n4. Return forms #403 for all Treaty Indians in the school.\n5. Admission and discharge forms #411 in duplicate for the same.\n6. Applications form #77 in triplicate for all Treaty Indians in the school.\n\nI am not sending application forms for those children transferred from Hay River and from Shingle Point. I didn't think it necessary. The two others I have mentioned above as not having sent, have yet to be signed by their respective fathers. I shall get the signatures and send them along next mail.\n\nI have used form #77 for Treaty Indians because the proper form did not come to hand until near the end of September when the forms were already filled up. I have marked in each case \"Treaty Indian\" at the top of each form.\n\nIf I have not sent copies enough of these forms advise me and I shall send as many as you need in the future. I have sent a copy of all forms except application forms to the Indian Residential School Commission, Winnipeg.\n\nI should like a further supply of forms #411 only, if you please.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n'sgd' H.

Indian Residential School. The Department approves the admission of each of the Treaty Indian children covered by these applications.\n\nIn regard to these returns, I may say that the Indian Affairs Branch requires only one copy of applications for admission and quarterly returns of attendance.

One is for your files, the other to be forwarded by you to the Department. Sally Ezai, a child from Hay River, has been entered on the register and put on the returns, but I find that Application Forms have not been filled out for her. I am sending them to Simpson, her home, in this mail, and shall forward them to you as soon as I get them back. I am sorry about this, but the child had been so long at Hay River, that it never occurred to me that no grant was being paid for her until I examined closely the information sent me by Mr. Singleton.\"\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.\n\nEWM/KH\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 919-10, part 1)\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT All Saints Anglican SCHOOL DURING Oct., Nov., Dec., QUARTER, 1937\n\n| No. | NAME            | Date of Admission | Age on Admission | Band | Father          | Mother          | Religion of Parents | State of Education upon entering the School |\n|-----|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 07  | Winnie Vineltsi | Nov. 2 9          |                  | McPherson | John Vineltsi L | Annie Vineltsi L | C.ofE.               | Nil                                         |\n|     |                 |                   |                  |      | David Drymeat D | Mary Drymeat D  | C.ofE.               | This School                                  |\n| 05  | Jane Drymeat    | \" 9 15            |                  |      |                 |                 |                     |                                             |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | NAME            | Date of Discharge | Age on Discharge | PERIODS IN THE SCHOOL | STATE OF EDUCATION | TRADE OR INDUSTRY TAUGHT AND PROFICIENCY IN IT | REMARKS UPON DISCHARGE REASONS FOR SAME |\n|-----|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 8   | Edward Francis  | Oct. 16           | 12 1 1 16        | N11 Grade 1           | Gen.

I am returning the admission and discharge sheet in order that you may revise it. The top part of this form should only show the names of the pupils admitted to the school for the first time during the quarter. The bottom part of the return should only show the names of the pupils who have been finally discharged from the school and returned to their homes.\n\nJames Husby, No. 9, was admitted to the Aklavik School in the year 1936. Apparently he was ill in hospital for some time but is still a pupil of the school. His name should not have been included on the admission and discharge form. All that was necessary in his case was to make a note opposite his name on the quarterly return showing the date he was admitted to hospital and the date he was discharged. As you are aware grant is not allowed for pupils when they are in hospital as the Department is responsible for their hospital expenses.\n\nFrom the information given in this letter I would appreciate if you would prepare and forward a revised admission and discharge form for the March quarter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Pugh of the Edmonton Agency we proceeded from the Resolution Indian Agency on the morning of July 1st.\n\nFORT MC PHERSON\n\nA strong protest was placed against the recruiting by the Missions of the Indian children to the schools. The Indians stated that the missions took their children to school in the fall but did not return them in the spring. This entailed a trip to Aklavik in the summer to see their children or else a prolonged visit in Aklavik, at a considerable expense. They do not like this as when they arrived in Aklavik they followed the usual Indian inclination to hang around a white settlement to their own detriment. On arrival in Aklavik and upon further enquiry this was found to be the case. The matter was discussed with the Anglican and R.C.Missions and am pleased to report that they are both going to take the school children to McPherson and Arctic Red River during the 1939 summer holidays. Copies of letters received from Indians attached, dealing with this matter. I would judge that Aklavik as an Indian rendezvous should be discouraged.

Westgate,\nBible House,\n184 Alexander Ave., E.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nWe were instructed by wire by both the Indian and Interior Departments to make up the March Quarterly Returns to the day that the mail left. We did this, which left five days remaining on that quarter. I enquired from Dr. Livingstone what we should do about these five days and he advised me to make separate returns and send them in when I could. There is a special plane in today, which will be the last possible mail plane until June. I am therefore sending all the forms to you, and shall ask you to send on three copies to the Department of Interior and the usual procedure and one copy to the Department of Indian Affairs, retaining one of each for your own file. If I should send these to the Agents at Norman and Fort Smith they could not possibly reach you outside until some time in June.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd) H.S.

Harvey M.D.\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\n\nRe. No. 12 Thomas Ross\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI find from the school records that Thomas Ross was given leave of absence on March 1st, 1940 for the ratting season. In the quarterly return for that quarter a note is made to that effect. I find that his parents came for the boy and promised to return him at the end of the ratting season. At the end of the season the family were at their camp fifty miles from the settlement, and could not return the boy. Since then the mother of the family has become ill, and since the boy is of use about the house I expect he shall not return to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nAll Saints School,\nAklavik N.W.T.\nFebruary 5, 1941.\n\nJ.P. Harvey,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Norman N.W.T.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI expect we shall have several boys out this year for the ratting season. This means that they go away early in March and are away until June 15th, or after that date. In the case of some who are in far away parts of the Delta the child cannot be returned to school before the end of the term. This I consider a good thing since it keeps these older boys in touch with their native life. However they are absent from the school for the whole of one quarter and as the matter stands the school loses the grant for that period. I believe the Department desire the older children to be allowed to leave the school for the ratting season and we have no objection to their going except that it does not seem right that we should lose the grant for six or eight children for three months.\n\nI would be glad if you would give me a ruling in the matter; whether or not they are to be allowed to go, and in the event of their going how the grant is to be reckoned.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nFort Norman N.W.T.\nFebruary 10 1941\n\nDear Sir,\nRe your letter of July 16, file 141-1-19,\n\nHere is the correspondence from Mr. Sheppard of the Cof E school Aklavik regarding the boy Thomas Ross.\n\nHe also asks for a ruling for the future regarding the school boys.\n\nWould suggest you write to him direct as the better way of satisfying his query.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.

Residential School is approved.\n\nWith regard to the Principal's letter of February 5 the Department is prepared to consider allowing grant for a maximum of 6 pupils to enable them to take part in the ratting season. This may be considered a vocational project. In making this concession it is understood that the school management will supply the boys with the clothing that they require and also attach to the June quarter return a report giving the names of the boys who are taking advantage of this offer and a brief outline of what each of them did during this special leave period.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

School but we have not received the March quarter return of the Aklavik C.E. School. Please arrange to have this forwarded immediately and inform the Principal of the Aklavik C.E.

E. Residential School reached the Department this morning, but we have not received the March quarter return from this school. It would be appreciated if you could arrange to have the March quarter return forwarded to us immediately. At the same time you might point out to the Principal that his returns are always delayed in reaching this office. I realize that delays in the mail may occur in connection with this school; but, at the same time it is felt that if the return was prepared promptly at the end of the quarter and immediately sent forward, it would reach here much earlier than it has in the past.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend T.B.R.

School Comm., M.S.C.C.,\n43-45 The Bible House, Alexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have received your letter of the 5th inst. No. 141-1-10, and regret that you have not yet received the March Quarter Return for our Aklavit School. As our copy of that Quarterly Return reached us on April 16th, I am wondering what could have happened to the original which should have reached you very shortly after the above date.\n\nI am advising Canon Shepherd, the Principal of this School, of the substance of your letter, but I am not convinced that the delays you mention are due to neglect on his part. His copy of the June Quarterly Return, for instance, reached us on July 31st, and as he always replies to our letters quite promptly, I am of the opinion the delays to which you refer must be due to some other cause.\n\nIf it would be a convenience to you to have a copy of the copy we received of the March Quarterly Return we will forward the same if you will kindly provide us with the necessary forms.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWith regard to the delay in receiving quarterly returns from our Aklavit School as referred to in Departmental letter of September 5th last, 141-1-10, and your letter to me on the 17th of September, I beg to state that I wrote to the Principal of this school in this important matter, and have recently received from him the following information:\n\nIn a letter dated September 20th he wrote, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I sent the original of the March quarterly returns direct to the Indian Agent at Fort Norman...... Because I heard nothing from it, I presumed all had worked out well, and sent the original of the July quarterly returns through the same channel. I mailed the copies for the March quarter on April 12th and for the July quarter on July 26th.\n\n\"I have made it a point to get those quarterly returns away on the first possible mail after the close of each quarter. With the September quarter there must be a long delay since we never get a mail from about the middle of September until Christmas time in each year. In the spring there is sometimes a long delay depending on whether or not we get a mail in April. If the weather continues cold we often do; if it does not then there is no mail after the March aeroplane until June. The returns for the other two quarters can always be sent away fairly promptly.\"\nPrincipal Shepherd suggests that to avoid further delays in the receipt of his returns, he be allowed to ask the Medical Officer of the Department of Mines and Resources to sign the returns, and that they be mailed direct to you thereafter, instead of being sent through the agency at Fort Norman. I will be obliged if you will let me know if this arrangement has the approval of your branch of Government.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTERW:A.\nOttawa,\nOctober 23, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the quarterly returns of the Aklavik C.E. School, I should appreciate it if you would advise the Principal to send his quarterly returns direct to the Department in future. By so doing the delays that have occurred in the past will be overcome.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe Rev. Canon H.S. Shepherd, Principal of our Aklavik School has requested me to advise him with regard to the method of computing the school attendance during the September Quarter of each year, during which Quarter most of the children are absent for the months of July and August on holiday. While it is my understanding that the children who were in residence when the school closed for the holiday period and then returned at the expiration of that period, are to be included in the return, I desire to have confirmation of this before giving a specific instruction to the Principal.\n\nWhile it seems to me that you furnished me with your ruling in this matter some years ago, I have been unable to locate the same, and I trust you will not mind my asking you to let me have it again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.B.R. Westgate\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 10, 1942.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant the Department allows 62 days holiday leave with grant. Consequently, for a pupil who goes on leave on June 30 and returns on September 1 grant should be requested on the September quarter return for 92 days. In the case of a pupil who goes on leave on June 30 and does not return until September 15 grant should be requested for 77 days. In brief, when preparing the September quarter return grant should be requested, in the case of those pupils who were in the school on June 30, for the exact number of days they were in residence during the September quarter plus 62 days holiday leave for which grant is allowed.\n\nThe Department would appreciate anything you can do to impress upon the Principal of the Aklavik Residential School the importance of transmitting his quarterly return immediately following the close of the quarter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.
