Here are the different problems I had to deal with immediately:\n\n1- The pump itself was out of order.\n2- It was unnecessarily elevated, thus necessitating more power to draw the water.\n3- The base on which it was standing was not firm.\n4- There was an undue draught of air around it, exposing it often to frost during winter.\n5- There was only a single floor over the pneumatic water tanks, which often were freezing during winter.\n\nI had the pump properly repaired by the shops of the Manitoba Paper Co., at Pine Falls. I had the pump lowered and set on a firm cement base. I had a wall built at some reasonable distance, and insulation done over the pneumatic tanks.\n\nEnclosed please find vouchers covering the labour done on the work, to wit:\n\nRepairs on the pump. Paid. $17.05\nWork to set the pump properly $59.00\n\n$76.05\n\nThe school has supplied free the following:\n\nBought from Granoffsky Bros., Pine Falls:\nCement 8 bags $8.80\nBought from The Cusson Lumber Co., St. Boniface, Man.:\n800 ft.

November 26th, 1936.\n\nAttention of Mr. Sutherland\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing copy of a letter received from the Rev. Father Brachet, Principal of the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, setting forth certain expenses incurred in connection with repairs to the pump and work in re-setting the pump on a more satisfactory foundation.\n\nThere is no question as to the fact that the pump needed to be repaired and you will perhaps recall the unsatisfactory setting of the pump when you visited the school some two or three years ago. The basement underneath the engine room was not dug sufficiently deep before the pump was installed and it was necessary to get the pump on a level with the pressure tanks, which were installed in a proper basement some two years ago.\n\nI feel that the expense has been kept quite reasonable and would recommend that Voucher No. 303, which I am forwarding under separate cover, be paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

The same work exactly cost in 1919 for wages only, I am told, the sum of $1,700.00. Still we had to crib 20 ft. more than in 1919 for earth on the bank of the river, which earth is now loose and needed to be held back from falling, whereas at that time the earth was solid and no crib was necessary. The cost was thus raised $10.00 per ft. for 20 ft., which is the ordinary cost of cribbing per foot.\n\nWe had to put all the men insured by the Compensation Board, for in places they were 18 ft. underground. Some accidents might also have happened in the water.\n\nThere are many items which were willingly paid by the school.\n\nWe are quite proud and thankful that we were successful in finishing the task properly.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nA.

Father Brachet, Principal of the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nWe expected to repair the water line by digging down at the school and with pressure forcing the pipe through the bank into the river. Unfortunately, there were too many rocks and it became necessary to lay the pipe by digging from the school out into the river beyond freezing point. I think the Department will understand that this entailed a great amount of work. I need only refer to the expense in connection with the water line at the Kenora School which expense, I understand, reached approximately $2500. The work at Fort Alexander was practically the same and I am convinced that the Principal has kept the cost as low as possible and that the work will prove satisfactory. I trust the Department will see fit to pay this added expense.\n\nUnder separate cover, I am forwarding Vouchers Nos. 301 and 302 in connection with the above matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G.

Urgent.\n\nWhen you came here last summer I had you notice that the Girls' Gallery foundation had partly fallen away. Since then it crumbled about completely, nearly causing bodily harm. The gallery itself and also the solarium built above by the Department were exposed to sink down at once. There was no time to lose in repairing it. While a competent foreman, Mr. Peter Desrochers, was here, I thought it necessary and urgent to proceed with work at once with two masons, whom I am employing at the school.\n\nEnclosed please find the accounts of the work, to wit:\n\nLabor. November 7th $86.00\n\" 14th $93.65\n\nMaterial. Bought from Granoffsky Bros., Pine Falls, Man., & payable to him $179.65\n\nEverything is now safe with the gallery & solarium.

The ammeter does not work, so we cannot know if electricity is brought to the batteries or not. The rheostat coils, having some plates burned, others poorly insulated, let some fire escape and flame up along the wall. Thus we can hardly recharge the nice set of batteries, which have been supplied by the Department.\n\nI had an electrician from the Manitoba Paper Co., of Pine Falls, come and examine the Switchboard. Later on two men from the Dickson Electric Co., of Winnipeg, Mr. W. P. Smith, Manager, and an expert, came on my request to visit the batteries, which they had supplied. Soon afterwards two men from the Canadian General Electric Co., of Winnipeg, came also on my request to see the generator and switchboard, which they have supplied in 1925.\n\nThe suggestions I gathered from those experienced men is that the ammeter should be fixed by a competent man of Winnipeg; also that the burned plates should be replaced by a company, which would recast similar ones, and that the others would be properly rehauled and isolated. Thus with a lowered cost the switchboard should work properly until such time as the Department would see the way to authorize the contemplated transmission line from Pine Falls.\n\nIt is rather hard to state the possible cost of this expenditure; but, as much as can be gathered, it should not amount to over $50.00, possibly less.\n\nAs this work is something delicate and important, I wish to leave it to the responsibility of the Department. I would only point out that it is very pressing.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nA. G.

Armstrong representing Exide Batteries of Canada Limited, and Mr. J.A. Smith, our service manager, proceeded to Fort Alexander School for the purpose of making a thorough examination of the condition of the batteries. Unfortunately we found that a few days previous the switch panel had broken down, the battery charging resistor had become broken, the ammeter was not in operation and the batteries were in a discharged condition. We made an examination of the batteries and they appeared to be, apart from the discharged condition, normal. There was nothing that we could determine from observations made that would indicate that the batteries were defective and that with proper care and attention they should not give the service for which they were recommended. Due to the discharged condition of the batteries, we were unable to make the regular tests and therefore we were unable to determine to what extent the batteries had been in a semi-discharged condition as the fact that the charge was not going into the batteries was entirely unknown to the party in charge of the equipment.\n\nWe remained on the job from approximately 3 o'clock P.M. until about 10 P.M., allowing a short interval for dinner. We succeeded in temporarily repairing the battery charging resistor on the plant and also temporarily repairing the ammeter and although the lighting plant end of the installation was apart from our affairs, we were able to assist the man in charge in obtaining a better working knowledge of their present\nsystem and at the same time we left instructions with him for the proper care of the batteries.\n\nAs mentioned above, we were unable to determine to what extent in the past these batteries were allowed to become discharged away below normal. Therefore to offset a sulphated condition and the possibility of a low capacity, we left full instructions for a method of correction which would remove sulphation and increase the capacity. We have further requested that they forward a report as soon as the various charges have been given the battery and when we have received this report, we will communicate with you further.\n\nThe above visit to the Fort Alexander Indian School is the third call which has been made and these calls were due to complaints which you have on record but in all cases we have found that the charging rates were inadequate to keep the battery in condition. However, we believe Father Brachet who is in charge at present, will see that instructions regarding this equipment are carried out and that the equipment will be preserved to the best of their ability. The young man in charge of the plant appears to be very conscientious and willing to co-operate in every way in regard to the proper care and attention of their lighting system.\n\nWe will communicate with you further when we have received the report from the operator in charge.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDICKSON ELECTRIC COMPANY\n\n(Sgd) W.

I am also enclosing a letter of a later date from the Principal.\n\nThe switchboard is certainly in bad condition as I was at the school myself last week and feared then we could not operate for long.\n\nI have discussed this with Dickson Electric and they state the coil needs repairing or perhaps renewing and if this is the case, it will cost more than $50, the amount estimated by the Rev. Father. I would like authority to put this board in operating condition and will endeavour to keep the expense as low as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

All the pipes are ready; there is only one thing missing, the bath tub itself.\n\nI am sure the Department will not refuse this indispensable article of a sick-room and will be glad to obtain for us one 4 ft. Cast Iron Enamelled Bath Tub.\n\nMr. Desrosiers is still working here and will be able to have an efficient installation if the bath tub is sent ere long.\n\nThanking you in advance for the recommendation you will give, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev.

M. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal, Fort Alexander Indian Res.

Since that time it seems that matters became still worse, for the plaster began to fall in places - once some fell on one pupil's head - and where big holes were opened on the walls, noticed that the rooms became about unfit to be inhabited, when there was a strong wind striking the sides. We could not pass the winter with pieces of plaster endangering the pupils and with cold rooms exposing them to pneumonia. In the same time it was too late to ask and wait for due authorization from the Department. Considering that, as Principal, I have the responsibility of the pupils' health, I have done the most pressing work, leaving the rest until we obtain the authorization to replaster, as has been asked in next year's estimates.\n\nThese urgent repairs on walls & ceilings amount to $672.80.\n\nIn the same time we had still to install toilets in the ex-laundry, now the girls' nice recreation room. The work amounts to $66.00.\n\nThese are the last returns I dare send to the Department, for I consider that we have received good help, which is immensely appreciated.\n\nA considerable amount of work remains to be done.\n\n1- The school being as an ice house at times during the winter, we have to re-adjust the external doors & frames, specially those leading to the fire-escapes, as well as the inside windows & stops, and the storm shades.\n\nA storm door with refrigging or stirs are needed in the boiler room, where water pipes froze last winter.\n\nInsulation has to be done over the dormitories, and in the boys' dormitories radiators will be added, as it is so high and exposed to the north wind.\n\n2- Some toilets leaking, some plumbing has to be refixed and fixtures replaced.\n\n3- Some chimney ventilators being fire-hazards have to be refixed.\n\nAll this necessary work means a large expenditure, but I am ready to have it done only with the school funds, provided the above accounts are accepted.\n\nI do not wish the Department to have to pay high hospital bills in Pine Falls for pupils who would have been exposed to sickness. Prevention is better than cure.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nA.G. Hamilton, Inspector,\nWinnipeg.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6265, file 579-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN., December 28th, 1936,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder separate cover, I am forwarding Voucher No. 337, amounting to $672.65, for labour in connection with repair work at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nI am attaching copy of a letter received from the Rev. J. Brachet, Principal of the school, and there is really very little I can add to this letter. I was at the school eight or ten days ago and can assure the Department that the work outlined by the Principal was all needed and has certainly been well done. There has been a lot of work carried out for which the Department have given no assistance. Paint has been purchased by the Principal and the exterior of the school painted one coat. This has greatly improved the appearance and will help to preserve the building.\n\nWhile at the school, I pointed out to the Rev. Father that there was no authority for any of the work and that it would be impossible to even submit further vouchers without his definite assurance that there would be no further expense during the present fiscal year. The Department will note that the Rev. Father has given this assurance in the letter attached. I am submitting the accounts in the form of a voucher and would recommend that, if funds are available, these accounts be paid. In making this recommendation I realize the Principal had no authority to do the work, but, on the other hand, it was practically impossible.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nimpossible to carry on with the school in the condition in which it was and, as stated above, the work has all been well done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. A. G. HAMILTON,\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES, WINNIPEG, DATED\nJANUARY 4th, 1937, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE FORT\nALEXANDER INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe fire escapes were unlocked. The fire hose appeared in good condition, but carelessly hung over a pipe. Brackets should be supplied and the hose properly folded. I would recommend that four axes be provided and placed in suitable locations, these to be used only in case of fire. Fire extinguishers are located on each floor. In winter, a night watchman is on duty and his time is checked by means of a clock. The school is a fire hazard and every precaution should be taken to prevent one.\n\nThe new laundry is well built and well equipped, except that more power is required to operate the machinery. If the Hydro power is not installed next year, a 10 H.P. engine should be supplied. The dryer is installed upstairs above the laundry and, when fitted with new coils, will prove very satisfactory.\n\nThe lighting plant is not giving good service. The engine is very old and expensive to operate. The switchboard really should be replaced, but with some repairs, we can perhaps get through the winter. I hope next year we can have the Hydro power installed; if this is not done, we must be prepared to install a new lighting plant and supply a larger engine for the laundry.\n\nThis school should also be supplied with a frigidaire. Due to the location, it is necessary to keep a supply of meat and other perishable food on hand and it is difficult to prevent waste under present conditions. There is suitable space for the installation in the dairy and I hope funds will be provided.\nOttawa, January 8, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant, reporting on your inspection of the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, you may purchase and ship to the school the brackets which you consider necessary for the fire hose. You should also instruct the Principal to have the hose properly installed and placed on the brackets.\n\nWith reference to the lighting plant, you were authorized by official letter of the 31st ultimo to arrange for the repairs required to the switchboard.\n\nYour recommendation that a frigidaire be supplied is noted. Owing to lack of funds, it is not possible to favourably consider supplying this equipment at the present time. Certain funds are provided for this school in our Appropriation for next year, and if this item is allowed, it may be possible to supply the frigidaire.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nLegislative Building,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of April 2nd regarding the chlorinating system at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School and I should be glad to discuss this with you the first opportunity.\n\nI do not concur in your opinion that the chlorinating installation is necessitated by mill operations, nor that the Company is responsible in any way for the upkeep or cost. Some years ago I offered to send our man down to the Mission periodically to make an inspection of the plant purely as a matter of voluntary assistance to the Mission authorities; apparently for quite a long time the plant was not used and was permitted to get out of repair so that there was no object in continuing this practice. However, if it is going to be of any assistance to the Mission authorities, I should be glad to send a man down periodically to inspect the equipment and give the Mission people any advice we can with regard to proper maintenance and operation. We would, however, assume no responsibility in connection with either the Chlorox or repairs.\n\nI shall be glad to discuss this at any time with Father Brachet and make arrangements as to the best time for such inspection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMANITOBA PAPER COMPANY LIMITED\n\n(Sgd) C. C. Irvine\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n538 Dom. Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, MAN., April 30th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received a letter some time ago from the Rev. Father Brachet stating it cost approximately $75. to purchase the Chlorox required to keep the water fit to drink at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School. He pointed out that this expense and the upkeep of the chlorinator is a direct result of pollution of the river by the Manitoba Paper Co. Ltd. and in his opinion, they should pay this expense. I have had repeated complaints from the Indians in this respect. They claim the river water has been made unfit to drink and feel the mill authorities should provide wells.\n\nRecently I wrote Mr. C. C. Irvine concerning the water situation and attached is a copy of his reply, and the Department will note the stand taken.\n\nThe existing condition can only be attributed to mill operations and my opinion is that both the school and Indians should be compensated by making it possible for them to obtain suitable drinking water.\n\nThe Department no doubt has correspondence regarding this matter as I am of the opinion the paper mill supplied the chlorinator now in use. If such is the case, they apparently at that time felt some responsibility. I would appreciate being advised under what arrangement the chlorinator was placed in the school and what agreement, if any, was made concerning operating costs.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nThe Secretary, Inspector of Indian Agencies\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1G, Volume 6265, file 579-5, part 7)\nOttawa, February 1, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the Manitoba Paper Company Ltd., Pine Falls, relative to the chlorinating plant at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School. They state that inspection has been made of this plant from time to time by their Chief Engineer and Chief Chemist and that it developed, at the time of the last inspection, which was on the 7th ultimo, that the school had been out of chlorine since about November 10th, last.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that an arrangement was made some time ago with the Company that when the supply of chlorine on hand reached a certain point, the School Authorities would advise them, and a further supply would be furnished. It is necessary, if this chlorinating plant is to be operated properly, that you co-operate with the Company in order to receive proper advice on how to handle the plant. The water from the Winnipeg River is grossly polluted, and, as the Department went to a great deal of expense to install the system, and as the Paper Company undertook to have their Engineer make periodic inspection and assist you in keeping the plant in order, it is expected that you will co-operate with them to the fullest extent. It would appear that this system is being operated with a great deal of carelessness and neglect. It is of the utmost importance to the health of the pupils that this chlorinating plant be kept in proper order and in constant use. I shall be pleased to have a report from you in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n'Sgd.' T. R. L. MacInnes.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. M. Kalmes, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Indian Res. School,\nFort Alexander, Man.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 5th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the condition of the water at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will remember that there has been previous correspondence regarding the chlorinating plant at this school and I would suggest that Reverend Father Brachet and yourself interview Mr. Irvine. It is quite possible that he will supply the chlorine that is required at the school. In this connection, I enclose, for your information, a copy of official letter of February 1st, 1932, written to the former Principal of the Fort Alexander Residential School.\n\nIf your interview with Mr. Irvine is unsatisfactory, you might discuss with Reverend Father Brachet the advisability of digging a well at the Fort Alexander School in order to provide for its water requirements. In replying, you might let me have an estimate of the cost of adopting this suggestion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey.\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc. l:\nA. G.

I understand the repair work required will involve considerable expense and I would appreciate knowing the amount allowed for repair and upkeep and if I may authorize the work necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, July 16th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to repair work required at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nIn our appropriation for the current fiscal year, the following provision was made for this school:\n\n- Repairs to balconies - $800.\n- Interior painting - $300.\n- General repairs - $300.\n\nTOTAL - $1,400.\n\nWhile the above items are specifically mentioned in our appropriation, at the same time, if you consider there is other more necessary work, the Department will have no objection to doing what you recommend.\n\nI believe it would be advisable for you to visit the Fort Alexander School and, after careful consideration, report to the Department the best manner in which to expend the above amount.\n\nYou should, also, state what tradesmen are required and the approximate cost of the lumber, etc., that will be needed.\n\nImmediate consideration will be given to your recommendation and you will then be advised what action to take.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Hesey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nChief, Welfare & Training  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am just back from a visit to the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School. The Principal took occasion of my visit to point out that he had no boat of any kind to use for his recruiting. As you know, the river divides the Reserve in two and about one-half of the Indians live on the East side of the river whilst the school is built on the West side of it.\n\nHe would willingly buy and pay for a large rowboat if the Department would supply a Johnson Outboard Motor. A 4-horsepower motor would be about the right size.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Principal has not asked for nor received any grant for recruiting, it occurred to me that you may be willing to supply him with this motor in lieu of a grant for recruiting.\n\nHoping that you will consider this request favourably, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend J.

This account represents a good part of material bought from Granovsky Bros., of Pine Falls, for different repairs, which were required for sanitation sake, and for the proper upkeep of the buildings. I have had the good fortune of having all the repairs supervised and directed by P. Desrosiers, whom I have found to be a very able and saving contractor, and whose services I wanted to use while they were still available.\n\nI enclose in the same time a truthful sum of the repairs which have been borne by the school only, as they were found so desirable and necessary. The repairs amount to $3,405.15. I thought you would be interested to know what kind of work we have been busy at for the past months. You have noticed a general change in all the buildings.\n\nI am sure the Department, knowing what we have done, will be ready to help us for the other pressing repairs, for which we need immediate assistance.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd.) J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nA.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.\nDear Sir,\n\nUnder separate cover I am forwarding a voucher in favour of the Rev. Father Brachet, amounting to $329.96.\n\nI would point out, at the beginning that this amount is over and above our recommendation, which I am forwarding under separate cover and will total more than the $1400.00 allowed for this school. The material shown in the voucher was purchased from the only firm on the list at Pine Falls and was needed for different repair work which was required throughout the school. I realize that Father had no authority for this expenditure but I can assure the Department that the material was needed and the work performed has been well done.\n\nIn view of the new preventorium which they are building and the other repair work yet to be done, the Father felt it necessary to go ahead in order to have the school in readiness for the pupils when it re-opens in September.\n\nFor the Department's information, I am attaching a sheet showing the repairs which have been carried out by the school authorities. These repairs amount to $3,405.15 and the expense was assumed by the school authorities. Along with the summary, I am forwarding a detailed statement which shows exactly how the money was spent.\n\nIn view of the large amount of work carried out by the school authorities and for which they received no assistance from the Department, I would certainly be pleased if funds could be provided for the voucher which I am submitting. The Rev. principal has been very fair in connection with the work and I might say that had he desired, the need for a septic tank could easily have been kept under cover until all the other repairs were completed and then made known, which means that we undoubtedly would have been obliged, by the Health authorities, to find funds wherewith to install a septic tank. I would be glad to know the Department's wishes in connection with this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to refer to your letter 125-1-5, dated July 16th, and to say that, as requested, I have visited the Pt. Alexander Indian Residential School and find that the $1400.00 allowed will hardly meet the expenses in connection with the work that should be carried out.\n\nThe roof of the boiler room leaks and unless this is repaired immediately the plaster inside will be entirely destroyed. This would cost approximately $110.00.\n\nIt has recently been discovered by the Health authorities that the disposal of the sewage from the school does not pass through a septic tank. It flows into a cement basin and from there runs into the lake. The outlet to the lake is not many feet from the present intake which supplies water to the school. A septic tank should be installed and it is estimated this would cost approximately $565.00.\n\nA number of the beds have been used for many years and are past repair and six new ones are required. Many of the mattresses must be destroyed, and the Sisters have made up the coverings necessary for 32 new mattresses. The filling for these will cost approximately $90.00.\n\nAlthough we did considerable repair work to the plaster on the walls of the school last year, there is still about 1000 yds., to be done. If it were possible to do the worst parts, probably 250 yards, we could get along for another year. This would cost $325.00.\n\nThe boys' play room has not been painted for many years and is very dark and gloomy. This room should be painted as well as the corridor leading to it. The laundry erected last year has never been painted inside and, as a large amount of the material used in the construction was old material, this should also be painted. The labour and paint in connection with this work would cost approximately $350.00.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nIf it is imperative to keep within the $1400.00, I would suggest that the plastering be left over although I am sure before another summer patches of it will have fallen off the wall. The principal is anxious to complete a large part of this work before school opens and I would appreciate having the necessary authority, if possible, by wire.\n\nThe labour, with the exception of that of Mr. Desrosiers and his assistant, will all be performed by the Indians. Mr. Desrosiers is the man who built the laundry last year and is a first class builder.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nOttawa, August 13, 1937.\n\nRe: Repairs for Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have, for acknowledgment, your letter of the 6th instant, in which you state that the sum of $1,400.00 will not be sufficient, in your judgment, to undertake the repairs at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret to state that the limited appropriation at our disposal will not permit us to exceed this amount. I would suggest, therefore, that the plastering to which you refer in the second last paragraph of your communication be left over, on the understanding that provision will be made for this work in our Estimates of next year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Alexander Indian Residential School, Pine Falls, Man.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 125-1-5 dated July 16 and Aug. 13 from R.A. Hoey.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls, Man.,\nSeptember 25th 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Fire protection.\n\nYesterday, on the approach of winter fires, we inspected our fire equipment and we found that 2 of the Pyrene Extinguishers could not operate, having been corroded by the liquid, and they are absolutely useless. It seems to me, anyway, that our equipment is small and inadequate, for, apart of 10 Manville and Eclipse Powder Guns (which are usable mostly for chimney or oil fires) we have only now 4 Guardene and 4 Pyrene Extinguishers.\n\nI would, therefore, ask that other Extinguishers be supplied to us, say \u00bd doz. Pyrene or more, together with refills for 4 Guardenes and for 4 Pyrene. The refill for the Guardenes would be:\n6 lbs. Bi-carbonate of Soda,\n16 fl. oz. Sulphuric Acid.\n\nIn the same time fire equipment is needed for the preventorium which is about completed. The following would be needed:\n\n4 Fire Extinguishers,\n2 50-ft. Fire Hose complete with valve and rack for 1\u00bd in. pipe.\n\nThe co-operation of the Department in this important matter will be duly appreciated.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J. Brechet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Inspector,\nDom. Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg.\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls, Man.,\nSeptember 25th 1937.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe Urgent repairs on Ice House.\n\nLast year when I came here as Principal I found in July that there was no more ice left in the Ice House. This year we have some left yet, owing to great care taken in surrounding all the ice with new shavings; however, we have been unable to keep meat throughout summer, on account of defective ventilation and of the lack of a cooling room. I find it absolutely necessary to keep all meats in very good condition, especially now that we are to start a preventorium. We would have to put a better insulation all through the inside, a new ventilation, two cooling rooms, and possibly a new foundation. The work has to be done now that the weather is cold and before frost begins. Mr. Desrochers, who supervises the building of the preventorium is equipped to do the work and he has the experience that will enable him to put satisfactory work. If we do not repair the Ice House now, we would have to wait another full year and consequently to be without any cooling convenience for meat, butter, etc..\n\nHere is an estimate of cost of repairing satisfactorily the present Ice House:\n\n| Item          | Cost   |\n|---------------|--------|\n| 3000 ft. Lumber at $55.00 | $165.00 |\n| Shavings      | $25.00 |\n| Labour        | $95.00 |\n\n$285.00\n\nI am ready to put any extra expenditure over the mentioned amount, in order to have an Ice House that will give perfect service.\n\nWe would need to have an immediate authorization to proceed with the work before the Indian Labourers go away to cut pulp wood.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nA. G. Hamilton, Inspector (Rev.)\nJ. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal.\nWinnipeg.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6265, file 579-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nSeptember 30th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRecords\n\nAttached are copies of two letters received from the Rev. Father Brachet.\n\nWe should have this fire equipment and I trust the same will be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nThe condition of the ice-house is exactly as set forth and the work outlined is needed. If funds are available, I would be glad if this could be allowed.\n\nI would also ask for a further authority of $20.00 to purchase blinds for the preventorium basement. There are twenty-two windows measuring 23\u00bd by 5 ft. The Rev. principal points out the preventorium will cost approximately $6,000.00. In addition he has purchased 5 good milk cows and intends buying four more and in view of this heavy expense, he would appreciate receiving consideration concerning the above matters.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. P. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 7, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, enclosing copies of letters received from the Principal of the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nAs pointed out in my letter of August 20th, it is not possible for us to exceed the amount provided in the present year's appropriation for the Fort Alexander Residential School. Under these circumstances I regret that favorable consideration cannot be given to the Principal's request for $280.00 for the erection of an ice house. This matter will, however, receive further consideration when we are preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1938-39.\n\nYou may purchase the quantity of refills that you consider necessary for the fire extinguishers at present in the school. Regarding the Principal's request for additional fire extinguishers, the Department is not certain if these are necessary. If, however, you consider two or three new extinguishers are required, you may also supply them.\n\nIn connection with the application for fire extinguishers, hose and blinds for the preventorium, it is considered that these should be purchased by the school management.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

W. McGill,\nDirector Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nMy dear Doctor McGill:\n\nYou are sufficiently conversant with the situation at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential school to dispense me from going into details concerning the electric plant which is now in use. I might say, however, as a matter of record that the electric light and energy are now supplied by a Diesel engine; of course this kind of power necessitates a very large number of batteries. This engine is very old and I am informed that it will soon have to be replaced. The same, of course, must be said of the batteries as they were installed a few years ago and that, as you know, batteries have a very short life, even under the very best management and care.\n\nWould not the best solution of this power and light problem be the building of a power line from Pine Falls to the school? This project was approved by the Department two years ago and was not proceeded with because it was found that the Manitoba Pulp and Paper Company which operates the Pine Falls Mill had not the right to sell electric energy to outside customers. This state of affairs is now eliminated because the Manitoba Power Company is building a line, at least so I am informed, from Great Falls to within two miles of the town of Pine Falls. This line could easily be projected as far as the school. The school then would have a permanent and safe source of electric power. This is all the more necessary since the building of the Preventorium in conjunction and under the direction of the Indian Fort Alexander school. You know how little dependable are the small power units in our schools. It would be most unfortunate if the patients who will be confined to the Preventorium were to suffer through the lack of sufficient electric energy both for power and light.\n\nI submit this case to your consideration knowing that you will favorably act upon it if it is at all possible to do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6265, file 579-5, part 8)\nOttawa, December 20, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, requesting that arrangements be made for the erection of a power line from Pine Falls to the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will remember discussing this matter with me when you recently visited the Department and, at that time, I suggested that you interview the President of the Winnipeg Electric Company, with a view to ascertaining if some arrangement could be made for the erection of a power line to Fort Alexander.\n\nWhen you have had an opportunity to interview him I would appreciate if you would write me again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Diesel engine which operates the electric plant for the Fort Alexander school is out of order and requires immediate attention. Would you be kind enough to issue orders to have this engine overhauled.\n\n2. Up to last June the farm instructor for the school was a bachelor and had a room in the school itself, but Father Brachet has seen fit to replace him with a married man. This means that he has to provide living quarters for him and his family as well. This will entail some expense. Father Brachet proposes to repair a fairly large log building which up to the present time was used as a meeting place for the Indians. It is likely that the sum of $400 would be sufficient for this purpose.\n\n3. The boiler in the laundry has to be overhauled; the boiler inspector for the province of Manitoba so ordered on the occasion of his visit to the school a few weeks ago.\n\nWill you be kind enough to let me know by return mail if it would be in order for Father Brachet to proceed with this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have soldered it with Smooth on Iron Cement without success. We then had an experienced man come twice from the Pine Falls Garage to braze it with acetylene; but it leaks elsewhere. All the front section would have to be taken out and replaced; but I am afraid that the six sections are in the same state, for the coil pipes which were connected from the hot water storage tank with the ordinary heating furnace were leaking last winter and we had to disconnect them.\n\nIt is a Guernsey Cottage Boiler we have from the Guernsey Foundry Co., Robert A. Stewart, Chief Inspector of the Bureau of Labor, 332 Legislative Bldg., Phone No. 840 252, who was here yesterday is of the opinion that it would not be safe to try and repair this old boiler, that any way these Guernsey Boilers do not last long. He mentioned to Rev. Sister Superior another kind of boiler which would be better suitable.\n\nWe are quite handicapped at present for the question of hot water, which is daily needed for dishes and baths. We would sincerely appreciate if you would kindly communicate with the Department by telegram in order to obtain the authorization to have another boiler bought. The Guernsey Foundry Co. would let you know what kind of boiler we have, and Mr. Stewart would mention the type of boiler which he thinks would be better fit and last longer.\n\nI am sure you will do your best to help us in our difficulty. I have bought already at our own expense a big water cooling tank for our 15 H.P. Engine, also a gasoline tank for the same engine, and a little tank for the kitchen range; but all the expenditure of repairs I have had in the school for the last two years I am unable to bear the cost of a hot water boiler.\n\nHoping to receive a word from you soon,\n\nI remain, dear Sir,\nA.G. Hamilton, Inspector, Wpeg.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6265, file 579-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter received from Father Brachet, re hot water boiler.\n\nThe Guernsey Foundry Company can supply the front section or all, but are not prepared to install it. The cost, F.O.B. Winnipeg, will be approximately\n\n(1) Front section without doors, app. 150 lbs @ 16\u00a2 lb.\n(2) Other sections, app. 85 lbs. @ 16\u00a2 lb.\n\nThe other boiler referred to by the Rev. principal is a steel plate boiler which, I understand, is quite expensive. If the old boiler could be checked and the work of repair carried out by a competent firm, (such as was carried out at Sandy Bay and Birtle by Yates & Neale Company, Brandon) I would recommend such a plan be followed.\n\nThe repair is urgent and an immediate reply will be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept., of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nEncl.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 5th instant you may have a competent firm check the boiler at the Fort Alexander Residential School and do the necessary repairs. It is noted that you will have to purchase approximately 235 lbs. of repair parts. Purchase of these should be made from a firm on the approved list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Father Brochet,\nIndian Residential School,\nFort Alexander, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested by you the following is a report on your water pump.\n\nThe pump as you know is in bad repair and will have to be sent to a machine shop for a general overhauling, which in my opinion does not justify the cost, as it is really an obsolete piece of machinery and is worn out.\n\nI would recommend that you install a gasoline driven pump of 500 gallons per hour capacity which would be ample for your normal water supply, but would recommend a 1000 gallon per hour capacity pump for fire protection. This can be supplied equipped with automatic pressure stop but would have to be started by hand or could be equipped fully automatic. This type of pump is very economical to operate and will give perfect satisfaction with a minimum amount of attention. I am writing to Crane & Co. to send you descriptions and prices on the above.\n\nIn regard to your lighting plant engine, I am going to make every effort to send you a competent man to advise you on its condition as this is out of my line of work.\n\nTaking into consideration the condition of your equipment, you would be well advised to install the gasoline operated pump and take the load off your Delco Batteries.\n\nYour Chlorox Water Treatment apparatus is operating satisfactory, and as you know I am only too willing to go down at any time to examine it and make any adjustments necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVCH/EH\n\nIndian Affairs.

No other preventive kills smut more effectively. Standard Formaldehyde is easy to use. Requires no special equipment for treating the grain nor masks to prevent the breathing of poisonous fumes or dust.\n\nAnd best of all, Standard Formaldehyde is by far the most economical, its cost being only one-sixth to one-tenth that of many other methods of treatment.\n\nRead the letters on this and the other side of this sheet\u2014we have hundreds of them\u2014and benefit from the experience of practical farmers such as these.\n\nAND PROTECT YOUR HOME AND FARM AS WELL!\n\nBesides being the best treatment for preventing smut in your grain, Standard Formaldehyde is the cheapest and best disinfectant you can buy for farms and homes. Always handy. Use it every day to keep things sweet and healthy. It will keep your stables sanitary, rid your stables, coops, barns, and back yards of animals, sore shoulders on your horses. Kills flies, drives away mosquitoes, positively eliminates bed bugs. Disinfects sick rooms.\n\nFor PERSPIRING FEET\u2014Bathe the feet for ten minutes in a mild solution (1 teaspoon to a quart of water) of Standard Formaldehyde and warm water. Gives wonderful relief and removes distressing odor.\n\nSAFEST \u2022 CHEAPEST \u2022 EASIEST TO USE\n\nSTANDARD CHEMICAL CO. LTD.\nMONTREAL WINNIPEG TORONTO\nWhen we started farming here in Alberta, in 1913, our seed was rather \"green\" in regard to many conditions we had to meet. As a result our first crop was very smutty, at least one-fifth being lost. Sometime later we heard of Formaldehyde and its application to seed grain. That result of our first trial was practically free of smut, greatly to our delight.\n\nOur method for treating was very crude\u2014a barrel of water with \"dope\" in it, a few gunny sacks into which we put the seed, and then these were suspended in the barrel for a few minutes. We used a common cotton box. Very crude, but we did not care as long as we were sure of a crop free from smut. In the course of a few years we made a doping contrivance which enabled us to work far faster and just as effectively.\n\nWe learned that seed which should be treated every spring, if only mixed up again springing in treating the seed the following fall, would become smutty. This we have actually demonstrated by dividing the seed into treated and untreated lots. The treated lot gave a clean harvest and the latter ran to about 50% smut.\n\nWe have been investigating into trying several other smut control devices, and while some of them eliminated the smut, there were so many objectionable features in handling them that we could hardly fail to fall on Formaldehyde every time.\n\nFor smut prevention on the market, if smut preventive on the market, it is easy and safe to handle; it is more effective than any other smut remedy on the market and any left over can be treated and marketed. It can easily be marketed or fed to the stock, an expensive or complicated control scheme is not necessary. I add it to the seed, and it comes first in deserving credit for the success of agriculture with areas free from smut menace.\n\nOur potatoes were getting more and more smutty, so we treated our seed potatoes in a mild solution of Formaldehyde for about 30 minutes and the resulting crop was just 100% clean.\n\nYours for Formaldehyde,\n\nCARL FREDERICKSON\nCastor, Alta.\n\nIt is with pleasure that I take this opportunity of telling you know that Formaldehyde is still second to none for treatment of seed grain.\n\nI have never seen in my twenty-five years' experience a seed treatment that yielded as good as one treated with Formaldehyde and dusted with an extremely fine dust half was smutted.\n\nIn five years back (1886) like others was anxious for the extra bushels we were supposed to get from using the new dust but found that there was some smut which was not found in the treated seed.\n\nMy own experience was that the wheat treated with Formaldehyde yielded 3 bushels per acre more than the untreated. The wheat which was treated with the new dust was also treated with Formaldehyde and was entirely smutted, while not one head of smut was found on the untreated wheat grown on the same farm.\n\nI notice the difference in price between Formaldehyde and the new dust but I would rather pay twice as much for the former as I do for the latter.\n\nI am convinced that Formaldehyde is an effective antiseptic and disinfectant and we found during the \"flu\" stage that the house where the patient lived was over patient's door and were successful in keeping the disease away from the rest of the family.\n\nI used it in a spray in the henhouse when cleaning up for roup, also in the barn when cleaning up for mite. It is disliked by flies so have used it to advantage in out-houses, thus helping to keep them away.\n\nWhen carefully and properly handled Standard Formaldehyde is an indispensible farm aid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nROBT. CHAPMAN\nPlumas, Man.\n\nI would like to give you my conclusions after twenty consecutive years' using Standard Formaldehyde. My result was always on the green. Living in an old settled district, our land was subject to smut, root rot, blight and wilt and it is always necessary to treat seed if we want to operate the farms. I find that smut of wheat, barley and oats causes. Standard Formaldehyde has been for me the perfect smut prevention for twenty years, I have sold in that time 107,000 bushels of wheat, barley and oats treated with a single load graded smutty, while I have now many cars saved thousands of dollars, doing from $4 to $6 per bushel for smut. I buy from ten to thirty cents each year, but has never once failed to give satisfaction. My expenditure for the last twenty years has been $90 to $100 in an automatic picker. A conservative estimate shows that I have saved by using Standard Formaldehyde is $6,000.00. So that the insurance is cheap as well as effective.\n\nI like Standard Formaldehyde because it is easy to use, safe and takes only a few minutes. There is no chance of failure, no risk of poison, no loss from dust contamination, and no loss from left-over treated seed. I have used it on crops two or three years old and was extremely effective.\n\nWe are told that other treatments are effective, but look smut, oats, barley and some varieties of wheat. I am a biologist but rely more on experience and I will have no smut of any kind if I use Standard Formaldehyde. I treat my seed carefully. I always feel assured when sowing treated seed that the resulting crop will be earlier and more even germination and smut free.\n\nFor years I have followed closely the results of dust treatments. There is still a wide difference of opinion as to their effectiveness among farmers. The instructions for using Standard Formaldehyde are plain and specific. Treat just before sowing.\n\nWith the dust treatments for the past bundle of four, when today, I am taking no chances, when in Standard Formaldehyde I have an economical, safe and effective insurance against smut.\n\nTHOS. W. WOOD, Cordova, Man.\n\nEVIDENCE!\n\nYou cannot do better than bank on the experience and the results obtained by thousands of Western Farmers who treat their seed regularly year after year with STANDARD FORMALDEHYDE. Read the testimony of some of these men.\n\nTREAT YOUR SEED THIS SPRING\u2014AND EVERY SPRING... for BETTER GRADES, GREATER YIELD and CROPS THAT PAY!\n\nSTANDARD CHEMICAL CO.

BALLEY\n\nRe: Order No. 9662\n\nThe above order was dated January 14, 1939, and your purchase form stated that the price of $189.95 covered the cost of the goods supplied and delivered f.o.b. Pine Falls, Manitoba.\n\nThe J. H. Ashdown Hardware Company, with whom the above-mentioned order was placed, have now forwarded us an account for $3.47 covering the cost of the freight charges on the goods supplied on order No. 9662. It would be appreciated if you would review your correspondence in this matter and let me know what action you consider should be taken in connection with the account for transportation expenses.\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. R.A.Hoey\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 1st instant, File No. 125-1-5, and the question of freight charges of $2.47 charged by J.H.Ashdown Hardware Company on well pumping unit and gasoline engine delivered at Pine Falls, Man., in accordance with Purchase Order #9662, I may say that the quotation of J.H.Ashdown Hardware Company, Winnipeg, dated January 7th, 1939, was definitely $189.95 f.o.b. Pine Falls, Man.\n\nUnder the circumstances the Department is not liable to payment of their account of $2.47 for transportation charges, Winnipeg to Pine Falls.\n\nW.M.Bailey\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 9, 1939.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI am in receipt of your account dated February 14 copy of which I am returning to you together with the freight receipt.\n\nThe Departmental Purchasing Agent states that your quotation dated January 7, 1939, was definitely $189.95 f.o.b. Pine Falls, Manitoba. Under these circumstances payment of the transportation cannot be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nThe J. H. Ashdown Hardware Co.

In addition were competitive prices obtained?\n\nM.J.F.

You may refer for instance to your letter No. 202-11A R.C. of November 30th, 1936, in which you inform me that you are advised by the Department that the question of installing a power line to the school would have to remain in abeyance until spring.\n\nBefore finally deciding the purchase of a new set of batteries, I think that, owing to the present condition of the generator and switchboard, the matter of a transmission line is worth studying as much more efficient and as a permanent light and power installation.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

This amount is prohibitive and unless a considerable deduction can be obtained the Department does not consider it worth while giving this particular matter further consideration. However, the third paragraph of Father Brachet's letter reads as follows:\n\n\"You are likely aware of the fact that there is now installed at Pine Falls an apparatus to distribute in the surrounding district of Tin Town and St. George the electricity coming from Great Falls, which fact would render easier a connecting line to the school.\"\n\nPossibly the power line could be installed at a much lower figure than the amount previously stated. Please make inquiries and let me have any information that you can obtain.\n\nAt the same time you might supply detailed information regarding the type and size of batteries that are in use at this school as it will be possible to supply these if it is decided not to consider the power line.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 125-1-5 dated November 2nd, I wish to report that I have again discussed the question of erecting a transmission line from Pine Falls to the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School with Father Brachet and others, and it is doubtful if the expense of this work can be reduced, in view of the advanced cost of material.\n\nFather Brachet states that it is the opinion of the Rev. Father Provencher that under the circumstances, it would be inadvisable at the present time to request the expenditure of such a large sum and, as an alternative which he believes would be just as satisfactory and probably even less expensive than simply paying for the light, he suggests installing a unit similar to the one installed at Sandy Bay, at approximately $1500.00. Father Provencher points out that, in their experience, a plant of this nature would cost less to operate than charges per month for electricity from a Hydro power line.\n\nThe present lighting plant is a very old type, making it expensive to operate, and exceedingly expensive to buy repairs for. The dynamo and switchboard are in very poor condition. It is possible that the batteries may last another few months. The engine is badly worn and, as pointed out above, expensive to operate in view of the fact that it consumes a large amount of gasoline.\n\nI am convinced that the most economical solution to our problem at this point would be to supply the school with a lighting plant as suggested by the Rev. Father Provencher.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa,\nNovember 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in connection with the lighting system at the Fort Alexander Indian residential school.\n\nAs no provision was made for a new electric lighting plant at this school in the current year's appropriation it is not possible to favourably consider supplying this at the present time. However, when preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41 an endeavour will be made to provide the amount that you recommend.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nMines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn his list of requirements for the Fort Alexander Residential School for the coming budget year, the Principal, Reverend Father J. Brachet asks for a power line from the town of Pine Falls to the School. The estimates supplied for the installation of this line vary from $4,500. to $6,500.\n\nIn a letter which I received yesterday, Father Brachet states that should the Department be unwilling to spend such a large amount, the purchase of a Diesel engine and a new set of batteries would supply the School needs for several years to come. We are therefore offering this alternative to the Department. The power line would naturally solve the lighting and power problems of the School definitely; on the other hand, the cost is quite high and Father Brachet would be satisfied with the Diesel engine and a new set of batteries, as mentioned above.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.-O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nGeneral Superintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The latter, I feel, should receive first consideration if you believe they will be required.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would advise the Department at once through the office of your local Indian Agent regarding the school requirements for the current fiscal year keeping in mind that approximately $800.00 will be all that the Department can consider expending.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

These are found inconvenient owing to the fact that studious pupils are often disturbed by a playful companion, and teachers have repeatedly expressed their wish for single desks.\n\nWe have learned lately with satisfaction that Currie School Equipment Ltd., 604 McIntyre Block, Winnipeg, is exchanging double desks for single ones, and we have invited the manager John E. Currie to come and examine our desks to see how much he would allow for them in an exchange deal. He found them still in good order and is offering $175.00 for the lot.\n\nOur need would be of 6 rows of 7 single desks, 2 rows of size 2, and 4 rows of size 3, each row of course with corresponding rear.\n\nNow in the enclosed folder out of the three types of desks that would suit us we would prefer Style 210 Book Box Single Desks on account of the box which is convenient to keep books in good order. Our next choice would be Style 101, which are in steel, the seat being both strong and noiseless. The third type is Style 10 in east.\n\nThe cost according to the different styles would be as follows:\n\n| Style   | Desks | Size | Net |\n|---------|-------|------|-----|\n| 210     | 14    | 2    | 10.50 | 147.00 |\n|         |       | 3    | 10.25 | 287.00 |\n|         | 2     | Rears| 7.60  | 15.20  |\n|         | 4     |      | 7.60  | 30.40  |\n|         |       |      |       | 479.60 | 304.60 |\n\n| Style   | Desks | Size | Net |\n|---------|-------|------|-----|\n| 101     | 14    | 2    | 9.30 | 130.20 |\n|         |       | 3    | 9.05 | 253.40 |\n|         | 2     | Rears| 8.10 | 16.20 |\n|         | 4     |      | 8.10 | 32.40 |\n|         |       |      |       | 432.20 | 257.20 |\n\n| Style   | Desks | Size | Net |\n|---------|-------|------|-----|\n| 10      | 14    | 2    | 8.80 | 123.20 |\n|         |       | 3    | 8.55 | 239.40 |\n|         | 2     | Rears| 7.60 | 15.20 |\n|         | 4     |      | 7.60 | 30.40 |\n|         |       |      |       | 408.20 | 233.20 |\n\nI would appreciate, dear Sir, if you could help us for more efficient teaching through the exchange of desks, and we await the pleasure of meeting you again.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nR.

Father Brachet:\n\n\"In order to help you in the purchase of the proper batteries for our old plant, I beg to give you the following information. We have 56 Delco Light Exide Ironclad Batteries. The old generator is from Canadian General Electric Co., Volts 125, Amps 56, 7 K.W. It has to be borne in mind that the generator being old, does not give its full charge. This is all the information I am able to give you.\n\nOne point I would stress is that we need the new batteries immediately, for we are wasting uselessly much fuel to obtain a very small electric charge, which does not last. The money could be spent for better purposes in the interest of the school. Furthermore we are facing a total shortness of light any day.\"\n\nI trust the batteries will be purchased without delay.

However, it became evident last fall that the Department could not stand such an expenditure. In the same time experience from other schools where Diesel Engines are used showed that these engines operate at a lower cost.\n\nIn answer to our request for a new lighting unit, in your letter of November 25th, 1939 - 202-11 A.R.C. - 79 advised us as follows:\n\n\"no provision was made for a new electric lighting plant for this school in the current year's appropriation it is not possible to favourably consider supplying this at the present time. However, when preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1940-1941 an endeavour will be made to provide the amount you recommend.\"\n\nSuch was the letter you received from the Department. Still our old lighting plant could not stand the test of time, and when we received during the holidays a new set of batteries from the Department, we thought it was time to get a new lighting plant, so as not to be short of light and power during winter, and after giving advice to the Department through Rev. Father Pleurde, our Provincial Rev. Fauteux, O.M.I., purchased from Mumford Medland Ltd., Ipswich, 10 H.P. Lister Diesel Engine, with 6 K.W. Generator Switchboard, for the sum of $947.00, which some Brothers installed free of charge.\n\nThe unit is giving full satisfaction. It costs less per hour to operate, whereas the old one was consuming more.\n\nWe hope the Department will understand that we cannot wait until next fall, but must find the way in due time to endorse what could not be put off any more.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nThe enclosed letter has just been received from the Rev. Father Brachet.\n\nThe old lighting plant was in poor condition. The engine had been in use for many years and was obsolete and expensive to operate. The switchboard was rebuilt time and again but never satisfactorily, and one never knew what charge the batteries were receiving.\n\nI am sure the Rev. Father Brachet would not have made this purchase had he not been fully convinced that he could not get through another winter. There was also the danger of destroying the new set of expensive batteries because of the switchboard.\n\nI know funds are difficult to get, but would recommend that I be given authority to voucher for the payment of this unit. This is an exceptionally well operated school and deserving of this consideration. I would be pleased to receive the Department's favourable approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 23, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant enclosing letter received from the Principal of the Fort Alexander Residential School in which he reports that he has purchased a new lighting plant.\n\nThe Principal of this school should be aware that before making any purchases for which he desires this Department to pay our authority should first be secured. The Rev. Principal must be aware of the purchasing regulations and his action in securing the lighting plant without any reference to this office, and at the same time requesting us to pay the account, is absolutely contrary to all instructions that have been issued to Principals of all residential schools.\n\nThe action taken in this regard has been very carefully considered and in view of the fact that the lighting plant was apparently necessary I am prepared to recommend to the Minister the payment of an amount of $500.00 toward the cost of this plant. In making this offer it should be distinctly understood that this is not to be considered an exception to the instructions mentioned in the second paragraph of this letter.\n\nThe Principal should forward a receipted account from Mumford Medland Limited and when I have this I will recommend to the Minister that an amount of $500.00 be allowed toward its cost. I cannot definitely promise that this payment will be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR.A.

I am by no means certain that we can have these accounts passed for payment. In any case I return the account of the Dufault Sheet Metal & Retinning Co. Before this account can even be considered it will be necessary to have detailed information supplied with regard to the quantities of corrugated iron supplied and the price per unit.\n\nYou should again point out to the Principal that expenditures for which the Department is expected to pay should not be made without first corresponding with this Branch through the office of the local Indian Agent. As intimated above, the procedure followed by the Principal of the Fort Alexander School is simply going to cause us a great deal of trouble and inconvenience which could easily be avoided if he would only follow the instructions that have been issued to him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.O. Picurde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSelkirk, Man., October 30, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 16th, File 125-1-5, relative to repairs to the Fort Alexander Residential School.\n\nI am very sorry that I was unable to answer this letter sooner as the roads were impassable on the Reserve. It was impossible to travel on the Reserve until the end of last week. Father Brachet informs me that Father Flourde has the accounts and is forwarding them to the Department. This work has been done without my knowledge and from my interview with Father Brachet, I considered that he had the Department's permission to have the work done.\n\nTrusting that this is the information you require, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A.

He informed us that he had the children, the Sisters and all the staff carrying water and assisting in putting the fire out. I cannot understand how they managed to put the fire out and save the school, for the fire started on the ground floor and spread through the building to the roof.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Inspector Hamilton's report on the Fort Alexander Residential School visited on October 22, 1941.\n\nA fire recently occurred between the laundry and bakery. It took several hours of hard fighting by all the pupils and staff to save the school. The laundry roof and walls were badly damaged. The Principal started repair work at once and the work was almost completed when I was there. The expense involved will probably reach $300.00. The fire extinguishers were all emptied and refills have been purchased. I am convinced the school was saved from total destruction only by hard fighting well directed by the Principal.\n\nThe kitchen floor is cement. The kitchen work is heavy and the Sisters are on their feet from early morning until late at night, and this type of floor makes the work very hard and trying. I would recommend that the floor be covered with battleship linoleum, and the cost as given by Eaton's for the linoleum and cement is $142.25, f.o.b. Pine Falls. If possible, this should be granted.\n| Item Description                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Doz Guardene Soda & Acid Recharges       | 1        | $8.16      | $8.16 |\n| Only \"Pyrene\" Refills for #33            | 6        | $9.66      | $57.96|\n\nUrgent purchase after fire.\nPrices fair & just.\nCertified OK.\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nCOPY\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** J.

Hoey\n\nI beg to acknowledge yours of November 1 regarding invoices which I forwarded to you a few weeks ago for materials purchased by the Principal of the Fort Alexander Indian Res. School.\n\nIt is evident that in making these purchases the Principal went beyond the authority generally granted to School Principals. The only excuse that can be invoked in his favour is that these repairs were of an urgent nature. It had been hoped that they could be postponed until 1942 as the school itself was in need of fairly substantial repairs. However, at the last minute Father Brachet, who as you know is a very conscientious and able administrator, thought that if the machinery shed was not repaired immediately, it might collapse completely and entail later on a much larger expenditure for rebuilding. As for the addition to the farm instructor's home, that also was unexpected and necessary, because he got married on short notice and proper accommodation had to be provided for him.\n\nIn view of the fact that Father Brachet paid all the labour in connection with these repairs, and that the assets of the school which is Government property have increased by that much, you will wish to pay all the accounts. I am enclosing the Dufault Sheet Metal account with the necessary detailed information. Thanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-5, part 9)\nOttawa, November 26, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nCertain accounts have been submitted to this Branch for payment in connection with repairs to the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School. Upon making enquiry it was found that a fire occurred there some weeks ago and that the accounts submitted covered the material purchased to cover the damage.\n\nWe do not appear to have received any previous report regarding this fire, and I would like to have complete information regarding it and also your opinion regarding the repairs that have been made since that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n528 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nDear Sir:\n\nI acknowledge your letter 125-1-5 dated November 26th regarding the fire which occurred at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nI inspected this school on October 22 and submitted my report on November 8. I now quote from that report as follows:\n\n\"A fire recently occurred between the laundry and bakery. It took several hours of hard fighting by all pupils and staff to save the school. The laundry roof and walls were badly damaged. The principal started repair work at once and the work was almost completed when I was there. The expense involved will probably reach $300.00. The fire extinguishers were all emptied and refills have been purchased. I am convinced the school was saved from total destruction only by hard fighting well directed by the principal.\"\n\nOn November 5 Mr. E. McPherson submitted his monthly report and made reference to the school fire as follows:\n\n\"On our visit to the Residential School, Father Brachet informed us that a few days before we arrived there he had a very bad fire which started in the laundry room of the school. He informed us that he had the children, the Sisters and all the staff carrying water and assisting in putting the fire out. I cannot understand how they managed to put the fire out and save the school, for the fire started on the ground floor and spread through the building to the roof.\"\n\nAs stated in my report, the repairs were almost completed at the time of my visit, but undoubtedly involved considerable expense both in material and labor. The walls of the laundry were badly burned, as also was the roof, and after looking over the damage carefully I wondered how the fire was brought under control. Father Brachet stated that fortunately there was no wind; otherwise I fear the school would have been destroyed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

This pipe, it is true, was surrounded in the wall by 1\u00bd ft. square of bricks, and these bricks on examination after the fire did not appear to be loosened. However, the pipe, which became quite heated at times, may have heated or burnt the surrounding bricks to the point of setting fire to some dust or spider's web above. Any way the fire made its way very rapidly through the wall upwards, setting all the top of the laundry in smoke and flames, which we took two hours to extinguish. Besides the united effort of all the staff and senior pupils, what saved the school itself from burning to ashes, was a rubber hose, which we use for the boys and girls' skating rink.\n\nOne linen fire hose in the laundry downstairs gave no service, for it was pierced in spots, being too old. When Mr. Hamilton came, I suggested that he should kindly ask the Department to supply us with 50 ft. of Linen Mill Fire Hose, Dia. inside 1\u00be\". I do not know if he mentioned this need of ours in his report. Up to date, however, we did not receive any hose. I wish you would kindly obtain it for us.\n\nNow to prevent a recurrence of the fire in the same spot, we have built in the wall a square of strongly cemented bricks of about 2\u00bd ft. square with a circular opening of one foot, so that the oven pipe cannot possibly touch or heat anywhere. This opening of one foot in diameter serves as a ventilator as well, as the bakery is quite hot at times.\n\nIn the same time we have set and repaired the oven, so there can be no danger coming from it, whether the staff is there or not.\n\nTrusting this is the information you desire,\n\nI remain, dear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev.

Principal:\n\n\"Regarding the cause of fire, which occurred between the bakery and the laundry on October 7th at 1:35 p.m., I beg to say that apparently it was due to a pipe which passed through the wall of the bakery, connecting the oven to the chimney in the laundry. This pipe, it is true, was surrounded in the wall by 1 ft. square of bricks, and these bricks on examination after the fire did not appear to be loosened. However, the pipe, which becomes quite heated at times, may have heated in turn the surrounding bricks to the point of setting fire to some dust or spider's web above. Anyway the fire made its way very rapidly through the wall upwards, setting all the top of the laundry in smoke and flames, which we took two hours to extinguish. Besides the united effort of all the staff and senior pupils, what saved the school itself from burning to ashes, was a rubber hose, which we use for the boys' and girls' skating rink.\n\n\"How to prevent a recurrence of the fire in the same spot, we have built in the wall a square of strongly cemented bricks of about 8 ft. square with a circular opening of one foot, so that the oven pipe cannot possibly touch or heat anywhere. This opening of one foot in diameter serves as a ventilator as well, as the bakery is quite hot at times.\"\n\"In the same time we have set and repaired the oven, so there can be no danger coming from it, whether the staff is there or not.\"\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McGill\n\nI have your memorandum of the 3rd instant, File No. 125-1-5, quoting an extract from a report received from the Principal of the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, explaining the cause of the fire which occurred in the school building in October last. It would seem that we were somewhat fortunate in that the fire did not do more damage than it did.\n\nIn view of the possibility of fire occurring in other schools in the same manner, might it not be well to send a circular letter to all Principals of Residential Schools suggesting that they should regularly examine into all possibilities of danger from fire. The danger which existed for many years at the Fort Alexander school is apparently now being prevented at very little expense and the damage that was caused by the fire could have been prevented if this work had been done before the fire occurred.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, February 11, 1942.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 26, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith reference to Mr. Jackson's memorandum of February 11, in connection with the fire at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, I attach, for your information, a copy of the circular letter which is being issued to all Indian residential schools.\n\nA similar circular letter regarding the same subject was forwarded to all Indian residential schools in the fall of 1939.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\n**MONTHLY STATEMENT**\n\n**WINNIPEG**, Nov. 30, 1941\n\nFort Alexander Indian School,\nFort Alexander,\nMAN.\n\n| DATE     | DEBITS | CREDITS | BALANCE |\n|----------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Nov. 19  | 47.60  |         | 47.60   |\n\nDecember 31st. is the close of our financial year.

(RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is becoming quite a task to find suitable employees to work for our residential schools. When a good one can be hired, who will not likely be called for military service, it is wise, I think, to give him and his family the minimum comfort, in order to interest him to his work and make him stay.\n\nOne of our employees left us late last fall and we found a sickly, but willing man with a family of six children, who shall be joined by another one soon. Our former employee was alone with his wife, and the little cottage they were living in here, was plenty large enough for them. The cottage is far from being spacious enough for this larger family, and our new man was ready to leave unless we would build an addition immediately this spring.\n\nI thought the best and only policy was, with the permission of our Provincial, to purchase at once the necessary material for an addition and to build it ourselves as soon as possible. We have consequently bought from The Russo Lumber Co., Ltd., St. Boniface, Man., some building material to the amount of $411.60, and we are going to start digging a cellar and foundation likely this week. Later there will be few other items to buy yet, such as paint.\n\nWe would far rather wait for the due authorization from the Department for such improvements, but you realize that it is generally a slow and uncertain process. Even if the permission is granted, before the material is bought by the Department, winter often close by.\n\nI presume it is the intention of the Department to keep our schools running as efficiently as possible during these trying times. It is the reason of our decision regarding the addition for our employee's house.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Supt., Indian Welf. & Training,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\n125-1-5\n\nJUNE 11 1948\n\nREV H BRACHT O M I\nPRINCIPAL\nFORT ALEXANDER INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nPINE FALLS MAN\n\nREFERENCE YOURS TENTH INSTANT SUSPEND ALL WORK REGARDING\nFARMER'S DWELLING PENDING RECEIPT DEPARTMENTAL LETTER\n\nR A HOEY\n\nCharge: Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-5, part 9)\nOttawa, June 11, 1942.\n\nDear Father Brachet:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 10, in which you discuss the urgent need of a building suitable for living quarters for the farming instructor employed at your school.\n\nI was greatly disturbed to note that you had already bought from the Cusson Lumber Company, Limited, of St. Boniface, building material at a cost of $411.80. No provision was made in the estimates of this year for the construction of a home for a farming instructor at the Fort Alexander School, and consequently it will not be possible for us to make this payment.\n\nUnder existing regulations - and these regulations have been in force for a number of years - no official of the Department and no principal of an Indian residential school can commit the Government to an expenditure unless authorized to do so from the head office. In the case of an emergency, certain field officials are allowed to incur expenditures not to exceed $25.00 in any given case. If we had in this year's estimates sufficient funds to meet this particular expenditure, we have no assurance whatever that the expenditure itself would be recognized by the office of the Minister or by the audit office.\n\nI am anxious that you should inspect and consider the suitability of the buildings on the Fort Alexander Reserve purchased by the Government about a year ago. If these buildings are suitable for the purpose-\n\nReverend J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls, Manitoba.\npurpose you have in mind, they might be placed at the disposal of the farming instructor, without rent, on the understanding that he might give a certain amount of nominal direction to the Indians in their farming operations. It is just possible, also, that if the storage space was taken over, this man might act as ration distributor.\n\nI am sending forward a copy of this letter to Inspector Hamilton, in the hope that he will find it convenient to discuss this matter with you at an early date. Regardless of the suitability of these buildings, however, you simply cannot proceed with the construction of a farming instructor's home in connection with the school unless you are prepared to pay the cost of this building from school funds.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nCOPY SENT TO INSPECTOR HAMILTON\nOttawa,\nJune 18, 1942.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $900.00 is available for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Fort Alexander Residential School. You should discuss this matter with the Principal as soon as possible and let me have your recommendations regarding the best manner in which this amount should be expended.\n\nDue to present conditions it is most important that we hear from you at the earliest possible date. As you are aware, it is extremely difficult to obtain deliveries on many items and, therefore, the sooner the order is placed the better for all parties concerned.\n\nRecently we received a letter from the Principal requesting us to approve an expenditure of $411.60 for material which he had purchased for the erection of a farmer's cottage. For your information, I attach a copy of our letter to the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls P.O., Man.,\nJune 30th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nBefore answering your letter of the 11th inst., I waited to have occasion to discuss the matter with Rev. Father Plourde and with Mr. Hamilton, Inspector. I saw Father Plourde; as for Mr. Hamilton, he was away when I called at his office.\n\nFirst of all I wish to thank you for putting at our disposal the buildings recently purchased from the Hudson's Bay Co. at Fort Alexander. These buildings are one mile away from the school. They might be useful, should one young employee we have wish to be married. As we have no other building available, the H.B.C. buildings could then be used temporarily. The question now of interest is a small bungalow which I built in 1936 on my arrival, and to which we want to set an addition. This addition was not necessary, when a family consisted only of two. Now that there is a family of eight, it is certainly too small. The reason I wrote you about our plans was not really to try and bind the Department, but to inform you of my efforts to better the school and buildings year after year, as our means permit and as circumstances oblige us.\n\nFather Plourde told me he had written you also about this question.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\nSelkirk, Man., July 10, 1942\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 15th, File 125-1-5, relative to repairs to the Fort Alexander Residential School.\n\nI have interviewed Father Brachet and he informed me that he did not ask the Department to pay for the building material for the farming instructor's house at the Fort Alexander Residential School. However, if the Department is prepared to allow them a few hundred dollars to assist them in this matter, he said it would be greatly appreciated. I inquired if there was any other repair work that required to be done at the School and he said that there was nothing that he knew of. I did not inform him that there was $300.00 available for repairs to this school.\n\nIn regard to the Department's buildings at the old Hudson's Bay Post, he informed me that they might be able to use them and that he would advise me regarding this at a later date. The school now has two farm instructors, one a single man and the other a married man with a family of eight. The Father informs me that the single man is talking of getting married and if he does they will want to take over our buildings. I would suggest that we hold the $300.00 for repairing our own buildings for they will certainly need repairs if they are to be used.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. Macpherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A.

I had also Mr. Roey informed through Father Plourde of Ottawa.\n\nThe enclosed report in duplicate from the Manager of the Globelite Batteries Ltd., Winnipeg, after the inspection of its Superintendent, states that a replacement is immediately required, and that the proper size we need is their\n\n56 cell Type WEI, ampere hour capacity of 450, which they quote at $712.25 f.o.b. Winnipeg. (Special price)\n\nThe Superintendent told us here that, considering the load, the battery set has lasted longer than could be expected, that it would be a waste to purchase the same type of battery, that they have many orders ahead and it would likely take about two months to have the battery set ready.\n\nThis matter being of urgent need, I would ask you to kindly bring it at once to the attention of the Department so that they may press the Globelite Batteries Ltd. to supply us as soon as possible with the type of Battery required.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal.\n\nE. McPherson, Indian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPINE FALLS P.O., Manitoba.\n\nAttention: Rev. J. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal\n\nDear Reverend Brachet:\n\nInspection made a few days ago by our Superintendent, Mr. Stuart, now confi-\nrmed that replacement of your present Electric Light Plant battery is immediately requi-\nred in order to enable you to continue efficient operation of your Electric Light Plant.\n\nYou, no doubt, are aware that your present battery is too small for your electri-\ncal requirements, which has necessitated recharging too frequently. This has reduced\nthe life of the battery considerably. After all, the life of any battery is measured\nin cycles, that is the number of times it is charged and discharged (one complete charge\nand discharge constitutes a cycle). Further, the average life of an Electric Light Plant\nbattery is 600 cycles.\n\nAlthough you did not receive the service in life years claimed for your present batter-\nies, nevertheless we feel satisfied that the battery has completed its rated number of\ncycles, and therefore the guarantee becomes void. However, in your particular case,\nwe are quite prepared to deviate from our usual policy and taking into consideration the\nshorter life obtained with this battery, we would like to offer some compensation by\nplacing your present battery with one of proper size, namely our 56 cell Type H/L,\nhaving an ampere-hour capacity of 450. As an adjustment, we are pleased to quote you\na net price of $712.85, F.O.B. Winnipeg, on this recommended size. (Regular price $930)\n\nFurther, should our offer be accepted, the old battery will automatically become\nyour property and the return of same is requested. We will bear return freight charges.\n\nTrusting that you will find our offer satisfactory cooperation and service at all times, we are,\n\nYours,\n\nGLOBELITE\n\nMar\n\nWESTERN CANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing herewith letters from Father Brachet and The Globlite Batteries Ltd re the batteries at the Fort Alexander Residential School.

Globelite batteries bought on July 2nd, 1940, as per purchase order #2624. The present set has lasted a little over 4\u00bd years although guaranteed to last 7 years if not overloaded. We note that you are now asking for a much more powerful set - 450 A.H. type W21.\n\nBefore ordering this type W.21 set, it is desirable that we be furnished with information regarding the average daily watt hour consumption - or the number of lights, wattage of lamps, and a list of the laundry equipment, refrigerators, and other electric equipment operated from the batteries.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nWMV/HC\nOttawa, February 20, 1945.\n\nMr. E.

This request was submitted to our Purchasing Branch, who have asked for additional information. A copy of the memorandum which we have received from them is enclosed, and it would be appreciated if you would supply the information requested in the second paragraph of their letter, at the earliest possible date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nIn reply to your letter 125-1-5 of Feb 20/45 I am enclosing a copy of a letter received from Father Brachet giving the information required for replacing the batteries at Fort Alexander Residential School.\n\nE.

We obtained from the Manitoba Paper Co., Pine Falls, the service of their specialist in Diesel Engines. He stated that a complete overhaul was necessary. So on December 28th we shipped the engine to Mumford, Medland, Limited, Winnipeg, from whom it was purchased.\n\nWe would have liked to ship it sooner, but our men with many others hired at high wages were busy day and night digging through frozen ground from 8 to 12 feet deep in order to reach the water pipe, which suddenly went out of order. We found out that with the heavy and continuous rains of last year the bank had slided imperceptibly, with the aid of storms which raised the river level 4 ft., the waves carrying much earth away, and the pipes had broken at some joints.\n\nWe do not intend to present to the Department the accounts for this heavy expenditure incurred at a time when the cold was biting and men all busy at their winter occupations. But we enclose in quadruplicate the account covering the repairs on the Diesel Engine, the amount being \u00a3149.13. - There are other side accounts which I have paid myself and which I shall not present.\n\nHad we foreseen such expenditure we would have communicated with the Department, but this was a case of emergency, and the Engine produces our light and operates the water pump, without any substitute (except a 3 H.P. Engine, which may be set for pumping, but which was not in order at the time, parts having been ordered three months before and having not been obtained yet).\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.

We obtained from the Manitoba Paper Co., Pine Falls, the service of their specialist in Diesel Engines. He stated that a complete overhaul was necessary. So on December 28th we shipped the engine to Mumford, Medland, Limited, Winnipeg, from whom it was purchased.\n\nWe would have liked to ship it sooner, but our men with many others hired at high wages were busy day and night digging through frozen ground from 8 to 12 feet deep in order to reach the water pipe, which suddenly went out of order. We found out that with the heavy and continuous rains of last year the bank had slided imperceptibly, with the aid of storms which raised the river level 4 ft., the waves carrying much earth away, and the pipes had broken at some joints.\n\nWe do not intend to present to the Department the accounts for this heavy expenditure incurred at a time when the cold was biting and men all busy at their winter occupations. But we enclose in quadruplicate the account covering the repairs on the Diesel Engine, the amount being $149.15.- There are other side accounts which I have paid myself and which I shall not present.\n\nHad we foreseen such expenditure we would have communicated with the Department, but this was a case of emergency, and the Engine produces our light and operates the water pump, without any substitute (except a 3 H.P. Engine, which may be set for pumping, but which was not in order at the time, parts having been ordered three months before and having not been obtained yet).\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.) Rev. J.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, 538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Man., dated October 30, 1945.\n\nFort Alexander Residential School\n\nThe dormitories are on the top floor. In case of fire the children must use the inside stairways or slip out onto balconies and descend by sliding down a pole. One pole must be 18' long and for little children to grasp this and step out into space is unsatisfactory. Some children are afraid; then too some drop too quickly and in case of a fire might easily be hurt when landing. I also noticed that the poles, although perhaps secure, wobble and give the appearance of being insecure. I would definitely recommend that the poles be removed and that stairways or some other type of fire escape be erected. This is an old school where, if a fire got started, I doubt if it could be checked; therefore the best and safest fire escapes are required. The fire hose appear in good condition and extinguishers and axes are kept at convenient points throughout the building.\nOttawa, 9th November, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to his inspection of Fort Alexander Residential School, Inspector Hamilton writes as follows:\n\n\"The dormitories are on the top floor.

Possibly you could arrange to have the poles made more secure. I presume that the pupils practice fire drill regularly and if so, past experience shows that if this is done the pupils usually become accustomed to pole type of fire escape.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Phelan.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIn a recent letter from the above school, the Principal, Reverend Father J. Brachet, O.M.I., requests two sewing machines to replace two machines so badly worn out that they cannot be repaired. He desires that these machines be of the new kind with the back-stitch feature.\n\nIn the same letter, the Principal informs me that there has been a landslide at the intake point of the waterpipe in the river and he has had to spend a little over $500.00 to have it repaired. As this work had to be done in a hurry, he was unable to consult your agent who, as you may know, has his office in Selkirk, Manitoba. He will shortly send me the details of this work and I hope that you will be able to reimburse him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nS.O.

McPherson, Indian Agent,\nSelkirk, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, enclosing Fire Inspection Report on the Fort Alexander Residential School.\n\nWith reference to page 2 of the report, the following matters should be brought to the attention of the Principal, with a view to having the school staff take the necessary action:\n\n1. Clean, remove and keep oil and grease from accumulating around gasoline motor in laundry.\n\n2. Boiler room door and frame to be covered with metal on the boiler room side and made self-closing.\n\n3. Both doors and frames from boiler room next to laundry to be metal clad on the boiler room side. Said doors to be tight-fitting and self-closing.\n\n4. It is also recommended that regular fire drill be held once a month, having regard to the weather.\n\nAs stated in the report, we have a pole type of fire escape on this building. We are not prepared to make any change at the present time. The children should be carefully drilled regarding the method of using the fire escape.\n\nThe following recommendation, made by the Inspector,\n\n...... should be\nshould be considered further:\n\nThere being no fire stops or cut-offs between the second and third floors, it is recommended that a fire resistive partition be constructed, equipped with a fire resistive door and frame, either at the bottom or top of the stairways - second floor to third floor. Doors to be self-closing. If glazed, same to be of wire glass in metal frames.\n\nYou might let me know what expenditure would be involved in carrying out the above recommendation.\n\nBernard F.

We intend to put on the water pipe line only some moss, which we shall go and gather in the bush this fall at our own expense. Some snow fences will help some safe covering. Being thus lightly covered the pipes should not break any more.\n\nThe second triplicate vouchers cover work done on the sewers, which bust on account of the slide. We do not include the cost of cement, gravel and sand.\n\nFather M. Lavigne, provincial, had called some officials to come and inspect the trouble and take the direction of the work. But as none came and as there was danger of typhoid fever, we had to proceed with the work. Brother P. Lefaille helped us much with his experience.\n\nFirst vouchers $235.68\n\nSecond \" 199.60\n\nWe would appreciate if these vouchers would be paid, for this year I had to buy a new tractor and I also added 64 acres to the school farm out of the bush at great expense.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 5 Sept.    | To Labourers as per receipted Paylists attached: |        |\n|            | Weeks ending June 8th/46 & June 16th/46      |        |\n|            | and June 29th/46                             | 233.65 |\n|            | Weeks ending July 6th/46 & July 15th/46      | 199.60 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

I also attach a copy of a letter from the Reverend Father Brachet, which fully explains that this was emergency work. The river bank is continually breaking away and at different times during the past ten years there has been expense for similar work. I would recommend that we secure the services of someone from the Surveys and Engineering Branch, with a view toward having a retaining wall built which would be permanent. We would then eliminate these periodic repair bills which usually entail heavy expense.\n\nThe work undoubtedly was necessary and the rate of pay reasonable. I recommend the account be paid. You will note there is still work to do in securing moss and erecting snow fences, all of which the Reverend Principal states he is prepared to do without further cost to the Department.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls, Man.,\nSept. 11, 1946.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe 125-1-5 W T 1 Ottawa Aug. 8/46.\n\nWith reference to the suggestions given by Mr. Neary regarding the Fire Inspection Report, I beg to submit the following observations:\n\n1. Oil and grease around gasoline motor in laundry.\n   This motor, being very old, throws oil around, and we have to wait till all the washing is done to clean the oil and grease.\n\n2. Boiler room door and frame to be covered with metal on the boiler room side, and made self-closing.\n   If the Department can secure for us some thick metal, together with the door lock, we will be ready to install them.\n\n3. Both doors and frames from boiler room next to laundry to be metal clad on the boiler room side. Said doors to be tight fitting and self-closing.\n   If the Department can procure some thick metal, and locks, for both doors, we will install them.\n\n4. Fire drill once a month. We have drills oftener.\n\nFire-resistive partitions as cut-offs between the second and third floor.\n   These partitions, to my estimation, would render the staircases much darker, and could not be so very effective in a frame building, where fires generally go up between the walls from one story to the other in no time.\n\nThe main object to consider is the safe and speedy evacuation of pupils in case of fire.\n   Our present system of fire escape is not adequate.\n   Mr. Hamilton, Inspector, wrote last fall to the Department, but Mr. Phelan stated that no changes could be made.\n   The Fire Commissioner also noted the inadequacy in his report, but again no change can be made at the present time.\n   This pole system during the night in bad weather would not be safe especially one pole that is so high, going from the dormitory to the ground (through 2 stories).\n   I would not be in favour of wooden stair cases outside, as in winter they would be icy and slippery.\n   The best system would be a chute escape of the type that they have in some day schools of Winnipeg. This system is safe and speedy, especially for smaller children.\n   I wish we could obtain at least one chute escape to replace the long pipe, of which the children are afraid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal\n\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI would refer to Dept letter 125-1-5 WT 1 of Aug 6/46 re the fire inspection report on the Fort Alexander Residential School.\n\nWhen at this Reserve recently I went into this matter with Rev Brachet, Principal of the school and now enclose a copy of a letter received from him on this subject.\n\nI might say that I agree with Rev Brachet on the question of the pole fire escape from the dormitory and in my opinion it would be almost impossible to evacuate a number of small children during a night fire without accidents by this method.\n\nAt the time I was there I was not able to get an estimate of the cost of the alterations suggested but will do so at first opportunity.\n\nF.

(RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Fort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your marginal notation of June 4th on a memorandum from the Director of Indian Affairs dated May 30th last, in which the desire is expressed to have a cylindrical steel chute fire escape erected at the above school to replace a pole type fire escape, you are advised as follows:\n\nSince our letter of October 3rd, 1946, quoting an estimated sum of $800.00 for supply and installation of a cylindrical chute type of fire escape, the cost of materials and labour have so risen as to make this type of construction uneconomical.\n\nA modern straight slide escape, provided space permits, or standard steel fire escape would provide adequate exit accommodation with access to the ground and either type can be recommended.\n\nAs the Indian Affairs record plans and drawings available in this office do not clearly indicate storey heights, window openings, and distance above floors of same, it will be necessary, in order to comply with the requirements of the National Building Code regarding exits and fire escapes, that measurements be obtained on the site by an officer from Winnipeg.\n\nWe are therefore requesting Mr. Gow to make arrangements to obtain the necessary data for our information.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch should be advised of the action we are taking, and that with the existing condition of the construction industry, there can be no assurance that Mr. Gow will be able to obtain tenders for the work.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-5, part 9)\nJuly 24, 1947.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRef: Fort Alexander Indian Residential School - Pine Falls, Manitoba.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of June 18, we are now in receipt of plans of the above school prepared from measurements taken on the site by Mr. W.H. Wallace with Mr. Persooge of Mr. Gow's staff.\n\nFrom the Indian Affairs record drawings available in this office, we were under the impression that the building was a brick structure, and accordingly recommended metal fire escapes. From the information now to hand, the school is of frame construction on masonry foundations, and four pole type fire escapes are shown on the building, two on the rear wall and one each on end walls.\n\nUnder these circumstances, an outside enclosed stairway of wood frame construction, leading to the ground and having exit doors equipped with panic bolts would provide cover from the elements and prevent entry from the outside by unauthorized persons. This type of fire escape serving a wood frame building complies with the requirements of the National Building Code for structures of this nature and height.\n\nTwo fire escapes of this type should replace the two pole type escapes on the rear wall of the school. The two end pole escapes are somewhat more difficult to replace and would necessitate alterations to enclosed verandah and stairs to main floor open verandahs.\n\nSome difficulty has been experienced in the past in getting contractors to quote a reasonable price for the erection of iron fire escapes at outlying schools. Similar difficulty should not be encountered in a wood frame escape and the cost should be considerably reduced. Our estimate of the cost of two wood frame enclosed stairs is in the neighborhood of $2,500.00 and an additional $1,000.00 to replace end pole escapes, a total of $3,500.00. As a comparison the estimated cost of two iron fire escapes on the rear wall is $4,000.00.\n\nIf the above proposal meets with approval, we shall be pleased to proceed with the preparation of drawings and specifications as soon thereafter as staff can be assigned.\n\nT.S.

M. Wardle\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, August 6th, 1947.\n\nDear Father Brachet:-\n\nWith reference to our interview of some weeks ago, I would appreciate it if you would let me know if you have interviewed the Manitoba Hydro Commission with reference to extending the power line from Pine Falls to the Fort Alexander School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

So you may imagine that, as soon as I came back from Ottawa with the assurance that a goodly sum was set aside for the purpose, I lost no time to get in touch with K. C. Ferguson, Superintendent of Water Power, Winnipeg Electric Co., Great Falls, Man.\n\nI went three times to Great Falls to see him, being able to see him the third time, and I wrote to him on June 5th. Finally he came here to examine the situation.\n\nThe conclusion is that the Winnipeg Electric would no doubt be willing to project a line from Pine Falls to Fort Alexander, but that, at the present time, they have much difficulty in obtaining the necessary material for the numerous contracts, without mentioning the shortage of men. Therefore, up to now, I have not been able to obtain any definite stand.\n\nHowever, I am glad to have received your inquiry of the 5th inst., and I will communicate again with the Winnipeg Electric Co., in order to have some clear decision for the future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls, Man.,\nAug. 19, 1947.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to your kind letter of the 6th inst. and to my answer of yesterday, I beg to state that Mr. Olson, Indian Agent, who came to see me today, has obtained from the Winnipeg Electric Co., at the Winnipeg Office, the assurance that sufficient material is now available so that the Company may be able to install the power transmission line some time this fall. The Indian Agent informed me that he is to write a full report to the Department on the subject.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nBernard F.

Pine Falls.\n\nThis report deals with the proposed Power Transmission Line and pending installation of same by Winnipeg Electric Co., at an early date for Fort Alexander Indian Reserve at Pine Falls, Manitoba.\n\nApparently this important development has been a live issue since 1938 when a survey conducted by Winnipeg Electric Company indicated this project could be effected at an approximate expenditure of $6000.00. For some time thereafter this was not approved for execution, and obviously during the war years lay dormant for apparent reasons.\n\nNow I am informed by Father Brachet, Principal of R.C. Residential School, Fort Alexander that this was discussed by him personally with some Departmental Officials at Ottawa and a favorable consideration is pending.\n\nInspector Hamilton delegated the writer to explore status of this venture with the Winnipeg Electric Co., and report further.\n\nMr. Merritt, Assistant Manager, Electric Sales, Winnipeg Electric Company was interviewed and he informs me that his Company is now in a position to fulfill this program, and if all factors required are complied with that all installations could be completed before freeze-up this fall.\n\nCompany requirements are as follows:\n\n1. A petition from Residential School and potential users of electric service to Company at Winnipeg.\n\n2. A meeting of Chief and Council approving development on Reserve.\n3. Departmental (Indian Affairs Branch) approval along with #2.\n\n4. Authority to install power line along highway for lessened installation costs to Indian homes which border on highway.\n\n5. Company requires right of way for repairs of line.\n\n6. Original cost estimate 1938 basis of $6000.00 likely to increase by some 30% to 50% today. Electric Company to stand some unspecified expense or amount depending on business possibilities.\n\n7. Company will make new survey re engineering problems, installation, etc., also survey all potential users for electric service at own expense.\n\n8. If foregoing satisfactory they will forthwith proceed, and assume complete installation of transmission line could be accomplished this fall and installation to home users to follow immediately.\n\nVisiting Fort Alexander Reserve I contacted Councillors Paul Courchene and John Moirisseau both of whom are most favorable, in fact, enthusiastic about development. Several band members seen and all likewise in accord. Needless to say Father Brachet was delighted and immediately undertook to obtain petition to Company on behalf of users.\n\nIt seems indicated that costs will approximate eight to nine thousand dollars today. I am assuming the appropriation for this development was discussed with B.F. Neary, Supt., of Welfare and Training.\n\nPersonally I would strongly urge the favorable consideration of this meritorious development. The far reaching benefits accruing, especially re obtaining electric refrigeration for food is of prime importance. The band members have been hoping for this for years and the residential school would so greatly benefit. I think this development a great forward step and unhesitatingly recommend its approval.\n\nI respectfully request your comments at an early date as to proposed action on this matter.\n\nB.E.

I do\nnot know the results of this Survey at present as I interviewed\nMr. Gilman, Vice-President and General Manager all Electric\noperations of the Company just after he had issued instructions\nto have this done. Actually I have been waiting to receive\nword from Ottawa as to what your attitude to this matter\nwould be before contacting the Winnipeg Electric Co., again.\nIn any event I think that it would be correct to indicate\nthat at this late date no installation of power transmission\nline would be executed before next spring. Mr. Gilman did say that\nunless they could do so before bad weather arrived that it\nwould be less expensive to install in spring.\n\nAside from above the situation rests much\nthe same as reported August 21st.

Olson, Indian Agent,\nSelkirk.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYesterday three men of the Winnipeg Electric Co. came from Great Falls to measure the length of the road, together with the number of curves, starting at the Pine Falls Hydro line on this side of the railroad track coming this way to Fort Alexander. When they reached Chief John Thompson's place, he stopped them and sent them back, telling them that white people had no business to come to the reserve without his permission and insulting them heavily.\n\nBefore returning, they came to consult me. I told them to proceed, but they did not dare until I brought the Chief to reason, which took quite a time.\n\nI told him that this was only a survey for a report to the Indian Affairs Branch, which is interested in supplying electricity for the two schools, that he could hardly stop this improvement for the two government schools, that the Indians did not have to take this convenience unless they really wished to have it. For him the government or anybody else has no right to step on the reserve, that an exorbitant price would have to be paid for the use of the land regarding the poles, that the Indians would not be fooled any more as they had been by the Manitoba Paper Co., that the two schools were no good as they had failed to form any one for a high public office, that the Indians were all against the use of electricity, telephone, etc... First he did not want to speak to me at all as I had not told him beforehand that these men were coming, but finally he agreed to let them finish their work.\n\nThe foreman was quite upset about it, and though quite big, he felt all shaken. I thought they would not come any more, but they were here today, although the road was wet with rain, and they must have finished their work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal.\nSelkirk, Man.\nOctober 11th, 1947\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRE: Power Transmission Line\nFort Alexander I.R., Pine Falls, Man.\n\nFurther to yours of October 6th, file Ref. 21125-4(WT/1)\nand 125-1-5.\n\nAs indicated in second paragraph of your letter\nit was very gratifying to learn that right of way for\ntransmission line is assured under lease 360, shown on plan\nM2773. I am enclosing letter received from Father Brachet,\nO.M.I., principal of Fort Alexander Residential School, which\nwill give you understanding we have in dealing with Chief Thompson\nof this Band. You will note that no reference was made to Chief\nThompson in my report of August 21st. The reason being that he\nwas off the Reserve for extended period and it was impossible\nto contact. Since that time a Chief and Council and band meeting\nhas been held at which time the Chief was the only individual\nwho cautioned against this forward step being accepted. At\nthat meeting no indication was given that his opposition would\ntake this form. I am arranging another meeting on the Reserve\nat which time this matter will be uppermost in our discussion.\nSufficient time has been given for full consideration by band\nmembers to form intelligent opinion. I do not doubt the outcome.\n\nRegarding your suggestion that Band funds be used\nto defray costs in excess of $6000.00 expenditure I can foresee\ndifficulties. There is now an approved resolution chargeable to\nfunds for some $3000.00 for road costs relating to very highway\ntransmission line will follow. Also at last meeting referred to\nabove held September 29th it was approved to spend a minimum\nof $1500.00 from band funds for bridge construction and repair\nof north part of Reserve. The amount may exceed this, and, as\ncontract is not yet let the full amount is not authorized by\nresolution to request $3000.00 more or less for this important\ntaking into account Chief Thompson's everlasting opposition to any progressive measures suggested it may be very difficult to obtain authority. Chief Thompson's opposition may carry votes inasmuch as but two thirds of band living on one side of the River dividing Reserve will directly benefit.\n\nMay I say for your information that Chief Thompson is the Chief who appeared before the Committee at Ottawa and made such fuss over the Department doing nothing to better the lot of his band. He has recently been chosen Chairman of Union of Indian Chiefs for Manitoba, having been elected September 24th last. He feels his position is one of great importance, and constantly is harping to Treaty rights of 1871. Yet this same Chief constantly opposes every progressive measure proposed for betterment of this band. Here certainly is a case in point for the elective system three year term. In a democratic election he would never be chief.\n\nMay I inquire as to whether it is imperative that Band funds pay for cost in excess of $6000.00 for transmission line before this important and necessary development can progress further? There is no question in my mind about getting approval of Chief transmission line entering Reserve territory. However, I can foresee grave difficulties to obtain resolution to charge to Band funds this extra cost.\n\nB.E. Olson\nSupt., Clandeboye Agency.\nOttawa, November 7, 1947.\n\nMr. B.E. Olson, Superintendent of Indian Agencies,\nSelkirk, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 11th ultimo with further reference to the power transmission line for the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nWe note that there may be some difficulty in obtaining the consent of the Band for the use of an amount of $3000.00 from their own funds towards the cost of the erection of the power line. However, you may place the matter before them and let us know their decision.\n\nFor your personal information, I may say that we are including an item of $9,000.00 in the estimates for 1948-49 for this power line but at the present time we can not give any definite assurance that the item will be allowed.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/HM.\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls P.O., Man.,\nOct. 31, 1947.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast July we prepared to lay a Battleship Linoleum in the boys' recreation room, but we found out that the flooring laid by the Indian Affairs when the addition was built had become so sunk in places that it had to be all taken out, and we had to put a thick layer of cement as an even base, the depth varying four inches on one side.\n\nOn July 25th Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector, brought Mr. Keenlyside, Deputy Minister, to visit the school. They saw the cement floor, which was finished a few days before, and Mr. Hamilton was willing to recommend some refundment for the work.\n\nWhen you visited me on the 28th inst. you saw the Battleship Linoleum as it is nicely and evenly laid.\n\nFor this emergency work I spent $83.62 for material and $144.00 for wages.\n\nI would be grateful if at least I could obtain the refundment of the material expenses, to wit:\n\n| Item          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|---------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Jul. 17 A. Adam | 13 sacks | $1.10      | $14.30|\n| 19 A. Courchene | 12       | $1.10      | $13.20|\n| 24 Man.

J. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal.\n\nB. E. Olson, Superintendent,\nClandeboye Agency,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nOctober 28th Fort Alexander Indian Residential School was visited and inspected. Father Brachet brought to my attention special work he performed representing a very necessary and effective improvement. He feels that some assistance should be given by Department for at least material costs.\n\nFather Brachet's letter to this office dated October 31st is herewith attached, and is self explanatory.\n\nMay I have your opinion on this matter so that I can report back to Father Brachet?\n\nB.E. Gibson,\nSupt. Clandebaye Agency.\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls P.O., Man.,\nOct. 20, 1947.\n\nB. E. Olson,\nSupt. Clandeboye Agency,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Hydro Line.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th inst., I beg to say that, owing to the fact that the main use of the line is destined for the school, I think that the Department should bear the cost of the transmission line, and to me it is not reasonable to expect the Indians to draw out of their trust fund in Ottawa to complete the sum of $6,000.00 laid aside by the Department, as only a limited number of the Indians on this side of the river would take advantage of the electric conveniences.\n\nAs it is, most of the Indians are theoretically in favour of the line, but should the proposition of contribution be put for discussion before the general council, I am afraid that a strong opposition would be formed.\n\nWhen I came here in 1936 all the Indians were against a good road. Still they have been generous enough - Chief John Thompson much against his will - to vote quite an amount for the betterment of the road on this side of the river. There is much improvement to do on the other side out of their fund money. So I think that their trust fund should be left for an absolutely public use.\n\nWhat is the question of say $3,000.00 for the Department, when it can be used as a public advertisement of what the party in power can do for the betterment of the Indians? When the C.C.F. are acting so much to disparage the Liberal Government in its policy towards the Indians, the installation of a Hydro Line on a reserve for the progress of two schools and of the more advanced Indians would be a bright item of propaganda indeed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal.\nSelkirk, Man.,\nOctober 31st, 1947.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Power Transmission Line\nFort Alexander I.R., Pine Falls, Man.\n\nFurther to your letter of October 14th, file 125-1-5 (WT.1) regarding the use of Band funds to defray costs in excess of $6000.00 for installation of Power Line on the Fort Alexander Reserve.\n\nMy last letter indicated my doubts as to whether Chief Thompson would ever consent to this arrangement. On October 28th the writer with Mr. Hughes visited this Reserve and met with Chief and Council to discuss this and other matters of business. Little if any progress was made with Chief Thompson regarding his approval for the use of Band funds. We were not prepared to call a band meeting to overrule the Chief, inasmuch as his arguments probably would meet with some approval from many Indians on the Reserve. Therefore, the subject was not followed through to its logical conclusion on this occasion.\n\nShortly after receipt of your communication requesting this charge Father Brachet was written to explore initial steps to bring this about. His letter to me under date of October 20th is herewith attached for your information. Father Brachet's letter fairly covers the arguments pro and con.\n\nThis matter is not as yet closed book. But it does seem doubtful that this charge will be acceptable.\n\nB.E. Olson,\nSupt. Glendiboye Agency.\nOttawa, November 12, 1947.\n\nMr. B.E.

Olson, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Selkirk, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to the cost of a power line to the Fort Alexander Residential School.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter, we consider it inadvisable to make any formal application at the present time to the Indian Council for the funds over and above the amount of $6,000, which was provided in the current year's appropriation.\n\nAs stated in my letter of November 7th, we are endeavouring to secure the total amount in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MDG\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Fire Hazard, Fort Alexander R.C. School\n\nOn October 22 last Mr. H.E. Puttee addressed a letter to Inspector Hamilton requesting that measures be taken by those in authority to remedy hazardous fire conditions at Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, at Pine Falls, Man. Mr. Puttee is Fire Commissioner for Manitoba.\n\nThis matter has been handed to me for attention. In checking past files it is apparent that major steps recommended were never authorized, and to date the measures recommended have not been effected.\n\nThe situation has been personally discussed with Rev. J. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal of the school, and complete inspection made of school regarding supposed hazards. From my investigation there emerge two major requirements for protection.\n\n(A) Means for evacuation of children.\n\n(B) Means for control of fire.\n\nEvacuation of Children\n\n(A) Father Brachet favors chute fire escape installed with only one objection, namely, installation would darken dormitories. OR:\n\n(B) Two iron fire escapes (stair type) with last section lifting up on weights.\n\nCONTROL OF FIRE:\n\nInstallation of approved type 5-gallon water pump tank fire extinguishers be installed on each floor of school.\n\nThe cost of above recommendations is not known to me. Understand Surveys and Engineering Branch has checked\n(2)\n\n...ices at least relating to chute fire escapes. The cost would be considerable and before anything further is done your reaction is solicited.\n\nI would refer to letter under date September 24th, 1946, file 125-1-5 (W.T.l) wherein authority was granted to effect certain recommendations. This work was never executed, and I would request that this authority be renewed so that we can immediately comply with said recommendations.\n\nB.E. Olson,\nSupt. Indian Agency.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, November 19, 1947.\n\nMr. B.E. Olson, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Selkirk, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 12th instant,\nfile 3-11-0, with reference to the Fort Alexander\nIndian Residential School.\n\nWith regard to the fire escapes, this\nmatter was brought to the attention of this Depart-\nment in a letter from Acting Agent Hughes, dated\nSeptember 27th, 1946.\n\nWe referred the request to the Surveys\nand Engineering Branch and on October 3rd, 1946,\nthey advised us that from the drawings of the school\non their files, they estimated the cost of a cylindrical\nsteel chute type of fire escape at $600.00. Consequent-\nly, we included this amount in our appropriation for\nthe year 1947-48.\n\nIn memorandum dated July 26th, 1947, the\nSurveys and Engineering Branch advised us that one of\nthe members of their staff had recently visited the\nschool and from the measurements and information given\nby their officer, they expressed the opinion that it\nwould be necessary to construct two wood frame enclosed\nstairs at a cost of approximately $2,500.00 and an\nadditional amount of $1,000.00 would be required to\nreplace the end pole escapes. You will note that this\nmeant an expenditure of approximately $3,500.00 and\nas funds for the purpose were not available in the\ncurrent year's appropriation we advised them not to\nproceed with the work.\nI believe it is too late this year to erect these escapes but the matter will be given further consideration early next summer.\n\nIn official letter of September 24th, 1946, we authorized the following action which was contained in a letter of the principal's dated September 11th, and which was forwarded to the Department under cover of Mr. Hughes' letter of September 16th,\n\n(1) Boiler room door and frame to be covered with metal on the boiler room side, and made self-closing.\n\n(2) Both doors and frames from boiler room next to laundry to be metal clad on the boiler room side, said doors to be made self-closing.\n\nIf these two improvements have not been carried out, you should arrange to have them done immediately. We are prepared to order the additional fire extinguishers if you will state how many you consider are actually required.\n\nWe are also prepared to allow the same amount as last year, namely $40.00 a month towards the salary of a night watchman. You should make certain that the night watchman is employed and that he is carrying out his duties satisfactorily.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\n\nPP/EGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Fort Alexander Indian Residential School\n\nMy visit to this school was unexpected but I found the school throughout in its usual immaculate condition. The boy's playroom has been refloored with cement and painted. It is now bright and cheerful and a splendid recreation room.\n\nThere are enrolled 105 pupils but the Principal expects to take in another 6 or 8 shortly. The classrooms are nicely arranged and are bright and cheerful. The pupils are making fair progress and their exercise books show careful work.\n\nThe dormitories were well aired, tidy and clean. The beds were neatly made and supplied with plenty of bedding.\n\nThe children were well clothed and clean. Their health appears good and I am convinced they are well fed.\n\nThe fire escapes remain the same. I understand a full report with pictures was submitted by Mr. Gow, District Chief Engineer, Surveys and Engineer Branch, months ago. Dr. Keenleyside on his visit was much concerned about the present pole fire escape and expressed the opinion that action to make secure the present poles and build extra escapes should not be delayed. I was indeed surprised to learn this week that no action has apparently been taken on the report already submitted. I would urge that action be taken at once to correct the present unsatisfactory condition.\n\nThe sewing room in all boarding schools is one of the busiest departments and I found this one no exception. Last year two new Singer sewing machines were supplied - these have helped greatly. However, other old machines must yet be replaced as they are past repairing. I would recommend that two more new machines be supplied.\n\nThe kitchen is a heavy department but the Sister in charge is doing an excellent piece of work. The range has no warming oven and this is a great inconvenience. A warming oven for a McClary, two oven and one fire pot type of stove is required. I recommend it be supplied.\n\nAnother requirement urgently needed is a refrigerator. I would suggest the present fruit storage space off the pantry as a suitable location to install the equipment. I am recommending this equipment believing the Department will approve the necessary expense in supplying the Hydro power to this school. I understand a definite proposition has been submitted which is considered reasonable and if this is correct the line should be built with as little delay as possible. Mr. Olson, the Indian Agent, has this matter in hand and will submit a complete report with his recommendation.\n\n-over-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-5, part 9)\nA large herd of cattle is kept and at present about ten cows are being milked.\n\nThe pupils at this school appear very happy and I consider Father Brachet operates a very excellent school. The children are well treated, well fed and clothed and have a splendid opportunity to fit themselves with an all round useful education.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOTTAWA, November 11, 1947.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI am enclosing the original of a letter received yesterday from Reverend Father Brachet, O.M.I., Fort Alexander. Attached to Father Brachet's letter is one from Mr. M. C. Gilman, Manager of Electric Sales of the Winnipeg Electric Company, which, in my estimation, should dispel all doubts in your mind regarding the economic aspects of this project. The Winnipeg Electric Company proposes to contribute the sum of $1,500.00 towards the execution of this project, and only requires $750.00 as total yearly revenue. I am firmly convinced that with the other customers they will be able to secure this amount.\n\nThe objections of Chief John Thompson should be set aside completely as of no value and of a nature to keep the reserve in a state of semi-civilization. I, therefore, hope that it will be possible for you to hurry this installation so that the school may benefit by the amount of $6,000.00 which you now have in the estimates for this project.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls, Man.,\nNov. 7, 1947.\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa.\n\nRev. Father:-\n\nRe Hydro Line.\n\nImmediately on my return from Ottawa in May I went to see the Manager of the Winnipeg Electric Co. at Great Falls. It was only on my third trip there that I was able to see him. Afterwards he came to see me here and discuss the installation of a power line from Pine Falls to the school.\n\nThe great objection that the company had was the scarcity of material and labour. Later on the company was agreeable to contemplate the possibility of a line extension, but it wanted a petition to that effect, with the names of the probable users, and the proposed location of the line. All this was forwarded on August 19th. We were informed on Sept. 6th that their representative, H. Vialoux, would make a survey some time after his holidays. I went with him back and forth all the way between Fort Alexander and Pine Falls, contacting the possible users of electricity and measuring the distance from the highway. On Oct. 8th three men came from Great Falls to measure the length of the road, together with the number of curves. When they came opposite Chief John Thompson's place, they were ordered to return loaded with insults. After much arguing I induced the chief to let them finish their task.\n\nOn Oct. 25th I asked the Company to give an estimate of the present cost of a transmission line to the school. I herewith submit the answer given on the 5th inst.\n\nI would have wished that at least the poles would have been planted before the frost sets in, so as to tie the sum of $6,000.00 appropriated for the purpose, but before the Indian Affairs Branch takes a decision and the Indian Council here agrees, it shall be too late likely.\n\nThe Chief, who complains that there is no progress and who in the same time hinders all progress as much as he can, is not in favour of an electric transmission line, but the great majority of Indians are in favour. If their approbation is necessary, it should be obtained early. Mr. B. E. Olson, Inspector of the Clandeboye Agency, Selkirk, states that there is on record at Ottawa a lease right covering this problem.\n\nBesides the Residential school and the Catholic Mission, the Indian day school, the Anglican mission, and the former store of the H.B.C., there would be at least 15 families that would use not only the lights, but also electric appliances, such as frigidaires, motors...\n\nMiss Alice McCready found our ice house very poor and wished for us a frigidaire.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Fort Alexander\nIndian Residential School,\nPine Falls P.O., Manitoba.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn answer to your letter of October 25th I would advise our estimate of the present day cost of extending a single phase, 60 cycle circuit along the highway a distance of approximately six (6) miles from our line at Pine Falls to deliver 110/120 volt service at your school is $8,420.00, made up as follows:\n\n| Item               | Cost   |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Poles              | $1,802 |\n| Guying Stubs       | 264    |\n| Anchor Guys        | 337    |\n| Cross Arms         | 286    |\n| Insulators         | 57     |\n| Wire               | 1,446  |\n| Transformers       | 638    |\n| Labor              | 3,240  |\n| Engineering & Supervision | 150 |\n| Contingencies      | 200    |\n\nThere is very little market for the sale of electric service along the route of this circuit or at Fort Alexander. Besides your buildings the only other likely users we believe are the Anglican School and residence and the Church, possibly a few other residences as well. Consequently our annual revenue obtainable in that area at the rate schedules we have in effect in Lac du Bonnet, St. George and West St. George would be quite small.\n\nIt is too late this year to undertake this work but if the Indian Affairs Branch of the Federal Government is prepared to guarantee revenue to us of $750.00 annually for a period of five years from this contemplated extension, we in turn will agree next year after we secure suitable contracts for service, to spend $1,500.00 toward the cost of this work, leaving the difference to be financed by the Government.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) MCGilman,\nManager of Electric Sales.\n\nMCGilman: YL\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nNovember 21, 1947\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa, (File: 125-1-5)\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nVOTE 516 ALLOTMENT 12-415 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO The Principal, Fort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls, Manitoba.\n\nPurpose for which required:\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 2        |            |       |\n|          | Ordinary Sewing Machines |       |\n| 1        |            |       |\n|          | Warming Oven for McClarey, two oven and one fire pot type of kitchen range. |       |\n\nNote: While the articles should be shipped as shown above, the account should be forwarded to Mr. B.E.

We have carefully reviewed the letter that you have received from Father Brachet, Principal of the Fort Alexander Residential School.\n\nIt is noted from the copy of the letter received from the Winnipeg Electric Company that it is too late this year to undertake this work. We are including the amount required for the installation of Hydro power at the Fort Alexander School in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49 and if this is allowed, we can give the necessary authority to proceed with the work about the end of March, 1948.\n\nIt is noted from the letter of the Winnipeg Electric Company that they will require to be guaranteed that they will receive an annual revenue of $750, for a period of five years, for this extension. As you are aware, this guarantee will have to be given by the principal of the school as the Department does not assume expenditure for electricity actually used at a residential school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, November 21, 1947.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 15th instant, file 202-11, reporting on your recent inspection of the Fort Alexander Residential School.\n\nWith regard to the fire escapes, this matter was brought to the attention of the Department in a letter from Acting Agent Hughes, dated September 27th, 1946. We referred the request to the Surveys and Engineering Branch and on October 3rd, 1946, they advised us that from the drawings of the school on their files, they estimated the cost of a cylindrical steel chute type of fire escape at $600.00.\n\nConsequently, we included this amount in our appropriation for the year 1947-48.\n\nIn memorandum dated July 26th, 1947, the Surveys and Engineering Branch advised us that one of the members of their staff had recently visited the school and from the measurements and information given by their officer, they expressed the opinion that it would be necessary to construct two wood frame enclosed stairs at a cost of approximately $2,500, and that an additional amount of $1,000 would be required to replace the end pale escapes.\n\nYou will note that this meant an expenditure of approximately $3,500, and as funds for the purpose were not available in the current year's\nappropriation we advised Surveys and Engineering not to proceed with the work.\n\nThe information just given regarding fire escapes has been supplied Superintendent Olson in our letter of November 19th. In that letter he was also authorized to make immediate repairs to the boiler room doors in order to reduce the fire hazard. We also told him that we were prepared to supply additional fire extinguishers on receipt of information from him stating how many are actually required.\n\nHe was also advised that the Department was prepared to allow an amount of $40.00 a month towards the salary of a night watchman.\n\nWe will order the two new sewing machines and also the warming oven.\n\nWe hope to be able to make arrangements for Hydro power to this school next year. In the meantime you might let us know the size of the room in which you consider refrigeration equipment could be installed. If you can obtain a quotation on installing this equipment from a firm in Winnipeg, you might also forward this for our consideration.\n\nBernard F.

Inasmuch as funds were not available in last year's estimates to defray costs but were included in 1948-49 estimates it is desired to bring this to issue at earliest possible date.\n\nTo obtain electric power on the Fort Alexander Reserve has been a live issue more or less since 1938. Last year this came to head when Winnipeg Electric Co., indicated they could proceed providing their requirements could be met. It has been discussed in Chief and Council meetings, and Band meetings, and, with countless band members. Aside from Chief Thompson and small group who do as he says there is general endorsement of this forward step. A special Band Meeting was called March 9th essentially to discuss the acceptance of Power Transmission Line to Reserve. A well attended meeting resulted and after full discussion participated in by every Councillor, Chief and band members, also Father Brabbert, Principal of Indian Residential School, and Canon Walters, Anglican minister a standing vote was taken which resulted in overwhelming endorsement of the proposal. Only Chief Thompson and about four band members did not vote in favor, but, incidentally merely refrained from voting.\n\nFollowing this meeting I travelled to northern Reserves and on my return to Selkirk received a letter signed by Chief Thompson that he desired to take the matter up with Indian Association of Manitoba before approving. No meeting has been held since and according to my information no meeting is contemplated in near future. Accordingly I proceeded to Pine Falls to interview Chief Thompson and find he has gone out trapping and is not expected to return for at least a month.\nThe time is now arriving that this matter should be dealt with. The Winnipeg Electric Company has stated its proposal. It would now be appreciated to hear Departmental requirements so this matter can be dealt with as relates to what this need do to further this essential development.\n\nB.E.

Brachet, Principal of the\nFort Alexander School, the Winnipeg Electric Company\noffered to install the line at a cost of approximately\n$8,420.00. You should consult Father Brachet as soon\nas possible and ascertain if this offer still holds\ngood. If not, either Father Brachet or yourself should\nsecure another quotation from the Company.\n\nThe last paragraph of the letter of November\n25th to Father Brachet read as follows:\n\n\"It is too late this year to undertake this work but\nif the Indian Affairs Branch of the Federal Government\nis prepared to guarantee revenue to us of $750.00\nannually for a period of five years from this contemplated\nextension, we in turn will agree, next year, after we\nsecure suitable contracts for service, to spend $1,500.00\ntoward the cost of this work, leaving the difference to\nbe financed by the Government.\"\n\nWe are not certain whether the $1,500.00 which\nthe Company offered to spend towards the cost of the\nwork is over and above their quotation of $8,420.00 or whether they mean $8,420.00 less $1,500.00.\n\nYou will also note that the Company required a guaranteed revenue of $750.00 annually. This guarantee will have to be given to the Company by the management of the Fort Alexander School as the Department does not pay the cost of current used at an Indian Residential School.\n\nBernard F.

J. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal of the above school, we are pleased to send herewith a five year proposal in duplicate for the supply of 1 @ 60 cycle 115/230 V. service for the above school.\n\nThis will involve the installation of a 25 K.V.A. 6600/4400 V. transformer at Pine Falls and the building of a 4400 V pole line for a distance of about six (6) miles and the installation of a 25 K.V.A. 4400/115/230 V. step down transformer at the school.\n\nWe submitted a proposal to Rev. Brachet last November which was based on the cost of labor and material at that time. Since then these costs have increased materially and on this account the present proposal provides for the payment of a higher contribution by the Government.\n\nOur proposal to Rev. Brachet provided for the signing of a five year agreement with annual minimum charge of $750.00 and the payment to us of the excess cost of line extension etc. over $1500.00. This excess is now estimated at $8250.00.

This excess is now estimated at $3,250.\n\nIt is our intention to submit this proposal to the Minister and we will probably have to obtain an Order in Council before proceeding with the matter. However, in the meantime I would direct your attention to the last paragraph of our letter of April 23rd in which you were advised that the management of the Fort Alexander School will have to give a guarantee to the company that they will pay the cost of the current, namely $750.00 annually as the Department does not pay for electric current used at any residential school.\n\nPlease consult Father Brachet and obtain from him a signed agreement that the school management will be responsible for $750.00 a year in the event of the Department concluding the contract with the Winnipeg Electric Company.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nMay 10, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe - Electric Service for Fort Alexander Mission School, near Pine Falls, Manitoba.\n\nIt is our intention to submit your proposal to our Minister at an early date and as soon as a decision is obtained you will be advised.\n\nWe note that you wish to have a final decision before July 1st, 1948.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR.A.

Hoey, Director of Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa to proceed with the line extension necessary to your school and charge the Government any excess costs over $1500.00, this excess being estimated at $8250.00.\n\nMr. Hoey advised us your school would be responsible for the payment of the electric service accounts and accordingly we have enclosed contract in quadruplicate which we would be pleased to have you sign and return to us. Upon completion of this agreement by us, after a service is connected, we will return the required number of copies.\n\nAs previously explained, this contract covers only supply of service to your school for the lands mentioned in the contract.\n\nI understand it is necessary for us to secure formal written permission from the Indian Council of the reserve so that our engineers may build a pole line as planned. I discussed this matter with Mr. B.E. Olson of the Indian Affairs Branch and he promised to secure the above mentioned permission in quadruplicate and forward same to us.\n\nWith reference to any other customers beside your school, it will be necessary for us to deal with them individually and to request them to sign a separate contract with provision for payment of a portion of this distribution expense wherever circumstances make this necessary.\n\nTrust you will find this proposal in order and advise us at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager, Electric Lines\n\nIndian Affairs.

Last year when an annex was erected to this school we employed Rev. Father Bousquet, the Principal of the school, to act as inspector of that work. He performed the duties in a most satisfactory manner, and we desire, if it is possible under the regulations of the Civil Service Commission, to have him appointed this year to inspect the work during the construction of the barn. The school is in an isolated location and to send in an outside man would entail a great deal of expense that is quite unnecessary. Winnipeg is the nearest point. We would have to pay the expenses of an inspector to and from Winnipeg, his maintenance while at the school inspecting the work, and his services would cost a great deal more than Father Bousquet is willing to accept, namely, $100.00 per month.\n\nIncl.- I am inclosing requisition herewith, and, as Father Bousquet is quite capable of performing the work, I would ask that you accede to our request and have him appointed without competition.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWm. Foran, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nCivil Service Commission,\nOttawa.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nIndian Boarding School\nFort Alexander, Man.\nJuly 18 1923.\n\nMr. J.D. Mclean, Assist. Deputy\n& Secretary of Ind. Department.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. S. Brown, from Winnipeg is beginning to build our barn for which he has the contract. So it is the time to appoint an Inspector of work, for it is very important to have good foundations to be made.\n\nI believe it would be very wise that you appoint me Inspector for work, as you did last year, with the same salary, for I will be on the spot all the time to watch the job.\n\nPlease, Dear Sir, with my anticipated thanks, accept the assurance of my respectful consideration,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am directed to inform you that the Civil Service Commissioners have now approved of the temporary employment of the Reverend Father Bousquet, as Inspector of Construction at Fort Alexander Indian Boarding School, Manitoba, at the salary of $1200 per annum, for a period not exceeding six months, in compliance with your request of the 7th instant.\n\nIf you will be good enough to notify the Commission of the date this employee reports for duty, the necessary certificate will be issued.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly 24, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to my letter to you of the 7th instant and telephone conversation with one of the officials of the Commission regarding the appointment of Reverend Father Bouquet, the Principal of the Fort Alexander Indian Boarding School, as Inspector of the work during the erection of the barn which is to be built at the school this year, I beg to say that we are today wiring Rev. Father Bouquet to take charge of the work temporarily under the thirty day clause. This is necessary owing to the fact that they are ready to start the work and it is important that good foundations be made. Father Bouquet's engagement will date from today.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nWm.

It will also be your duty to issue progress certificates to the contractors, up to 90% of the value of labour and material in the building.\n\nYou will be paid at the rate of $100.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

Co., Ltd.,\nToronto & Glencoe.\n\nCapacity: 1 sack flour.\n\nAt present we use a gasoline motor right inside the laundry. The gas fumes are specially hard on the children's constitution during winter when doors have to be kept closed.\n\nYou will, no doubt, be interested in obtaining for us the four motors with mechanism.\n\nYou know that we will have to pay a yearly minimum charge of $750.00 for electricity during five years, whether we use it or not.\n\nWe will do our part in purchasing an automatic water pump ourselves.\n\nTrusting you will make at once the necessary inquiries for equipment from those companies, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev.

Neary,\nSupt. of Education\n\nEnclosed herewith is a letter received from Rev. J. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal of the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, Pine Falls, Manitoba. The letter is self explanatory and merits favorable consideration.\n\nIn as much as this equipment, if approved for purchase, should be dealt with through the central purchasing agent I am leaving this for such action as you may deem advisable.\n\nB.B.

School,\nPine Falls, Manitoba.\n\nDear Father Brachet:\n\nSuperintendent Olson has forwarded to us your letter of August 28th and in order to save time we are communicating direct with you.\n\nPlease let us know as soon as possible the horse power of the gasoline motor which you have been using for the three machines mentioned in your letter.\n\nWas this motor giving sufficient power to work the units efficiently. When we have your reply we will be in a position to order the electric motor that you request.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nc/o to Mr. Olson.\nSelkirk, Man., September 3, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAtt'n: Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education\n\nThere has been much correspondence regarding the fire escapes and other inadequacies at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School at Pine Falls, Manitoba. The need for proper fire escapes is progressively becoming more urgent. I am wondering as to whether there is any possibility of these being replaced in accord with requests in previous correspondence from this office. If anything can be done this year it is obvious that installation before winter sets in would be most desirable.\n\nB.E. Olson,\nSuperintendent,\nGlandeboye Agency.\nSeptember 10, 1948.\n\nMr. B.E. Olson,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nSelkirk, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to fire escapes at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nOwing to the installation of Hydro in this school this year, we have no funds available for the construction of fire escapes.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls, Man.,\nSeptember 11, 1948.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe 125-1-6 (E.1)-Electric Motors in Laundry.\n\nIn answer to your inquiry of the 8th inst. regarding the gasoline motor which operates the three machines in the laundry and the dough mixer in the bakery, I beg to state that it is a 3/9 H. P. Engine and that it is somewhat inadequate in power to run the three laundry machines in the same time.\n\nWe believe that a separate motor unit for each machine would give better service and would be less expensive in the long run than one 10 H. P. Electric Motor. Consequently we would need four motors, with the necessary connecting mechanism:\n\n1 for the Washing Machine,\n1 \" \" Extractor,\n1 \" \" Dry Cleaner,\n1 \" \" Dough Mixer.\n\nPlease note that our Dough Mixer, with a capacity of 1 sack of flour, is worn out and leaking, and that when we can obtain another one, it would be better to have one with a capacity of two sacks, and consequently, it would be wise to purchase a motor powerful enough for this new mixer.\n\nTrusting this is the information you desire, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\n\nPrincipal.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Fort Alexander Indian Residential School at Pine Falls, Manitoba have the following equipment which was obtained from your company:\n\nWashing Machine - Serial No. 1215\u00bd - M 7239\nExtractor - \" 333 - M 7424\nDry Cleaner - \" 22730 - M 7254\n\nAt the present time, these machines are operated by a gasoline engine through shafting.

Neary\n\nReplying to yours of the 14th we beg to advise that in December 1928 we sold you a Dough Mixing Machine for mixing one and a half barrels of flour and as a matter of fact this machine would mix two bags of flour quite easily. To motorize this you would require the following:\n\n1 Only 2 h.p. 60 cycle single phase 110-220 volt Motor - 900 RPM\n1 Only pair motor slides\n1 Only chain drive consisting of two sprockets and chain and a chain guard.\n\nPrice the Lot . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $380.00\n\nThis price is net f.o.b. Toronto factory, sales tax extra and is subject to change without notice.\n\nYou need have no hesitation in mixing up to three bags of flour in the Dough Mixer aforementioned when equipped with a two horsepower motor for the machine was built for this capacity and the motor will handle it quite nicely. We believe we are correct in assuming that the mixer which was shipped to The Pine Creek Residential School, Winnipegosis, Man., is the machine you have reference to. The serial number of this machine was #5182.\n\nTrusting this gives you the information you desire and awaiting your further esteemed commands, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFLETCHER MANUFACTURING COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Engine, I beg to submit the following information.\n\nOn July 31, 1940, we obtained from Mumford, Medland Limited, of Winnipeg, one 10 H.P. K.W. Lister Diesel Engine, with one 6 K.W. Shunt Wound Battery Charging Generator, for the sum of $947.00.\n\nThe account was paid by a school cheque No. 275 on October 19, 1940.\n\nThe engine was overhauled in Dec. 1944, and is presently in good running condition.\n\nThe main work of the engine, besides operating the charging generator, is to revolve the water pump (Myers Self-oiling Bulldozer No. 315), which on wash days is running continually and on other days at very frequent periods.\n\nEven after we obtain the hydro-electricity, the engine shall be precious to produce a supply of light when the line is defective during or after storms.\n\nThere is much animosity among the protestant element of the reserve against the transmission line and it is hard to say what some individuals may do in the matter of interference, though I hope that the line shall not be cut.\n\nIn short if we would dispose of the engine, we would need another one in its place. As it is, the engine is well set on a specially built foundation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.

H. J. Statham, Chief Clerk.\n\nHJS/RMT\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nCOL. B. F. NEARY.\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of a letter dated the 17th instant, addressed to the Purchasing Agent of this Department, regarding certain accounts which are outstanding with the Winnipeg office of Crane Limited.\n\nI am writing the Winnipeg office of Crane Limited in connection with all of the accounts which were forwarded here, with the exception of two. The papers regarding these are attached hereto. You will see that I have noted in pencil that one of the accounts refers to the Fort Alexander School and the other to the Sandy Bay School. I have gone over your files regarding these two schools and have turned down some papers which have reference to the items mentioned. I have also been in touch with the office of the Purchasing Agent. He informs me that Purchase Order No. 19877 was issued on May 16th, 1947, in favour of Crane Limited. It referred to certain pipe, elbows, etc., required by the Sandy Bay School. He also informs me that this order was given to the Company F.O.B. Amaranth. The second Purchase Order No. 20930, or No. 30930, was issued on the 28th of June, 1948, for the Fort Alexander School. The order was F.O.B. Pine Falls.\n\nAlthough I have not been able to get full information, my opinion is that these orders were issued in favour of the Company and that part of the orders was sent almost immediately and, in accordance with the tender, the freight was paid by the Company. Later on they completed the order; but, in both cases, it was overlooked that the material was to go F.O.B. the nearest town in each case. I presume this is the reason why they are now making claim for freight on these two shipments.\n\nI am replying to the letter received, and informing the Company that they will hear further from you regarding the two accounts dealt with in this memorandum.\n\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\n\nEnclosures.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAtt'n: Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education\n\nSelkirk, Man.,\nNovember 2, 1948.\n\nThis acknowledges your letter of October 19th - your file 125-5 (E.l).\n\nI would report that our electrical advice has been received from Mr. Robert Watson, Chief Provincial Electrical Inspector, Department of Labour, Parliament Buildings, Winnipeg, Manitoba. For your information Mr. Watson made a thorough check of the wiring in the school and found same to be entirely satisfactory. During this inspection visit Mr. Watson gave his expert advice as to the electrical equipment required and the type to be ordered.\n\nThe motors ordered should be single phase - 60 cycle.\n\nBd. Olson,\nSuperintendent,\nGlandshaye Agency.\nNovember 3, 1948.\n\nMr. R.E. Olson,\nSub-Indian Affairs Branch,\nSelkirk, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Fort Alexander School and Adjacent Buildings\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to the inspection which was made on October 29th of the electrical equipment and wiring at the above school, the Department recommends the following changes:\n\n1. That all outlets with drop cords and sockets be removed, and that ceiling fixtures or porcelain receptacles be installed.\n2. That both sewing rooms on second floor be equipped with separate circuits complete with pilot lights for use of electric irons.\n3. That the return condensate pump and the small furnace room be re-wired in conduit.\n4. Temporary wiring in basement hall to be removed and wired in approved manner, and a plug be installed for Projector Machine, and wiring made available for the connection of X-Ray equipment.\n5. That an approved type fire alarm system be installed in the school with a signal bell located in the Father's residence.\n6. That exit lights be installed above all exit doors controlled from a separate circuit.\n7. That a new service and distribution be installed in the Boiler Room with a minimum capacity of the main switch rated at 200 amps. If it is the intention of the school at a later date to install hot water heating and electric ranges we would recommend that the service switch be of ample capacity for any future load.\n8. Secondary lines of ample capacity to be run overhead to supply Father's residence, Church, work shop, barns and residences.\n\nThe general condition of the wiring throughout all buildings was found to be very good and no re-wiring is necessary other than the few recommendations which have been previously stated.\n\nAny further assistance you may require in this matter the Department will cooperate to the fullest extent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCHIEF INSPECTOR, MECHANICAL & ENGINEERING BRANCH\nNovember 8, 1946.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe: Fort Alexander Roman Catholic School and Administration Bldg.\n\nWe trust you will find these plans and specifications satisfactory.\n\nWe would be pleased to install this equipment on the following basis:\n\n- 15% on Labour\n- 15% on Material\n- 7% on Labour for Compensation, Unemployment Insurance, etc.\n\nPlus Board, Room, and Freight.\n\nThis work will be carried out in an efficient manner and in accordance with the Canadian Electrical Code and Local Regulations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.

The following comments may, however, be of interest.\n\nThe S.A. Johnson Company, of Winnipeg, is a very reliable and competent electrical organization. Their work is recommended and approved by the Department of Labor. They have acceptably performed work for the Public Works Department, Ottawa and hospitals, schools, St. Mary's Academy, theatres and public buildings in Manitoba. Their competency is beyond dispute.\n\nRegarding \"A\" and \"B\" I am satisfied by approving \"B\" plan on understanding total cost would not exceed cost estimate in \"A\" that lowest cost will be obtained.\n\nContinued...\nNovember 14, 1948\n\nIt is to be appreciated that contracting work in an old institution takes into account probable cost factors which must be allowed in tender. Actual performance of work may greatly reduce the cost and the proposal with a reliable company like S.A. Johnson and Company would be to the Department's advantage.\n\nI wish to report that I have checked probable costs and find foregoing tender very low. Mr. Watson, Inspector, Department of Labor, thoroughly familiar with estimate as to cost, and who thoroughly examined and inspected the school expected a tender for $4,000.00. Therefore, I have no hesitation in recommending acceptance of tender in \"A\".\n\nI would draw to your attention the important recommendation for safety re fire hazard in points 5 and 6 of Inspector's report. This is a \"must\" for this school. You are familiar with previous correspondence regarding fire hazards. A proper alarm system is our first essential - fire escapes will, no doubt, be considered later.\n\nThere is reason for gratification that wiring throughout school and buildings was found to be satisfactory and no re-wiring necessary. This represents a saving of several thousand dollars.\n\nThe Winnipeg Electric Company has done a speedy job of erecting Power Transmission Line. Line work is now completely finished, leaving only set-up of transformers to complete the job. The Winnipeg Electric Company will be ready to turn on the power and give service by, or before, November 20th.\n\nHaving in mind the availability of service by the end of this week I would respectfully request your preferred and speedy consideration. I shall await your early reply.\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.E.

This original amount was shipped but was found to be some 9 feet short of requirements. When this was discovered Vulcan Iron Works were requested to supply the full requirements, which apparently exceeded the original order and which caused the increase in our voucher.\n\nThe fault, perhaps, is entirely mine that I did not properly check Brother Jasmine's order but under the circumstances the additional smoke pipe was absolutely necessary.\n\nI recommend payment of this voucher as submitted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.E.

You will please note that the total cost of the pole line and service work in this connection amounts to $10,151.13, of which we agreed to stand $1500 in accord with the terms of the special five year contract dated July 8th, 1948 which the Reverend Father J. Brachet, Principal of the Indian Residential School, was authorized by Mr. R. A. Hoey, Director of Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, to sign.\n\nThe approximate price quoted for this work in May 1948 was $8,250, subject to the prices of labor and materials at that time. Both the price of labor and materials increased slightly, and in addition there was a small amount of extra work done which I understand from our Mr. Fergusson you authorized at the time the construction gang were on the job in order to save the extra expense of bringing the construction gang back at a later date.\n\nWe trust you will find the enclosed bill in order and will be able to secure approval for payment at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager of Electric Sales.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This floor cannot be relied on as a sure foundation. We expect the Bell Refrigerator Co. to put instead a safe insulated floor.\n\nFinally as we cannot keep any meat in the old ice house, for it becomes musty very quickly, we would ask you to be kind enough to urge the purchaser to place the order with Bell Refrigerator Co. as soon as possible.\n\nI wish to thank the Department for accepting the plan of Bell Refrigerator Co., which has given satisfaction to many institutions around Winnipeg, and which shall certainly give us also a perfect service.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ.

Johnson and Company, for installing fluorescent lighting and fixtures in several of the rooms at the Fort Alexander Residential School.\n\nIn view of the contents of the second paragraph of your letter, we approve installing the fluorescent lighting in the sewing room as you recommend, at a cost of $50.20.\n\nIt is possible that improved lighting may be required in the other rooms, and if you have not already done so, you might obtain the report which presumably has been made by Mr. W. Watson, Chief Provincial electrical and lighting inspector. Following a review of this, you might feel it advisable to recommend additional lighting in other rooms in the building.\n\nHowever, it should be kept in mind by the Principal and Superintendent Olson that in the current year's appropriation we have provided an amount of $1,000.00 for repairs and improvements at the Fort Alexander School, and any amount expended for additional lighting will have to be...\nprovided from that particular amount. In other words, if the money is spent on lighting, it will not be available for other purposes.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nMay 30th, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Ft.

His aim was to give satisfaction wherever the service could be thought best.\n\nDuring all this month the cooler room and the freezer room have been constantly kept at the desired temperature, as the units have automatically operated as desired.\n\nIn short we may say that the refrigerator has been found a perfect job in every way, and we feel very thankful over the fact that such a reliable company as Bell Refrigerator Co. has been given the contract.\n\nWe have recommended Mr. Bell at some of our own houses, such as the Juniorate College of St. Boniface and the College of Gravelbourg, and we are pleased to know that among other competitors he has been chosen to set a system of refrigeration.\n\nWe are really grateful to the Department for such satisfactory convenience as we are now enjoying to the better health of our pupils.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev.

Johnson Company had been responsible for the installation of electrical service in the school initially and had given excellent service it was agreed that with their presence on the reserve the work would be done more economically than were tenders obtained and an independent visit made from Winnipeg to take care of the job. Under the circumstances I do not think that the Reverend J. Brachet is to be blamed for the action involved and I am assured that the cost as indicated in this voucher is very reasonable and the work very competently done. Should there not be at this time an appropriation applicable to this amount it was agreed between Rev. Brachet and myself that this should be charged against the $1,000.00 allotment for improvements at this school.\nOctober 12, 1949\n\nWhile I appreciate that this procedure is somewhat irregular I would recommend this to your favourable consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.E.

A very complete fire inspection report with recommendations was made by Mr. E. H. Houston of the Fire Commissioner's Department on June 13th, 1946. Several recommendations were made regarding life safety orders and fire prevention orders. There is a complete file in your office originally submitted to Mr. A. G. Hamilton, then Inspector, telling the various recommendations that had been executed. Ottawa also is quite familiar with the requirements having received a copy of the original fire inspector's report. Mr. Bernard F. Neary reported to this office that the Surveys and Engineering Branch had advised that the cost of executing the necessary fire escape protection was approximately $3,500.00 and that the Department's appropriation did not permit this expenditure, at that time. Whether the required amount has been included in the current estimates is unknown to me.\n\nIn the fire inspector's report you sent to me it is indicated that recommendation #4 regarding the life safety orders had not been fulfilled. I would definitely advise that this is not so as a night watchman has always been on duty and the Department has paid for his services regularly on a monthly basis, barring of course the months of June and September of each year. With regard to recommendation \"C\" relating to life safety orders this has now been taken care of since the installation of electricity this year at the institution.\n\n-over-\n\nIndian Affairs.

The main recommendation seems to be the substitution of sliding pole fire escapes for the stairway type fire escape.\n\nBefore we decide in this particular instance, it will be necessary for you to review the situation at other residential schools in Manitoba. We have a number of pole fire escapes, as these were strongly recommended at one time.\n\nIf we should go into a wholesale replacement of these fire escapes with the standard stair type, then it will entail expenditure of a great deal of money.\n\nYou might advise whether the Principal of this school has any definite views concerning the pole fire escape. We have been advised that if the children practice using this escape, they become accustomed to it and, of course, it is preferable in that no ice and snow can accumulate as with the stair type.\n\nBernard F.

However, in our schools where the pole extends to a veranda, it more or less makes the drop very short and the children are not nervous about going down them.\n\nThe Rev. Father Ruest is very much against sliding pole fire escapes, for while they might be satisfactory for older children, the younger children will not use them because of the drop; also, the drop is so sudden it might break their legs.\n\nI am quite aware that it would be very expensive to go into a wholesale replacement of fire escapes, but I feel that at this school, a wooden chute could be built - covered with tin. This should answer the purpose and be much less expensive. I must admit, however, that the stairway type of fire escape is far the best, but the cost is too high.\n\nPlease advise me if you consider I should get prices on a wooden fire escape, or if you think it is better to put in the steel one.\n\nR.

In some of these we have the stair-type fire escape, and at others we have the pole-type fire escape.

Consequently, it is felt that the school management should not expect to be reimbursed for the full amount which they provided towards its cost. Besides, if the management of the Fort Alexander School agree to the transfer, it is our intention to transfer the engine to another school conducted under the auspices of the Oblate Order.\n\nWe feel that the Department should not be expected to pay the Fort Alexander School more than $100.00, and it is hoped that the management will accept this offer. In that event, you may forward a Voucher and payment will be made immediately. You can also arrange for the transfer of the engine and batteries to the Pine Creek Residential School.\n\nBernard F.

It would be advisable to consult Dr. J. B. Still, Room 711, Boyd Building, Winnipeg, who is the Agent of the Health of Animals Branch, Department of Agriculture, and who would, no doubt, assist you in purchasing a pure bred bull.

The Department will expect you to obtain this animal as cheaply as possible, and when the purchase has been made, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. This animal should be kept in charge of the Principal at the school, and should be available for the use of both the school and band herds.

McLean, Secr\u00e9taire.\nD\u00e9part. des Affaires Indiennes.\nOttawa.\n\nCher monsieur,\n\nAu mois de d\u00e9cembre dernier, vous avez eu la bont\u00e9 de nous accorder un taureau de race pour am\u00e9liorer le troupeau de l'\u00e9cole et celui de la r\u00e9serve. Avant d'\u00eatre exp\u00e9di\u00e9, il fut examin\u00e9 par un v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire du Minist\u00e8re de l'agriculture du Manitoba, et reconnu parfaitement sain. De fait pendant tout l'hiver dernier, il a paru \u00eatre en parfaite sant\u00e9.\n\nAu printemps, nous l'avons laiss\u00e9 courir au large avec les animaux de la r\u00e9serve et une partie des n\u00f4tres, comme il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu entre nous au moment de l'achat. Malheureusement se trouvant au contact de quelque animal malade, au mois de juillet, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cliner et \u00e0 maigrir. Nous l'avons mis \u00e0 part pour le soigner d'une mani\u00e8re sp\u00e9ciale, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que, fin d'octobre, il est mort avec\ntous les sympt\u00f4mes de la tuberculose,-toux,jeta\n-ge par les narines,respiration acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e,essoufle-\nment,etc....\n\nJe regrette sinc\u00e8rement ce taureau de\nrace Holstein,car il \u00e9tait magnifique et promettait\nbien pour la reproduction.Aujourd'hui nous nous trou-\nvons sans taureau qui vaille quelque chose.Si,apr\u00e8s\nune si triste aventure, je n'\u00e9tais pas retenu par la\nhonte,j'en demanderais un autre au Gouvernement,pour\nremplacer celui que nous avons perdu; et si dans vot\n-re bont\u00e9,cher monsieur,vous nous accordez un second\nje vous en serai infiniment reconnaissan$.\n\nAgr\u00e9ez,cher monsieur,l'expression\nde mes sentiments les plus respectueux,\n\nVotre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9.\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Boarding School,\nFort Alexandre, Man.,\nNovember 28th, 1924.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the month of December last you were kind enough to grant us a pure blood bull to improve the herd at the school and on the reserve. Before it was brought over it was examined by a Veterinary Surgeon of the Department of Agriculture of Manitoba, and found to be perfectly sound. In fact, during all of last Winter he seemed to be in perfect health.\n\nIn the Spring, we let him run around with the cattle of the reserve and part of ours, as this was understood at the time of the purchase. Unfortunately being in contact with some diseased animals during the month of July he started to weaken and get thin. We isolated him to treat him in some special manner, until at the end of October he died with all the symptoms of tuberculosis, coughing, ejection through the nose, difficulty in breathing, choking, etc.\n\nI regret sincerely this Holstein bull, as he was beautiful and promising for the reproduction. Today we are left without a bull worth while. If, after this sad happening, I was not shy I would ask the Government to replace the one we have lost and if you were kind enough to grant us another one, I would be infinitely thankful.\n\nYours, etc.,\n\nP. Bouquet\nO.M.I.\nOttawa, December 22, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the supplying of a bull for the use of the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School and the reserve. In reply I regret to state that replacement will have to be made from school funds, as there is no appropriation at the present time which can be used for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

There is much to do. Much has been done already, to such an extent that I am about out of funds, although I have received a little help from the church.\n\nTwo of horses were no more good. I had to buy a team from Winnipeg, in order to be able to haul the wood which is necessary for the school. The horses have cost $235.00, plus $16.50 for delivery. They are a fine and good team.\n\nFather Plourde, having passed here lately with Rev. Father Provincial, and noticing my distress, has advised me to write to you and ask you to kindly use your influence to have the Department cover this expenditure in my special case.\n\nI am, therefore, including the account in quadruplicate, hoping that you will be successful to have it paid.\n\nWhen you come westward again, I would be glad that you make it a point, once you have reached Winnipeg, to make your first visit to Fort Alexander, to see the change that has been operated.

I beg to state that our herd has been tested last summer, at which test one cow I had bought from Pine Falls was found to react and was killed the same day; the herd was retested last fall and found in good order. We have presently 14 milching cows, ten of which have been purchased before the last test. We derive enough milk from our cows and we do not need to buy any elsewhere.\n\nThe purchase of these ten cows has thrown us back financially; but the purchase was necessary, as the former milching cows were too poor to depend on them for our milk supply for the school and preventorium. It has been always my policy in the past to have plenty of good milk for the pupils, so as to secure good health to all the pupils and to build up the weaker ones.\n\nIf you could manage to obtain for us a little help towards covering partially the expenditure of $521.70, it would be appreciated. I would be quite satisfied with a cheque of $100.00. It would allow us to buy some feed, which this year is rather scarce.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\nSelkirk, Man., Oct. 3rd, 1938.\n\nREPORT FOR MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 1938.\n\nVisiting Reserves\n\nVisited Fort Alexander twice owing to Nurse Thomas and Nelson being transferred to Norway House. While on reserve visited R.C. Mission, schools and homes. Made arrangements to take rations from Pine Falls to reserve. Inspected oat crops which have been cut and stacked but not threshed as they have no threshing machine other than the one owned by Father Brachet. The Indians have good gardens which will be a great help to them. There are two Indians who have 1000 lbs. of beans to sell.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 16, 1939.\n\nDear Father Brachet:\n\nI am enclosing herewith three photos received by the Department from the Anglican Missionary stationed at Trout Lake, in northern Ontario.\n\nIt would appear that this missionary purchased three or four goats two or three years ago at Winnipeg. In his letter he states that these animals have contributed substantially to the physical fitness of his Indian population. The Indians, it would appear, enjoy both the milk and the meat of these animals.\n\nI have discussed with Inspector Hamilton on more than one occasion the desirability of securing goats for a number of Indian reserves in the province of Manitoba, particularly Indian reserves where milk is scarce and where relief costs are high. Goats are immune from tuberculosis and their milk if widely used by the Indians would, I feel sure, tend to arrest the ravages of tuberculosis among young Indians.\n\nI am anxious that you should discuss with Father Plourde the desirability of securing three or four goats and establishing these at your school by way of experiment. It would be, in my judgment, a fine thing if you could place these goats in the care of three or four of the senior pupils, in the hope that these students after graduation would feel disposed to care for such animals. These goats might be purchased by the Department\n\nReverend J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nPine Falls, Manitoba.\non the understanding that from time to time a young goat might be given to one or two of the graduating students by way of recognition for their work in caring for the other animals.\n\nThis letter is written wholly by way of suggestion and I shall be glad to have in due course any comments you may care to offer with respect to this proposal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls P.O., Man.,\n\nFebruary 28th 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe 125-1-14.\n\nIn answer to your kind letter of the 16th inst. I beg to say that we find your proposition very practical and we would be quite disposed to make the experiment of raising goats and of inducing the Indians to have some. I would only suggest that the goats should be big enough to defend themselves against ordinary dogs. I am told that the school has tried raising sheep in the past and that Indian dogs ate them. However, since that time, Indians have raised sheep and two families still keep some.\n\nWe would put the goats in charge of interested pupils who later would receive as reward a kid, which would be for them the beginning of a herd.\n\nSome pupils are quite enthusiastic already about the proposition. I know very little about goats myself; but one of our employees had some and his experience would be found useful.\n\nHoping that we will be able to make a success of the proposition, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, March 9, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copies of correspondence relating to the purchase of goats for the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School. The subject matter of this correspondence, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nI have been wondering if you could find it convenient to select and purchase five or six goats for this institution. It is my understanding that there is a goat farm where goats can be secured in the Bird's Hill district. You will note Father Brachet's suggestion that the goats should be big enough to defend themselves against ordinary dogs.\n\nThis purchase, if made, will be made on the understanding that payment will be made from the 1939-40 estimates.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n588 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter 125-1-14 dated March 9th, and will endeavour to locate the goats. At present, the side roads are impassable but as the expense is chargeable against 1939-1940 estimates, I presume it will be quite in order to leave this matter in abeyance until the roads become passable.\n\nWe had one goat killed at Little Saskatchewan by dogs. I doubt if the size would be much protection but I will certainly keep this in mind.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

The milk is given to weaker pupils, especially to those whose lungs are below the mark.\n\nI must say that I am quite pleased with the lot and very thankful indeed.

He has decided to accept the proposal of the Company as regards hospital accommodation for ordinary sick and injured Indians.\n\nI am directed to express the gratitude of the Department for your offer to establish a general hospital and to ask whether, in view of the Honourable the Minister's decision, your Order would be willing to establish an institution for the special purpose described hereafter.\n\nIt is the Department's hope to enter upon a program for the control of Tuberculosis among the Indians of Manitoba with special reference to the elimination of this disease from the Indian Residential Schools. From rather extensive surveys of these schools in that and other Provinces it has been found that there are two classes of children suffering from Tuberculosis. The one\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nc/o University of Ottawa\nLaurier Avenue East\nOttawa, Ont.\nclass consists of pupils who have the disease in a definitely active form and for whom the only effective treatment must be carried out in sanatoria specially designed and equipped for this purpose such as the institutions at St. Vital and Ninette. The other group includes children who are only slightly affected and who have the prospect of becoming fit for ordinary school life after a period of special care extending over a year or two during which they can carry on their studies in a modified degree. They may remain pupils of the school but they require extra care, rest and feeding, and should be segregated from the other pupils for the sake of both groups.\n\nExperience in other Provinces suggests that in the three accessible schools under the charge of your Church in Manitoba there might be found from twenty to thirty children of this latter class. The Department is convinced that for the efficient conduct of their isolation they should be in a place where they are under the frequent and careful supervision of a Physician and where that Physician can secure regular periodical advice from a specialist in Tuberculosis based on his personal examination of the pupils.\n\nIt will be agreed that these conditions obtain at Fort Alexander in a degree which would be impossible at Sandy Bay and Pine Creek, and the Department's proposal is that your Order should establish at the Fort Alexander school, in the building under discussion, a section for the accommodation of this class of pupil from that school and the other two schools mentioned above. I wish to make it clear that this institution would be designed only for pupils belonging to your Church. They would remain school pupils with at least nominal attachment to the schools to which they belong. These schools would\nreceive the usual grant for their education and in addition the Department is prepared to pay annually a sum sufficient to provide the additional cost of special food and the services of a graduate nurse or nursing Sister. At other units of this kind this has worked out at about $1000 per annum.\n\nThe plan, of course, is designed for the rehabilitation of pupils who are found to have been admitted to the schools after all precautions have been taken to exclude those who are actively tubercular. It is not intended to serve as a means of providing hospital accommodation for tubercular Indian children at large.\n\nI recommend this proposal to the careful and, I hope, favourable consideration of your Order. It is based on the best advice the Department has been able to secure from recognized authorities on Tuberculosis as the means of solution of what has come to be regarded as the most accessible key to the control of Tuberculosis in the Prairie Provinces at any cost which might be approved by Parliament. It is possible that the Department is asking for some slight financial co-operation on the part of your Order but it will do its best to ensure that the Order is not put to any substantial expense. It has the advantage which I think will appeal to you of retaining the school status of these children, a status which it might well be impossible to retain under any other plan of procedure.\n\nI am authorized to lay this proposal before you and I shall hope for fairly early consideration of it as the Department is anxious to be able to plan a definite program, of which this would be a part, to be got into operation as nearly as possible at the beginning of the new school year in September.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Doctor McGill:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 26th 1937 in which you ask whether our Order would be prepared to cooperate with the Department of Indian Affairs in the establishment of a health unit in which certain cases of T.B. Indian children might be taken care of as far as their health is concerned whilst receiving at the same time that amount of education which their condition might permit.\n\nYour proposal is that this institution be located at Fort Alexander and that arrangements be made to receive therein from twenty (20) to thirty (30) children who are slightly affected by tuberculosis and who can be made fit for ordinary school life if given special care and diet for a period of a year or two.\n\nI am authorized by Reverend Father Lamontagne, Provincial of the Manitoba Province, to advise you that the Oblate Fathers are prepared to establish a sanatorium or a preventorium at Fort Alexander for the purposes above set forth. However, after examining carefully the building which we had offered to the Department for hospital purposes we have come to the conclusion that only part of that building can be used for a preventorium and that we will have to build an addition at least 30 x 35 with full basement and two stories to accommodate the number of children.\n2- Dr. Harold W. McGill.\n\nthat you mention in your letter. The last estimate that we have been able to secure for this building and also for the alterations needed for the new existing building is $6,000. We are prepared to advance this amount but must naturally look to a revenue that will at least take care of the interest and the other carrying charges such as heat, light and general upkeep. We are confident that if the number of these children can be set at thirty (30) as you mention in your letter that such expenses can be provided out of the revenue now proposed to be given by the Department for the upkeep and running of such institutions.\n\nYour proposal to have just one such institution for all the Catholic children in the territory served by the Pine Creek, Sandy Bay and Fort Alexander schools may not be very practical on account of distances and lack of transportation facilities. Camperville is about three hundred (300) miles from Winnipeg and Fort Alexander is another one hundred (100) miles, so that the distance between the Reserves in the district of Pine Creek and Fort Alexander is at least four hundred (400) miles. Transportation facilities as stated above are not good and we feel that parents will have very serious objections to allowing their children to be taken away so far because they will not have much chance to see them. It might also work to the detriment of these children because they would be very homesick and their mental state might make their progress to normal health very difficult.\n3- Dr. Harold W. McGill.\n\nPossibly the best solution of the case would be the establishment of two such health institutions or preventoriums, one in Fort Alexander and the other in Pine Creek. As the expenses connected with an establishment of this nature will be quite heavy we are not prepared to go ahead this year with both of them but we might be able to do so next year.\n\nOur architect is now drawing plans for the Fort Alexander establishment and we expect to be in a position to commence building operations about the last of July. Given propitious weather we are satisfied that the building can be completed by about the first or at the latest the fifteenth of September.\n\nBefore bringing this letter to a conclusion I cannot refrain from expressing our disappointment at the refusal of the Department to accept our offer of establishing a general hospital on the Fort Alexander Reserve for the care of sick Indians of every category. Our offer carried no demand upon the Department for funds and neither were extra fees for the care of the sick Indians asked for. Instead of accepting our offer the Department has given a very substantial grant to the Abitibi Power Company and our sick Indians will certainly be in an environment which will not be conducive to the attainment of the best results neither from a mental or moral point of view. The Churches have done so much for the Indians in the past and they\nare prepared to cooperate with the Department so wholeheartedly that offers of the nature of the one made by the Reverend Oblate Fathers should not be refused to give consideration to plans of groups or companies which are here today and may be gone tomorrow.\n\nThe above statement is made without any acrimony on our part but we think it was essential for us to state our position as clearly as possible.\n\nI am, dear Doctor McGill,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWINNIPEG, June 12th 1937\n\nMANITOBA\n1 Copy of letter July 6\naddress\nRev.

The Medical Services of the Department have been occupied by the convention of the Canadian Medical Association and particularly with a meeting of a committee on tuberculosis at which were represented the Provincial Governments and tuberculosis health authorities from all parts of the country; in fact it was thought well to ascertain the views of that committee before going further with this and one or two other projects of the same kind which have been under consideration.\n\nThe Tuberculosis Committee gave a good deal of attention to this phase of tuberculosis work among Indian children and was convinced of its value. I believe that your Order will come to regard this institution as very valuable and will be pleased that the Department urged you to adopt this plan, rather than the other you had in mind.\n\nI gather from your letter that you are prepared to advance $6,000 to adapt the building to its intended use and that you are willing to do this if you can look forward to having at all times about 30 children.\n\nRev. J. O. Picurde, O. M. I.,\nSuperintendent General,\nOblate Catholic Indian Missions,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nin it. Judging from the reports of the examination of Indian schools in the Province of Manitoba I think there is little prospect of the number of Indian children suitable for this kind of treatment falling below 30 in the schools under our charge in any very near future and it is quite possible that if the number from the three schools should fall below 30 there would be children in a similar condition from other sources available to make up the number.\n\nTo make the financial conditions quite clear I should like to state again that the Department expects to continue the usual school per capita grant for each of these children and in addition is prepared to pay the sum of 25 cents per day for each child during its residence in the preventorium.\n\nI should like also to add that the medical supervision of the children will be that of the local physician under periodic and fairly frequent attendance of a recognized specialist in tuberculosis. It will be necessary to meet the requirements of these physicians in regard to diet, ventilation and other phases of care.\n\nThe Department would prefer, if at all possible that the plan on which the building is to be adapted should be submitted for the approval of Doctor Bisnett and Dr. J. D. Adamson whom you will recognize as the chief medical advisor at the St. Vital Sanatorium. I suggest therefore, if it is not too late, you should take the plan to Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies at Winnipeg and ask him to call in the services of the doctors named. The Provincial Government has regulations in respect to the design of hospitals and I am not sure that it may not require submission of the plans to its advisors also. This is a matter on which Mr. Hamilton would be pleased to inform himself and advise you.\nI should also express the understanding of the Department that your order does not expect direct return of the funds invested in this institution but will depend upon revenue derived from the maintenance of the children to justify its outlay.\n\nSubject to these observations I think you may take this letter as the Department's agreement and proceed with the reconstruction of the building. As soon as possible after the residential schools open in the fall, arrangements will be made to transfer to it, if it is ready, the children for whose care it is designed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.

R. L. MacInnes\nActing Director of Indian Affairs\n\nLM\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received a copy of a letter 51-125 dated July 6th, addressed to the Rev. Father Plourde, which letter, I fear, does not clearly set forth what is desired.\n\nThe thirty pupils for the Preventorium are to be taken from Fort Alexander, Sandy Lake and Pine Creek schools, which means that the above schools will be short thirty pupils - some perhaps five, others ten or fifteen. I presume the per capita grant, plus 25\u00a2 per day, will be paid the preventorium institution. Is this correct? Accepting this as correct, will the schools concerned be allowed and paid the grant for pupils recruited to replace those transferred to the preventorium?\n\nAs this undertaking entails considerable expense and as it will spread over a long period of years, I think all parties concerned should thoroughly understand the arrangement. I believe Father Plourde is writing the Department and I would appreciate being advised re the arrangements under which the work is to be carried on.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

Were it otherwise, the schools would be deprived of a revenue proportionate to the number of children so transferred, which would make the operation and maintenance that much more difficult.\n\nTherefore, if it is understood that the three schools of Fort Alexander, Sandy Bay, and Pine Creek will not have their pupilage reduced and that the children who may be transferred from each school to the preventorium, may be replaced by other children, if available, so that the schools will not lose any revenue, we are prepared to proceed with the erection and staffing of the proposed preventorium at Fort Alexander.\n\nAs the lumber has already been ordered and delivery of it is expected in a few days, an immediate answer to our letter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nGeneral Superintendent of Catholic Indian Missions.\nMr. T. R. L. MacInnes  \nActing Director of Indian Affairs  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge yours of the 6th instant re the erection and operation of a preventorium for Indian T. B. children at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nThe conditions set forth in your letter for the operation of this institution are in line with the conversations that I had with Doctor McGill and the Officers of the Department of Indian Affairs in this connection.\n\nThere is one point, though, which we would like to be clearly understood before we proceed with the erection and furnishing of this new building. My understanding, as well as that of the Oblate Provincial of Manitoba, is that the Oblate Fathers are to receive for the inmates of this institution the ordinary per-capita grant allowed for Indian children in boarding schools, i.e., the sum of $165.00 per year, plus .25 per day to defray the cost of special food and in addition the salary of a graduate nurse or nursing sister.\n\nThe children that will be in this institution will come from the three Residential Schools under the direction of the Reverend Oblate Fathers in Manitoba. But it must be understood, of course, that these schools will not be deprived of any revenue for pupils so transferred and that they will be allowed to accept other pupils to take the place of those transferred to the Fort Alexander\nJuly 20, 1937\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 16 referring to the proposed preventorium at Fort Alexander. The Department did not contemplate that it would pay the salary of a graduate nurse or nursing Sister at this institution and it does not like this double method of compensation. It does not, however, contemplate that the institution should be operated at a loss and is prepared to meet the actual cost which it might not be possible to determine for a little time after it is opened.\n\nThe other condition on which you ask agreement introduces for the first time a problem of the removal of the preventorium class of children from one school to another and I may say that the problem was not foreseen. It would appear that the new institution must be conducted on a separate basis from the schools and I think you need have no doubt that the principals of the schools will be allowed to recruit additional pupils to take the place of those so removed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes\nActing Director of Indian Affairs\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nGeneral Superintendent of Catholic Indian Missions,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nLM\nJuly 23, 1937\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nOn my return to the office, your letter 202-12B has been brought to my attention. There is really little to add to the information conveyed in the letter of July 6 to Reverend Father Plourde. His original offer was to establish a general hospital for Indians in an unused building near the Fort Alexander School. This offer the Department did not think it advisable to accept, and was able to persuade him to adapt the building for the special care of pupils of the three Roman Catholic Residential Schools in southern Manitoba suffering from minimal tuberculosis who might have a good school future under from 1 to 2 years modified school routine, with extra food, rest, etc.\n\nThere are already some institutions of this kind in operation, but the arrangement for each is a problem by itself, and this is the first one designed to take pupils from several schools. The plan, therefore, has been developing its own details, so to speak, and has reached the stage set forth in the letter of July 6.\n\nOn the specific point you raise, Father Plourde is being advised as follows:\n\n\"The other condition on which you ask agreement introduces for the first time a problem of the removal of the preventorium class of children from one school to another and I may say that the problem was not foreseen. It would appear that the new institution must be conducted on a separate basis from the schools and I think you need have no doubt that the principals of the\n\nA. G.

It does not, however, contemplate that the institution should be operated at a loss and is prepared to meet the actual cost which it might not be possible to determine for a little time after it is opened.\"\n\nOn this latter point, it is obvious that the actual cost of operation cannot be foreseen. The Department does not contemplate that these institutions shall be permitted to yield a profit to the body which operates them, and proposed to have their expenditures audited as occasion requires and permits. I think this is the policy that can be devised under present circumstances. We wish so far as we possibly can to meet the strongly expressed wishes of the Churches to control tuberculosis among children, and I think we are entitled to ask them to co-operate in this effort without seeking to profit by it financially.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs\n\nLM\nST. BONIFACE SANATORIUM  \nST. VITAL, MAN.\n\nJuly 16, 1937.\n\nMr. G. Hamilton,  \nInspector of Indian Agencies,  \nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Preventorium at Fort Alexander.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton,\n\nTo supplement and confirm our conversation on the above subject, I wish to make the following comments:\n\nThree questions immediately arise, namely:\n\n1. Are there enough suitable cases to fill thirty beds?\n2. Would the Preventorium plan really make a substantial contribution to the Indian tuberculosis problem?\n3. If not, how can the plan be improved?\n\nI shall deal with each of these problems separately.\n\n1. Are there available cases?\n\nIt is presumed that the proposed unit will be run along the lines usually implied by the word \"Preventorium\", i.e., the inmates will all be in the following classes:\n\na. They shall be of school age, i.e., six to sixteen and of both sexes.\nb. They shall not have open tuberculous lesions of any sort and will therefore be non-infectious.\nc. They shall all be fit for ambulant treatment and will be up and about most of the time.\nd. They shall not require intensive medical or surgical treatment.\n\nThe above is the usual conception of a Preventorium case. It will be found that very few such cases are actually in territory tributary to Fort Alexander.\n\nA real Preventorium case is not really a clinical entity. It is an abstraction built on the assumption that doctors can predict by examination what children are likely to contract tuberculosis. This is, of course, not so. It is certainly true that children who have had contact with open tuberculosis are the only ones who ultimately get tuberculosis. But all contacts cannot be cared for in an institution. Even if they were, there is no assurance that there would ultimately be less tuberculosis among them. The same applies to those with a positive tuberculin test and those with healed childhood lesions. The possibility that contacts with open tuberculosis would be broken for children in a Preventorium might operate in their favor. This breaking of contact should, however, be accomplished for all Indian children in boarding schools without providing separate buildings. This could be done by frequent tuberculin tests and x-ray examinations.\n2. Would the Preventorium plan make a substantial contribution to the Indian tuberculosis problem?\n\nThe death rate in infants\u2014which is said to be high\u2014would obviously be unaffected. Also just as many would be infected up to going to school. While in the Preventorium there would presumably be less spread of infection. This would, however, probably not be absolute. Among thirty suspects or alleged closed cases there would always be some who would become \"open.\" Indeed the criteria by which we have previously judged cases to be \"open\" or \"closed\" have recently been brought into question. In any event, a very close scrutiny would need to be kept to prevent spread in the institution.\n\nBut suppose no such spread took place, what will be the position of these children when discharged to their old environment at the age of fifteen or sixteen? Will the fact that they have been in Preventorium prevent them from breaking down at the usual age (sixteen to thirty-five)? Probably not. Since a larger number than usual will possibly be tuberculin negative, the reverse may quite possibly happen; i.e., they may be more susceptible.\n\nThe crux of the whole tuberculosis problem in Indians is no different than in whites, i.e., sources of contamination must be removed by treatment and isolation. The Preventorium plan does not do this and it would seem a misuse of funds if they were spent on anything so fantastic when there are so many other urgent necessities.\n\n3. Can the plan be improved?\n\nAn institution at Fort Alexander might possibly contribute something if it went right out to treat tuberculosis among young Indians in the ordinary way. It might be arranged that patients be sent into Sanatorium for a few weeks or months observation and when considered suitable be transferred to Fort Alexander where they could continue modified Sanatorium care and pneumothorax if necessary. Even then I feel that there would never be enough of school age Indian children to fill thirty beds. However, I suppose the age limit for inmates could be changed. Such an institution, properly supervised, might develop into a very useful organization.\n\nThe plans of the new building which you showed me are quite good except that there are no single wards whatever, and when one is treating many children facilities for isolation is imperative otherwise you would be almost always harassed with inter-current infectious diseases.\n\nI hope you will not consider these opinions as being merely destructive. They are offered in complete candor and sincerity and I think the opinions given are those generally held by all those experienced in the treatment of tuberculosis.\n\nI feel that this whole matter should be referred to the Committee recently appointed in Ottawa for the consideration of the Indian problem in Canada.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJDA5OP\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-25, part 1)\nDecember 22, 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe tuberculosis survey of the residential schools carried on under the auspices of your church in Manitoba has disclosed that at Sandy Bay there are three and Pine Creek five children who require accommodation in the preventorium recently established at your school. At your own school there was only one, Annie Sutherland. The reverend Principals of the other schools have been requested to have these eight pupils removed to the preventorium at as early a date as may be convenient and I have no doubt you will place Annie Sutherland in the same institution, as soon as it comes into use.\n\nAs discussed with you on more than one occasion, the operation of these units must be considered as experimental for a reasonable length of time. You may begin by rendering an account for the accommodation of these nine children at the rate of $1.00 per day on the understanding that this rate is temporary and only designed to cover the cost between the time the children are admitted and the end of the fiscal year and subject to revision upwards or downwards after experience has shown what the cost of operation may be.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal,\nFort Alexander Residential School,\nPine Falls, Man.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs\n\nLM\nDecember 22, 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIf the present plans of the Department succeed, there will shortly arrive at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, some nine children requiring observation for tuberculosis. These are not sanatorium cases but pupils who require additional food, general care and shortened school hours so that after a year or so of this rest they may resume their original school life at the school from which they came. The Reverend Principal will require some advice in establishing a proper routine for these children and the Department will appreciate your co-operation with him to this end. Knowing your active interest in Indian tuberculosis, I have no hesitation in asking you to do this and will appreciate a report from you with any recommendations on which may be based some rather more definite plan for the operation of this and other units of the same kind, as I think you may know this is the first definite central preventorium which the Department has undertaken to set up.\n\nI do not want to lay down any definite rules at the moment beyond saying that should any of these children develop a condition which requires active sanatorium care, the Department would be pleased to know about it at once as it is not the intention that this institution should be used for that purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. D. R. Bissett, Esq., M.D.,\nPine Falls,\nManitoba\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs\n\nLM\nDecember 23, 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to convey to you the Department's thanks for your summary report addressed to Doctor Stone on December 13, showing the results of the survey of the Indian Residential Schools in Manitoba. Instructions are being issued to the principals of the Roman Catholic schools to have removed to Fort Alexander the nine pupils found in these institutions and I think it may not be necessary to trouble you further about these nine children.\n\nThere were in the Roman Catholic schools, three, and in the Protestant four cases recommended for sanatorium care. The Department is anxious that these children should be removed from the schools if it has not already been done, and placed in institutions where they may obtain the best care available. With the consent of the parents, I think that the three Roman Catholic children might go to the Children's Pavilion at St. Vital, but I think there might be possible objections to the four children from Elkhorn going to that place. The Department is not prepared to recognize such objections as final as it is the invariable rule that Indians, or the parents of minor Indians, may choose any hospital or institution recognized by Provincial authority. I should like, however, to ask you whether you could provide at Ninette accommodation for four pupils from Elkhorn if their parents object to their going to St. Vital.\n\nThere is no central preventorium for Protestant observation cases and I note your statement that you\n\nE. L. Ross, Esq., M.D.,\nMedical Superintendent,\nThe sanatorium Board of Manitoba,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nare satisfied that they can be adequately cared for in the schools where they are. I would appreciate your further consideration of this matter, not necessarily for present decision, but with a view to the future. There has been a suggestion that a central preventorium unit should be established for Protestant children and the number selected for observation would seem to indicate that such a project might become necessary later on.\n\nI shall await your statement as to whether and where sanatorium accommodation is available before issuing any instructions for the removal of the active cases.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs\n\nLM\nDecember 23, 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will find enclosed copies of letters to various persons in Manitoba on matters arising out of the tuberculosis survey of the Residential Schools of that province. The letters have been written with a view to carrying out the next steps without trouble on your part but you should know what is being done. I think it may be necessary to ask you to arrange for the removal of the active sanatorium cases and you will see that I have requested Doctor Ross to see where accommodation is available for them.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Director of Indian Affairs\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIM\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter dated December 23rd, 1937, together with the enclosures.\n\nDr. Bissett promised to write concerning the preventorium at Fort Alexander. However I think Father Brachet has taken the wrong meaning from your letter dated December 22nd, 1937. In that letter you gave permission for 9 pupils to be admitted to the preventorium at the rate of $1.00 per day. Dr. Bissett admitted or suggested the admission of the 27 referred to by the travelling clinic in their report of December 13th.\n\nThese pupils may be in for one month or some for six months, but my impression is that the rate of pay was to be 25\u00a2 over and above the regular grant. I gathered the Father expects to get $1.00 less the grant which he figures at about 45\u00a2. I understand, as stated above, Dr. Bissett is writing direct concerning this matter which I hope may be agreeably settled.\n\nThe preventorium building is well built and wonderfully bright and cheerful. The equipment is all that can be desired and I feel the Indian children are most fortunate in receiving such consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nJanuary 19, 1938\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 200-11B of January 11 I may say that in my letter of December 22 I made as clear as possible the views of the Department on the rate to be paid in the first instance to the Principal of the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School for the accommodation of Indian children in the preventorium at that school. If the last paragraph of my letter is taken literally as it was expected to be, there can scarcely be any misunderstanding. In the letters of the same day addressed to you, care was taken to state that the children admitted to this preventorium would cease to be pupils of the schools where they had formerly been and there could be no further question of grant for Indian education in their cases. Rev. Father Brachet may present accounts at the rate of $1.00 per day for each child.\n\nThe reference in your letter to Doctor Bissett's recommendation is not quite clear, but I may repeat the Department's view and policy that it does not wish nor propose to have the preventorium used for the accommodation of children suffering from definitely active tuberculosis.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs\nJanuary 21, 1938.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nI would like to have sent to the Department Hospital at Pine Falls all the X-ray films taken by the Manitoba Sanitorium Clinic at the Fort Alexander Reserve last October.\n\nAs you know about 22% of the Indians show signs of T.B., and it is going to be practically essential for me to have these films where I can refer to them if I am to deal adequately with the problem of T.B.\n\nI, of course do not know if these films are the property of the Sanitorium or the property of the Department. If they belong to the Department no doubt they can be sent here without any trouble. If, however they actually belong to Ninette Sanitorium, procedure towards getting them will be somewhat different. In any event it is most desirable that we have them here, and if your department will secure them for us we will undertake to see that they are kept safely, and returned either to the department, or to the sanitorium authorities when requested. If it is necessary to discuss this matter with either Dr. Stone, or Dr. McGill, they will I know understand immediately the desirability of our having the films here.\n\nI hope within the next two weeks to be able to draw up a definite scheme for the control of T.B. on this reserve and submit the same for suggestions and approval to the director of the Department.\n\nJust another point I note in the letter written by Mr. MacInnes to the Rev. Father Plourde that mention is made of a recognized specialist in T.B. being available especially in regard to the preventorium work. Is Dr. Adamson the specialist referred to, and if so will I be able to have the advice and assistance of Dr. Adamson in regard to general T.B. work among the Indians in my charge.\n\nIncidentally, for your information I might say that I am now doing some work in chest surgery at the St. Boniface Sanitorium under the direction of Dr. Olson surgeon in charge there.\n\nMedical Superintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nRE: Preventorium at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nThis building is now completed and furnished. As you inspected it with me it is not necessary for me to point out that it is a most attractive and well laid out little institution.\n\nIn the report made by the Minette Sanitorium Clinic in regard to the children attending the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, there is specifically mentioned some twenty seven children who have signs and stigma of T.B. in some form, although the report says that they are not necessarily present or active disease.\n\nI went over these children and find that they are all under weight, a number of them also need their Tonsils removed.\n\nI have a copy of a letter dated July 6th, 1937, written to Rev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, and signed by T.R.L. MacInnes, acting director of Indian Affairs. This letter deals with the construction and operation of the preventorium, new completed at Fort Alexander, and in paragraph three it is intimated that thirty children will probably be the usual number of residence there. This paragraph has been specifically drawn to my attention by the Reverend Principal of the School.\n\nI have taken the children mentioned above, and placed them in this preventorium for observation, extra diet, etc., and just what period of time they will be there it is impossible at the moment to say. As soon as their weight and general condition picks up they will be placed once again with the regular school children.\n\nI have lately received a letter from Dr. McGill, and it is quite apparent that the Director is taking a personal interest in this preventorium. He has asked me to give it my closest attention, and draw up some scheme of operation, which\nI think might be to the advantage of the children, and he has also requested that I report directly to him. I feel that an institution of this type will be productive of some very real results, especially among those who, while they have not active T.B., yet are under weight, ill nourished, and show some signs of old T.B.\n\nI am going to lay out a routine plan for the care of these children, and personally visit this institution often. We intend to keep a very strict record of these children, and when we have a fairly well organized plan of procedure I will write Dr. McGill a complete report. Meanwhile I would like to know if I am carrying out the Department's wish in placing this group of children in the preventorium, and would appreciate your advice in this particular point.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMedical Superintendent.\n\nEDRB:FW\nPINE FALLS HOSPITAL\nLIMITED\n\nPINE FALLS, MANITOBA\nFebruary 5, 1938.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached you will find a copy of a letter written by me to the Rev. J. Brachet, Principal of the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, dated February 2, 1938, in connection with the Preventorium recently established at the Fort Alexander Indian School.\n\nFirst let me say that the children from other reserves about which you wrote me on December 22, 1937, have not as yet arrived. If, and when they do, provisions will be made to take care of them.\n\nUnder rules governing the admission of patients to the Preventorium, I might have added that no Non-Catholic child will be admitted, except on direct request of the department. It is too bad that this type of institution is not open to all the children on the reserve, as there are a great many who would certainly benefit by being admitted. I am anxious to know if I have met your wishes in placing this particular group of children in the Preventorium. I discussed with the Medical men who conducted the T. B. clinic, the advisability of placing these particular children in the Preventorium for special care and diet, and they agreed that unquestionably it would prove of much good. We intend to keep a very careful record of all these children, in order that you may be able to judge as to the effectiveness of this type of an institution for Indian children, who are T. B. contacts, and whose general health is somewhat below par.\n\nCould the Department arrange to have a Dentist visit periodically, in order to see that the children's teeth are kept in good order. I am requisitioning from the Department, a Scale with measuring rod, clinical thermometers, hospital charts, and some extra Cod Liver Oil, and Iron Tonic, which I hope you will be able to supply for the Preventorium.\n\nI would appreciate greatly your advice in regard to the general set up of the Preventorium, especially as to the daily routine for these children, and if there is any special line of treatment or procedure you would like me to carry out I will be glad to co-operate fully.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMedical Officer.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-25, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nPINE FALLS HOSPITAL\nLIMITED\n\nPINE FALLS, MANITOBA\nFebruary 2, 1938.\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal, Fort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nFort Alexander, Manitoba.\n\nRe Preventorium\n\nDear Father Brachet:\n\nUnder date of December 22nd, 1937, I received a letter from the director of Indian Affairs, Dr. McGill, in regard to the above institution. As you will note from his letter, (which I have shown you), Dr. McGill is taking a personal interest in this institution. Just what financial aid has been provided by the department I do not know, consequently we must, consistent with giving adequate care to the children, keep a close eye on expenditures. The success or failure of this institution will apparently have a decided bearing on the department's policy in respect to the establishment of similar institutions elsewhere. We must therefore use every effort towards seeing that children admitted are given every chance to benefit during the timespent in the institution, and it follows that complete and careful records of each child be kept for the Department's later information as well as for our own guidance in the matter of treatment.\n\nThe following is an outline for the general conduct of the Preventorium. Although we will probably find as time goes by that it will be necessary to modify it. Personally I consider this work among Indian children of vital importance, as in such a Preventorium the child is removed from danger of infection, and by improving his health we increase his resistance to any infection which he has already received, and prevent the development of clinical or active TB.\n\nRules Governing Admission to Preventorium: No child with TB of the lungs is to be admitted, nor any with a discharging tuberculous wound, nor any child which by reason of any discharge or excretion might be considered a menace to others.\n\nChildren from Other than Fort Alexander Reserves: These children will be detained at the Fort Alexander Indian Hospital, Pine Falls, for a complete examination, prior to being admitted to the Preventorium. This examination to include an X-ray of the chest, and when found necessary inoculation for Small Pox, Diphtheria, etc. Experience shows also that children with large and diseased Tonsils are slow in making recovery from any illness, and are also found to be largely the cause of the prevalence of colds in institutions, consequently in these cases Tonsil operations will be done. In connection with these operations it is necessary to have the consent of the parents. Would you therefore be good enough to ask the Rev. Fathers in charge of such schools as may send children to the Preventorium, to secure, and forward to you the written consent of the parents of such children, to have Tonsil and Adenoid operations done where deemed necessary.\n\nClinical Records to be Kept: I have provided from the supplies of the Fort Alexander Hospital regular hospital charts for your use. On admission, Charts must show the child's family history, especially in regard to TB. Also the weight, height, and temperature, with the pulse rate. Temperatures should be taken twice daily, and\nnoted on the chart. Each child should be accurately weighed once a week, and weight noted on the chart. It is exceedingly important that these records be kept as they will give us the best indication as to whether the children are improving or otherwise.\n\nI am asking the department to supply the Preventorium the following:\n\n1. Scale with measuring rod attached.\n2. 3 dozen Clinical Thermometers.\n3. A supply of Iron Tonic and Cod Liver Oil.\n4. Sufficient hospital charts for a year's use.\n\nNow as to the ordinary operation of the Preventorium, the following is a suggested Daily Routine.\n\n7 A.M. Children Arise\u2014Wash, dress, and make their beds.\nTemperatures taken and noted on their charts. Examination is made for any acute infection. If any adverse signs are found the child is to be removed to the isolation ward provided for that purpose, and the Medical Officer notified.\n\n7:50 A.M. Breakfast.\n8:25 A.M. Dental Toilet\n8:30 A.M. School\n10:30 A.M. Return from school and play outside until 11:45 A.M.\n12 P.M. Noon Meal\n12:30 P.M. Rest period for one hour.\n1:30 P.M. School\u2014One hour\n2:30 P.M. Afternoon lunch, play outside until 4:30 P.M.\n5 P.M. Evening Meal\n5:45 P.M. Shower Baths, evening temperature, (which is noted on the chart.)\n7 P.M. To bed.\n\nI am attaching a suggested typical menu for a week. This can be modified where necessary.\n\nMedication: Each child is to have a tablespoon of Cod Liver Oil twice a day, and a Teaspoon of Iron Tonic once a day, routinely. In addition it would be advisable around the noon period to have each child take a sun bath for about 15 or 20 minutes.\n\nDentistry: I will ask the department to arrange to have a Dentist make periodic visits to the school in order to see that the children's teeth are kept in proper order.\n\nSchool work: I would suggest that during the warm months that an open air class room be set up. This could be done near the school on the river bank, and I believe will be found of definite value. In addition to the ordinary class work could you arrange to have classes given in basketry, sewing, fish net making, shoe repairing, and some modelling and painting to those who show special aptitude for that type of work. Nature talks and the life history of Native birds, flowers, and insects, giving special attention to those insects which are a pest in gardens would be instructive as well as interesting. I will be glad to assist your staff by taking over some of these nature study lessons myself, if you think it will be of any assistance. In addition to the above, if you could arrange with one of your staff to give ordinary Setting Up exercises daily it would be of advantage.\n\nBuilding: The Preventorium, as I feel admirably suited for its purpose. There is a large unobstructed, heated basement, (60 x 32), in which Setting Up exercises and talks can be given. The window space is ample to provide for necessary ventilation with abundant sunshine. The screen, glassed in verandah will be an excellent location for certain children to sleep out on during part of the year.\n\nAs you know the 27 children in the Preventorium have all been examined by the Ninette Sanitorium Travelling Clinic, and are all TB contacts, all under weight, and have all been described by the clinic as having evidence of TB, but not necessarily of present or active disease.\nI will visit the preventorium weekly, and between visits should any emergency arise kindly advise me.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of this letter to Dr. McGill, Director of Indian Affairs for his information, criticisms, and advice.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMedical Officer\n\nHDR: FW\n| Monday          | Tuesday         | Wednesday       | Thursday        | Friday          |

what can be planned for during the next twelve months, I feel able to discuss your letters of January 21st to Mr. Hamilton, and of February 5th to Dr. McGill.\n\nThis is the third cut and out Preventorium unit we have got into operation. All have developed along certain lines suitable to local conditions, and you appear to have utilized this one for what seemed to you a good immediate purpose. I am glad you have put it to use, and will only ask you to consider the following principles as essential. Beyond them, we do not want to impose any hard and fast rules.\n\n1. It is settled policy to keep within the school framework and therefore the religious framework, children who will return to normal school routine within not more than two years and, preferably, one year or less.\n\n2. It is equally settled policy to remove from the schools, and so from religious auspices, those children who definitely require sanatorium treatment.\n\nThe former group continues to be subject to that section of the Indian Act which says that a Roman Catholic child must not be compelled (is in practice allowed) to go to a Protestant school, and vice versa. The latter group are subject to no such law, but are subject to the consent of their parents as to where they may go or be sent.\n\n3. We do not want Preventoria to become Sanatoria.\n\n4. The Fort Alexander institution will serve the three R.C. Residential Schools in Manitoba, those at Fort Frances, McIntosh and Kenora in Ontario, and any R.C. Day Schools which can be got under tuberculosis control.\n\n5. As the very object of a Preventorium is to make weak children strong, you are carrying out the principle by using yours for the twenty-seven children, but we do not want it to become a hospital, nor a place where the school can get a higher revenue for pupils who only require observation, without any special care. Our guide in this must be the best tuberculosis opinion we can get, and so, we want to share your and our responsibility by getting periodical inspections by the specialist.\n\nE.D.R. Bissett, Esq., M.D.,\nPine Falls,\nManitoba.\n\nWe want to.........\n6. We want to leave sanatorium work to those who are now doing it, at least until such time as they cannot meet the demand. For this reason, we want to turn over sanatorium cases to the Manitoba Sanatorium Board, much as we do mental patients to the Provincial Mental Service. We shall accept any disposal they can make of them.\n\n7. We want, in the final settled program, to do for Indians about what white people are now doing for themselves and one another. With due regard to the possibility of doing anything, or much, for certain remote groups, we want to keep down the overhead cost. This year has been experimental and fact finding in a large degree. You can't go wrong if you deal with adult Fort Alexander Indians much as you do with the people of Pine Falls. As they come under your notice you will try to get a final diagnosis on suspected tuberculosis, and we will try to find room and money for their sanatorium treatment. We cannot expect, at one jump, to go from almost no tuberculosis service to one which the white people have not attained.\n\nBeyond this, however, we want to get as complete control of tuberculosis among children as we can, hence the preventorium and the preference all along the line for children.\n\nWe shall have some new money after April 1st, sufficient I should say, at first sight, to do about a quarter of what might be done. So far as possible, I want to utilize the utmost possible proportion for treatment, and the least necessary for diagnosis and other overhead costs. I am asking you to incur any of the latter sort of costs grudgingly, and if there is any caution to be enjoined on your letter of February 2nd to Father Brackett, it is along this line. I think the outline of it is admirable, for a start at least.\n\nYou may think all these replies very general in tone, but we don't want to lay down hard and fast rules on details, and, up to about the last week, have not known whether any of the things we have undertaken would be gone on with, extended or abandoned.\n\nI may see you in about two weeks, if a half-formed plan of going west should come off.\n\nYou had best get the Principal to ask the Agent for the Dentist.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.L. Stone, M.D.,\nSuperintendent of Medical Services.\nDear Doctor Bissett:\n\nBeing now in a somewhat better position to forecast what can be planned for during the next twelve months, I feel able to discuss your letters of January 21st to Mr. Hamilton, and of February 5th to Dr. McGill.\n\nThis is the third out and out Preventorium unit we have got into operation. All have developed along certain lines suitable to local conditions, and you appear to have utilized this one for what seemed to you a good immediate purpose. I am glad you have put it to use, and will only ask you to consider the following principles as essential. Beyond them, we do not want to impose any hard and fast rules.\n\n1. It is settled policy to keep within the school framework and therefore the religious framework, children who will return to normal school routine within not more than two years and, preferably, one year or less.\n\n2. It is equally settled policy to remove from the schools, and so from religious auspices, those children who definitely require sanatorium treatment.\n\nThe former group continues to be subject to that section of the Indian Act which says that a Roman Catholic child must not be compelled (is in practice allowed) to go to a Protestant school, and vice versa. The latter group are subject to no such law, but are subject to the consent of their parents as to where they may go or be sent.\n\n3. We do not want Preventoria to become Sanatoria.\n\n4. The Fort Alexander institution will serve the three R.C. Residential Schools in Manitoba, those at Fort Frances, McIntosh and Kenora in Ontario, and any R.C. Day Schools which can be got under tuberculosis control.\n\n5. As the very object of a Preventorium is to make weak children strong, you are carrying out the principle by using yours for the twenty-seven children, but we do not want it to become a hospital, nor a place where the school can get a higher revenue for pupils who only require observation, without any special care. Our guide in this must be the best tuberculosis opinion we can get, and so, we want to share your and our responsibility by getting periodical inspections by the specialist.\n\nWe want to...........\n\nE.D.R. Bissett, Esq., M.D.,\nPine Falls,\nManitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-25, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n6. We want to leave sanatorium work to those who are now doing it, at least until such time as they cannot meet the demand. For this reason, we want to turn over sanatorium cases to the Manitoba Sanatorium Board, much as we do mental patients to the Provincial Mental Service. We shall accept any disposal they can make of them.\n\n7. We want, in the final settled program, to do for Indians about what white people are now doing for themselves and one another, with due regard to the possibility or doing anything or much, for certain remote groups. We want to keep down the overhead cost. This year has been experimental and fast finding in a large degree. You can't go wrong if you deal with adult Fort Alexander Indians much as you do with the people of Pine Falls. As they come under your notice you will try to get a final diagnosis on suspected tuberculosis, and we will try to find room and money for their sanatorium treatment. We cannot expect, at one jump, to go from almost no tuberculosis service to one which the white people have not attained.\n\nBeyond this, however, we want to get as complete control of tuberculosis among children as we can, hence the preventorium and the preference all along the line for children.\n\nWe shall have some new money after April 1st, sufficient, I should say, at first sight, to do about a quarter of what might be done. So far as possible, I want to utilize the utmost possible proportion for treatment, and the least necessary for diagnosis and other overhead costs. I am asking you to incur any of the latter sort of costs grudgingly, and if there is any caution to be enjoined on your letter of February 2nd to Father Brachet, it is along this line. I think the outline of it is admirable, for a start at least.\n\nYou may think all these replies very general in tone, but we don't want to lay down hard and fast rules on details, and, up to about the last week, have not known whether any of the things we have undertaken would be gone on with, extended or abandoned.\n\nI may see you in about two weeks, if a half-formed plan of going west should come off.\n\nYou had best get the Principal to ask the Agent for the Dentist.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.L.

(RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-25, part 1)\nApril 20, 1938\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will recall discussion about securing the services of one of the officers of the Manitoba Sanatorium Board to make periodical visits to the Fort Alexander Indian Reserve to consult with Doctor Bissett, the management of the preventorium at Fort Alexander Indian Residential School. Several suggestions have been received that Dr. J. D. Adamson should be asked to do this work, and the Department would indeed be pleased to have him, if there is no objection on the part of the Board. It will be within your authority to make an arrangement at such reasonable or nominal fee as may be decided upon for a visit to the Reserve.\n\nThe immediate situation is that the preventorium has about 27 inmates. Four are entered as regular preventorium patients at a tentative rate of $1.00 per day and the remainder at 25 cents per day in addition to the per capita grant for education. The building, it is believed, was designed for a capacity of 20. The account for the month of March was $325.00, which seems rather a severe tax on the funds for tuberculosis. I do not like to ask you to go to Fort Alexander, but if you can find time to do so it might be advisable.\n\nThe Department is not complaining of the situation. The Development of the preventorium could not be foreseen in detail, but it is necessary that it should now be reviewed and get on a good operating basis which will\n\nA. G.

(RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-25, part 1)\nDr. E.L. Stone  \nDirector of Medical Services  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa\n\nDear Dr. Stone:\n\nI had occasion last week to meet Father Brochet, Principal of the Fort Alexander school and also Director of the Preventorium. He informed me that he has only four children that might be classed as preventorium cases. Three of these come from Sandy Bay and one from the Fort Alexander reserve. So far he has received no children from Camperville, Fort Frances, Kenora or McIntosh.\n\nIf all the children in the above schools and districts who were declared preventorium cases were to be sent to Fort Alexander the Preventorium would be more than filled. My purpose in writing you today is to acquaint you with the facts in the case and to urge upon you if you deem it advisable the necessity of fairly prompt action if we wish the Preventorium to fulfill the purpose for which it was erected.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-25, part 1)\nMay 3, 1938\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 26 I may say that the Department has long since given instructions that the Preventorium cases from the four residential schools you mention be removed to Fort Alexander. The instruction was made conditional on the consent of the parents and as you point out, none of the cases from these four schools have gone. Some light is shed on the matter by a report just now received from the Indian Agent, Fort Frances that he has not been able to induce any of the parents to allow their children to go. The sentiment among them in that neighbourhood appears to be that \"they would rather see them die here than send them away and have them die at Fort Alexander\".\n\nIt appears to me that something might be accomplished by missionary work on the part of the school Principals if the Indians at other places had the same views as those at Kenora. Perhaps you are in the best position of anyone to request the Principals to do what they can in this direction. At the same time the Department will see what can be done through the Indian Agents and Medical Officers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nGeneral Superintendent,\nOblate Catholic Indian Missions,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nE. L. Stone, M. B.\nSuperintendent of Medical Services\n\nIM\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 5-413 of April 27 I may say that the Department is very discouraged at the attitude of the parents of the children recommended to the Preventorium section of the school at Fort Alexander. Far from there being any likelihood of the children dying at Fort Alexander, the Preventorium there has been set up as a place where they will receive even better care and attention than they could have in any ordinary residential school where they will be among children of their own kind, have ample rest and no work and where every effort will be made to produce happy surroundings for them. If there was any prospect of these children dying or even becoming bed cases, the Department would not think of sending them to any school.\n\nThis appears to be a matter in which the Indian Agent, Medical Officers and school principals should all combine to explain to the Indians the true facts. The Church which operates the Fort Alexander School has very kindly spent a good deal of money in providing this institution and the Department has furnished it also at considerable expense. It hopes that this kindness and thoughtfulness will not be defeated by the very persons for whose benefit it was intended. While this letter is addressed to you, copies are being sent to other Indian Agents who will gather from it what the Department would like them to do at their Agencies.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRenora, Ont.\n\nE.

Though most of these children appear to have been discharged before the 7th of that month, it seems remarkable that so many should have been retained during the holidays. The officers of the Manitoba Sanatorium Board recently visited the school and the Department would like their comment before this account is paid. Perhaps you would be kind enough to communicate with Dr. J. D. Adamson in this connection.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. L. Stone, M.B.\nFor Secretary\n\nE. McPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nLM\nSelkirk, Man., August 27th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 125-1-25 of the 12th instant, please be advised that we took this matter up with Dr. J.D.

(RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-25, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nDr. J.G. Wherrett, Secretary of the Canadian Tuberculosis Association, reports having discussed the Fort Alexander Preventorium with Doctor Adamson on a recent visit to Winnipeg. Doctor Wherrett said there was still some doubt as to the principles which should govern the administration of this institution and suggested that definite regulations should be laid down by the Department.\n\nIt was thought that this matter would have been settled fairly satisfactorily by your consultations with the Manitoba Sanatorium Board last Spring and I must say that it is difficult for the Department to lay down more than a very general ruling if it has not to run the danger of making regulations which may not turn out to be satisfactory.\n\nIt is the Department's intention that the preventorium shall be used for the benefit of Roman Catholic children suitable for treatment in it, and coming from any district within a reasonable distance from its location. This would include the whole of the Province of Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario as far East as Kenora and Sioux Lookout and the areas from which Indians come to those places. It was anticipated last year that there would be at least twenty candidates\n\nA.G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDW\nfor treatment from the Sioux Lookout and Kenora Districts, but the Department made the error of consulting the parents over the disposal of the children who were already school pupils. That will not be done again. The suitable candidates for the preventorium should have positive tuberculin skin reactions, should be in some danger of becoming actively tuberculous, but should not have the disease in a communicable form. Perhaps one way of expressing this would be that their bodily discharges should not contain tubercle bacilli. They might have indications of early tuberculosis, or be convalescent from sanatorium or more active treatment. They should not be bed patients in the ordinary sense of that term.\n\nTheir admission and discharge should be decided upon in consultation between the local medical officer, either at Fort Alexander or elsewhere, and one of the medical officers for the sanatorium board. This consultation might, in some cases, have to be carried out by mail. Admissions and discharges should be finally authorized by you and it is undesirable that there should be frequent admissions from and discharges to residential schools after the early part of the school term, unless an exchange can be made between the preventorium and the school without affecting the number of grant earning pupils in the school.\n\nPupils admitted to the preventorium from the Fort Alexander School will remain on the school roll and the Department will pay 25\u00a2 per day in addition to the grant for education. Pupils from other schools will be struck off the strength of the schools, may be replaced by other children, and the Department will pay the Preventorium authorities $1.00 per day,\nsubject to adjustment of this rate after audit of the expenditure by the departmental auditor.\n\nThe staff of the preventorium must include one graduate nurse and provision must be made for limited school instruction. It is requested that you and Dr. J.D. Adamson act as a committee with any other persons whom you may wish to bring into it, to decide with the preventorium on the suitability of the staff provided, the food and care made available, and other details of the actual operation of the institution. Presumably you will wish to add to this committee Dr. E.D.R. Bissett.\n\nImmediate medical supervision of the preventorium will be carried out by Dr. E.D.R. Bissett, to whose compensation the amount of $300.00 has recently been added, partly to provide for this duty.\n\nIn laying down these principles the Department wishes to avoid imposing them, or any of them upon you in so strict a form that the effective operation of the institution may be interfered with. If, therefore, in any respect they are not suitable or workable, you may vary them in consultation with the members of the committee referred to above. In any event, the Department would like to be informed of the rules laid down so that, by its approval, it may strengthen your authority in having them carried out. It thinks that Doctor Adamson or any available medical officer of the sanatorium board should be asked to visit the preventorium about once monthly, or as required, and is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this service.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to pay for the maintenance in this institution of school pupils or other children who have no tuberculosis, even though they may be below the average standard of health in other respects. That situation occurred...\nduring the last term, but the time has obviously passed when it should be permitted to continue.\n\nIt may well be that this letter does not cover the whole field and that other aspects of the problem may have to be decided on the ground. It may also be said that few institutions reach their best standard of operation within the first few months of their existence and the Department will be well satisfied if its hopes are realized within the course of the present school year.\n\nAn earnest endeavour has been made in this letter to cover the whole ground, but it may be well to add that the children admitted to this preventorium need not necessarily have been residential school pupils. Its object is to prevent the progress of tuberculosis among Roman Catholic children to a point where they will become sanatorium cases.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls, Man.,\nSeptember 23rd, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Preventorium - July & August.\n\nIn answer to the inquiry of the Department regarding the care of some pupils in the preventorium during the month of July, I beg to say that we had no directions from the Department. Dr. Biscott, however, insisted on keeping during the holidays all the pupils cared for in the preventorium.\n\nRegarding the three pupils brought to the preventorium from Sandy Bay, one, Marie Louise Beaulieu, was found to be well enough to be discharged and I brought her back to Sandy Bay at the end of June. The two others, according to the report of the Ninette Clinic, had to be kept in, and we did keep them throughout the holidays. The others were taken out by their parents in turns. This account for a few days marked on some patients. We regretted, however, that some went away. Annie Sutherland, for instance, lost 10 lbs. during her holidays.\n\nI may add that for the month of August we have only on the report the two pupils from Sandy Bay, Louisa Malcolm & Harry Houle. The two others, who have each 4 and 3 days to their name, were brought back before the end of the holidays.\n\nTrusting this explanation will make matters plain, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nRev. J. Bradt, C.M., Principal.\n\nE. McPherson, Indian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSelkirk, Man., Oct. 4th. 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter No. 125-1-25 of August 12th, please be advised that Dr. J.D. Adamson visited the preventorium in May last, at which time he examined thirty-two children.\n\nWe also wrote to Rev. J. Brachet for an explanation of his account for the month of July, and enclose herewith a copy of his reply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nEM/FL\n| Name of Patient | School | Age | Sex | Date of Admission | Remarks |\n|-----------------|--------|-----|----|------------------|---------|\n| Louise Beloche | Sandy Bay School | 16 | girl | 12/4/38 | 30 Running temperature |\n| Annie Sutherland | Fort Alexander | 14 | - | 1/1/38 | 27 Lost weight during holidays |\n| Harry Houte | Sandy Bay School | 9 | boy | 12/4/38 | 30 General improvement |\n| Thomas Moore | Campbellville School | 9 | - | 10/9/38 | 13 Running temperature |\n| Leon Courchene | Fort Alexander | 9 | - | 7/3/38 | 24 Running temperature |\n| Cyril Courchene | Fort Alexander | 8 | - | 7/3/38 | 24 Running temperature |\n| Madeleine Bonhard | Fort Alexander School | 14 | girl | 7/4/38 | 30 Lost weight during holidays |\n| Elizabeth Galwood | - | - | - | - | 30 |\n| Doris Beecus | - | - | - | - | 25 Dying well |\n| Doris Garthstone | - | - | - | - | 30 Lost weight during holidays |\n| Zelda Fontaine | - | - | - | - | 30 Running temperature |\n| Jackie Fontaine | - | - | - | - | 27 Running temperature |\n| Sarah Beecus | - | - | - | - | 29 Running temperature |\n| Antoinette Galwood | - | - | - | - | 30 Running temperature |\n| Zelida Fontaine | - | - | - | - | 27 Lost weight during holidays |\n| Virginia Grayeyes | - | - | - | - | 30 Running temperature |\n| Jean Beecus | - | - | - | - | 35 Running temperature |\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this connection I have to refer to the Department's letter of September 21 and to a considerable number of previous communications defining the principles on which children were to be admitted to the Preventorium and maintained there at additional expense over the per capita grant for education.\n\nExamination of the accounts for these two months shows that in September, six, and October, seven, children from various schools appear to have been treated in the preventorium for reasons relating to the principle under which the institution was set up. In each month a much larger number, all from the Fort Alexander school are shown as having been accommodated in the Preventorium for reasons which are not apparent.\n\nI do not think the Department can make payment of these accounts until the matter is got on a more satisfactory basis, in accordance with the Department's instructions of September 21.

MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\nGR\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, MAN., January 7th, 1929.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to refer to your letter dated December 5th, file 125-1-25 and to say that I accompanied Dr. Adamson to the Fort Alexander School on December 30th. The trip was somewhat delayed but the Doctor was unable to leave prior to that date.\n\nThe roads were very heavy from Pine Falls to the school and it was necessary to hire a special livery for this trip.\n\nThe eight pupils without positive tuberculin reaction have been discharged and at present there are 27 receiving special care. Dr. Adamson is reporting on the situation but in my opinion there is little ground for criticism as to the situation now stands. If this 'preventorium' is to be operated as outlined by Dr. Adamson it will require additional equipment and staff etc. will be almost a 'sanatorium'. I do not know if the school authorities are willing to do this. The Rev. principal feels that an institution of this nature, operated in conjunction with a school, will change the environment and make the preventorium children restless, thus preventing their rapid return to health. He also intimated that, if carried out, the present financial arrangement would be insufficient.\n\nDr. Bissett acted on Circular 706-778 dated August 5th and made his admissions from the previous clinic report. I did not advise Dr. Bissett of letter 125-1-25 dated September 21st but did advise Doctors Adamson, Ross and Jackson and Mr. McEachern. The circular made clear to me that the Provincial Tuberculosis Clinic was to be used if available and Dr. Bissett knew the clinic would later be making a return visit to the school.\n\nAs pointed out above, I feel we can offer very little criticism other than with regard to the eight pupils and even in these cases I believe Dr. Bissett acted in the interest of the children, and felt that three or four months special care would tide them past a possible breakdown.\n\nThe clinic has recommended fourteen pupils. Four have not yet arrived but we hope to secure their admission. We have not received any, as yet, from Ontario. Discharges can be affected any time to accommodate new admissions.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6266, file 579-25, part 1)\nI feel we have the hearty co-operation of the Rev. Principal. I also believe Dr. Bissett has acted in good faith and is interested in the work. He appeared willing to co-operate in whatever plan of work the Department definitely outlines.\n\nUnder separate cover, I am forwarding a voucher in favour of Dr. Adamson, amounting to $50.00. This covers mileage and professional services.\n\nI think, if this work is to continue, the Department would do well to definitely engage Dr. Adamson to supervise the preventorium and if this were done, I am sure that within a few months the institution could be made to fill the Departments' expectations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Preventorium at Fort Alexander.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton,\n\nTo supplement and confirm our conversation on the above subject, I wish to make the following comments:\n\nThree questions immediately arise, namely:\n\n1. Are there enough suitable cases to fill thirty beds?\n2. Would the Preventorium plan really make a substantial contribution to the Indian tuberculosis problem?\n3. If not, how can the plan be improved?\n\nI shall deal with each of these problems separately.\n\n1. Are there available cases?\n\nIt is presumed that the proposed unit will be run along the lines usually implied by the word \"Preventorium\", i.e., the inmates will all be in the following classes:\n\na. They shall be of school age, i.e., six to sixteen and of both sexes.\nb. They shall not have open tuberculous lesions of any sort and will therefore be non-infectious.\nc. They shall all be fit for ambulant treatment and will be up and about most of the time.\nd. They shall not require intensive medical or surgical treatment.\n\nThe above is the usual conception of a Preventorium case. It will be found that very few such cases are actually in territory tributary to Fort Alexander.\n\nA real Preventorium case is not really a clinical entity. It is an abstraction built on the assumption that doctors can predict by examination what children are likely to contract tuberculosis. This is, of course, not so. It is certainly true that children who have had contact with open tuberculosis are the only ones who ultimately get tuberculosis. But all contacts cannot be cared for in an institution. Even if they were, there is no assurance that there would ultimately be less tuberculosis among them. The same applies to those with a positive tuberculin test and those with healed childhood lesions. The possibility that contact with open tuberculosis would be broken for children in a Preventorium might operate in their favor. This breaking of contact should, however, be accomplished for all Indian children in\nboarding schools without providing separate buildings. This could be done by frequent tuberculin tests and x-ray examinations.\n\n2. Would the Preventorium plan make a substantial contribution to the Indian tuberculosis problem?\n\nThe death rate in infants\u2014which is said to be high\u2014would obviously be unaffected. Also just as many would be infected up to going to school. While in the Preventorium there would presumably be less spread of infection. This would, however, probably not be absolute. Among thirty suspects or alleged closed cases there would always be some who would become \"open\". Indeed the criteria by which we have previously judged cases to be \"Open\" or \"closed\" have recently been brought into question. In any event, a very close scrutiny would need to be kept to prevent spread in the institution.\n\nBut suppose no such spread took place, what will be the position of these children when discharged to their old environment at the age of fifteen or sixteen? Will the fact that they have been in Preventorium prevent them from breaking down at the usual age (sixteen to thirty-five)? Probably not. Since a larger number than usual will possibly be tuberculin negative, the reverse may quite possibly happen; i.e., they may be more susceptible.\n\nThe crux of the whole tuberculosis problem in Indians is no different than in whites, i.e., sources of contamination must be removed by treatment and isolation. The Preventorium plan does not do this and it would seem a misuse of funds if they were spent on anything so fantastic when there are so many other urgent necessities.\n\n3. Can the plan be improved?\n\nAn institution at Fort Alexander might possibly contribute something if it went right out to treat tuberculosis among young Indians in the ordinary way. It might be arranged that patients be sent into Sanatorium for a few weeks or months observation and when considered suitable be transferred to Fort Alexander where they could continue modified Sanatorium care and pneumothorax if necessary. Even then I feel that there would never be enough of school age Indian children to fill thirty beds. However, I suppose the age limit for inmates could be changed. Such an institution, properly supervised, might develop into a very useful organization.\n\nThe plans of the new building which you showed me are quite good except that there are no single wards whatever, and when one is treating many children facilities for isolation is imperative otherwise you would be almost always harassed with inter-current infectious diseases.\n\nI hope you will not consider these opinions as being merely destructive. They are offered in complete candor and sincerity and I think the opinions given are those\ngenerally held by all those experienced in the treatment of tuberculosis.\n\nI feel that this whole matter should be referred to the Committee recently appointed in Ottawa for the consideration of the Indian problem in Canada.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.D. Adamson, M.D.,\nMedical Director.\n\nJDA1CP\nST. BONIFACE SANATORIUM\nST. VITAL, MAN.\n\nJanuary 5, 1938.\n\nE. L. Stone, Esq., M.D.,\nDirector of Medical Services,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Stone,\n\nIn accordance with your suggestion, Inspector A. G. Hamilton and I visited the Fort Alexander Preventorium on December 30, 1937.\n\nI examined the records and the x-ray reports of the 27 children now in. They all have demonstrable tuberculous lesions which are healed or healing, and none of them can be called open cases in the ordinary sense, and none of them require care in a fully equipped Sanatorium. Some of them may at times produce tubercle bacilli.\n\nThis situation is a very definite improvement over the one that existed when the Travelling Clinic examined the school in October, 1936, when of 34 children only 6 were considered to be proper cases and 8 were actually skin negative. According to Dr. Bissett and Father Brachet, these 34 were put in on the understanding that the institution was to be run on the original idea of Preventorium, i.e., it was to be used simply as a unit in which undernourished and generally run down children should be given extra food, rest and medical supervision. Their instructions apparently specifically stated that potentially infectious cases should not be admitted. These instructions are contained in a Head Quarter's circular letter No. 706778, September 21, 1936.\n\nSince the Travelling Clinic report (October 17, 1936) the 8 negative reactors have been discharged. Also, 10 \"spreader school\" cases, as selected by the Travelling Clinic, have been admitted. At present the large majority of the patients may be regarded as suitable cases for the institution.\n\nThe obvious objection to the present situation is that the new cases sent in are potential spreaders and might possibly contaminate the children in the school with whom they freely associate except with regard to sleeping quarters. If it is to be run as a \"spreader school\", arrangements for complete isolation from the other school should be made. It is obvious that this would require an extensive change in general routine and establishment. Separate dining room, class room and play grounds will be necessary, and these children should not be allowed to mix in any way with those of the larger school; also, a nurse or attendant with some training in tuberculosis should be available, and the treatment should be continued throughout the year and not simply for the school year.\n\nThese suggestions came as a surprise to Dr. Bissett and Father Brachet who apparently up to now considered that the procedure would be similar to that which was in vogue last year. I am convinced that when they selected the\nST. BONIFACE SANATORIUM\nST. VITAL, MAN.\n\nE. L. Stone, Esq., M.D. January 5, 1939.\n\nchildren at the beginning of the season they were both acting in accordance with what they considered to be the wishes of the Department, and I think it is true to say that neither of them had had any specific intimation of the change of procedure.\n\nTo reduce the danger of contamination I have suggested that in the meantime the Preventorium children should be separate in the dining room and use separate dishes.\n\nI did not go into details as to the extent or the expense of the changes that would be necessary if the Department is of the opinion that this Unit should be run strictly as a \"spreader school\". An estimate in this regard can be made.\n\nIf the Department is satisfied with the policy of a \"spreader school\", arrangements should be made to have the appropriate changes made. In the meantime such steps as are possible under the circumstances will be taken to prevent contact between the two groups of children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. Adamson, M.D.\n\nJDAOP\nST. BONIFACE SANATORIUM\nST. VITAL, MAN.\n\nJanuary 5, 1939.\n\nDr. E. L. Stone,\nDirector of Medical Services,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Stone,\n\nEnclosed please find my report on the Fort Alexander visit.\n\nI shall be very glad to assist the Department in any way I can in making this Unit a satisfactory one to all concerned. On the next occasion when we have a meeting of those interested in tuberculosis the whole question of the feasibility of running a real \"spreader school\" in that particular locality will be discussed. It probably can be done but it will likely be necessary to use other means to bring the children in from their homes.\n\nThe future plans in connection with this, I think, should be made in consultation with the Sanatorium Board. If the Department wishes me to act as their consultant I think they should have a definite understanding with the Sanatorium Board that I am acting in such capacity. I do not think that there is any likelihood of any objections to such an arrangement but I sometime would feel much more comfortable if the Sanatorium Board understood my position.\n\nWith kind regards, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

They all have demonstrable tuberculous lesions which are healed or healing, are not open cases in the ordinary sense and do not require care in a fully equipped sanatorium. They would include the children with enlarged hilar glands and the so called childhood type or primary infection type of pulmonary tuberculosis. Some of them may at times produce tubercle bacilli. Bone and joint cases which had been treated in a sanatorium, and were ambulant or on casts could be removed to this type of place for more economic care.\n\nI now quote from a report on this institution made to the Department on January 5, by Dr. J. D. Adamson, Winnipeg, a recognized authority on tuberculosis, with which report I fully concur:\n\n\"The obvious objection to the present situation is that the new cases sent in are potential spreaders and might possibly contaminate the children in the school with whom they freely associate except with regard to sleeping...\"\nquarters. If it is to be run as a \"spreader school\", arrangements for complete isolation from the other school should be made. It is obvious that this would require an extensive change in general routine and establishment. Separate dining room, class room and play grounds will be necessary, and these children should not be allowed to mix in any way with those of the larger school; also, a nurse or attendant with some training in tuberculosis should be available, and the treatment should be continued throughout the year and not simply for the school year.\"\n\nIt is not reasonable to remove children from one school because of the obvious danger they are to other pupils, and bring them to another school where they are in constant contact with the other children except for sleeping quarters.\n\nThe Reverend Principal of the school recognizes this fact, and asked me not to transfer the children from Western Ontario to the Preventorium until the question was settled and some more suitable way of caring for these cases found.\n\nI think I should point out the experience of Dr. Geo. Ferguson, in connection with these \"observation cases\" at Lebret school. While they were kept in the school, although under supposed segregation and special routine, twenty-five new cases of tuberculosis developed in one year. Since they have all been removed from the school, not a single new case has developed in more than two years.\n\nI do not believe the present Unit to be at all satisfactory and it is distinctly dangerous. Nor do I believe that alterations could be made to make it satisfactory. Such a Unit should be entirely separate and away from the school where non-tuberculous children are living.\n\nTherefore I recommend the abandonment of this Unit.\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D.\nAsst. Superintendent of Medical Services\nOttawa, March 6, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nAttached is a report received from Dr. F. E. Moore after his visit to the Fort Alexander Preventorium.\n\nI have discussed this matter at length with Mr. Hogg and Dr. Moore. Owing to illness Dr. Stone was unable to be present at the final discussion.

Hamilton and Dr. E. D. R. Bissett, a visit was made to the Fort Alexander Preventorium.\n\nAll the children in the Preventorium were examined, their x-ray plates (taken by the Travelling Clinic on May 10, 1939) having previously been read in collaboration with Dr. E. L. Ross and Dr. D. S. Scott. There has been a gratifying improvement in most of the children as judged by examination and plates. Below is given a nominal role with the disposals recommended:\n\n| Name               | Sex | Age | Disposal                                      |\n|--------------------|-----|-----|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Audy, Thomas       | M.  | 10  | Remain in Preventorium.                       |\n| Boubard, Madeleine | F.  | 14  | Retain in Preventorium.                      |\n| Bruyere, Alphonse  | M.  | 14  | Remain in Preventorium.                      |\n| Courchene, Cyril   | M.  | 8   | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Courchene, Eugene  | M.  | 7   | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Courchene, Leon    | M.  | 9   | Should be sent to St. Boniface Sanatorium for treatment of knee. |\n| Courchene, Stanford| M.  | 14  | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Fontaine, Adelard  | M.  | 9   | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Fontaine, Clifford | M.  | 10  | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Fontaine, Ernest   | M.  | 7   | Discharge to school after T. & A. operation. |\n| Fontaine, Freda    | F.  | 10  | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Fontaine, Lillian  | F.  | 9   | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Fontaine, Lucie    | F.  | 10  | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Girard, Verna      | F.  | 6   | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Guimond, Antoinette| F.  | 8   | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Guimond, Harry     | M.  | 12  | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Hardisty, Joseph   | M.  | 11  | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Houle, Harry       | M.  | 10  | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Macklin, Frances   | F.  | 11  | Retain in Preventorium.                      |\n| Martin, Leonard    | M.  | 9   | Discharge to School after T. & A. operation. |\n| Malcolm, Louisa    | F.  | 17  | Recommend Preventorium.                      |\n| Martin, Philip     | M.  | 13  | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Meccas, Doris      | F.  | 15  | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Sutherland, Alexander| M. | 11  | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Tait, Wilfrid      | M.  | 11  | Discharge to School.                         |\n| Tanner, Bertha     | F.  | 12  | Discharge to School after T. & A. operation. |\n| Tanner, Irene      | F.  | 4   | To Sanatorium for treatment - especially sinuses. |\n\nIndian Affairs.

McGill. - 2 - May 15, 1939.\n\nThe summary of these recommendations is as follows:\nTo go to Sanatorium - 2\nTo remain in Preventorium - 5.\nTo be discharged from Preventorium - 20.\n\nWe also examined 7 children from the school and two from the reserve. A nominal role and suggested disposal is given:\n\n| Name            | Sex | Age | Disposal                  |\n|-----------------|-----|-----|----------------------------|\n| Boubard, Catherine | F   | 11  | Admit to Preventorium.    |\n| Courchene, Agathe | F   | 11  | Admit to Preventorium.    |\n| Courchene, Angela | F   | 16  | No treatment.             |\n| Courchene, Dora  | F   | 11  | No treatment.             |\n| Courchene, Mary Jane | F | 17  | No treatment.             |\n| Courchene, Victor | M   | 15  | No treatment.             |\n| Fontaine, Alfred  | M   | 14  | No treatment.             |\n| Spence, Nora      | F   | 6   | No treatment.             |\n| Sutherland, Annie | F   | 14  | No treatment.             |\n\nThe significant recommendations are therefore:\n\n1. Five children should remain as preventorium cases and two others should be admitted. These children are potential carriers and require special supervision.\n\n2. Two children have been recommended for Sanatorium care. They can be definitely improved by treatment. Pending admission to Sanatorium they should remain in the Preventorium.\n\nThe discharge of the other children to the school or to their homes may well be delayed till the end of the school session. In this way their studies will not be broken into and duplication of transportation arrangements will be unnecessary.\n\nIt is recommended that those children selected for preventorium treatment shall remain in the institution throughout the summer and be re-examined for disposal before school opens in the fall. It would be unwise to allow them to return to their home environment after having brought them to their present improved condition by special supervision and care. In a few months most of them should be fit to resume their usual life; those who are not will likely need more energetic treatment in Sanatorium.\n\nI cannot speak too highly of the conscientious and intelligent efforts that Father Brachet and the Sisters have made in their attempt to assist these children. They have done the very best that could be done under the circumstances. They have implemented the suggestion that preventorium children should be segregated from the school children in the dining room and that they should have separate dishes. The children still mix freely with the other children in play and class.\nST. BONIFACE SANATORIUM\nST. VITAL, MAN.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill. - 5 - May 15, 1939.\n\nrooms. This is a definite hazard to the healthy school children. Under the circumstances this hazard has not been very great because very few are potential carriers. If the preventorium were filled next fall with real \"carriers\" the risk would be very serious, and the children in the school would be in no better position, so far as infection is concerned, than in their own homes.\n\nIt is urged that the Department arrange to make the Preventorium into a real \"carrier school\" or use it as a boarding school for healthy children. The latter alternative is probably preferable since surveys during the coming year will probably not discover a sufficient number of carrier cases who can be persuaded to come in. If all the known cases who are clinically carriers, but do not need full Sanatorium care, can be made to come in, and if proper facilities for segregation can be made, the institution might serve a useful purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD. Adamson, M.D.\n\nJDA:OP\nReverend Sir:\n\nDoctor Adamson has reported to the Department on his recent visit to the Preventorium and School.\n\nAfter full and careful consideration of the problems involved, the Department has decided to discontinue the operation of the preventorium at the end of the present school year. I believe you were given some intimation of this when Doctor Moore and Inspector Hamilton visited you last winter.\n\nDoctor Adamson has recommended the disposal of the children in the following manner, and it is the wish of the Department that this be carried out.\n\nThere are two children, Irene Tanner and L\u00e9on Courch\u00e8ne, who are to be sent to St. Boniface Sanatorium at once.\n\nThere are two children at present in the school, Catherine Boubard and Agathe Courch\u00e8ne, who should be admitted to the preventorium at once.\n\nOf the remaining children in the preventorium, they may all be kept there until the close of the school year when, with the following exceptions, they are to be discharged from the preventorium and henceforth regarded as ordinary school pupils. Before this is done in the case of three children, Ernest Fontaine, Leonard Martin, and Bertha Tanner, with the parents' consent, they are to be referred to Doctor Bissett to have their tonsils and adenoids removed........\n\nReverend J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPINE FALLS, Manitoba.\nremoved before they are discharged at the end of the school year.\n\nThe following pupils may be retained in the preventorium until next fall, before which time you will be further advised as to their disposal; that is, Thomas Audy, Madeleine Boubard, Alphonse Bruyere, Louise Malcolm, Frances MacKlin, Catherine Boubard, and Agathe Courchene.\n\nI wish on behalf of the Department to thank you, Father Brachet, and the Sisters for your conscientious and intelligent efforts to assist these children. Everyone feels that you have done the very best that could have been done under the circumstances.\n\nDoctor Bissett is being advised of the children who are recommended for operation, and Indian Agent McPherson will be notified and will arrange the transfer of the two patients to St. Boniface Sanatorium.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n\nN.N.\nExpenditure borne by the Oblate Fathers for the erection of the Preventorium near the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\n| Supplier                        | Item          | Amount   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------|----------|\n| Sprague Lumber Co.              | lumber        | $1635.14 |\n| Dowse                           | shavings      | 27.50    |\n| Granovsky                       | cement        | 397.62   |\n| Smith                           | hardware      | 591.23   |\n| Ashdown                         |               | 555.85   |\n| Crane                           | eaves         | 132.26   |\n| Decloux                         | Oakum         | 34.22    |\n| Marshall-W                      | soutan paper  | 5.70     |\n| Toupin                          | pipe posts    | 44.25    |\n| Minville                        | catch basins  | 38.00    |\n| Dominion Foundry                | hardwall      | 4.20     |\n| Granovsky Bros.                 | paint         | 171.50   |\n| Western Paint                   |               | 40.25    |\n| Pine Falls Garage                | freight       | 120.85   |\n| Gravel                          |               | 267.78   |\n|                                 |               | **4046.95** |\n\nP.

While at the preventorium Doctor Adamson should carefully examine all the children there with a view to discharging them. Any who are passed as fit should be returned to the regular school. Any that need more active treatment should be considered for admission either to the Pine Falls hospital or to sanatorium. There will still probably be a few children of the type for which the place is intended. These children may be left in the preventorium for the time being.\"\n\nYou will note, according to the Department's letter, that any children who were passed as fit should be returned to the regular school. I think you will agree that, after the careful examination made by the clinic and Dr. Adamson, the twenty pupils reported in good condition should now be in a regular school for the balance of the school year. As soon as it is possible to obtain the consent of the parents and the authority of the Department, the other two cases should be sent to the St. Boniface Sanatorium. Is it possible for you to secure the consent of the parents? I do not think this arrangement would necessitate any special trips until all the children are discharged in June.

Below is given a nominal role with the disposals recommended:\n\n| Name          | Sex | Age | Disposal                                      |\n|---------------|-----|-----|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Andy, Thomas  | M   | 10  | Remain in Preventorium                        |\n| Beaubard, Madeline | F   | 14  | do                                            |\n| Bruyere, Alphonse | M   | 14  | do                                            |\n| Courchene, Cyril | M   | 8   | Discharge to school                           |\n| Courchene, Eugene | M   | 7   | do                                            |\n| Courchene, Leon | M   | 9   | Should be sent to St. Boniface Sanatorium for treatment of knee |\n| Courchene, Stanford | M   | 14  | Discharge to School                           |\n| Fontaine, Adelard | M   | 9   | do                                            |\n| Fontaine, Clifford | M   | 10  | do                                            |\n| Fontaine, Ernest | M   | 7   | Discharge to School after T. & A. operation   |\n| Fontaine, Freda | F   | 10  | Discharge to School                           |\n| Fontaine, Lillias | F   | 9   | do                                            |\n| Fontaine, Lucie | F   | 10  | do                                            |\n| Girard, Verna | F   | 6   | do                                            |\n| Guimond, Antoinette | F   | 8   | do                                            |\n| Guimond, Harry | M   | 12  | do                                            |\n| Hardisty, Joseph | M   | 11  | do                                            |\n| Houle, Harry | M   | 10  | do                                            |\n| Macklin, Frances | F   | 11  | Remain in Preventorium                        |\n| Martin, Leonard | M   | 9   | Discharge to School after T. & A. operation   |\n| Malcolm, Louisa | F   | 17  | Recommend preventorium                        |\n| Martin, Phillip | M   | 13  | Discharge to school                           |\n| Macdonald, Doris | F   | 13  | do                                            |\n| Sutherland, Alexander | M   | 11  | do                                            |\n| Tait, Wilfrid | M   | 11  | do                                            |\n| Tanner, Bertha | F   | 12  | Discharge to School after T. & A. operation   |\n| Tanner, Irene | F   | 24  | To Sanatorium for treatment, especially sinuses |\n\nFather Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPt.

I am writing the Rev. Principal today disclosing the findings and advising that the instructions from Ottawa state these children are to be discharged from the preventorium.\n\nTwo are recommended for sanatorium treatment and five are to be retained with the addition of two new ones\u2014a total in the preventorium of seven children.\n\nDr. Adamson and the Board agreed and recommended that these children, if possible, be retained at school during the holidays and then re-examined. Is this recommendation approved?\n\nI believe the preventorium, even though operated under a number of difficulties, has rendered a splendid service and I find the Rev.

They are very poor, and their prospects appear to me to be very slight unless they are induced to remove to a part of the country where farming or stock raising are possible. These Indians are very keen for education. They are now all members of our Church.\n\nI think Archdeacon J.A. Macdonald's application for such schools to be treated at Lac la Ronge. The school there is excellent, may receive a favorable response also. Indeed, in my judgment, each agency where there is an industrial school there, there will be a number of places where day-schools will need to be kept up as feeder to the larger institutions.\n\nHave delayed this letter so long, a great deal can be made toward the object.\n\nVerry Poor Copy\n\nIndian Affairs.

Emmanuel College needs a perpetual grant for education. Emmanuel College, Prince Albert, you know how here, for years doing this work. There are several fine ladies who now support it. If more than Church funds the College could take a many more. They appeal to the zone from three now from the Littleford Industrial school. With all our vision work being funding it hard to help the College grow, yet have felt that it does not need the local a great loss, especially in Education. With border, Arch J. A. Macdonald must speak. You pour new that an attor & times friend to the Saskatchewan Indians does not delay his letters, as wished to send copy of the last report of the Saskatchewan containing any advice last August in which I addressed a new method of administration funds in Education; but the issue of the report has been delayed, so must not wait.

That in his general Report on the Indian School Question made some years ago to Sir John Macdonald, at his request, he advocated the establishment of an industrial institution at the Pas Agency, as he considered it would be of great benefit to the Indians.\n2. The question of the Department contributing towards the schools already in existence at Lac Le Ronge and Montreal Lake, within the territory covered by the recent treaty made with those Indians, has been under the consideration of the Dept., and the Indian Commissioner was advised that the Dept. was not prepared to contribute towards the same until the Reserves to be allotted to these Indians had been surveyed.\n\n3.

I hope you will do the best you can with it. If the Government can't do everything required for a Boarding School, would you kindly find out how far they would go in support of one.\n\nMy idea is a plain Boarding School without any frills and nonsense, simply to give the children the elements of an English education, and especially to teach them to talk English. I was all through the Pas district last summer, and I am satisfied that when the time comes, and that may not be very long, the almost inexhaustible timber will be worked and there.\n\nT. O. Davis, M.P.,\nOttawa.\nwill be employment for a large number of the Indians, if they are only civilized enough to take advantage of their opportunities. The day schools will never teach them English. They have had day schools for sixty years at the Pas and the Indians are not more advanced today than they were fifty years ago. I can vouch for the truth of this statement as far back as forty years ago, as it was just that number of years ago, last June, that I first took charge of the Pas Mission.\n\nLess expensive Boarding schools with fewer hard and fast rules in connection with them would suit me best.\n\nI am on my way to England when expected to spend the winter.

Archdeacon Mackay on this subject; and in reply I beg to inform you that nothing can be done at present in this direction but the question will receive due consideration in connection with the preparation of next year's estimates.\n\nI have, as requested, sent an acknowledgment of this petition to Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\nOTTAWA, 19th October, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the petition hereunder, submitted to the Department by Mr. Davis, M.P., from a number of Indians of the Pas Agency for the establishment of a boarding school on their reserve I beg to say that nearly all the Indians of this Agency are members of the Church of England and if a boarding school were established, it is more than likely that it would be carried on under the auspices of that Church. The per capita grant allowed boarding schools would not meet the necessary outlay for the maintenance and management of a school in this locality. There is no mention of any provision being made by the Church for buildings as is usual in the case of boarding schools. The Diocese of Saskatchewan would, I hardly think, be able to contribute anything towards this end and I doubt if they would be able to meet the additional cost of maintaining this school.\n\nThe question of establishing more boarding schools is one of policy for the Department to decide, but if the number is increased, it should, I think be distinctly understood that the financial responsibility of the Department ceases with the paying of the per capita grant, and a more practical\nOttawa, February 1st, 1904.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nWill you please let me have a report as to the necessity for an Indian Boarding School at the Pas and any facts in connection with the schools in existence there now.\n\nFrank Pelly\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOTTAWA, 2nd February, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the necessity for an Indian Boarding school at The Pas, I beg to say that in October last Mr Davis M.P. forwarded a petition signed by a number of Indians from the district asking for the establishment of such a school.\n\nThe question of opening an Industrial school or a Boarding school at The Pas has been before the Department since 1887, when it was brought up by the Bishop of Calgary and Saskatchewan who asked that an industrial school be established there under the control of the Church of England. In 1890 the Bishop was informed that the Department would see what could be done to further the project in the following year but the matter was dropped however and nothing further was done until the petition above referred to was sent in, when Mr Davis was informed that the matter would receive due consideration in connection with the preparation of next year's estimates, and I see by Mr Scott's note on my memorandum of the 19th Oct. last that a note has been made of it. I beg to refer to my memo. above quoted and would state in connection therewith that if a boarding school is established there, it would have to be carried on by the Department, as I do not consider that the Church of\nEngland is in a financial position to undertake any further work in that district.\n\nThe claims of these Indians for a boarding school are as strong as those of others who are being supplied, if the Department considers that nothing less than a boarding school will meet the case.\n\nAs I stated in my previous memorandum, the Ch. of England has 8 day schools in the Pas Agency, which are doing fairly well, having an average attendance of about 50% of the total school population.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\nMr. Scott,\n\nHas been requested to provide an additional teacher for the school.\n\nMr. Redden, in his report, has mentioned that he has been provided with either a man or woman. This was not stated.\n\nS.C.\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOctober 8, 1907.\n\nThe Honourable Frank Oliver,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\nThe Executive Committee of the Diocese of Saskatchewan desires respectfully to represent to you the need of a Boarding School for the Indian children in the Pas Agency.\n\nThere are over two hundred and fifty (250) treaty Indian children of school age in this Agency. Many of these children cannot attend the day schools, and of those who do attend the attendance is so irregular that practically they receive very little education. Experience fully shows that under existing conditions the day schools are not very effective.\nRailway communication is being extended to The Pas, and the Indians will come more and more in contact with white people and the changes in the conditions of life consequent upon the advance of civilization. They will need every help to meet the new conditions, and without education it would be almost hopeless to expect them to grapple successfully with these conditions.\n\nAt or near The Pas\u2014where the railway reaches the Saskatchewan River\u2014and where the Indians come into immediate contact with all that railways usually bring with them, would be a very suitable point for such an Indian Boarding School. The Pas is the headquarters of the Indian Department Agency, and also of our missionary work in that district.\n\nWe would therefore respectfully request that an appropriation be made for\nfor the purpose of building a Boarding School at that point, and the usual per capita grant for fifty (50) pupils,\n\nWe have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ.

Davis Secretary.\n\nOn behalf of the Synod,\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose a memorial from the Synod of the Diocese of Saskatchewan, of which I have the honour to be Bishop. The Sec'y (I see) omitted to state that this memorial was the unanimous resolution of the Executive Comm., sitting yesterday, Oct. 8th. May I add my hope that you will see the importance of the School requested, & have an appropriation made for the purpose. I am well aware that the whole question of Indian Schools is under your consideration, & I believe the Dep't is willing & anxious to do what is best for your Indian wards, when you can decide what the best is. But meanwhile opportunities & needs can not be neglected, & a Boarding School at the Pas is both. I & other missionaries of some experience hope to be in Toronto 24th & 25th, & should be pleased if we could wait upon you in Ottawa about the 29th.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 17, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan has enclosed a memorial from the Synod of his Diocese, asking for the establishment of a boarding school in the Pas agency, to be built by the Government, to accommodate 50 pupils at the usual per capita grant.\n\nThe question of opening a boarding or industrial school at the Pas has been before the Department since 1887, and applications from the Church of England for such a school have been renewed from time to time since then. There are some 250 children of school age in this agency; practically all of them are recognized as members of the Church of England. To meet the educational needs of these Indians there are eight day schools, conducted under the auspices of that Church. The last published annual report shows an enrolment at these schools of 186, with an average attendance of 96.\n\nIn the memorial it is pointed out that many of the children cannot attend day schools, and of those who do attend they are so irregular that practically they receive very little education and it is claimed that experience fully shows that under existing conditions the day schools are not very effective. I regret to say that this statement is in the main correct, but there is no reason why day schools should not be made\nmade effective. This could be done by raising the present salaries and holding out inducements to efficient teachers to take charge of these schools, and although the clergy generally, and some few laymen, hold that the only way to civilize and educate an Indian child is to place him in an industrial or boarding school, where he will be removed from the influence of the reserve, I do not share this opinion, as my experience has taught me that the boarding and industrial schools do not, in most cases, achieve the end aimed at. The ex-pupils of these schools, I have learned from reliable information, failed, with few exceptions, to benefit from their stay there, and to make any return for the large outlay entailed in maintaining such institutions. For the six years and nine months ended March 31, last, the cost of schools of this class in the West was close upon two million dollars, and I claim that, if a portion of this sum had been expended in bettering the Indians' condition on the reserve and improving the existing day schools, better results would have been obtained. As an argument against boarding and industrial schools, I might point out that the long hours and confinement tell against the health of the pupils, as is conclusively shown by our medical reports. Then again, the relieving of Indian parents from all responsibility for the maintenance of their children does not encourage industry and self-reliance, and the pupil who has had everything found for him up to the time he leaves school does not show much inclination for steady work when he is removed from restraint. In fact, the greater number are much more helpless.\nhelpless and disinclined for steady work than those who have never attended schools of this class. These remarks are more applicable to boys than to girls.\n\nThe memorial, as before stated, asks the Government to contribute the full cost of building and equipping the school, and, should it not be successfully carried on with the usual per capita grant, which is most likely, the Department would have to meet the deficits. Again, if the Department once undertakes to build and equip boarding schools and hand them over to religious denominations to carry on, it will be flooded with applications and there will be no limit to the expenditure.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

While we appreciate the education given to our children at these schools, yet they are so far away that we hesitate to let our children go to them, as we feel very much the long separation from them.\n\nIf, as we now request, a school be established here at the Big Eddy, The Pas, which is central for the reserves round, we would not hesitate to let our children go, it being so much nearer, we should be satisfied, being able to visit our children occasionally. We feel that a school here would be a great benefit to us.\n\nWe therefore in behalf of the Indians under us, and all the Indians in The Pas Agency, earnestly beg that you will bring this before the Government for us, and that you will graciously assist us, that this may be granted to us.\n\nSigned\u2014\n\nAntoine Constant, Chief, Pas Band\nPatrick Constant, Coun.\nDavid Cook,\nNorman Lathlin, Cedar Lake Band\nJames Lathlin, Cumberland\nJeremiah Crane, Shoal Lake\nAlbert Moore,\nJeremiah Naywakayas, Red Earth\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sept. 30th, 1909.\n\nRe Education\n\n...........There are day schools on all the reserves, taught in a good many cases by the missionary, and they were all in operation, with the exception of Shoal Lake which was closed for the want of a teacher. It seems impossible for the Indians to grasp the benefits conferred by the educating of their children; but if a school happens to be closed for want of a teacher as in the case of Shoal Lake they make great complaints, open it up and they do not seem to care whether their children go or not, and if it was not for the children themselves, very few would attend. If the teacher neglects to go around, and is at all careless, the attendance is very poor. Take the schools as a whole in this agency, they are very poor, and few children over ten or twelve attend. A boarding school at the Pas is asked for by the Agency Indians, and would suit them much better than sending the children to the Industrial Schools. They object very strongly to sending their children so far from home. An occasional one dies while at school, and it is very difficult to make them understand that all these schools have the very best medical advice.\n\n(Sgd) S. J. Jackson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nAt a band meeting held at the Pas on August 21st last, the Chief and all the Councillors spoke strongly their desire that I should write to the Department of Indian Affairs, and ask them to build a boarding school at the Pas, for the group of reserves that comprise the Pas Agency.\n\nThere is no doubt but that a boarding school at this point would be very satisfactory to all the Indians of this Agency. All the other schools are so far away, they do not like to send their children to them, as it costs a lot of money to go, or have their children sent, to see them.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.D.

Has the Department decided when the work will be started?\n\nAt present, since the removal of the Indians from the South to the North side of the River, the school work has been in an unsatisfactory state and as the Indians have heard that there is a prospect of a Boarding School, they are looking forward to it and appear anxious to see it in operation.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ.

There is a good building which will accommodate 30 pupils. The average attendance now is low and this building would probably suffice.\n\nOn the Pas Reserve there are two schools,\u2014The Pas and Big Eddy. These must be classed as failures, owing largely to nomadic habits of parents and partly to inefficient teachers.

The following are quotations from Mr. Logan's report recently received:\n\n\"There is a splendid opportunity here for a good day school as the people do not live far away and the C. N.

It is expected that a good town will be built near here.\"\n\n\"The three reserves, Fairford, Little Saskatchewan and Lake St. Martin, offer a splendid opportunity for a good boarding school which would likely be situated at this point.

The growing difficulty of obtaining pupils for the Battleford Industrial School and the need for new buildings there if the School is to be continued has forced the Bishop to consider the situation.\n\nEvidently the arrangement which the Department made with the Presbyterian Church on the closing of the Regina Industrial School commends itself favorably to the Church of England. Archdeacon MacKay presented the attached memorandum, making alternative propositions; first, as to an increase in the grant for the existing Boarding schools and the establishment of a new Boarding School at the Pas; second, proposing the closing of the Battleford Industrial School and a partition of the grants amongst the other schools on an increased scale of per capita allowance. This latter proposition appeals to me as being in line with our policy of closing the larger Industrial schools and where Boarding Schools are at all required to establish them upon the Reserves. It involves also the improvement of three Day Schools. The present buildings of the Battleford Industrial\nSchool are in a dilapidated condition and if the School were to be longer maintained we would have to consider putting up a new building, which could not be done to meet the needs of the institution much under $50,000.00. Taking everything into consideration, therefore, I think we should accept the proposal to close Battleford, allow the Boarding Schools at Lac la Ronge and Onion Lake an increase in their per capita grant to $100.00, establish a Boarding School at the Pas providing for 100 pupils at $100 and either make an addition to the present Lac la Ronge Boarding School or erect a new School at Montreal Lake. We should be able to build a school at the Pas for about $30,000.00.\n\nI do not think it would be advisable to decide hastily on the needs of the Montreal Lake situation but to consider the matter most carefully before we decide what buildings to erect. In Archdeacon MacKay's memorandum of the funds available for redistribution under the new plan he includes those formerly voted for Emmanuel College. This item disappeared from the Estimates some years ago, but we could close a number of day schools in the Pas district which are now doing very poor work. While I think the Church of England might have some claim for consideration as to the loss of Emmanuel College also the closing of these Day Schools will assist the gross saving.\nOttawa, November 3, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nOn the 17th ultimo the Venerable Archdeacon MacKay of Battleford called at the Department and submitted certain proposals which, he said, emanated from Your Lordship as head of the diocese in reference to the Indian school establishment in your district.\n\nOne of these propositions was to close the Battleford Industrial School and open in lieu thereof a boarding school to accommodate 100 pupils at The Pas and to build either a new school at Montreal Lake with accommodation for 50 pupils or increase the accommodation at Lac la Ronge and provide in all for 100 pupils and to pay a per capita grant at The Pas and Montreal Lake (or Lac la Ronge) and Onion Lake of $100.00 instead of $72.00 as at present. This proposal also involved improvements to the existing day schools on the Red Pheasants, Little Pine and Ahtahka-koop reserves.\n\nI may state for Your Lordship's information that the Department is disposed to accept this proposition as submitted by Archdeacon MacKay and to close the Battleford Industrial school as soon as a new building can be provided at The Pas and the desired improvements effected at the schools mentioned.

Archdeacon MacKay. The proposals he made had my full approval, & I note with satisfaction that you so thought well of them, & are inclined to give effect to them. For some reasons we shall be sorry to have Bat'sford Indian School closed; but we shall unable to keep it just now that the adjacent Reservations have been closed & the Indians dispersed. But I trust we will hold by your design to open a Boarding school at the Pas, and to increase the accommodation at Lac la Ronge to 100 pupils, or to build another at Wanapitei Lake for 50 - per cap. grant $100. I shall also welcome improvements in the Red Pheasants & Little Pine Schools. In the whole, I think a new school at North Lake is better than doubting the capacity of Lac la Ronge. I am glad to hear of extensive repairs, mid-day meal, & increased salary at Little Pine's. I think the Department may rely upon us to try & secure these improvements with a better class of teachers. But it is not easy to procure these.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReferring to your letter quoted above, with regard to the establishment of a boarding school at Montreal Lake or the enlargement of the boarding school at Lac la Ronge, I have the honour to state that I have given the matter my best attention, and have no hesitation in recommending the establishment of a school for 50 pupils at Lac la Ronge.\n\nMy recent report on the boarding school at Lac la Ronge will show that neither the present building nor its site is well adapted for a school for 50 pupils, much less for 100. In case of its being rebuilt on a new and more suitable site the building could be built to a plan and of dimensions adapted to 100 pupils, it is true. But the educational needs of Amos Charles' band (at Stanley) have to be provided for; and if two of these bands are to be provided for in one school it would naturally be those at Lac la Ronge and Stanley, as being in every respect more closely associated. But in my opinion it will be necessary to provide for the education of the children of these three bands separately, in order to secure the full attendance that is desirable; while I also believe that these smaller schools will in every respect do more efficient work than one large one. I may say that although the question before me has reference only to Montreal Lake and Lac la Ronge, yet I find it impossible to discuss it fully without making\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthis reference at least to the needs of the people at Stanley.\n\nIt is practically certain that it would not be possible to secure more than a small percentage of the children of school age at Montreal Lake for attendance at a school at Lac la Ronge. Communication between the places is at present difficult. The canoe route by the Montreal river is so labourious that it is now practically abandoned for freighting purposes. There is a winter trail overland which is shorter and easier, but it is not much used by the Indians, who are poorly equipped for travelling by trail. It is true that before many years have passed conditions of travel will in all probability have altered very much for the better; but notwithstanding this, from my knowledge of the geographical situation of these two bands, their relations to each other, and the experience of schools elsewhere in regard to attendance, I feel convinced that a school at Lac la Ronge will never satisfactorily meet the educational needs of the Indians at Montreal Lake.\n\nWhile the present site of the school at Lac la Ronge is both picturesque and healthful, as are also many other possible sites on that lake, and there is also plenty of timber there for fuel and building purposes, yet various sites could be selected at Montreal Lake which, besides having these advantages, are surrounded with land well adapted to farming and gardening and affording fair facilities for the keeping of stock. The timber around Montreal Lake is very fine; the soil is of excellent quality; there is much native hay to be had conveniently, while cultivated feed for stock could be grown abundantly. This last is a consideration of no slight importance, since a good supply of milk is indispensable in a boarding school, which necessitates the keeping of a number of cows. Schools in these regions find a liberal supply of fish equally indispensable. For this purpose there could be\nno better location than Lac la Ronge; but while Montreal Lake is not itself a particularly good lake for fish, the Bittern Lake, a small lake at the south-east corner of the reserve, furnishes a plentiful supply of whitefish of the best quality.\n\nIn William Charles' band, at Montreal Lake, there are between 45 and 50 children of the ordinary school age, that is, between six and fifteen years. In James Roberts' band, at Lac la Ronge, as it is since the division of the band, there are 72 children of school age; while in Amos Charles' band, at Stanley, there are 56. Though children from Stanley are never likely to attend the school at Lac la Ronge in large numbers, yet they are more likely to attend than are those whose homes are at Montreal Lake.\n\nA most important consideration, to my mind, in favour of the establishment of a school at Montreal Lake of similar capacity to the one at Lac la Ronge, in preference to doubling the capacity of the present school, is that each school is a very important center of influence for good upon the lives and habits of the Indian population around. This is an influence which belongs to every similar institution, apart from the direct work of education, and while it is somewhat increased through any increase in the capacity and importance of the institution, it is not exerted so widely or so beneficially by doubling the capacity of one school as by establishing a similar school in a different center.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, December 28, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant in reference to the establishment of a boarding school at Montreal Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the contents thereof have been noted.

I should be glad to have Your Lordship's opinion on this matter.\n\nI would also ask Your Lordship to be good enough to state whether you have formed any opinion as to the most desirable location for this school.

Although nothing definite has been decided upon it is considered well to give the matter of the location of a building early and careful consideration.

Fischer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHudson Bay Junction, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI answered your letter, but did not decide finally what site propose to use for Boarding School at the Pas. I have conferred with Archdeacon MacKay, & he has recommended us the best locality \"Big Eddy\". It is an Indian Reserve, about 5 or 6 miles upstream, on Saskatchewan River, from the Pas. The land is high, dry, sandy (Pines, etc.) & so healthy. It is not too near the Town with its drawbacks & dangers. I think they could get some land fit for cultivation. There is a good road back to Clear Water Lake where they could get fish.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. A. Armstrong\nOttawa, November 23, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 16th instant in regard to the site for the Pas Boarding School I beg to say that the Department is in receipt of a communication from His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan in which His Lordship recommends that this school be erected on the Big Eddy Reserve about five or six miles up the river from the Pas. It is stated that the site is high and dry and that there will be sufficient land for cultivation. It is further stated that there is a good road to Clearwater Lake where fish can be had. I shall be glad to hear your opinion of this choice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFred. Fischer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHudson Bay Junction, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd Ultimo, No 373371, regarding a site for the Pas Boarding School.\n\nIn this connection I would strongly suggest for the Department's consideration, that this School be erected at a place on the Pas Reserve known as the Big Eddy. This place is one of the highest points on the river, the soil is sandy and gravelly, with the finest of drainage, jack pine trees grow all around and I think as I have seen several springs there, that good water could be had by digging a well, in fact I consider the place from a sanitary point of view an ideal spot for a Boarding School for this Agency, as well as for convenience, being nearly equidistant from the other reserves, the distance from The Pas is about four miles.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nAt a meeting of the Pas band held on the reserve on the 8th of August last, the question of a boarding school for the Pas Agency was again brought up by the band and fully discussed. The Indians are getting anxious on this subject, as a boarding school was promised the band by Mr. Merlatt, the late Inspector for the district, at a meeting held by him over ten years ago, and they think that the promise should be carried out as soon as possible.\n\nThe Canadian Northern Railway is now at this point. A large lumber mill has been erected by an American firm, so all kinds of material for building can be obtained at reasonable prices. The band at this meeting passed a resolution unanimously that they offer a free site to the Department of 320 acres any place on the reserve. In my opinion a boarding school should be built at this point, say for eighty children, as all the bands in this Agency would send their children.\n\nI would recommend that serious consideration be given this matter by the Department, as I am aware that the English Church authorities would be very glad to take charge of a boarding school at this point. Le Pas is now in the Province of Manitoba and no doubt will be in the jurisdiction of Archbishop Matheson when the rearrangement of the Diocese is made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

I may say that this same location is recommended by His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan. The site should be such that the school will be able to raise sufficient vegetables, etc., for their own consumption and it will be necessary to have a resolution of the band setting aside a portion of land not less than 160 acres for school purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFred. Fischer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLe Pas, N.W.T.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 373371 dated the 19th ultimo, on the subject of suitable land for cultivation in connection with the proposed new Boarding School, and in reply beg to explain as follows.\n\nThat portion of the Pas Reserve known as \"The Big Eddy\" is a high sandy and gravelly ridge, covered with Jack Pine. On account of the elevation and dryness of the soil it is recommended as an ideal spot for a School and the water found there is of the best quality derived from springs, but with regard to the quality of the soil in the immediate vicinity of the proposed site, it is light and sandy, and unless in a wet year cannot be depended on to grow anything. However a sufficient area could be had in the bottom land of good rich soil sufficient for the requirements of the School.\n\nI might add that at the last annuity Payments\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\npayments the Indians stated that they were quite willing to cede whatever land would be required for school purposes.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\n406846\nOttawa, April 25, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of January 5th, last, in regard to the establishment of a boarding school at The Pas I beg to say that the Department hopes to be in a position to undertake this work this year.\n\nYour remark that the band passed a resolution offering a free site to the Department of 320 acres at any place on the reserve has been noted and I have to ask you to be good enough when paying annuities to the Indians of the reserve to obtain a resolution in writing signed by the Chief and Councillors. It would be well also for you and the Agent to choose definitely this land in question and have it staked and a general description of the location should be embodied in the resolution above referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS.

When may we expect the boarding school at the Pas to be started?\n2. Whether the Department has yet definitely arranged when the Industrial School at Battleford will be closed?\n3. Whether the Department has decided to accede to the request that has been submitted to make an advance to the Battleford School to relieve the present financial pressure.\n\nWith regard to the first, the Department are aware that there has been no school worthy of the name at the Pas for some years, in fact ever since the Indians removed to the north side of the river, and it is now absolutely closed. The Indians are\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\ninsistent in their request for a school, especially since they have been informed that they are to have a Boarding School. The Department is aware how long it takes to carry out any building scheme of importance, and how often the expense is greatly increased by work being commenced too late in the season.\n\nWith regard to the closing of the Battleford School, the Department will readily understand that it is only fair to all concerned, especially to the Principal and other members of the staff, to know definitely why the present interest that surrounds it and centre in it are likely to be dissolved.\n\nReferring to the request for temporary financial help for the Battleford School, the Department will see from the monthly returns that the school has a serious deficit to carry. At the same time the assets in the way of live stock, firewood,\n3.\n\nimplementors should cover the liabilities,\nif those liabilities are not allowed to increase\nindefinitely.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nyour obediently,\n\nJ.

Rogers\nSuperintendent Genl.\nof Indian Affairs\n\nNo. 2 Letter\n\nAug 3rd, 1912\n\nSir,\n\nI have already written to you re. the Pas School. I desire to add a request, as urgent as I can make it, for a Cottage Hospital for Indians to be attached to it.\n\n1. In this I am only endorsing the advice with of the J.D. doctor for this Agency, Dr. Orisk, who takes a real interest in the welfare of the Indians, & desires to do really good work among them, not merely to play at doctoring. I would congratulate you, Sir, on your appointment of Dr. Orisk; for he is about the first J.D. doctor that I have met who really seems to care, & to be anxious to relieve the Indian sick, a most encouraging contrast to his predecessors. It would be a great pity to damp his ardour & to check his enthusiasm & zeal. In this request & endorsetion of the doctor's request I have the cordial backing of Mr. William McKay who has laboured among & for our Indians for 50 years!\n\n2. The doctor will give you at length his reasons, & a statement of the kind of cases he meets with which require hospital treatment. Without a hospital for such cases his work is largely in vain. The Indians at home will not\ncarry out instructions, nor take medicine regularly.\n\n3. As it is he was occasionally to send a patient to the Roman Catholic hospital\u2014when they will take him\u2014and they pretty stiffly for it. One, at least, they refused to take until to some sample, \u2014this man may die, unless the doctor can send him to some hospital elsewhere. A patient in your own hospital will cost you less than in the R.C. hospital.\n\n4. Besides the R.C. hospital is denominational in the worst way. The Bishop priests use the existence of their hospital as a proof of what they can & will do for the Indians if they become R.Cath. It is a standing bribe to the Indians.\n\nThen the patients, sick & weak in mind & in body, are exposed to a quiet steady persuasion to turn, while in hospital.\n\n5. It need not be an expensive building, but a one-story pavilion or bungalow (or buildings) as at Birtle.\n\nI believe that your Dep't has built & is operating such a place in connexion with your school at Birtle, Man., successfully. I ask for the same here, in connexion with the Residential School, as thus most economically built & managed. With one matron, or nurse, for the hospital constantly, one or more of the teachers might have some training in nursing, & help at special times. One cottage might do at first, as experiment, to be increased if the need increases, & you approve the experiment & the cost.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.A. Saskatchewan\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Pedley:\n\nBishop Newnham in his letter of August 3rd requests us to establish a Hospital for Indians in connection with the proposed new building for the Church of England Boarding School at the Pas. The plan is the same as used in the Norway House Methodist School. While there is provision in the building for the inmates, there is no Hospital in it. At Norway House this is provided for by the detached Hospital building.\n\nBishop Newnham makes a strictly Denominational plea in which we are not interested, but, as we have an active Doctor at the Pas it might be beneficial to have a Hospital at that point. I think it preferable wherever we can do so to make use of the Hospitals established for White people. There would seem to be such a Hospital at the Pas, although Bishop Newnham states that it is not acceptable. If it was thought advisable\nadvisable to erect this building we would have to provide for it in the estimates.\n\nWe might be able to find funds for it and put it up at the same time as the School, but, I think we should have reports from our own Doctor, Agent and Inspector. In fact we might ask Inspector Jackson to take the matter up and obtain a report.\n\nChief Accountant.\nBox 38, Prince Albert, Sask.\nAug. 3rd, 1912.\n\nHon & Dear Sir:\n\nWe have also asked for the last two years for definite action re, the Battleford Industrial School and I have received kind assurances but no action. The school is dwindling and must dwindle on account of the moving of the Battleford reservations and the opening or promises of new Improved Day Schools. This necessarily means that the per capita grant is decreasing (I mean the total sum) and the school getting into debt, a thing this school has never before done. We ask the I.D. to advance $2000. (for the first time) which $2000. will be easily recovered from the assets when you close (as promised soon) the school. I would refer you to the file of letters on both sides for all information. In this case also \"the absence of the Minister of the Interior\" was quoted as the cause of delay in action.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYours faithfully\n\nJ.A. Saskatchewan.\nSir,\n\nI am writing to you on Indian Department matters which are, to our minds, very important & urgent, & I would beg your most careful consideration of them & your kind & prompt action. I shall write of them in two separate letters, as they have to do with two distinct branches of the work. First, in this letter Educational. I. I would beg of you to look personally into the matter of the long-promised Residential School at the Pas. I have been given to understand that one reason for the delay is the difficulty of placing the matter before the Minister of the Interior, who has so many other duties to attend to. May I then beg of you to be kind enough to take up this pressing matter. The delay is causing great discontent & our Indians, & great harm to the work. Nothing is being done, nor can be done, with the day-school at the Pas, because of the expected Residential School. Meanwhile the Indian children are relapsing into ignorance, idleness, & bad ways, & at the same time the over-active Roman Church, with a Bishop now at the Pas, is promoting the dissentient, promising the Indians to educate their children,\nNo. 1 (2nd page)\n\nWe have no chance to reduce our Indians from us, & to undo the work that the Church of England has done at the Pas for 72 years! The tenders should be given out, contracts made, & the building begun at once, or it means another year without a school. You can learn the promises made by the J.D., the plans they offered we accepted, & all our petitions, from the files in your office.\n\nII. We have also asked for the last two years for definite action re, the Battleford Industrial School, I have received kind assurances, but no action. The school is dwindling & must diminish on account of the moving of the Battleford Reservation, & the opening, or promises, of new improved day-schools. This necessarily means that the per capita grant is decreasing (I mean, the total sum) the school getting into debt, a thing this school has never before done. We asked the J.D. to advance $2000 (for the first time) which $2000 will easily be recovered from the sale when you close (as promised) the school. I would refer you to the file of letters on both sides for all information. In this case also, \"The absence of the Ministry of the Interior\" was quoted as the cause of delay in action.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.A. Saskatchewan\nOttawa, August 17th, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department has received your Lordship's letter of the 3rd August, in which you recommend the establishment of an Hospital for Indians in connection with the proposed new building for the Church of England Boarding School, at Le Pas; and in reply I may say that the matter will be given consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Mewham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBox 39,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, August 17th, 1912.\n\nSir:\n\nIt has been represented to the Department by His Lordship, Bishop Newnham, that it would well to establish an Hospital for Indians in connection with the proposed new building for the Church of England Boarding School, at Le Pas. The Department desires that you will look very carefully into this matter and consult both with the Indian Agent Mr. Fischer and with Dr. Orez, after which you should submit a report and recommendation to Head-quarters. The Agent and the Doctor should set forth their views in writing, which reports may be submitted to the Department by you. Kindly give the matter attention at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nS. J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nStonewall, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Reddy,\nPlease do little turned dirt in respect Battleford.\nSir,\n\nWith regard to the representations made to the Department by His Lordship Bishop Newnham on the advisibility of establishing an Hospital for the Indians, I would certainly consider the plan of the greatest importance and benefit to them.\n\nThe medical attendance as it is at present is unsatisfactory in the results, while the Doctor is attentive and painstaking, the apathy and negligence of the Indians themselves in carrying out his instructions, render his efforts in many cases of little use. The mode of living of the people, their nomadic habits, moving as they do from place to place and living in tents, as well as sleeping on the ground, makes the attendance necessary in severe cases an absolute impossibility.\n\nIn view therefore of the probability of a boarding school being built at The Big Eddy I would recommend an hospital in connection therewith, where outside cases from the other reserves could be treated.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nS.J. Jackson, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nLe Pas. Man.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter No.373371-1, of date the 17th ult., I may say that having looked as fully as possible into this matter of a hospital in connection with the Indian boarding school on the Pas reserve, beg leave to report as follows.\n\nIn the course of my inspections during the past four years in this and other Agencies, I have found on all the reserves a number of cases drawn to my attention by the visiting Physician, and also coming under my own personal observation, where a simple operation would cure the patient. When the Doctor's attention was called to these cases he invariably declined to operate because his personal service could not be given to the patient for any length of time after the operation.\n\nFor instance, in the summer of 1911, on the Manitowapah Agency, an Indian came to see Dr. Clarke on one of his reserves, for a swelling on the side of his jaw, the Doctor gave him something to rub on his cheek, but told me later that it was a very simple operation to remove the lump and cure the young man, but he would not operate on account of not being able to give, say a week's personal attention to the wound.\n\nThe average Indian does not give very much attention to personal cleanliness, and in their houses the same characteristic disregard of hygiene prevails, in consequence of this trait our medical men are afraid of blood poisoning in connection with operations on the reserves, in their homes.\nAll surgical cases should be sent to the hospital, but the doctors on the Manitowah, and the Pas, agencies hesitate about sending such cases which are not immediately dangerous to the hospital, on account of the very large expense to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe closest Protestant hospital to this agency at the present time is at Swan Lake, distant about 193 miles from Le Pas, and in addition to this all the bands in this agency are situated from 75 to 100 miles from this point, with water communication for at least six months in each year, and a hospital situated where this boarding school is built, will be easily accessible from all the reserves in the Agency.\n\nAfter carefully looking into this matter I have come to the conclusion that the establishing of a small hospital in connection with the boarding school, would be a great favour to the Indians of this agency.\n\nAs to the expense, outside of the building, it would only be necessary to have a trained nurse of experience, as all the other help required would come from the staff of the school and the elder pupils, (as at Birtle).\n\nThere is also the side of the question, the benefit to the school itself. There are times when when a number of the pupils require a weeks lay off in the hospital for minor ailments, which can be better looked after under the personal observation of the nurse, and the advantage thereby conferred it would be hard for me to estimate. After consultation with Dr. Crok, I have drafted a rough plan of building required, with the probable cost of same, which you will find enclosed.\n\nAlso find enclosed letter from Mr. Fischer, and a report from Dr. Crok, on the subject.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Secretary, & Deputy,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\nSec. Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\u2014\n\nI have been requested by Mr. S. J. Jackson, Inspector of Agencies, to report to the Department on conditions that exist among the various bands under my care that would make the addition of an hospital to the proposed school an essential part of the scheme.\n\nIn my July report I mentioned having seen various cases that could only be treated successfully in hospital, and at the end of another month in the work I am still more of the opinion that such a place is needed here. For instance a woman brought in a child two years old suffering from a bad form of hernia. This is her third child and both the others had the same trouble and are both dead. It is possible that had the doctor had the necessary hospital facilities something might have been done for the little ones. It would be an utter impossibility to do any sort of surgery in the houses, they are so filthy, and the minute you would be out sight even if you did risk one they would be wandering over the wound with dejections of their own. With a small hospital and a nurse in charge this difficulty would be overcome. I am only mentioning this one instance of a case requiring surgical treatment but there are others just as urgent.\n\nAgain from the surgical aspect of the question I am of the sure opinion that we could get great benefit from a place of this kind with many of our medical cases. Saw a case of acute rheumatism the other day, the patient lying on the floor. I found on enquiry that there was not a bed in the house, and the sick as well as the sound slept practically in the same heap of blankets. This state of affairs you will admit would not tend to the welfare of either. This practice of crowding the ill and the well into the same room and often into the same bed is another argument in support of our request. Again, too often the Doctor in charge of the Indian work, just because he is unable to apply the same scientific principles in the treatment of his Indians, as he can to his white brother, is unable to get the same satisfactory results and consequently loses the Indian's confidence, and without you have their confidence you can do very little with them.\n\nAs to the size of building required, I would suggest one having ward that would hold five beds. Would want two such wards one for male and female patients, two private rooms for special cases, and a room for operations, these would be ample for hospital purposes. Besides, we would require the usual nurses quarters, drug dispensary, also kitchen dining room closets etc. If you think it better something on the cottage system would work out very well and could be added to as required.\n\nThe site proposed for the school buildings would be an ideal one for an hospital. Placed as it would be on a hill high above the swampy land around, the very fact that we would be able to get our sick there would help in many cases as much as medicine.\n\nI, as medical attendant to the bands here, want to give them the very best I can, and I cannot let an opportunity such as this pass without bringing to the notice of the Department, the urgent need of such an institution here. I trust that you will see your way clear to grant us this boon.\n\nI will be ready and willing at all times to give you any desired information. Thanking you in anticipation,\n\nI beg to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\nSir:-\n\nAmong the elder women of all the bands I have visited, I have seen a number of cases of pannus. This disease of the eyes which results ultimately in total blindness, I attribute to their living in smoky tents and houses. The treatment of the disease is surgical, but as we have no regular place at our disposal in which to do operations, we are forced to let them go without treatment. I would humbly draw the attention of the Department to our need of a hospital here for such and many other cases. Could not such be made part of the new school buildings being built here? I would remind the Department of similar facilities in connection with the school at Birtle Man.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.D. Osk M.D.\nThe Sec.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Lean,\n\nI desire to make a report on the proposed site for the Pass Industrial School viz. Fisher Island, the Pass.\n\nMr. Jackson, Inspector of Land Agencies who kindly consented to take me over that site, gave alternative site at Big Sally.\n\n1. I decidedly prefer Fisher Island, as very little good ground or convenient soil can be had on the Big Sally Reserve.\n2. Fisher Island is so near the mainland that the bridge necessary will cost comparatively little.\n3. It seems as if every inch of the island can be used. There is no waste. The hills cut & pits rigged by Mr. Jackson show a gradual rise of surface & a capital soil. The latter is comprised of the best site under Hon. M.\n4. Furniture can be obtained quite near the proposed site.\n5. I will respectfully advise:\n   a) That the offer of the Indians be accepted for Fisher Island.\n   b) That about 20 acres be cleared this fall & winter, the tree-trunks (properly trimmed being cut up a pile & dry, which will provide a fine stock of fuel ready for the first building operations.\n   c) That a competent man be sent (it will not cost much), to survey the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\na great deal in the cost of building) & demand a report on the limestone there. It should furnish not only the lime required for the ledge, but, I am told, good limestone for founda'tion & the main part of the house, so that it is cheaper than good lumber.\n\na) That it be made in water & a well dug near. This will not only help in the exact location of the ledge, but also provide water ready for the builder.\n\nb) All this will tend to encourage the Indians who are beginning to be suspicious as to the purpose of a school.\n\nf) That Mr. Jackson seems to take an intelligent as well as a great interest in the matter, & his suggestions & recommendations seem well worth acceptance.\n\nI greatly regret your inability to get tenders this fall for the ledge. It was not expected, as tenders were advertised for quite late. I hope you will be prepared to invite tenders, with the site location of ledge defined, about Christmas or New Year, & if the limestone promises well for a fine ledge, instructs them about that time are the cheapest, & the contractors can get everything ready for the spring. I believe that in this case, a visit from Mr. Sherrin in the fall, the school should pay well & the boys learn real farming.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

That is to say that the value of the wood exceeds the cost of the clearing by $1200.00.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nIf the Pas Indian Boarding School is to be built during the next season, it would be greatly to the benefit of the building operations if say ten acres of the Island was cleared this fall before the snow gets too deep. The trees should be made into cordwood, and the brush piled and burned.\n\nIt would also be advisable to put down a well near the site of building when the same was cleared, and have it finished before building starts.\n\nAs the Island is underlaid with limestone it will be necessary to have the well drilled.\n\nAll the wells around here at the present time are shallow and have only surface water, by going into the rock a never failing supply, such as is wanted by an institution of this character, is usually found. Two well will be required one at the school and one at the stables. I would recommend that this preliminary work be done before next spring.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.O.F.

Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nStonewall, Man.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI had notes of a letter I wished to write you, but I am not sure what I wrote it. If this be a repetition of a letter already written, please forgive me. I have secured what I believe to be an excellent Principal for the new Pas Boarding-school, Rev. L. Laronde. He is a married man with a suitable wife. He is a native of the country, having taken a high standing in St. John's College, Manitoba University, and having since had some years experience of work among the Crees. He is ready to enter on his position and duties as soon as the house is ready for him. And I think he should do so, to get to work, preparing for the pupils, and setting them up. His salary must begin from the date when he enters the school. Now, I understand that his salary will come out of the Capitulation grant. There can be no grant till there are pupils. What is the done man while? I think you should name his salary for the present, so much per month, he to provide his own board, etc., out of that, + the S.D. to pay this monthly. (What about the salaries also of any of the staff who join him at the beginning, & before Capitulation grant comes in? The school can not be run on nothing for six months until the S.D. make an initial grant to cover all this? If there is no other way, I think you should advance it, & be repaid gradually out of Capitulation grant. The point is that there is need of his presence & work, & that of some of the staff for some time before pupils come in.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe finances during this time, the maintenance expenses of the school must be found, & it is not the duty of the Church to find these funds, nor has the Church in this poor district any funds for this purpose. I don't know what you usually do in starting a new school, but it seems to me that the S.D. must furnish funds to start, even if it has these funds delayed 6 degrees. Please bear in mind that I have been paying the salary of Mr. Sties for 3 months now while he prepared the grounds etc., for the school. I should be glad of an early answer as to how you are going to arrange this, & when you want him & his staff to enter into residence. Are you urging the contractors to hurry up a finish? When do you expect these all ready? By the last report I had nothing had been done as to stables, out houses, etc., promised. The Contractor told Mr. Sties he had received no order for them! The cattle & horses from Battleford had been long expected, but no word had come of their having started, nor the stores, furniture, etc. Mr. Sties wants to cut the hay, haul the firewood, etc., school, etc., but is waiting for the horses. He talks of borrowing a reaper etc., but it will be false economy to hire horses, while your horses at Battleford are idle, & \"eating their heads off\". Inquire me for being so troublesome, but I am anxious.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. H. Saskatchewan\nBishop\nOttawa, Aug. 6th, 1914\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 31st ultimo making certain suggestions in reference to the maintenance and management of the new Pas Boarding School, I beg to say that the question submitted therein will be referred to the Deputy Minister on his return to Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. J. A. Newnham D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to the proposed opening of the Pas Indian Boarding School on Oct. 1st, I beg to recommend for the post of Principal the Rev. Louis Laronde, at present missionary on St. Peter's Indian Reserve, Manitoba. Mr. Laronde is himself a product of an Indian residential school, being a graduate of the Battleford Industrial School. He has had a good industrial training and a good education, being a B.A. of Manitoba University. He has proved himself a very capable and diligent worker, and his wife, who before her marriage was a very successful school teacher, will.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nA. H. A.\nIt is hoped, be a valuable aid to her hus-\nband in the management of the school.\nAn early reply will oblige, as should you\nfurther the opening of the school on the\ndate proposed, and the appointment of\nMr. Laviolette, he should be on the\nground as soon as possible to have\neverything prepared for the reception of\nthe pupils.\n\nKindly address me at\nPrince Albert\nSask.\n\nYours, Sir,\nJohn MacKay\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWhile you were in the west the Bishop of Saskatchewan wrote under date of the 31st ultimo recommending the appointment of the Rev. Louis Laronde as Principal of the new Pas Boarding School. He is a French half-breed, a graduate of St. John's College and withdrew from treaty in 1909. He is a married man and has had experience as a teacher in Indian day schools. Venerable Archdeacon MacKay has also recommended his appointment in a letter received today. So far as his educational attainments go Mr. Laronde is fully qualified, but it is a question for you to decide whether you would be willing to intrust the success of a new school to a half-breed. I think our past experience goes to show that we would be taking great risks in putting a school of this class in charge of a half-breed.\n\nThe Bishop inquires what is to be done in regard to salaries of the principal and any of the staff who may join before the school is open. His Lordship says that it will be necessary for the principal to be there sometime in advance of the opening of the school.\nAs this will be a per capita grant school there will be no money coming in until after the school is opened. His Lordship would like the Department to assume the payment of the salaries until the per capita grant comes in and, as they have no money available for meeting current expenses even after the school is opened, he thinks the Department ought to furnish funds to start the school, to be repaid gradually out of the per capita grant. It is certain that the church has no money and if the Department makes an advance they will be starting in debt and it will take them a long time to work it off.\n\nWith regard to the stock which is to be transferred from the Battleford School Mr. Inspector Jackson is to arrange for this being done.\n\nI think under the circumstances the Department will have to make an advance to the school to enable them to purchase their supplies, which could be deducted from the quarterly earnings.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Laronde for the position of principal of this school, that, while the Department recognizes that Mr. Laronde has the educational qualifications, it has no assurance that he has the business ability and experience which would justify the Department in entrusting a school of this class to his management. This school will be conducted on the per capita grant system and, while the allowance is considered enough under careful business management to meet all legitimate demands, there can be no margin left and it will require the closest economy and supervision to make ends meet. The school will have a deficit from the start, as funds will have to be advanced to enable it to be carried on from its inception, which will have to be repaid out of the per capita earnings. The Department regrets that it cannot accede to Your Lordship's wish to place this school in charge of Mr. Laronde, as it does not consider that he has had the necessary experience to enable him to successfully carry on an institution of this class. I trust that Your Lordship will see the necessity of securing a competent\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\ntent man to manage this school, who, in addition to his other qualifications, will be able to make it a financial success.\n\nThe Department will be prepared to make an advance to enable the school to start and this advance can be repaid gradually. It will also assume the first cost of the necessary equipment, which will have to be kept up by the church. The Department would like Your Lordship to submit a list of the equipment required. The school will be ready for occupation by the first of October, next.\n\nIt is presumed that the implements and horses referred to in Your Lordship's letter have been transferred from Battleford by this time, as directions were given to have them sent on to The Pas.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nNATHAN C. T.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, September 2nd, 1914.\n\nDear Dr. Grain,\n\nI have your letter of the 26th August, and have instructed the office to send you an order for the purchase of an operating table for the Sisters.\n\nI will arrange in plenty of time for the equipment of the Norway House Hospital, we are dealing with that now.\n\nI note what you say with reference to duplicating the order for the Pas.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nO. I. Grain, Esq., M.D.,\nSelkirk, Man.\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nI don't know where the delay was, but I only received your letter a week ago. In reply, I say:\n\n1. I fear it is now too late to cancel Mr. Laronde's appointment. He has re-signed his last position, and must be at the Pas by now, getting ready for the pupils. The S.D. has been in the habit of accepting any nomination as the best that could be found, and seeing that I received no reply to my letter of 31st July, I told Mr. Laronde to come along and get to work.\n\n2. Mr. Laronde has hitherto given me highest satisfaction in working among the Indians. He will be under the guidance of Mr. MacKay who is experienced in such schools for 40 years past, & started Lac la Ronge School.\n\n3. I have no other person in view, & could not probably find one as good as Mr. Laronde, & the nomination has been granted to us.\n\n4. I am instructing Mr. Laronde that he is at present only Acting Principal. If he makes a failure he can be removed; but it would be unfair to him to cancel the appointment without fair trial.\n\nII. I am thankful that the Dept. will make an advance to start the school. This is acceptable, instead of the grant I asked for. Also that the S.D. will provide equipment. I sent long ago a partial list of what was required. I will have it amplified & repeated. We will be ready by 1st. The horses we have arrived though too late for the buying. The rest remain yours faithfully.\n\nJ. A. Saskatchewan\n\n(Victoria)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\nOttawa, September 22, 1914.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 11th instant in further reference to the maintenance, management and equipment of the new Pas Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the fact that Your Lordship has practically become responsible for the appointment of Mr. Laronde as principal of this school, the Department will consent to his being given a trial on the distinct understanding that should his management of the school not prove satisfactory his services are to be dispensed with on three month's notice. The Department will arrange to have this school inspected from time to time and Mr. Laronde will be given every assistance by the inspector and it is hoped that he will meet Your Lordship's expectations and make a success of this school.\n\nWith regard to the advance needed to carry on the school I have to request that Your Lordship will be good enough to state what amount is considered necessary for this purpose.\n\nAs to the equipment of the school I beg to enclose herewith a list of the articles transferred to the Pas Boarding School from the Battleford Industrial School, from which Your Lordship will see that nearly all the furnishings\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishopsthorpe,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nfurnishings required have been sent to the school. In fact the list contains articles which the Department does not supply to per capita grant schools, such as bedding, cooking utensils and crockery. It is noticed that there is no mention of mattresses in the list. If they are not on hand they will be supplied if Your Lordship will kindly state the sizes and number required. Any additional desks needed will also be furnished, but the number and sizes should be given.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory, I have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that one of the two teams of horses that were transferred from the Battleford Industrial School to Le Pas School as part of its equipment, has ever since its arrival here been useless and a source of expense. One horse of this team is troubled with rheumatism and lung trouble, and being over 20 years old, there is no hope of his becoming fit for service again. According to Mr. F. G. Barnes, he was sick at Battleford, was hardly able to make the landing here, and has been sick since.\n\nWe have tested this team regularly once a month after a month's rest and care, but at each trial the horse in question becomes almost too lame to walk and bleeds from the nose after a few hours' work, however light the work may be.\n\nUnder normal conditions we need one team to haul wood and hay and work about the place, and another team to assist, and to bring freight from the town, to get up ice, saw dust etc. The work in spring and summer...\nwill be still heavier as we shall require two teams to prepare our garden, pulling up stumps, haul away heavy stone, besides freighting etc. The roads here are of the heaviest, consisting of clay, stones, stumps and corduroy.\n\nOur one available team is overworked in doing the most necessary work of the school, and being an old team, it will not last long at the rate it has been working.\n\nWe urgently require a young and heavy team to complete our equipment in this respect, and we beg the Department to supply this need, as without another team we will be sadly handicapped at the beginning of our work here and when the need is greatest.\n\nThe sick horse is hopeless and had better be shot, while the other, though unable to do the heavy work required here, is still good for light work and could be sold for $50 at least. Both horses are idle as we have no equipment for a single horse.\n\nA young, heavy, team would cost in the neighbourhood of $275.\n\nI am Obediently Yours,\n(Pres) Louis Laronde\nPrincipal\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe Principal of The Pas Boarding School reports that one of the two teams of horses which were transferred from the Battleford Industrial School is now practically useless and one of the horses is so old that he should be shot. He asks that a new team be supplied and says that a young, heavy team can be bought for about $275.00. The Principal explains that they have plenty of work for two teams and, as we are equipping this school, I would recommend that another team be purchased.\n\nO.K. Paley\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 22nd ultimo reporting that one of the teams of horses which were transferred to the Pas Boarding School from the Battleford Industrial school is now useless and asking to be furnished with a young team I beg to say that you are authorized to purchase a heavy, young team of horses for the use of this school, the price of which should not exceed the amount quoted by you, viz.- $275.00, on the distinct understanding that no further request for equipment of this nature will be made.

Brodie, Murray & Lavende tried to manage this with a capable Indian, but found that he could not train the boys to do this work. I hope that you will persuade the Dept' to meet Lavende's account for expenses, & his requisition for equipment as generously as possible. If this is all counted merely as an advance, to be repaid by Capitation grant, it will be rather hard on the school, & on us. The children are well, & making rapid improvement; the Indians seem enthusiastic about it. I hope to visit the school soon.\n\nWishing you every happiness for 1915\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. Saskatchewan Bishop\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am writing by way of consequence of a letter just received from Rev. L. Laronde, The Pas School. When he wrote they had 75 pupils, & he expected to make up the balance of the 80 allowed in a few days. The school is beginning to get into good shape; but it was very hard on the staff for the first 10 weeks, as they were rather short-handed, & there was much to do. Archdeacon Mackay superintended for a time & helped them much by his experience & wisdom. I have now lent them Mr. & Mrs. Matheson (of Battleford School) for a short time, so that Mr. Laronde might get a good start & training. Then they will have the benefit of the valuable help & Miss Stages (if she does not overwork herself & get laid up). Laronde himself is a fine fellow\u2014earnest & diligent, & only lacking experience of this work. Laronde tells me that he has sent in a further requisition for equipment needed, & that meanwhile he has had to buy some of the things needed, without waiting for reply from you. I believe all was advised or sanctioned by Archdeacon Mackay or Canon Matheson, & I hope the Ind. Dept. will be generous.\n\nHe has also had to engage a good man to look after the stock & teach the boys how to thoroughly. This will be\nJanuary 20th, 1915.\n\nMy dear Bishop Newnham,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 11th instant, in reference to matters pertaining to the new Pas Boarding school. I am very pleased indeed to learn that a good start has been made in the work, and I shall await with pleasure the report after Your Lordship's visit to the institution.\n\nWith regard to the equipment for the institution, this will not constitute a charge against any advance in the per capita grant that may be made. The Department is willing to provide furnishings and equipment to a reasonable extent, although, of course, there may be certain classes of equipment that would reasonably be charged to the earnings of the school.\n\nIt is to be understood that the furnishing by the Department is once for all, and that the school author-\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nties will be responsible for future equipment and renewals.\n\nI shall be pleased to deal generously, as you request, with the requisition. Quotations for furnishings are at present being analyzed, but have not as yet been submitted to me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, March 11, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that you will at the earliest date convenient proceed to The Pas for the purpose of inspecting the new Church of England boarding school there. The Department wishes you to go thoroughly into the financial standing of this school since the date of its opening and submit a statement of receipts and expenditure and also a list of the outstanding accounts, if any, which are chargeable to the maintenance and management of this school, including salaries. The reason for asking for this statement is that Mr. Laronde, the Principal, is anticipating his per capita grant. He has already drawn $1550.00 in advances for the current quarter and there will only be a small balance due him on the 31st instant. While the Department will continue making advances for a short time, he should be given to understand that he will be expected to exercise due economy in the management of the school, as the Department cannot be held responsible for any deficit that may occur. The Department would like you also to report on matters generally in connection with the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nS. J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSuite No. 2,\n478 River Ave,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nfor grain or feed for the stock and horses. I would estimate that to clear the other 25 acres and get it ready for crop, for the year 1916, will take at least $250.00 in addition to the boys' labour. Again four old cows and a bull 10 years old, were sent him from Battleford, and he should have 10 young cows and a young bull furnished him at an early date, as there is plenty of hay to be found in the vicinity of the school. All the boarding schools in this Inspectorate make a special effort to have plenty of milk for the children, and if Mr Laronde is left with his old cows, he will be badly off in this respect.\n\nI am reporting on this school before the end of the month and will send full particulars as to the requirements of the Principal, if he is to make the institution a success. I found on the register of the school 81 pupils, of which 77 were present at the time of my visit, and no pupils have as yet been taken from the Red Earth Reserve, if authority was granted the attendance can be increased to 100 at any time. Kindly let me know if you wish me to take the trip requested by your letter. I will be in The Pas on the 4th of July, attending the treaty payments,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D.

Seeing from the books that the Principal was receiving advances on account of the per capita grant, I told him that this was not the usual policy of The Department, and that the grant must be based on the quarterly returns.\n\nThe Principal of this school will require some extra money for one or two years, to assist him in getting things on a paying basis, and will not be able to improve the land and run the school on the per capita grant.\n\nAs I reported to the [illegible] Department before the school was built, Fisher Island is thickly covered with bush, and has at the present time about 30 acres cleared of trees, but not of stumps, of this 20 acres was cleared by the Department, and 10 acres by the Church. Of this 30 acres, about 5 is cleared of stumps, about enough for potatoes and a garden, leaving nothing...\nOttawa, March 25, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in reference to conditions at The Pas Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it will not be necessary for you to make a special trip to The Pas for the purpose of inspecting the boarding school, as instructed in official letter of the 11th instant, unless further advised.

I believe everything is correct.\n\nI beg to thank you for the promptness with which you have purchased and forwarded the goods, of all of which we are pleased. Your promptness has enabled us to get all the equipment at the School before the roads became impassible, for a delay of a week in shipment would have made it impossible to get it on the ground before navigation opened.\n\nIn regard to the uneasiness of the Dept. about our financial position, I think it is unnecessary. We drew a large advance in this Quarter because of the large outlay necessary to secure our next winter's wood, when otherwise we would have been satisfied with far less for current accounts.

A desire to keep ourselves before our friends and supporters is our main motive, but we hope also, according to our capacity, to join in the good work for the uplift of the Indian race. As however the nature of a paper is largely determined by the character of its supporters, we earnestly ask all true friends for the Cause to co-operate with us to make our paper a mouth-piece for the missionary work of our Church in the West.\nTHE PAS AGENCY.\n\nBY W. R. TAYLOR, INDIAN AGENT.\n\nThe Pas Agency consists of six Reserves, viz., The Pas, Moose Lake, Chemawawin, Cumberland, Shoal Lake and Red Earth; it embraces an Indian population of 1077 souls at the last annuity payments, when was paid the sum total of $5720.00.\n\nThe largest Reserve is The Pas, which also leads in population. These Indians draw more money annually than any of the other bands in the Agency, due to their sale of the land which now forms The Pas townsite. These Indians, being more numerous, also usually earn more by their hunting than the others. In previous years, their earnings amounted to thousands of dollars annually from the fur hunt alone, the prices of furs being so encouraging, that all who were able went to gather in the fur harvest. At the close of the fur season, which is May 15th, each hunter of thrift had a substantial account to his credit. What a contrast is found this season. The war between the Allies and Germany, has completely demoralized fur prices, and the Indians find it difficult to make even a living. I write now of the Reserves in general.\n\nTimes have been hard for our Indians. The fur trade outlook was so discouraging at the beginning of last winter that the usual outfitting for the winter hunt was stopped by the various traders and stores. The Indians were therefore thrown upon their own resources, which generally, towards winter, are limited. The Dept. of Indian Affairs, upon proper representations being made to them, stepped in and gave assistance to the more deserving cases. Ammunition and twine were given to help them in fishing and to store game for their winter use. Encouragement was given to lay up provisions, rather than to exert themselves in the fur hunt. Provisions had been placed on every Reserve for the aged and destitute, but owing to failure in prices for furs, our issues began in some instances earlier than usual. Consequently, the supply ran short sooner than in other years and had to be replenished.\n\nFarming is encouraged among the various Bands, as far as is practicable, considering the nature of the country, which is not adapted to grain growing. Potatoes and vegetables are freely grown and mature well. In this, two Reserves, Shoal Lake and Red Earth, excel; there are grown the finest potatoes procurable, and in large quantities. These Indians always have a large surplus, which they sell to the Finger Lumber Company at a fair price.\n\nThe Reserves are visited in summer by gasolene launch, the \"Ogemah;\" and in winter, by dog-trains and, in some cases, by horses. We touch at all Reserves by water with our launch, with\n\n(Continued on page 8.)\n\nOUR BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nIn order to give our readers some conception of our School, we herewith subjoin a brief sketch of the site, buildings, and the present Staff of the School.\n\nTHE SITE\n\nThe School is situated on Fisher Island, about six miles from The Pas, and near the Big Eddy of the Saskatchewan River. The site is called an island because, at high water, it is entirely surrounded by water. At this time the only means of access is by boat which could come to within 200 yards from the School. At very low water, a narrow neck of land to the east connects the Island to the main-land, and it is possible to walk over this crossing on foot. Ordinarily, however, the water is high enough to isolate us, and crossing over to the mainland with horses would not be possible. The Fisher Creek to the south of us flows in a southerly direction and enters the Saskatchewan two miles away. A chain of lakes and mud-flats forms the other barrier around the Island. Fisher Island is about 320 acres in extent, and is thickly wooded with white poplar, with a sprinkling of birch and a few spruce, and the only clearing is a 20-acre space around the School. With the exception of a few acres this clearing is thickly studded with stumps and stones, and it will require hard work to clear enough acreage for a farm. The soil is vegetable mold over a clay sub-soil, which, with cultivation, should be productive. The thick woods which cover the Island will provide fuel for some years to come; while hay, barring floods, will be plentiful. The character of the Island points to farming as our principal means towards self-support, and this fits in with our hopes and aims. Other sites may claim superior advantages in the way of accessibility and beauty of surroundings, but we believe that a site of equal acreage and natural resources would be difficult to find within the same radius from The Pas.\n\nTHE BUILDINGS.\n\nThe main building is a three story frame structure on concrete foundations, 90ft. by 85ft., in the shape of a T, with commodious balconies on the whole of the front, where are located the fire escapes, consisting of brass sliding poles, with doors leading out from each dormitory and hallway. In the basement are located the bakery, acetylene gas-plant, laundry, drying-room, tank room, with a 3000 gallon compression tank, and a large soft-water cistern, boys' gymnasium, and the furnace room. On the main floor are the Indians' waiting-room, office, two sitting-rooms, main class-room dining-room, kitchen and pantries, and the girls' play-room, used also as a class-room. On the second floor, which is used by the\ngirls and staff, are two dormitories, with large clothes closets, two wash-rooms, two bath-rooms, sewing room; Principal and Matron's suite, and staff rooms. The third floor is similarly laid out as the second, and is occupied by the staff and boys. Hard-wood floors are used throughout, hot and cold water laid out on every floor; the building is heated by steam, while an acetylene gas plant, of 150-lights capacity, provides excellent light for the building.\n\nThe out-buildings, which are all excellent, consist of a barn, pigery, hen and root house, engine and pump house, store house, an ice house, and pupils' out-buildings.\n\nThese buildings were built and are owned by the Dept. of Indian Affairs, who have spared no expense to render them up-to-date and sanitary, and are an outcome of many years' experience of Indian education.\n\nTHE STAFF.\n\nRev. L. Laronde, M.A., B.D., acts as Principal. Mr. Laronde has an intimate knowledge of most of the different phases of Indian boarding school life and work, and also passed through the practical stage of teaching in Indian day schools in Western Ontario and Manitoba, and later as missionary under the Church Missionary Society, was engaged in Indian Mission work in the Diocese of Rupertslad among the Crees and Ojibways.\n\nIn every large school there is need for a mechanical genius. We have such a man in our Engineer, Mr. F. J. Watts, who not only attends to the machinery of the School and keeps them in proper running order, but also can turn his hand to almost anything that requires solving about the School, as he is a first class carpenter, and has served his time in tinsmithing and farming, and can also work at the forge.\n\nMr. M. Demerse came to us only recently, but has already made his influence felt. He knows farm work both in the East and West, and under his management, our stock has shown a marked improvement. Besides assisting the Principal in the care of the boys, his interest and skill in athletics has caused increased enthusiasm for outdoor sports among the pupils, and we feel sure that the important work of clearing and laying out our farm will prosper under his charge.\n\nMr. Robt. McGillivray, as labourer, has proved himself thoroughly reliable in his own field, and has ever been a staunch advocate of the School among his people. We regret that he is severing his connection with us this month.\n\nMrs. Laronde, as honorary matron, brings to her work both ability and the experience needed for this important position. She has had a successful career as a school teacher in Quebec, as well as among the Indians in the West, marked by a succession of prizes and bonuses secured by her schools.\n\nMiss H. Hayes, assistant matron, has had a long and successful career in a similar capacity at the Battleford Industrial School. We consider ourselves fortunate to have secured her services, as her experience has gained her control of children and the ability to win their affections.\n\nMiss M. G. Willis, B.A., is a graduate of Owen's College, of the University of Manchester, with five year's practical experience in England, and two years in Canada, in country schools, as well as at St. Alban's Ladies' College, Prince Albert. Her work as senior teacher will be increasingly effective with the advance of her pupils.\n\nMiss K. S. S. Upsdell, our primary teacher, has a second class professional standing. She received her training at Goldsmith's Training College, University of London, and her practical experience consisted of six year's teaching in London and in Dartford, England, and one year in Canada, at Coblenz, Sask. Full of energy and enthusiasm, and gifted with unusual musical ability, she fills an important place in our school, and under her tutelage, our pupils are gaining fast in music, singing, as well as in their other work.\n\nMiss Olive Hitchcox is one of the workers sent out by the Women's Auxiliary to our School,\nand we have been fortunate indeed in her choice. She presides over the kitchen with great ability, and a great deal of the good health of our pupils is due to her skill. Miss Hitchcox came from England four years ago with her people who made their home at Oakville, Ont. She was accepted by the W.A., and was sent as a probationer to the Chapleau Indian Boarding School, and completed her training at the Hospital for Sick Children and at the Alexandra School for Girls, Toronto, when she was accepted as a W.A. missionary and sent to our School.\n\nMiss Norma Moody, the other of our W.A. workers, received her training at the Battleford Industrial School, and the Battleford General Hospital. She is in charge of the Sewing room, and of all the pupils' clothing, which is a work which requires patience, industry and able management. Miss Moody, we are sorry to say, is not with us at present, as an unfortunate accident to her arm made it necessary for her to go to Winnipeg, but we hope to have her back with us soon. Miss Moody has endeared herself to all the girls.\n\nThe Indian Hospital at Fisher Island\n\nTHE INDIAN HOSPITAL.\n\nFor the benefit of the School and of the Indians of the surrounding Reserves, the Dept. of Indian Affairs built on a site within 300 feet from the School a hospital for the sick, at a cost of $10,000. As can be seen from our cut, it is a substantial frame building, capable of accommodating 25 patients, with basement and a veranda extending the width of the front. Water and light are supplied from the School plants, while the heating is from two hot air furnaces in the basement. On the ground floor are the doctor's office, men's ward, women's ward, dispensary, operating room, dining room, kitchen and pantry; on the second floor are two semi-private wards, doctor's bedroom, nurse's bedroom, and sitting room, house-keeper's room, bathroom, linen room, and a bedroom for emergency help. Separate in a wing by itself is the isolation ward for infectious cases. The interior is finished in beaverboard; the walls are sheeted with alternate layers of lumber, Cabot's quilt and Neponset paper, and the whole finished off on the outside by three-ply roofing.\n\nThe nurse in charge of the hospital is Miss Mabel Jenner. She is a graduate of St. Joseph's, Chatham, Ont. Before she came here she was engaged in private nursing in Winnipeg for three years. Miss Jenner is indefatigable in her duties to the sick from the School and from the Reserves. She is winning her way into the hearts of the Indians and quickly breaking down the prejudice against hospitals which usually characterises them at first. From the very first good work has been accomplished, and we look forward to its still greater usefulness and benefit. Patients are coming now as far as from Nelson House on the Hudson's Bay. The hospital is entirely under the control of the Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nLOCAL NEWS.\n\nMr. Glen Campbell, Chief Inspector, was a visitor at our School.\n\nBorn.\u2014At the Fisher Island Hospital, on Jan. 20th., a son to Rev. and Mrs. Laronde.\n\nIn the absence of Dr. R. D. Orok, M.P.P., Drs. F. Orok and Robinson have been attending the hospital and School.\n\nMrs. M. Metcalf, after a month's stay as temporary help, has been obliged to leave the School because of sickness in her family.\n\nMiss M. A. Robinson, one of the original members of our Staff, and a valued worker, who left us because of ill-health, has fully recovered from her sickness.\n\nS. J. Jackson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, made his official visit recently. His visit has been very helpful to us, not only by his friendly counsel and advice, but also by his practical efforts in our behalf. Our long delayed equipment has been purchased and shipped by him since his departure and is now ready to our hand.\nIndian Agent, W. R. Taylor, in his monthly visits, has shown unfailing interest in our School.\n\nRev. Canon and Mrs. Matheson visited us last January. The long experience of these faithful workers was specially helpful to all.\n\nMiss Kate E. Halson, the General Dorcas Secretary, spent two weeks at our School last Oct. while on her Western tour of W. A. work. We were delighted to have Miss Halson come to our School for first hand impressions of our position and needs. We have no sincerer friend or a more indefatigable worker on our behalf than Miss Halson, and we gladly render our thanks to her. An article from her pen in the Letter Leaflet has done much to make our School known to W. A. workers.\n\nOur special thanks are due to the All Saints' Church G. A., Ottawa, for supplying presents for our Xmas tree; to Ottawa W. A. for an organ and Communion vessels for our new Church, donated in memory of Mrs. Greene, and for the Staff sitting-room furniture, donated in memory of Mrs. McGillivray. Lack of space prevents us from giving an account of the work of the W. A. in behalf of our School in this number, but we hope to do so in our next.\n\n(Continued from page 2.)\n\nthe exception of Red Earth. We could go to within ten miles of this Reserve, where there was a jam of fallen trees and driftwood, which completely blocked the river. Here we would disembark and use canoes, usually hired from Shoal Lake, and were paddled up to Red Earth Reserve. Here also all freight for the Indian Department, the Hudson's Bay Company and Revillon Freres, was landed by the Ross Navigation Co., and freighted onward by canoes and by waggon. This jam, I am glad to say, was taken out by the Saskatchewan Government last winter, and a passage cleared through which boats may now pass and land right at the school house door.\n\nOn each of these Reserves is established a day school, and a teacher is paid by the Dept. of Indian Affairs to teach the rising generation the rudiments of education. It is to me an interesting thing, during my visits, to examine these schools, and note what progress the children make. Some of the children are indeed clever, while all appear bright and happy.\n\nThe parents are anxious to see their children attend school, on some of the Reserves especially. The Pas, Shoal Lake and Cumberland Bands, responded nobly in filling The Pas Residential School to overflowing. Here are seen as bright a bunch of children as it has been my good fortune to behold. Under the able management of Rev. L. Laronde and his Staff, this School is progressing favourably.\nIndian Boarding School,\nThe Pas,\n29, 3, 15.477331\n\nDear Mr. Jackson,\n\nI am just finishing a three days' visit here, and am much pleased with buildings, equipment (as far as it goes), and state of work, and condition of pupils. All is going well, and I think you will have cause to be proud of your Pas School.\n\nI quite agree with Mr. Laronde, and I believe with yourself also, that a good stock in the stables will tend to economy, that the school should raise all its own milk, butter and potatoes, hay, &c., some beef and poultry, &c. These things are costly to buy. The school might also sell some. I hear you are asking the I.D. for 6 more good cows and a young bull, besides hens and pigs. I hope you will obtain them. Is it any use my writing to Ottawa to back your request, or will you in your letter tell them that I am very anxious to have these things? and I think I can promise good results. We need a really good bull. The present one is poor, also good milking cows, at least 6 more. It will be easy to raise hay, roots and other fodder here.\n\nI thank you for all you have done, and for all you are going to do.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) J. A. Saskatchewan,\nBishop.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to my report on The Pas Indian Boarding School, posted to you on the 31st of March. I neglected to put on Statement Nomine, Requirements, one 2 year old Thoroughbred Bull.\n\nFor your information, I am sending you copy of a letter just received from Bishop Newnham, and he sees good prospects for the future of the School in the West.\n\nWe are aware of the fact that both in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the Anglican Church is poor and cannot afford to equip these schools as ought to be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDuncan C.

He now asks to be allowed to purchase one and refers to a copy of a letter from the Bishop of Saskatchewan, which he encloses.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\nOttawa, April 21, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 12th instant in which you were authorized to purchase certain articles for The Pas Boarding School I beg to say that, as the Department has instructed Mr. Inspector Graham to purchase a number of cows and bulls in the Portage la Prairie district, it has been decided to allow him to buy the six cows and bull required for The Pas school at the same time and he will be requested to have them shipped to The Pas and advise the Principal of the date of shipment. It will, therefore, not be necessary for you to do anything in connection with the purchase of the cows and bull for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nStonewall, Man.\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nI fear I forgot to write by you the following information or request. If I did write by you pardon the repetition.\n\nThe friends & supporters of the new school at the Pas Boarding School & our Church people generally desire that the school may be called the \"John A. MacKay Boarding School\" in honour of an older & best missionary to the Crees, who has long been connected with the Pas, & was largely instrumental in obtaining such a fine school from the S.D. We wish to know if the S.D. will accept & recognize the name, or let it be the official name. \"The Pas Boarding School (for Indians)\" is rather a vague title & makes little appeal to Church people. The \"Jno. A. MacKay Boarding School\" will appeal to us much more strongly. Will you lay this before the proper authorities, use your interested influence to have it accepted, or let me know. I am just starting to visit the school, & see how things are going on. They need another lady-worker, as the staff is over-worked. So far I have been unable to procure one.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. A. Saskatchewan\n\nIndian Affairs.

I think the title is somewhat cumbersome; I see no reason why we should not consent to call it the Mackay Indian Boarding School.

There are just now 82 children on the roll, a few more, just under age, who will join the roll next quarter. They are the healthiest looking lot I have seen at any of the schools, & in manners & conduct already show a marked improvement; while they seem very intelligent & are making rapid progress in their learning. I am particularly pleased with all I see at the school. The buildings & equipment also merit commendation, & I am really grateful to the Department for such an institution & have told the parents of the pupils that they are very fortunate. Some of the equipment is not yet complete by any means, especially as regards the forming of their outdoor departments; but I think that for a beginning it is in fairly advanced condition. All this has meant hard & faithful work on the part of the Principal & all his staff, & I think praise is due to them. The work has been all the harder because they are a little short-handed. Miss Moody has been absent from serious trouble following a broken arm, which has necessitated serious surgical treatment. But we hope that she will be back very soon, & we are expecting another lady also to take charge of taking care of laundry work, which for some time has been done by members of the staff who should be free from this extra work. There will also be changes in the female staff.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBut I do not think you need be anxious about the capability of the Principal, as at his faithful diligence of his work. I consider that considering the many difficulties inseparable from the initiation of the school, the lack both in equipment or in funds at the start, he has done remarkably well. He is very enthusiastic, a subject to make the school return a good proportion of the cost of maintenance, if he is only allowed a reasonable outfit in tools & in live-stock etc.\n\nI do hope you will persuade the Department here as liberal as possible, & to respond to this application for equipment as early as fully as possible.

L. Larmie, the amount asked for (with this letter) to cover expenses incurred in organisation, & before he could begin to claim Capitalization Grant. Organisation is really part of equipment & is not part of the maintenance. It was necessary that some members of the staff should be on hand for a few weeks before the pupils arrived, to put the school in order, set up the furniture, clean up after the contractor, etc. This, I say, is really part of the \"equipment\", & the work which has been done has been done, as the cost of the equipment is intended to be outside parties. The Church has borne part of this expense, & I think the S.D. should bear the rest as it undertook\nTo hand the school over to the Church, equipped & ready for the beginning of the work of teaching, or I permit a separate sheet the account for this, you will find that it has been kept as far as possible.\n\nFurther, I understand that Mr. Jackson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, is very eager that we should use our full time opportunities of farming at this school, that the school should have started with as good an outfit of live stock as similar schools have had, & that he is going to ask the S.D. for more cows, etc. I beg to endorse his suggestion. Mr. Larned's livestock have done well with the few animals they have. A good stock of cows, & here, & a few pigs will really be an economy. They should raise all their own beef, milk, & butter, perhaps be able to sell some at a good price.\n\nI trust I have not worried you, but I have noticed some of the enthusiasm felt here, & I do believe that generous treatment by the S.D. will bring a good return.

Taylor Esq.,\nIndian Agent, The Pas. Man.\n\nSir,\n\nI have been given to understand by the Ven. Archdeacon Mackay on his return from his visit to Ottawa, that the Department would assist the school in defraying the heavy expenses in connection with the securing of our hay last summer.\n\nAs you are aware the floods destroyed every vestige of hay around the school, and it was necessary to purchase hay and feed to keep up our stock during the summer until we could bring in our summer's cut at the Carrot River.\n\nAs soon as our flats were flooded we had the Ross Navigation Co. transport our outfit 7 miles up the Saskatchewan where we cut about 15 tons before we were again flooded. We then had our outfit transported 35 miles up the Carrot River where we put up about 90 tons.\n\nWe found it would have been prohibitive to get our hay pressed and hauled during the summer, and found it cheaper to buy sufficient hay to carry us till we could haul our hay in winter from Carrot River.\n\nIn the winter hauling, it will be necessary to have a man in camp at the hay field to load and bring the team half-way to the school and be met by another team with an empty load, then exchange sleighs and return to camp and load up ready for the next day. We can only bring in 5 or 6 tons per week, and it will require about 15 weeks to haul all.\nour hay with the two teams that would be available, leaving one team to do the work around the School.\n\nThe assistance of the Department in this matter will be very welcome, as without it, this heavy expense for hay and feed would become a burden to the School which would add much to our deficit.\n\nTrusting that you will kindly bring this matter before the Department with your recommendation for assistance, I am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.

I have not certified the accounts, as they were incurred without my knowledge.\n\nIn connection with this hay, I beg to say that hay this season was procured at great expense. The water in the Saskatchewan river rising, overflowing its banks and flooding the whole surrounding hay meadows. While the hay season was on I ran the Doctor's boat over the school haygrounds, there was then 3\u00bd feet of water over them. They had to go up the Saskatchewan River, and after cutting for a time, had to build a stage and stack their hay on this. The water drove them away from this place, and they had to go away up the Carrot river, where they put up about 90 tons. This hay will have to be hauled 35 miles by teams.\n\nIn submitting the account to the Department for consideration, I beg to say that the school has been to great expense in getting hay, and if the Department will not pay the whole account, I would recommend that some assistance be given.\n\nYour Obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI beg to lay before you one or two matters of a financial kind re The Mackay Boarding School, at The Pas.\n\n1. I would like to secure a hay reserve up the Carrot River for cases of emergency, such as the past season. If it had not been for our getting hay up the Carrot River we should have had to kill, or sell, some of the school cattle. Floods are liable to happen any season, and we ought to have a hay reserve to fall back upon. Will you take this up with the proper Department, or tell me how to do so.\n\n2. I would earnestly endorse Mr. Laronde's appeal for a grant of $500.00 to cover the expenses of getting our hay this last season. I believe he has sent you a detailed statement of expenses amounting to $497.50. If he has not, I can do so. He has taken it up with you through the Indian Agent. I understand that the extra expense for feed caused by the floods is even greater than what he has put down in his account. In your letter to me of 4th August, speaking of this extra expense, you say \"if you find it necessary...\"\nto do so, you might submit a statement showing the expenditure for the consideration of the Department.\" We have done so, and I trust the Department will be able to meet it.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The amount of grant due each quarter is calculated and paid on the average attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nThe Manager,\nCanadian Bank of Commerce,\nThe Pas, Man.\nIndian Department, Winnipeg,\nNovember 29th, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nA few days ago Dr. Orok of Le Pas, while in the city, told me that there was an epidemic of sickness at the Le Pas Indian School, which he thought was due to a stoppage in the sewer, and that he thought it would be well for me to go out to investigate. So I left for there on Wednesday morning Nov. 24th, and arrived the following day and went out with Dr. Robertson, who is acting for Dr. Orok, to the Hospital and Indian School. I found thirty cases of typhoid fever including four of the staff at the School, and the Housekeeper at the Hospital. A woman had been authorized to assist at the School, so I left her to take care of the staff, sick at the School, and instructions for all the pupils, laid up at the School, to be removed to the Hospital with their beds and bedding, as soon as another nurse had arrived from Winnipeg, for whom I had telegraphed for. The nurse at the Hospital was absolutely alone, to cook and look after about ten cases, and it was utterly impossible for her to continue without help. I requested Mr. Taylor, the Agent, to have a woman replace the Housekeeper at the Hospital for a month, and that with the assistance of the extra nurse, who left here on Friday morning, Nurse Jenner says that she thinks they could manage. It will mean about twenty-five cases at the Hospital, and there are more cases developing each day.\n\nThe sewer has been attended to and it is running freely now, but no disinfectants had been used, so I ordered lime, chloride of lime and formalin to be used thoroughly, and also instructed that the water and milk be boiled before being used.\n\nDr. Robertson will go out every second day, and if necessary will go every day.\nI brought in samples of milk and water to be analyzed. The water was found to be all right, but I think the trouble is carried by the milk through handling. A thorough process of disinfection will be carried out, but there has never been any stationary laundry tub placed in the laundry and connected with the water system, for which a request had been made before.\n\nThere is also a hot water tank there which is burst from top to bottom and the nurse says that they have no hot water for their baths, since she has been there, and it is very important to have good facilities for washing in Hospitals, particularly with an epidemic of this sort. The tank, I am told, can not be repaired without sending it back to the foundry and a new one can be got for somewhere in the neighborhood of $15.00.\n\nIn clearing out the sewer, a man-hole has been put in between the Y and the septic tank, but to facilitate it being cleaned out other times, a man-hole should be put in at the Y and another one between the Y and Hospital. Mr. Jackson, the Inspector, had sewer rods supplied for cleaning out the sewer, and Mr. Lerond, Principal of the School, has asked for some plungers to be used. So I have ordered a dozen of them and a dozen enamel bed-pans and a dozen towels.\n\nI have sent out typhoid vaccine to inoculate those at the School who have not contracted the disease.\n\nI have taken all this responsibility of engaging the Nurse and so forth, on myself, as it is too serious a matter to trifle with, and I trust you will approve of my actions.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It seems to me that it would have been better to postpone the issue of a paper such as \"The Advocate\" until the school was well established and until you had shown that it could be conducted with due regard to the health of the pupils and that the staff had sufficient ability to keep the equipment in good order.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

I am, Sir,\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nLouis Lavoie\nPrincipal.\nJanuary 21st, 1916.\n\nRev Sir -\n\nMy attention has been drawn to your letter of November 5th, in which you ask for general literature bearing on Indian work to be used in fostering interest in the work of the Department. There is no literature available except the Annual Report of the Department.\n\nAs I mentioned in my letter of November 19th last, it seems to me that the establishment of this paper should have been delayed until the school was in good running order.\n\nUpon a more careful examination of the issue, for September and October, I find some misstatements; I have particular reference to the statements made in the article on compulsory education, which do not at all express the attitude of the Department upon this important question, and which, unfortunately, must create an undesirable impression in the minds of the readers of your paper.\n\nRev Louis Laroche,\nPrincipal, MacKay Boarding School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nIt seems rather strange that you should not be aware that there are regulations for compulsory attendance at schools.\n\nI feel that I must bring these matters to the attention of his Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJanuary 21st, 1916.\n\nDear Bishop Newnham -\n\nMy attention has been drawn to certain incorrect statements in the issue of a paper called \"The Advocate,\" published at the MacKay Boarding School.\n\nI have no doubt that if you have read the issue for September and October you have observed the misstatements, particularly those regarding compulsory attendance at schools. It would appear that Rev. Mr. Laroche has no knowledge of our regulations in this respect.\n\nI am of opinion that the issue of a paper, such as this, should have been postponed until the school was well established. It must constitute a considerable waste of energy on the part of the Principal, if it appears regularly. It seems to me that it would be better if his whole efforts were devoted to the management of the school, a task which would demand his entire time and abilities.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nI thought it well to express to your Lordship my personal opinion.

I fear I did not carefully read the Sept.-Oct. number\u2014if I saw it. I will write & ask him for one. I will then take up the matter with him, & endeavor to control his efforts at \"editorials.\" I am sorry you think the issue of such a paper unwise so early in the school's history. I trust you will not be hurt if I do not quote a few with you.\n\n1. The J.D. money does not nearly pay for the running of the school, we have to depend on friends to supplement the funds. The Advocate interests them & they rally to our help.\n\n2. It does not take up a great deal of his time. It only appears every second (or third?) minute. We had the press & the type, & it is teaching the boys the printer's trade.\n\n3. Moreover it encourages the children to take an interest in the school's doings, & impress them selves in English. It seems to me a very fair item in \"the management of the school,\" & Larmde is always very ready to be advised or even to be set right. Archibald MacKay is just going there, & will arrange about some responsible \"editing.\" I trust you will have no further occasion to object to it.\n\nBelieve me yours faithfully,\n\nJ. A. Saskatchewan\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Indians of Canada, as a race, through no fault of their own, have played but a minor part in the War. At the commencement of the war there were few more eager to offer their means and personal services than the Indians, but for some incomprehensible reason their offers to form battalions or regiments were refused, although they were not debarred from enlisting individually, as it were on the quiet, and their money was accepted. This anomalous state of affairs is now ended, and the Indians can take their place as an integral part of the British Empire, and go forth, as a unit, to fight for King and Country. The Indian has played a no mean part in the history of Canada, his courage and steadiness has been proved on many a battlefield, while his loyalty is undoubted. Their native qualities will make the Indians, once they adapted themselves to the intricacies of modern warfare, good soldiers, trench fighting would come natural to them, and, as scouts and snipers, they would have few equals. There are already many Indians at the front, fighting in the trenches with credit to themselves and to their race, many are now in training and we feel sure that they will rally round the Flag as long as there is need and their numbers last.\n\nFor the Church this movement means a call for further sacrifice,\u2014to provide, as leaders, men who understand and sympathise with the Indians, or in other words, Indian missionaries and workers. As its capacity for sacrifice and the loyalty of its members is well known, the Church may confidently be expected not to fail in this crisis.\nDOINGS OF THE SCHOOL.\n\nSince our last issue we have passed through an anxious and critical time on account of an epidemic of sickness which visited the School from about the middle of October to the middle of December when the last case went down. Owing to the peculiar nature of the symptoms we failed to obtain a definite diagnosis of the epidemic until after six weeks, by which time the epidemic had reached its height and thereafter soon spent itself. The epidemic was ascribed variously as due to ptomaine poisoning, injudicious or over-eating, sewer-gas poisoning, mud-fever from the eating of ducks, etc.; consequently our efforts to combat it were of a random nature. The Department sent its Medical Superintendent, on Nov. 25th., who pronounced the epidemic a mild type of typhoid. Vigorous measures were prescribed in the way of diet, disinfection and the isolation of patients in the hospital. At its height there were 21 pupils down with the disease, and 5 out the Staff. With the help of nurses supplied by the Indian Department we were able to carry on the usual routine of the School.\n\nHappily all our pupils and Staff have come through the epidemic as well as ever; but it was not permitted us to come through our time of trial altogether without sorrow. The infant son of Rev. and Mrs. Laronde, at a time when the mother herself was sick, became a victim of the typhoid and, in spite of robust constitution, succumbed to the disease on Nov. 28th. after less than three weeks' illness. The child's death was felt all the more keenly inasmuch as he was born and brought up in our midst, and was looked upon as the School baby.\n\nAs to when or how the infection of typhoid began it would be impossible to say. There had been an outbreak of typhoid in town and about thirty cases had developed, and it is thought that there was a connection between the two outbreaks.\n\nThe shadow of the epidemic passed away with the approach of the holidays, and, the time of anxiety being past, we were able to enjoy the Christmas season all the more, with our numbers complete with the exception of 18 pupils who were still in the hospital, but convalescent. Chiefly through the generosity of the Girls' Auxiliary of All Saints' Church, Ottawa, we were able to have a Christmas Tree entertainment on Christmas Eve. The class room was tastefully decorated with evergreens, wreathing, Chinese lanterns and flags, while the Tree was loaded down with gifts for over 100 people. Several carols were nicely rendered by different classes and by all the pupils. Then the jingle of Sant-\nta Claus' bells could be heard and he entered amid tense excitement on the part of the pupils and Indians. Santa Claus is still unfamiliar enough to most of our pupils as to be an awesome figure to them, and in spite of his gentleness was regarded with terror by the little ones. However, he won their hearts by his liberality, and all went happily to bed with their gifts after they had sung \"God Save the King,\" and gave three cheers for Principal and Mrs. Laronde, and three for Santa Claus. Then Santa must needs go over to the hospital to visit the children there. So preceded by the members of the Staff, bearing his gifts, Santa here also brought pleasure to the children and, amid squeals of delight or fright, gave every one a gift. Mr. Turner made a very excellent Santa Claus.\n\nOn Christmas morning all the children attended the Christmas service, after which they sat down to a substantial Christmas dinner, which was eaten up with relish. Lastly, there is a rush on the part of the girls to wash up dishes and put things aright, for by this time there are many dog trains and an occasional horse and sleigh waiting outside which are to carry them home for a brief visit to their parents.\n\nOn the afternoon of the appointed day for the return to the School, there is a steady stream of men and women, on foot or with dog trains or horses, bringing their children home. The return is marked by a greater exuberance of spirits than the departure from School, showing that however great the attractions of the home were the School was still a dearer place. By the morning of Jan. 3rd. the School had resumed its accustomed routine and activity.\n\nWith the Christmas holidays we lost through their graduation four more of our pupils, viz; Gilbert Moore, Frederick Young, Simeon Bear and George Cowan. The benefit that these boys derived by their year's stay in the School, and their worth, may be measured by the extent they have been missed in the different departments of our School life, and we feel sure that they will acquit themselves true men in the battle of life.\n\nThe Farmer and his boys are busy transporting hay from our distant hayfield to the School. By steady hauling with two teams, they bring about six tons a week.\n\nIn the proposed Indian Contingent or Contingents, to be raised in this district and elsewhere, the War is coming nearer home to us. The call will find the School ready. The Principal has been offered a commission in the proposed contingent, and if the way be open, he will join. All our ex-pupils, interviewed so far, have expressed a willingness to join, and among our available pupils there is the same ready spirit.\nLOCALS.\n\nDIED.\u2014At the Mackay Boarding School, on Nov. 28th., 1915, Melvin Jenner, son of Rev. and Mrs. Laronde, aged 10 months and 8 days.\n\nTo Mr. Demerse we owe the excellent cut of our football team, which is reproduced here.\n\nDr. Robertson inoculated with typhoid antitoxin about 40 of the children who had not been affected by the epidemic.\n\nDr. Robertson, of The Pas, was on Nov. 1st., appointed as Doctor for the Indian Department in this district, in succession to Dr. R.

Thorough tests were instituted by the Doctor of the water supply, milk, etc., without discovery of the bacillus.\n\nMrs. C. Holman, of The Pas, spent two weeks at the School to assist in nursing during the epidemic, and was relieved by Mrs. W.

Mrs. Laronde said 'Hello, Santa Claus.' I went out because I thought Santa was not nice. The little girls cried and got up on desks, but the boys laughed. But I guess Santa was having fun because he shouted 'Hip, hip, hurrah.'\u2014Mary Moore.\n\nMr. Laronde got us a Christmas tree; he hung up dollies, candles and candies. Santa Claus came to the Christmas tree and ran round the room and gave presents to the children and ladies. The little girls screamed and cried. The girls in front sang carols. The girls wore their blue Sunday dresses. When all was finished the children sang \"God save the King.\" Santa took off his hat and mask, and let the cheering, and said good-bye to us.\u2014Elsie Ross.\n\nI went home for the Christmas holidays, and I was very glad to come back to school again. On New Year's day we had a good time; all of us girls from Big Eddy and Carrot River were sliding and playing other games; the men played football, while the women played other nice games. I was glad to meet the girls who left the School last October.\u2014Hagar Cook.\n\nWe were in the hospital for three weeks sick with fever. We did not eat anything at all, but had things to drink. We were very hungry sometimes. We asked Miss Jenner to give us bread, but she didn't because she was afraid of the Doctor. The Doctor said if we ate meat or bread we would not get well. We were sorry to miss the Christmas tree at the School, but Santa Claus made us happy by coming and giving us our presents.\u2014Mary Jane Cook.\n\nAt the School they had a Christmas tree, but I did not see it because I was in the hospital. Santa Claus came to the hospital and gave us our dolls, ribbons and handkerchiefs. We all sat on our beds and screamed when he came in. He gave us our presents, and he danced in the middle of the ward and he told us that he came from Cumberland and that he had seen the children there.

(No. 126.410-21) in reference to my request for general literature bearing on Indian work to be used in fostering interest in the work of the Department, I beg to say that I had in mind (a) various contributions from your pen and that of other Dept. officials; (b) the Report issued to Inspectors; (c) current news of the Indians emanating from the Dept.; and (d) records of Indian customs, etc.\n\nIn regard to your disapproval of our establishment of the paper until some future date, I beg to say that had there been any indication or promise of encouragement and future help in your letter in reply to our request for help, I certainly would have awaited your time and convenience; but the impression derived from your letter was one unsympathetic coldness with our aim. I started the paper when I did in compliance with the wishes of our Indian Committee, but in deference to your disapproval, I gave up the idea of teaching the trade to any of our pupils until such time as the Dept. may think fit to counteract the undertaking by its support.\n\nIndian Affairs.

So that theoretically the Dept. is up-to-date on the question of Compulsory Education, but practically it is as stated in our paper; there is Compulsory Education in potential but not in actual Instances to my knowledge of appeal for enforcement of education to the Indian Act have been in each case refused. I beg further to refer you to the Winnipeg Resolutions of 1907, wherein the need of some system of Compulsory education was felt to be necessary by those interested in Indian work, and admitted by the Deputy Superintendent, in his reply, as far as attendance at the day schools was concerned.\n\nIn my request for assistance in the way of literature, I was bidding at the same time for your co-operation, so that whatever was published bearing on the work of the Dept. should be done from the point of view of the Dept. Your reply to this was a condemnation for incompetence in regard to the management of our sewers which condemnation, in turn, was based on a report made at random, without personal inspection and only from hearsay, and consequently unreliable. Failing a supply\nof material from the Dept. we must use what we can secure, and naturally this will be utilized from the individual standpoint with the consequent liability to error. But as our aim is for truth and justice we shall not knowingly be party to any prejudicial utterances, and if found out in such will thankfully publish any corrections submitted.\n\nYour intimation to bring these matters to my Bishop characterizes your letter, which otherwise was very fair, as being on a par with your previous personal communications wherein I have yet to find that spirit of patient and friendly sympathy and justice which, as Principal of one of your schools, I have the right to expect from the active head of the Dept., and being deprived of which renders one discouragingly handicapped.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nLouis Laronde\nPrincipal.\nFebruary 16th, 1916.\n\nDear Bishop Newnham -\n\nI am enclosing herewith for your information a copy of a letter which I have just received from Rev.

There is some little deficit, but it is not alarming, especially when you consider the profitable cost of hay last summer. But it must not increase, or recur, & we think it need not if the following be carried out.\n\nA) I again urge on your Department a favourable response to the appeal for extra grants for 1915, of $500, to cover extra cost because of the floods, an appeal you have been \"considering\" for 4 months. Detailed cost of extra hay was sent to you.\n\nB) In view of somewhat frequent floods & extra cost, we advise your Department to direct Mr. Larom\u00e9 to reduce his horses to two teams only, his cows to six, with bull, a reasonable number of growing calves; & to allow him to dispose of the surplus over that for the benefit of the school deficit. I have advised Mr. Larom\u00e9 to that course but he would hardly adopt it without word from you. It will very often be difficult & costly to get hay for more than that number, 4 horses, 6 cows, bull, calves in proportion.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. A.

This assumption is contradicted by the testimony of the Indians here as well as by the old timers, who unite...\nIn saying that there is a flood once every seven years, and that successive floods have been unknown.\n\nIt is a well-known fact and a matter of common sense that floods on the Saskatchewan are caused, not by excessive snow-fall in the mountains, but by cloud-bursts and excessive rains, and these conditions are unusual.\n\nBecause other schools, e.g., Lac la Ronge Boarding School, can plod along with one team, 1 cow, hand-pumps, box-stoves etc., is no reason why the MacKay Boarding School which was built on first-class principles, should be degraded to the level of a second-rate school.\n\nOne good year will enable us to put up more than two years' supply of hay from our own flats, while two years would make our stock a source of revenue.\n\nEven were the assumption of successive floods true, it would still be an easy and worthwhile to go up the Carrot River for our hay\u2014provided the Dept. assisted us, e.g., by the grant of a hay-press and perhaps by undertaking the cost of our transportation. The Dept. has set the school forward.\nOn ambitious lines in the way of stock, and it is unfair to ask for the undoing of that work because there were floods in the first year. It is easy to descend, but difficult to ascend, in all endeavour, and to take away or discourage high hopes and enthusiasm is to take away the incentive to endeavour.\n\nOn these grounds, and because we are most concerned, I wish to register this protest to any radical reduction of our stock.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nLouis Laronde\nPrincipal\nMarch 9th, 1916.\n\nMost Rev.

The Department is not, therefore, disposed to intervene with his management in this respect.\n\nIn any event I would point out to your Lordship that it would hardly be possible to allow him to dispose of stock which was purchased by the Department and apply the proceeds to the reduction of the deficit incurred by the management of the school.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D., Bishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, March 11, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th ultimo I beg to say that the Department has decided that it would not be in the best interests of the Mackay Boarding School to carry out the suggestion of the Indian School Committee to reduce the live stock at the school. His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan has been so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. L. Laronde,\nPrincipal,\nThe Mackay Boarding School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Mackay Boarding School,\nThe Pas Man. Feb. 15th. 1916\n\nJ.J. Jackson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan has informed me that at a meeting of their Indian School Committee held Feb. 15th, it was decided that the Department should be asked to reduce the farm stock at this school to two teams of horses, 6 cows and 1 bull\u2014the balance to be sold for the benefit of the School to recoup in part the heavy expense of the season for hay because of last summer's floods and that the stock be limited to the above number.\n\nAs the one most concerned in the success or failure of this School, I wish to register my protest against the course advocated by the Committee.\n\nThe grounds on which they base this sudden reversal of policy are (1) the assumption that the floods on the Saskatchewan come in cycles\u2014that following last season's flood, there will be a succession of floods each summer for six more years; and (2) stock raising does not pay.\n\nIn asking that the above request be not allowed I do so on the following grounds. (1) the course advocated by the Committee is too precipitate. Let us put the question of the possibility of stock-raising to a thorough test. A year's test is not a fair criterion and a year's experience does not give a true indication of the resources and possibilities of a locality.\n\n(2) The assumption of the Committee is contradicted by the Indians and old-timer, who live on the River, who claim that there is a flood once in about every seven years, followed by successive good years.\n\n(3) It is a matter of common sense and a well-known fact that floods on the Saskatchewan are due not to excessive snowfall but to excessive rains in the Mountains in conjunction with cloud-bursts and these no one can predict with certainty and are not of yearly occurrence. Present indications do not point to a flood;\nThe River is low; the heavy snowfall of November and December has shrunk under the recent three days' thaw and last season's waters were drained away.\n\n4. The Fundamental reason which has influenced the Committee in their request is not the floods but undue conservatism and an adherence to a conservative ideal. Lac la Ronge B. School happens to be a pet of the Ven. Archdeacon Mackey and it is the Archdeacon who has inspired the course of the Committee. But that Lac la Ronge Boarding School has hitherto plodded along with 1 team, 1 cow & hand pump box-stoves etc., is no reason why the Mackey Boarding School should be degraded to follow the same narrow rut. The Mackey Boarding school was built on a different principle and was launched on a more ambitious scale and should be allowed the necessary liberty of action, time and patience to work out its destiny.\n\n5. It is easy to descend but difficult enough to ascend in the scale of endeavour. To deny a person the right to pursue the path of any high hope he may have formed, or to see the outcome of his enthusiasm, is to take from him all incentive to living endeavour. It is cruel if not utterly wrong to destroy or nullify the ideals and enthusiasms of the young, because, perchance, the old have seen their futility.\n\n6. I believe that one good year will enable us to put up more than two years' supply of hay from our own flats; that two good years would make our stock a source of revenue, and that once we can insure ourselves against a poor season, we could never again be compelled to pass through such a trying season as the last.\n\nTo make a success of our farm however, we need generous treatment from the Department, in the following form:\n\n1. The setting aside of a hay reserve for the school on the Carrot River beyond reach of floods. Steps are being taken with the Department to have this done.\n\n2. The grant of a hay press, so that in case of a flood we could press our hay and have it hauled by water to the school.\nWe could not afford to repeat this year's experiment of hauling about 80 tons of hay by the school teams, because of the labour and time involved.\n\nThe undertaking by the Department the cost of transportation by water involved in getting hay in seasons of flood.\n\nI have written to the Department on this subject but I wish to secure further your co-operation, as I know you are a firm believer in the possibilities of Fisher Island, and consequently would not passively allow this injustice to be done to the school on a matter which will mean success or failure for us.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nObediently yours,\n\nLouis Leronde (sgd)\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nI will find enclosed copy of letter which I received recently from the Rev. Louis Laroche, Principal of the Pas Indian Boarding School. As no doubt you are aware, there was an unprecedented flood on the Saskatchewan River, during the hay season of 1915, about the latter part of July, at the time of Treaty Payments. Just before I left the Pas, after finishing these payments, the water at that time was within two feet of the highest known point, for half a century and when I was up there on the first of September, a little over a month later, the water was still up about the same level.\n\nThe consequence of this flood was that all the hay grounds, which are adjacent to but not included in the area of Fisher Island, were flooded. As a result, Mr. Laroche had a very difficult time in getting hay to keep his cattle during the winter. The action of the Bishop of Saskatchewan, as shown by the resolution in the communication, which I am sending you a copy of, is no doubt founded on the fact that hay was so scarce during the last year. At the time I made the investigation in the site at Fisher Island, of the likelihood of its being flooded, at the time of abnormal water, the information I got at that time, and which is on file at your Department at Ottawa, was that there had only been two floods during the sixty years before the time of my investigation, and such being the case my opinion is that there will be no trouble at all in providing sufficient hay for a very large number of stock at the Fisher Indian Boarding School. I would not like to see the action, proposed by Bishop Newnham, agreed to by the Department as I feel certain, unless they are allowed to go into the raising of stock on a large scale.\nOFFICE OF THE\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES.\nLAKE MANITOBA INSPECTORATE.\nWinnipeg\n5 Chelsea Court\nMarch 6th, 1916\n\nSir,\n\nscale, they will never be able to run the school on the per capita grant.\n\nI would recommend that the present programme be adhered to for at least two years more, before any change of the kind, suggested by the Bishop, should be allowed. I have written the Principal that I expect to be up there in about ten days from now and will go fully into this matter with him, on my arrival.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nDuncan C.

No. 1.\n\nThe Advocate will be issued once every two months under the auspices of the Church of England Boarding School, The Pas, Man.\n\nAll communications and remittances in connection with our paper to be addressed, The Principal, The Mackay Boarding School, The Pas, Man.\n\nWith this issue we enter upon the second year of our little paper. While we have not yet realized our hope to make our paper a mouth-piece of the Indian missionary work of the Diocese, we have succeeded in keeping the School before its friends. We trust that our friends will continue their support and encouragement to The Advocate.\n\nIn the academic field the education of the Indian is carried on by four classes of schools\u2014the Day, the Improved Day, the Boarding, and the Industrial Schools. Beginning in this, and in subsequent issues, we hope to deal with each type of school, and endeavour to point out their respective merits and defects and relative importance and interdependence. The Day School, with which we deal in this issue, is, in point of numbers the most important, but in results the weakest in the chain; yet its persistence, in spite of general condemnation, consists in the fact that it is a pioneer in its field, a flame, however feeble, where otherwise would be scholastic darkness; matters would be infinitely worse without its existence, and it is capable of modification and improvement as to become potent for good in its field. The day will come when, as a Consolidated School, it will take its rightful place, in the vastness of its sphere of influence and capacity to keep in advance of the civilisation of its neighbourhood, to a position of the first importance, as the foundation and nourisher of all other types of schools. The attainment of this desirable end is now in its initial stage; its realisation is a matter of liberality on the part of the Canadian people.\nDOINGS OF THE SCHOOL.\n\nThe health of our pupils for the past four months has been excellent, and there have been but a few minor ailments incidental to the season.\n\nWith the break-up of the river the high water has cut us off from the mainland and there was no crossing except by boats for over two weeks.\n\nOur gasoline launch, the \"Big Eddy,\" has been thoroughly overhauled, cleaned and painted, and is ready again for service.\n\nThe pupils viewed with regret the sudden cessation to their hockey and skating, but, with the optimism of youth, they have turned to quoits, baseball, football, and other summer pastimes and games, and find them fully as delightful as the winter games. An innovation has been made for the girls in the introduction of baseball among their games, and judging from the comments overheard this game has come to stay.\n\nThe boys have no more occasion to covet the girls' swings, as they have had a double swing with horizontal bar put up for them; another is soon to go up, with a third swing and a trapeze. We have now a full equipment to occupy healthily the leisure hours of all our pupils.\n\nOur pupils have shown their eagerness to learn the English language by voluntarily asking that they be forbidden to talk Cree; we were prepared to make a rule to this effect sometime in the future, but we hardly expected to have our hands forced in this manner, and to have to jump in eighteen months from exclusive Cree to exclusive English. Although we know the hardship and lapses it will cause, the rule has been made, to apply at first only within the building. We notice that the children are more subdued than formerly about the building.\n\nThat the interest and love for the Cree hymn-book might not be destroyed by overuse the Sankey & Moody hymn-book has been introduced for use in the Sunday School. We now have the Cree hymn-book at the Sunday morning Service, Sankey & Moody in Sunday School, and the Hymn Book at the evening Service and daily prayers.\n\nWith the passing away of the snow our almost endless warfare against brush, stones and stumps has been renewed in earnest. The boys work in relays, half being at school while the other is in the field; while from four to five the girls add their willing hands to the work, and the boys in the field are reinforced by those just out from school. Though the work is still vast, we are able more and more to centralize our efforts on the important work of the farm.\nLOCALS.\n\nMr. Demerse, before leaving the School, presented the boys with a new football.\n\nInspector S. J. Jackson, made his annual visit of inspection of the School last month.\n\nMiss Henly, of Saskatoon, who comes to substitute for Miss Upsdell, is expected here on the 6th of May.\n\nThe School will be represented by Miss N. Moody at the coming Annual of the Diocesan Women's Auxiliary at Saskatoon.\n\nMr. M. Demerse, our Farm Instructor who left us at the end of March, has enlisted as a private in the B. D. Company of the 128th Battalion at Moose Jaw, Sask.\n\nMiss S. E. Martin, for four years matron of the Victoria Hospital in Winnipeg, has been appointed matron of the Indian Department hospital at this School.\n\nMiss Upsdell, before leaving for England on her leave of absence, will visit friends in Saskatoon, Coblenz, and at other points, leaving here in a week's time.\n\nMiss M. G. Willis, who has been with us for over a year as Senior Teacher, is severing her connection with the School in May, having accepted a school at Traynor, Sask. Our good wishes go with Miss Willis to her new field.\n\nW. A. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.\n\nSince our last acknowledgment, bales, containing outfits &c, have been received from the following Branches of the W.A., to whom our thanks are due:\u2014 St. Margaret's, Winnipeg, Man.; St. Andrew's, Sturgeon Creek, Man.; St. Luke's, Marquette, Man.; St. Alban's, St Margaret's G.A., St. Alban's G.A., Winnipeg; Clearwater, Man.; Binscarth Sen. and G.A., Man.; Hartney, G.A., Man.; Trinity Church, St. Stephen's, N.B.; St. John's, Port Hope, Ont.; St. George's, Guelph, Ont., (2 bales).\n\nTHE MISSION CALL.\n\nAmong the fields requiring ordained men in this Diocese are four in which the Indians form the major part of the population, namely, Onion Lake, north of Lloydminster, with a population of 140, of which 100 are Indians; Montreal Lake, north of Prince Albert, with 235 people, of whom 100 are Indians; Moose Lake, north of the Pas, with 100 Indians out of a total population of 163, and Grand Rapids, east of the Pas, with 150 Indians out of a population of 183. Ten other fields require ordained men, while there are further 10 districts requiring occupation and Church ministration.\nNOTES FROM OUR PUPILS.\n\nBoth boys and girls now play baseball, Mr. Laronde playing with both and coaching us.\u2014Absalom Cook.\n\nThree of the boys bought new scarlet sweaters and short black pants; we want to wear them when we play with the Indians from Big Eddy. There are not many big boys, as four left last year.\u2014Barnabas Marles.\n\nBecause red and black are our School colours, Mr. Turner painted the top of the boat with black and red lines, and the rest he painted white and wrote \"Big Eddy\" at the front.\u2014Robert John Head.\n\nLast Sunday morning the baby boy of Mr. Wm. Harris was brought to Baptism; Mr. and Mrs. Laronde were God-parents. The baby was called Norman Edgar, and he had nice white clothes with red ribbons; he was in a moss bag; Mrs. Laronde carried him.\u2014Eliza Paul.\n\nMr. Demerse, our former farmer, has gone to the war to fight against the Germans. Some of the boys from the Mackay School want to go too but are not allowed because they are not 18 yet, but they will join when they come of age. Two Indian young men came to Church here in their khaki uniforms and caused a flutter of excitement among the children.\u2014Philip Moore.\n\nThe Indians are away trapping and hunting.\u2014Alfred McGillivray\n\nI like to do silk work best of all fancy work.\u2014Louisa Paul.\n\nWe sometimes help Mr. Laronde in photography.

I cut the hair close, and when I have made the little boys bald Mr. Laronde pays me. The big boys pay me the same 10 cents, but I do not cut off quite all of theirs.\u2014Matthew McGillivray.\nMatthew McGillivray has been put in charge of the small boys' dormitory.\u2014Elias Settee.\n\nThree little boys have been moved up to the big boys' dormitory.\u2014William Greenleaf.\n\nThe girls clean up around the building for half an hour every morning.\u2014Isabel Bignell.\n\nWe have made bows and arrows for ourselves to play with.\u2014David Lathlin.\n\nI know one should not kill the little birds, but the little boys will shoot at them and kill them.\u2014Isaiah Whitehead.\n\nNearly every girl has a trunk, of all sizes; they use them for their dresses, ribbons and silk work; the little girls use theirs for their dollys.\u2014Elizabeth Lathlin.\n\nThere is a new nurse in the Hospital, her name is Miss Martin. There is only one Schoolboy there just now. The nurse is very kind.\u2014Florence Thomas.\n\nWe were pleased to see Inspector Jackson when he came to inspect our School a few weeks ago.\u2014Eliza Paul.\n\nOn Good Friday we improved our football grounds; four horses were hitched to the harrows, while the boys dug up stones and the girls raked and gathered up roots and sticks. At ten o'clock we stopped work and put on our Sunday clothing, and went to Church at eleven o'clock. After dinner we had football and all the boys played.\u2014Albert Flett.\n\nWe had holidays on Good Friday and Easter Monday.\u2014Horace Whitehead.\n\nMy work every day is to scrub the stairs and hall before I go to school.\u2014Nathan Young.\n\nWe are wearing our straw hats again and our summer dresses; we put away our winter clothing.\u2014Mary Jane Cook.\n\nMr. Denease has gone to his farm; he is going to be a soldier and will soon cross over to England to fight.\u2014Elijah Tobacco.\n\nWe are very fond of learning new songs, and Miss Upsdell has taught us many lately. We hope to have a little concert on Friday.\u2014Sarah Paul.\n\nWe helped Mr. Laronde to take off the storm windows; Isabel and I held the windows from the inside, and Mary Jane held the ladder.\u2014Sarah Buck.\n\nWe are very busy in the sewing room, making aprons and dresses, trimming hats and mending clothes. Miss Moody cuts out and I make up.\u2014Matilda Wilson.\n\nMiss Moody is going to the W.A. annual meeting, and will be away for a few days. I will steer the boat when she goes in, and there will be other passengers.\u2014James Partridge.\n\nLast Sunday the soldiers came to church at the English service. My cousin is learning to be a soldier. We are proud of the soldier boys that we know.\u2014Mary Ann Young.\nTHE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe day schools form over 75 per cent. of the total number of schools in Canada for the education of the Indians. There are supported by the Government, are Government inspected, but are under denominational control. The salary paid is $300 a year. A change for the better was made a few years ago in this respect, and a certificated teacher can now receive $500.\n\nThe Day School was the earliest experiment in the education of the Indian, and was the result of missionary enterprise. The first grant by Parliament was made in 1875, when $2000 was voted for day schools in Ontario. From that time this class of school has passed gradually into the hands of the Government. The typical day school of the old type was unpretentious: a simple one-roomed building was planted in as central a location as possible on a reserve, and gave tuition to the children who choose to come to the school for five or six hours per teaching day; while the teacher was empowered to help and encourage the pupils by the issue of two hard-tack biscuits to each. Owing, however, to the peculiar condition of most of the Indian reserves and the characteristics of the people, the insufficiency of the average day school became apparent at the outset. The following are the chief difficulties met with in connection with Indian day schools and which militate against their success:\n\n1. The nomadic habit of the Indian which takes him away from the reserve for long periods at a time in pursuit of his livelihood, prevents regularity of attendance. An absence from the school for two months on the part of a child nullifies that child's previous half-year's training.\n\n2. Too often there is apathy and a lack of desire for advancement in both parent and child, and the advantages of the school are neglected or used only spasmodically.\n\n3. The severe deterrent of poverty is often present. Many children have insufficient clothing during the winter, and the provision for a mid-day meal is in many cases neglected.\n\n4. When the child comes to an age between 12 and 14 years, the call of the wild overcomes his fondness for the school; or, he is then required to help at home. The school age of the average child is thus from 6 to 12, and the limit of education is the 2nd or 3rd Reader.\n\n5. The supply of fuel for the winter months is left to the management of Indians, and too often they have not sufficient interest in the school to induce them to fulfil this duty, and, in consequence, the school is frequently closed.\n6. It is exceedingly difficult to get efficient teachers. The insufficiency of the Government grant, the lack of proper accommodation, the enforced residence on the reserve, the isolation, often in the remote parts of the country, the discouragements due to the apathy of the people for any efforts made for their advancement, the lack of all incentives except, perhaps, that of doing good, and the absence (apart from the Church) of any hope of advancement\u2014these are enough to daunt and discourage all but the most devoted and self-sacrificing.\n\n7. The teaching and influence of even our best teachers is sadly hindered by bad surroundings. The old Persian belief in the struggle between light and darkness\u2014good and evil\u2014finds its sad counterpart, alas, too real, in the life of many an Indian child.\n\n8. Lastly, there is the drawback of ignorance of the English language, and the unsatisfactory nature of the text-books and course of study. The texts deal mostly with matters requiring previous knowledge of the world\u2014the manners, customs, and ways of thinking of a different race, if not of a different country; while the course of study is that of the Public School. And when we consider that most of the children are learning to read in an alien tongue, we must admit the amount of work required of them is very great.\n\nIt is only fair to remark that these facts become modified in proportion as the Indians become civilized. Under the most favourable circumstances the Indian day school approximates closely to the Public School, and in some cases becomes merged with it, and its evolution is then complete. These circumstances, however, are rare, and, on the whole, the day school of the past generation is a failure. This is acknowledged both by the Department of Indian Affairs and by the Churches:\n\n(a) \"The Indian day school of the lowest type is a burden to the teacher and an inexplicable punishment to the scholar, almost useless in its results.\"\u2014Superintendent of Indian Education, Blue Book, 1910, p. 274.\n\n(b) It has been the practice of the Romanists, whose wisdom and foresight no one doubts, to do away with day schools in the West, and establish boarding schools in their place. In this connection we may quote one of their Bishops, (Bishop Legal, in the Manitoba Free Press, May 13, 1908):\u2014\"As to trying again the system of day schools in place of the boarding schools, it is, to any one who is even slightly acquainted with the conditions of our Indian reserves, at least in the West, a perfect delusion and a farce. This system has been tried and found wanting.\"\nLESSONS IN CREE.\n\n\u0101 as a in hate; o as o in note;\na \"a\" fat; u \"u\" in but;\ne \"e\" me; oo \"oo\" soon;\ni \"i\" pin, ew \"ew\" few;\ni \"i\" thine; ow \"ow\" now.\n\nAlso aw with the a sounded as in far and the w as in now.\nC always as c in church.\n\nI.

I found that on account of the very high water in the Saskatchewan river it will be impossible to get any hay this season. No hay will be obtained during the present season anywhere within forty miles of The Pas. Mr. Taylor, The Indian Agent, was arranging to go out with the Councillors of the Pas Band to see if they could get hay somewhere in the Moose Lake district. If they find hay, they will put it up and then drive all their stock there after the ice forms and will winter their stock where they put up the hay.\n\nI am sending you attached a statement showing you what the school will likely have in the way of feed for their stock, the land cleared, and the number of horses and cattle they now have on hand. I am of the opinion that it will be advisable and necessary to come to the relief of this school by assisting them to buy hay for the coming winter. If this is not done authority will have to be given them to dispose of their stock. The deficit since starting the school is roughly $3000.00 and the church feel that they cannot increase this to the large extent necessary to feed the stock on hand during the winter.\n\nIt will take about 100 hundred tons of hay to feed their stock and in the Swan River or Melfort districts I can buy this hay baled for about $8.00 a ton delivered at the Pas. As you will notice by the Statement they now have cleared about 20 acres more land and if assistance was given this fall they could clear this land of stumps and stones.\nand have it ready for planting fodder corn next Spring.\n\nI would recommend that assistance be given as outlined and if thought advisable I will go up and see that matters are arranged as desired by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS. J. Jackson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 16, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant enclosing a statement showing what the MacKay Boarding School will likely have in the way of feed for their stock, the land cleared and the number of horses and cattle they now have on hand and stating that it will take about one hundred tons of hay to feed their stock.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may purchase one hundred tons of hay for this school at a cost not exceeding $8.00 a ton delivered at The Pas.\n\nIn regard to the deficit at this school it must be distinctly understood by the school and church authorities that the Department will not assume any responsibility for the deficit.\n\nIn regard to clearing the twenty acres of land of stumps and stones the Department would like to have a closer estimate of the cost of this work, as $400.00 is considered somewhat high. You might obtain an estimate of the probable cost per acre of clearing this land.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. J.

From advices I have received recently it may not be possible to get the hay for the price I first estimated, but will not buy any at a higher price without advising the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.D.

They have 21 head of cattle and 7 seven horses and he considers that six cows, four horses and one bull would be sufficient for their needs. At present the hay has to be purchased and, as the school has no funds for this purpose, they look to the Department to help them out. If the Department is not in a position to do this the Archdeacon's recommendation should be carried out.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This sum is sufficiently large as to be embarrassing and might cause inconvenience. We beg, therefore, to make application to the Dept. for relief, and in doing so we beg to submit the following considerations:\n\nI. We began operations in 1914 with a deficit of $200, incurred in our taking over the buildings from the Contractors and putting them in running order.\n\nII. For our first quarter, instead of receiving our full income of $2000, we received only $1369, due to a shortage in our numbers, which in turn was caused by the difficulties of travel at the season we opened the School.\n\nIII. In 1915, our first season, we suffered from floods and drought. To provide feed for our stock we had to go far afield for hay, incurring, over and above what we considered would have been the legitimate expenses had we cut from our flats, an extra expense of $1700. Our farm also, for drought, caused us loss.\n\nIV. In 1916, our second season, we suffered from even worse floods than in 1915, and also from rains in Spring and drought in Summer. The feeding of the stock in summer, fall and first part of the winter, was a continual expense, while our farm did not make a return of the outlay put upon it.\n\nV. In this season, when we saw that a bad flood was inevitable, help was procured, after our seeding was about done, to provide an emergency pasture of about five acres for our stock, entailing an expense in this work and in other things of a similar nature, to provide against the flood, of about $1000.\n\nVI. Because our gasoline had become unsafe, we found it neces-\nnecessary to procure a new hull in a knock-down state, at a cost, for the materials alone, of $200.\n\nVII. The freezing of water-pipes, sewer, septic-tank and septic-tank outlet, has made it necessary to open up these lines in the dead of winter, for which fires and their attendance were required day and night, and entailing an outlay of about $200 to date.\n\nSummarized, the above may be given roughly as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Amount |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Preliminary expenses                             | $200   |\n| Loss of Income during first Qr.                  | 621    |\n| Extra expenses for hay, 1915                      | 1700   |\n| Expenses due to floods, 1916, Pasture, Hay       | 1400   |\n| Purchase of a new hull for gasoline boat         | 200    |\n| Frozen sewer, water-pipes, etc., expenses         | 200    |\n| **Total**                                        | **$4321** |\n\nWe believe that the Dept. will recognize that our circumstances have been very difficult, and of such a nature as to make a deficit unavoidable. We beg therefore to make application to the Dept. for relief and aid in the form of a loan of about $3000, with as low an interest rate as possible, for a term of at least two years, the principal to be paid off in installments of about $200 per Quarter out of the Per Capita Grant to the School. These terms are only suggestions dictated by our needs; we believe that the Dept., if generous enough to give us the loan, will also be generous as to terms.\n\nWe believe, given a good year or two, that we can make good financially, and it is in this faith, and to ensure our making good, that we ask the assistance of the Department.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nLouis Laronde,\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFood 3.50\nClothing 2\nSocks 2.75\nFuel .75\nTotal 9.00\nOttawa, May 7, 1917.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of a letter received from Rev. L. Laronde, Principal of The Mackay Boarding School, together with a copy of the financial statement of this school for the year ending March 31st, last, which shows a deficit of $3673.52. Mr. Laronde has explained the cause of this deficit and has asked the Department to advance the school, by way of a loan, the sum of $3000.00 to meet this deficit.\n\nAs the funds at the disposal of the Department are very limited, owing to the war, I have to request that Your Lordship will be good enough to state whether your diocese would be able to assist the school and, if not, what Your Lordship would recommend should be done to meet this deficit.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th of March last, stating that the financial statement for The Mackay Boarding School for the year ending March 31st, last, shows a total deficit of $3673.51 and making application to the Department for relief and aid in the form of a loan of about $3000.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter is receiving consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Louis Laronde,\nPrincipal,\nThe Mackay Boarding School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nI duly received from you a copy of Rev. L. Laronde's letter & his financial statement. You ask me to state (1) whether His Diocese can assist the school, and (2) if not, what I recommend to be done.\n\nIt happened that my Committee on Indian Schools met on Wednesday, 16th, & I brought the whole matter before them. Their reply was unanimous & decided to quite agree with my firm opinion in the matter. I give you that reply somewhat briefly.\n\nI. We think that Rev. L. Laronde has made out a very strong case for expecting relief from the Indian Department. The deficit is caused partly by unfortunate weather conditions, flood, etc., for two years past, partly seemingly by imperfect workmanship or planning of the agents employed by the I.D. in building & equipping the premises. It is entirely connected with that part of the enterprise in which the I.D. has much more interest & concern than the Church has.\n\nII. The Diocese has absolutely no funds which it can apply to this object. You will note from the yearly financial statement of the School that the Church contributes in cash & clothing some $1800 yearly. It actually has given more\nmore, which does not appear. Thus we have worked without any charge an extra teacher etc., for months at a time, & we have paid the salary of such. You speak of the funds at the disposal of the S.D. as being very limited, owing to the War. Ours are much more so; in fact we are struggling to reduce our overdraft in the Bank by $20,000. Therefore the only possible thing seems to be, what I recommend, that the S.D. should meet this deficit, as Mr. Larmde suggests as a \"loan with small interest\" that is a poor way out & will cripple us for years; but as a definite grant to cover losses, or at least as an advance to be paid off gradually in a term of years. And I should ask Mr. for $3,000 but for the amount of deficit, viz. $3,673.\n\nI trust you will submit this letter & the matter to the responsible heads of the S.D. & that they will see the justice of my request.\n\nBelieve me\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. H. Saskatchewan\nBishop\nOttawa, June 9, 1917.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to Your Lordship's letter of the 15th ultimo in reference to the deficit at the MacKay Boarding School I beg to say that the Department regrets that, owing to the straightened condition of its finances, it will not be able to come to the relief of this school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, June 9, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 10th of March, last, in regard to the deficit at the MacKay Boarding School I beg to say that the Department regrets that, owing to the straightened condition of its finances, it will not be able to come to the relief of your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Louis Laronde,\nPrincipal,\nThe MacKay Boarding School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Rev. L. Laronde has enlisted in a Forestry Battalion now being raised for overseas service, and was in consequence given up the charge of the Indian Boarding School at this place. As the men joining this Battalion are mostly Indians, it is hoped that Rev. Laronde will be able to exercise a good influence over them. In the mean time I have taken charge of the school, until such time as we can find a suitable man for the post of Principal.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\nArchdeacon\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nThe Pas, Manitoba\nJune 2nd 1917\n\nReferring to your letter No. 375371-1, addressed to Rev. Louis Laronde in reply to his request for aid in view of the deficit of $3678.51 in the finances of the school, I would earnestly request the kind attention of the Department to this matter as it is a pressing need. As Rev. Laronde pointed out in his letter to the Department, the position has been one of exceptional difficulty, and now the unprecedented rise in the cost of nearly everything, especially flour, and most other articles of food, renders it impossible to struggle on without relief in some way. We are putting in all the potatoes and other garden stuff we can, and hope if we have a favourable reason to cut down living expenses before very long, but under any circumstances we are facing to have a hard time to make ends meet.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\nJ.A. Mackay\nArchdeacon\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, June 13, 1917.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant informing the Department that the Rev. L. Laronde, Principal of the MacKay Boarding School, has enlisted in a Forestry Battalion now being raised for overseas service, and that you have taken charge of the school until such time as you can find a suitable man for the post of principal.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department hopes that you will be successful in obtaining a suitable man as Principal of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nActing Principal,\nMacKay Boarding School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, June 13, 1917.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the deficit at the MacKay Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as the Rev. Mr. Laronde was informed, the Department is unable to grant this school any assistance, as, owing to the war, the funds at its disposal are limited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nActing Principal,\nMacKay Boarding School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nJuly 11th, 1917.\n\nMy dear Bishop Bownham -\n\nThere has just come to hand this morning Mr. Inspector Jackson's report on the MacKay Boarding School. The deficit reported to us by the Principal on March 31st, 1917, was $5,673.51; Mr. Jackson's report shows accounts owing by the school on June 26th amounting to $5,173.94.\n\nI am sending you herewith for Your Lordship's information a statement of these accounts. You will note particularly the large amount owing to A. Macdonald Co., of Winnipeg, wholesale grocers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Bownham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nThings are in rather disorganized state at the present time at this school neither of the class-room teachers being permanently employed. Miss Taylor is just on trial and Mr. Bird, who has been employed by the Church in other work is just teaching till Miss Upsdell comes back from England where she went on a visit and now finds it difficult to get back.\n\nThere is no farmer at the school this spring so all the work has been done by and under the supervision of the Acting Principal who is 61 years of age. He has done good work so far and the twenty acres in crop is looking well. Most of the potatoes were well up at the time of my visit. Seventy bushels of potatoes were planted this year and as the ground is in first class shape a good yield may be expected. The oats were well up and promised to give a good return. On my visit to the school in November last I told Mr. Laronde, the Principal, to put in about ten acres of fodder corn to use in case of a shortage of hay. This was not done, so the school is up against having to buy hay again or sell what cattle they have. The oat straw they will get from the ten acres of oats will just about feed their horses.\n\nReport dated, Jul 6th, 1917.\nMEMO., re MACKAY SCHOOL DEFICIT.\n\n(1) I have repeatedly advised the I.D. that this deficit was gathering largely to\n\n(1) the destruction of hay &c.by floods and\n(2) the unsuitable \"plant\" or construction for drainage,electric lighting,water system,&c.\n\nNo fault of ours. And I appeal for extra grant to meet these expenses.\n\n(2) Undoubtedly Mr.Laronde's want of judgment and incapacity as Manager may have contributed somewhat to the large deficit. But the architect,contractors,and those responsible for the location and character of the school are really more largely the cause.\n\nIf you will instruct Archdeacon MacKay to inform you very fully as to these faults and his proposals in remedy,I think it will be of great benefit.\n\n(3) At present Archdeacon Mackay is in charge,and economising in every way,while the Church is paying his salary,and Mr.Bird's and most of the Ladies',which cannot be continued for long.\n\nWe are rapidly paying the A.Macdonald Co.back debt.You will notice that Mr.LaRonde has left $1362.of his salary remain unpaid,and Archdeacon MacKay has personally paid $565,&c.\n\nThis is not fair to them.\n\nThe per.capita grant of $110 is perfectly absurd,and it is impossible to manage the school on that alone.\n\nAll the expenses of taking up,relaying,thawing out &c of lighting,water,and sanitation plant should be paid by I.D. as Extras. &c above under (2)\n\nConsult Archdeacon MacKay as to (1) permanent method for sanitation &c.and (2) amount of live stock to be economically maintained,and the rest to be disposed of.\n\nJ.A.S.\nExtract from letter from the Bishop of Saskatchewan in reply to letters from Dept. dated June 27th and July 11th, 1917.\n\nPrince Albert July 27, 1917.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\n......... 3rd. Inspect'r Jackson's report on McKay Board'g School and the lamentable deficit. We have the whole matter in hand. Archdeacon MacKay is at present managing the school. The Church is thus providing the salary of Principal and all the female staff, leaving the per cap.grant for pupils and back debts &c. This cannot continue long. The Church can not and will not permanently carry the burden of the I.D. But I write of this separately. I close this introductory letter with the kindest regard to yourself, and remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n(sgd) J.A. Saskatchewan.\nMemo. Re- MacKay Boarding School.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nBishop Newnham in his letter of the 27th of July states that the church cannot and will not permanently carry the burden of the Indian Department, and he encloses a memorandum explaining the cause of the deficit of this school which amounted to $173.94, which he claims is largely due to the destruction by floods and the unsuitability of construction for drainage, electric lighting, water connections, etc.\n\nThis school is built on Fisher Island in the Saskatchewan River, Le Pas Agency about six miles from the town of Le Pas. The site was selected by Mr. Jackson and Mr. Fisher, and was approved of by Bishop Newnham, and contains 549.7 acres, which was presented by the Chief and principal men of the Le Pas Band on the 19th of August 1912.\n\nThe contract for the school building and hospital was $76,578.00. In addition to the contract, the following amounts were expended; cellars $406.50, installing furnace and cistern $196, erection of outbuildings $6664, pump and tool house $460, acetylene tank room $443.25, fence and closet $575, extras: setting in sewer and pipe $1200, trenching for and connecting water and gas $1076.24, installing cistern, etc. $693.76, making well $251, metal ceiling, sewestrough and pipe $323, extra windows, doors, etc. $370 sundry extras $162.73,- Making a total amount\namount of $91,411.68.\n\nMr. Laronde, the late principal on the 10th of March 1917 gave the following summary of the expenses which the school had been put to under his management.\n\nPreliminary expenses - - - - - - - - - - $200\nLoss of Income during first Qr. - - - - - - 621\nExtra expenses for hay, 1915 - - - - - - 1700\nExpenses due to floods, 1916, Pasture, Hay, - 1400\nPurchase of a new hull for gasoline boat - - 200\nFrozen sewer, water-pipes, etc., expenses - - 200\n\nTotal - - - $1321\n\nThe Bishop admits that Mr. Laronde's want of judgement and incompetency of management may have contributed somewhat to the large deficit. When Mr. Laronde was recommended to the position of principal by Bishop Newnham in August 1914, the Department wrote the Bishop stating \"that, while he recommended Mr. Laronde's educational qualities, it was no assurance that he had the ability to conduct a school of this class. The Bishop was informed that the school would be conducted on the per capita grant system, and, while the allowance is considered enough under careful business management to meet all legitimate demands, there can be no margin left and it will require the closest economy and supervision to make ends meet. The school will have a deficit from the start, as funds will have to be advanced to enable it to be\nbe carried on from its inception which will have to be repaid out of the per capita earnings. The Department regrets that it cannot accede to your Lordship's wish to place this school in charge of Mr. Laronde, as it does not consider that he has had the necessary experience to enable him to successfully carry on an institution of this class.\" To this letter Bishop Newnham replied that he had already appointed Mr. Laronde, and on the 22nd of September the Bishop was again written and told\u2014\"that, in view of the fact that he had practically become responsible for the appointment of Mr. Laronde as principal of this school, the Department will consent that he be given a trial on the distinct understanding that, should his management not prove satisfactory, his services are to be dispensed with on three month's notice.\"\n\nBishop Newnham in his recent memorandum claims that the architect, contractor, and those responsible for the location and character of the school are to blame for its deficit, but on the 26th of March 1915 Bishop Newnham wrote the Department stating that he was exceedingly pleased with all he saw at the school, the buildings and equipment, also the accommodation. While the buildings were in the course of erection the Department engaged the services of a building inspector who was employed for 183 days at $6 a day. The location chosen is said to be the best in the locality and, as before stated, selected with the approval of the Bishop, and if any faults are now to be found with the drainage, lighting, water system etc., they are probably due to carelessness and incapacity of the management, however it might be well\nwell to carry out the Bishop's suggestion that Archdeacon MacKay be asked for his proposals to remedy it.\n\nThe trouble with this school is want of funds. The per capita grant of $110.00 is insufficient. Eighty pupils are provided for which will give them a gross income of $8500 a year. It will require at least $3500 to pay salaries which only leaves $5300. For the year ending December 31, 1916, food, and incidental expenses cost $7060.33, and clothing cost $585.34 a year, a total of $5945.67. No saving could be made in any of these items and it is quite evident that the school cannot be carried on for $110.\n\nNorway House and Cross Lake are in receipt of $135 per capita being classed in the Northern Division. As the church is not in a position to supplement the grant at present allowed the MacKay Boarding School, and if this school is to be continued the Department will have to place it on the same basis as the above mentioned schools, at least until the Island is brought under cultivation.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I find upon examining the records that this site was selected by Inspector Jackson and the then Agent, Mr. Fisher, and was approved by Your Lordship. It would appear that the site was the best available in the neighbourhood of The Pas. I note also that in March, 1915, you wrote, expressing your pleasure with all that you had seen after a visit to the school, including the accommodation as provided.\n\nI am prepared to admit that there may be faults in the drainage, lighting and water systems, but I am of opinion that the faults cannot altogether be attributed to the systems themselves, but are due to a great extent to incompetent management. As your Lordship is aware, we have had wide experience in the\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\npreparation of plans, etc., for these residential schools, and it would appear rather singular that our work in connection with The Pas School should be such a signal failure when compared with other similar institutions throughout the country, more especially at Norway House, where the building is an identically the same plan. The principal trouble of the water, light and drainage is in connection with the hospital. The Department at the present time has the matter under hand and a remedy is being sought. In all probability the water and drainage of the hospital will have to be separated from the school plant.\n\nYour Lordship will recollect that it was with a great deal of reluctance that we gave our consent to the appointment of Mr. Leronde, as Principal of this school, and it is not necessary to dwell further upon this phase of the management.\n\nI note your suggestion that Archdeacon MacKay should be asked for his proposals to remedy defects at the school, and I shall carry out these suggestions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am afraid I am going to inflict upon you a very long letter, or group of memoranda. But troubles have come very thick fast lately, so I desire your very careful consideration of my notes, and then your advice as to any best method of action. But first let me thank you for three late letters from you, June 27 & July 11 last.\n\n1st Notification of increase of per capita grant by ten dollars!\n\nI don't want to be ungrateful. Half a loaf is better than no bread. But really now! Every single person to whom I have told the news of the increase has made the same sort of criticism. \"When prices have gone up 50% a time almost 100%, what real aid is an advance of 10%?\" In other words, \"we could not run the schools free of debt on the $100 per cap. old prices: we certainly can not nearly do so on $110 per cap. new prices. Please understand [illegible] and not dreaming of blaming you\u2014 I'm sure you did your best. [illegible] understand the present poverty of the Govt. Treasury, and imagine that the result is \"the depleted funds at the disposal of the Department\". But, I don't think it is honest or fair of the Govt. to shift its covenanted responsibility towards the Indians, or to lay the burden on the Church, without the Govt distinctly saying \"We can not fulfill our obligations: we lay them down, and ask the Church to step into our place in the matter.\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

Macdonald is not strictly a \"returned Soldier\". He only got so far as Regina, & I understand was never of much use to the Military. b) That he has never been a success as a \"Teacher\" at Red Pheasant's, 1912, & at James Smith's Band, F. & la Come, though doing moderately well as a visiting preaching missionary. c) That I could not honestly approve of his appointment & have told him so, and d) That I had already offered the School to Rev. M.B. Edwards, a diligent & earnest missionary to the Cree, now at F.

You know the problem confronting us all the time as regards the future of our pupils. It seems vain to educate them well only to return to their poor homes on this Reserve where there are no openings for them. Stella Constant is a very promising girl, she is steady & good at work & has the makings of a good teacher. It seems important to widen the minds of our pupils when possible but there is no outlook here. Miss Kells, the head teacher is planning to go home to Toronto this summer for her holiday & is very willing to take Stella to her home & to give her all possible opportunities to see the wider side of life & the benefit of wider education, bringing her back for next term. This would be a great advantage, not only to Stella, but thro' her interest the others & perhaps help to inspire them with wider ambitions. Only last night, the Archd heard of 2 pupils from Lac la Ronge who had been taken to Alberta & had made good there. Last Sept I met another girl from there, who had come out for as she said if she stayed there, there was nothing before her but to marry a hunter, would be away half the year & she would have no opportunity of doing anything else. We are aiming at inducing the girls to train for some definite life work & each one so helped will be a help to others.\n\nHoping you will be able to grant this help\n\nbelieve me faithfully yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 1)\nMarch 25, 1919.\n\nDear Madam -\n\nI have your letter of the 19th inst., in reference to Stella Constant. I regret very much that the funds at our disposal will not permit any expenditure at present, such as proposed.\n\nWhile I appreciate the motive that caused you to make the request on behalf of this girl, I cannot agree to become responsible for the charges that would be involved in sending her on a visit to Toronto.\n\nThe demands on our vote for educational purposes are so heavy that we have the greatest difficulty in meeting them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMiss E.

Miss Bird was formerly Miss Eldredge and until her marriage and some time after was senior teacher in the school. She is fully qualified for the work.\n\nYours, Sir,\n\nJ. B. MacKay\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nAltaura.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that on the 8th of March I visited the McKay Boarding School. There were present 43 girls and 39 boys. Everything seem fairly satisfactory at the institution. The Principal was away at the time of my visit, his work was being carried on by Rev. Mr. Minchen. The school is very clean and tidy, the kitchen and dining room being especially clean.\n\nI do not think the people up at the school will have enough hay to carry their cattle through if the winter lasts much longer, however if they run short we probably can procure enough to last them through.\n\nAs the Principal was away at the time of my visit, there are no requests to make at present for this school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Secretary and Deputy,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI prefer to send these letters on various subjects for your use, though you may have to hand them on to others to deal with. They all concern the Pas School.\n\n1. Archdeacon MacKay is at last resigning the helm which he has so bravely managed for so long. After work needs him. With his approval or advice I nominate Rev. Mr. Minchin for the post of Principal of the MacKay School; I hope you will appoint him. He has done most of the work lately, & I believe has satisfied the Archdeacon, the staff, & your Agent at the Pas. He has had varied experience, some business experience, is good with young people, & a disciplinarian.\n\n2. Finance. While Archdeacon MacKay was here the Church paid his salary, as Archdeacon, & the J.D. was therefore saved the salary of a Principal, & in that way the Archdeacon was able slightly to reduce the school debt. But it is quite impossible to pay the Principal's salary out of the per cap. grant, & yet to go on reducing the debt. The J.D. is placing the School & the Principal in an impossible position. A man of Mr. Minchin's proven age, & position should not have less than $800 or $900. The Church is willing to pay part of this. It is neither willing nor able to pay the whole of it; let it be asked for & be asked to do so.\nThe per Cap. grant has only been increased 20 per cent whereas the cost of living has increased from 50 to 75 per cent since say 1914. I desire to press the desirability of either increasing the per cap. grant further or voting an annual sum towards his salary. The Church is now paying actually the salary of 4 out of the staff. But whether that be possible or not, I do most earnestly urge, I think I may justly demand (!) that the S.D. does the fair thing by the Principal, agrees him a fair start by paying the present deficit or debt of the school some $2,395.22. Archdeacon MacKay has reduced the debt to that amount; or rather, as I have pointed out this has been done partly by the Archdeacon's management, but still more by the Church paying his salary, & so saving enough from the per cap. grant to reduce the debt. This can not go on when Mr. MacKay's salary has been taken out of the per cap. grant. The debt I have always maintained, was almost unavoidable under conditions which were no fault of ours or of Mr. Larouche. (a) the failure of hay harvest two years running & the greatly increased cost of food for live stock. (b) the great expense during two winters of repairs of sewers & machinery owing to faulty construction, with which we had nothing to do, & which should be charged to Capital account paid by S.D. & not in any way to maintenance or current revenue. If this debt is not paid, the Principal enters on the work with a full-time round his neck, & the...\nIt is prevented from a fair chance of proving itself a success. I ask then that the S.D. should at once pay off this debt of $2,395.\n\n3. Hospital. I feel that it is a great pity that the S.D. closed their hospital. It was well worth its cost. It should be re-opened. We understand that it may need a good deal of overhauling, to make it weather-proof. Bad construction! But, any how, will the S.D. do for this Reserve what it has done for Lac la Ronge? Will it provide for the salary of a field matron, if I find a trained & certified nurse acceptable to you & to the Civil Service examiners? I have a splendid candidate; all-round experience & certificate. The school would accommodate her, & be thankful to have some one at hand to supervise the health of the children. There are now sick children in the school, & the doctor has given up his own bed-room to one who needs isolation because of tuberculosis trouble. What can you do about this?\n\nThen, what about the Pas. Miss Meakin has received a formal letter of appointment at $45 a month(!) & to report & get instructions! Not a word as to where, when, to report, no instructions, etc. To whom shall she report? Who will instruct her? Is $45 all the S.D. will give? She was getting $20 to $25 a week nursing. She can not go till end of May or early June now. Roads all gone; lakes not yet open. Who will pay expenses of travel? About $75 from Prince Albert to Lac la Ronge, & $15 or so from her home to P.A. Can you please answer pretty soon. I am for highland soon, & shall be very busy till then.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Minchin as Principal of the MacKay boarding school. I trust that he will be as successful as you anticipate.\n\nI regret, however, that the Department cannot assume responsibility for the payment of his salary; this is something that we have never undertaken in any of these institutions conducted under the auspices of the Churches, and no exception could be made in the case of the MacKay school.

In each case such appointments should be to the post of acting-principal. Such appointments do not require the approval of the Indian Department. At a later date, when the appointee has been tested and found satisfactory, he can then be recommended to the Indian Department for appointment as Principal.\"\n\nIn the notes which I have of matters discussed with the Superintendent of Indian Education in my office here on August 4, I find the change of Principals at the MacKay School mentioned, and when I informed him of the circumstances and the qualifications of Mr. Timney, our nominee for the Principalship, he gave it as his opinion that these would satisfy the requirements of your Department.\n\nThis fact, along with the opinion expressed by our General Secretary as set forth above, will help to explain to you, I trust, the reason why the changes under consideration were made and no direct communication, greatly to my regret, forwarded to you in connexion with the same.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary and Acting\nGeneral Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/FG\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI deeply regret to learn from your letter of September 30, addressed to the Rev. Canon Gould, a copy of which has just come into my possession, that you appear to have been uninformed of the change of \"Principal\" at the Mackay School, The Pas, Man.\n\nOn looking over my records I find that the Rev. A.E. Minchin, B.A., for some time Principal of this School, informed our Commission on June 30th, both by wire and letter, that he had been offered the \"Mastership\" of St. George's College, Prince Albert, by the Bishop of Saskatchewan, and desired to know if he could be released from the Principalship of the Mackay School on July 31st. A period of three months notice is generally required by our Commission before a contract of this sort can be terminated, but under the circumstances they decided to allow Mr. Minchin to leave on the date suggested.\n\nIn response to advertisements in the Manitoba Free Press and Winnipeg Tribune over twenty applications were received for the position, and that of Mr. W. Timney, a copy of which I enclose herewith, was accepted.\n\nOn July 19th I find that I informed our General Secretary of this action and recommended that he communicate the same to your Department. In his reply dated August 4 he wrote as follows:-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 2)\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, concerning the change in principals at the Mackay Indian Boarding School. I have noted that Mr. W. Tinney has been appointed Acting Principal. His qualifications are such that fit him for institutional work, and I hope he has a career of much usefulness in Indian education.\n\nI am pleased to have an official intimation of this appointment, and I will take it as a favour if you would inform us of all changes as they occur. Our approval of the definite appointment can be secured after a principal has shown his ability to manage an institution.\n\nMr. Ferrier, who was in your office in August, last, understood that the discussion of Mr. Minchin's resignation was quite unofficial and did not even make a note of Mr. Tinney's name.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDuncan C.

G.,\n41 The Bible House, Alexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\n2. 1863-135.\n\nTake back into school Philip Lathlin and Hardisty Flett with instructions to send them to some other school in case of future trouble. These boys are sixteen years old.\n\nAll the pupils are at present being kept at their homes on the Pas Reserve. I could handle them as was done previously, but it seems useless to beat them, and I do not think it possible to cure the wild ones, as the parents do not seem to bother about them or help us in the least.\n\nIn any case I would be obliged if the Department will wire me on receipt of this letter their views of what the punishment should be.\n\nThe Principal is so worried that he will agree to anything we do, I have his authority for above suggestions so it will make no trouble between the Department and Church officials.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report as follows regarding matters at Mackay Boarding School.\n\nSoon after the new Principal took charge some of the bog boys raided the store room and got some extract, and generally misbehaved during the absence of the Principal, who was in town. On his arrival back at school he investigated the trouble and decided to bring the boys in here, and the boys were suitably punished.\n\nMatters seemed settled after this, until last week when the same bunch of boys brought their skating boots, with skates attached, in to town here and sold them to a second hand store. The same day two of the boys arrived back at school drunk. We found that one of them had bought peppermint extract at a local drug store, and I placed the drug clerk in jail for a month after due trial. The Principal recovered the boots and skates from the second hand dealer.\n\nThe Principal is new to his work, but is doing his best to control matters. However, the whole institution will be disorganized if things keep on as at present. I have given the Principal my full support at all times.\n\nIt seems that something more than strapping the boys will have to done, but I wish authority before taking further steps. There are one or two means we have under discussion.\n\nFirst - Try the boys under Sec 139 Indian Act for being drunk. This puts the school in a bad light, and might seem to the parents too drastic, in case the boys were sent to jail.\n\nSecond - Take the boot thieves in front of a magistrate and have them sent to the reformatory. This is also too drastic in my opinion. We have to keep so many things in mind as to the effect on the parents as well as the children.\n\nThird - Discharge following pupils with dishonorable papers. McIvor Cook, Gilbert Paul, J.W. Harris. These will soon be 18 years old at any rate. Discharge with honorable discharge Nathan Flett, R.J. Head, they are nearly 18 and are in the gang but only as sympathisers and prompters.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 2)\nReference your letter November twenty-seventh the Department authorizes discharge of McIvor Cook, Gilbert Paul J. W. Harris Nathan Flett and R. J.

(RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 2)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that on the 9th inst I visited the Mackay Boarding School.\n\nMatters are not entirely settled up there yet, but the Principal has things well in hand. The girls have the running away idea now, two of the big ones went to Cumberland House last week without permission.\n\nI have the numbers about up to 80 again, and when the deserters get back the number will be about right, but I will try to get a few more in case of accidents.\n\nThe Principal talks of getting a man to look after the big boys after school hours, I would be obliged if the Department will take this matter up with the Mission Society who handle the school matters and see that the idea is carried out if possible.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Tinney, Acting Principal at the Mackay Indian Boarding School, has had some difficulty with the older boys at the school and that Mr. Indian Agent Waddy has assisted to the full extent of his powers in the effort to prevent truancy and to secure discipline. Our representative and the principal are of the opinion that it is extremely desirable to arrange for an addition to the staff - such officer to have, among other duties, the supervision of the boys. I shall be pleased if you will give this matter your early and thoughtful consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.

This Department approves of your action in assisting the principal with the return of truants. I have noted that the principal is desirous of securing the services, on his staff, of a man to act as boys' supervisor. I am pleased to inform you that a communication is being addressed to the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, drawing their attention to the extreme desirability of an immediate appointment in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of January 23, No.128-1-1, in which reference is made to truancy at the Mackay School at The Pan, and the desirability of the appointment of another agent to have supervision of the boys, I beg to state that I have fully discussed this matter with Mr. W. Tinney, the Acting Principal, who was brought to the city for this purpose, and have decided, after consultation with him, that it will be to the advantage of the staff and the school in general, if a male agent were appointed to take the place of one of the lady workers who has recently resigned.\n\nAs applications from men who appear to me to be competent to fill the position of boys supervisor are already available in this office, it is probable that an appointment will be made before the end of this month, and that the appointee be able to give to Mr. Tinney the assistance he requires in this respect, and which apparently lady agents are unable to render.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary & Acting General Secretary M.S.C.C.\nOTTAWA, February 13th, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of the 9th instant, in which you state that the appointment of a man to fill the position of boys' supervisor will probably be made before the end of this month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 6th instant, I beg to say we have noted with satisfaction that you have obtained the services of a man to fill the position of boys' supervisor at the McKay Indian Boarding School, and that Mr. Dixon has proceeded to the school to take up duties.\n\nWe hope that, as a result of Mr. Dixon's supervision and assistance in the work among the boys, there will be a decided improvement as regards discipline and the frequent cases of truancy.\n\nI shall be pleased to have further information as to the qualifications which Mr. Dixon possesses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAast. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary & Acting General Secretary,\nMissionary Society of the Church in Canada,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that I visited the Mackay Boarding School on the 13th inst., the medical officer came with me.\n\nThe health of the pupils was very good, an epidemic of influenza of mild type had gone through the school lately, but all the pupils were about over it at time of my visit. Some minor ailments were treated.\n\nThe building was very clean and the rooms all kept in tidy condition. The cupboards supplied were all in position, but the bed springs had not been changed yet, the new ones will be put in place shortly.\n\nThere were 82 pupils on the roll at time of my visit, but the March return will only show 80, as two entered after April 1st.\n\nThe Principal asks if the Department will request the Provincial School Authorities in Winnipeg to arrange to have the Inspector visit the Mackay School this spring. Last year the Indian Department informed me that arrangements had been made for this work, but up to date no Manitoba Inspector has visited any school in the district.\n\nThe principal also asks if the old hospital building near the school can be given to the school. I have made numerous reports on the condition of this building, it is going to pieces. Mr. Tinney wants to use the lumber in the building to make a new shed and a stable, and to use the cellar as a root cellar. The only salvage we could use would be the windows, doors, furnaces and furniture, and this could be shipped wherever desired. I do not know whether we will ever use the building as a hospital again or not, the expense of putting it in shape would be heavy.\n\nMatters at this school seem to be settled down, the staff get along better than they did last autumn. The Principal has not got the business head of the former principals and will have trouble with his own superior officers in time, as he is inclined to value the dollar too lightly.\n\nI am, Sir,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary, Your obedient servant,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nIndian Agent\n\nOttawa.\nThe school has the show place in Northern Manitoba as far as garden produce is concerned. This year in addition to the regular garden they have about 1\u00bd acres of experimental farm work put in.\n\nPremier John Bracken visited the school last fall and asked the Principal if he would care to have a free issue of various seeds, if so he would have them supplied. The Principal agreed to put in a plot if a regular plan was supplied, and the plot is now planted with the following varieties:\n\nTimothy, Fescue, Western Rye, Bromc, Alfalfa, Alsike, Red Clover, Sweet Clover, Ruby Wheat, Marquis Wheat, Banner Oats, Golden Rain Oats, Can. Thorpe Barley, O.A.C. Barley, Premost Flax, Spring Rye, Sunflowers, Corn, Sudan Grass, Millet, Turnips, Mangles, & Potatoes. The boys in the school are more interested in this experiment than anything else, they have the plot as smooth as tennis lawn. I will have a copy of the result supplied to the Department.\n\nIn addition to the above there is in crop, practically all sown, 5 acres potatoes, \u00bd acre onions, \u00bc acre carrots, 1 acre swede turnips, \u00bc acre sugar beets, \u00bc acre rape kale, 2 acres fodder corn, \u00bd acre general garden produce.\n\nThere is a fairly large field of alfalfa which will give two crops this year.\n\nWe have organized a football league here with two white teams, a Pas Band team, and the school team. This helps to get the boys acquainted with the white men, and to mix with them on some terms of equality. The local saw mill always supplies a job to any of the members of the football team, which also helps out.\n\nThe two Indian teams played yesterday at the school, but the boys got beaten. Most of the reserve team are ex-pupils of boarding schools.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that I visited the Mackay Boarding School yesterday.\n\nThe staff seems to have settled their disputes and matters are going on very quietly there now. The building as usual was kept in a very neat and tidy condition, and sanitary arrangements are all that could be desired. There is little sickness in the institution, just two cases that require medical attention, the doctor will visit the school to-morrow I expect.\n\nThe Principal drew my attention to the following repairs and replacements which are required.\n\nThe school has not been painted on the outside since it was built. A good job was made by the original contractor, but now the building needs paint to preserve the wood work. I think this should be allowed, the Department probably has had similar buildings painted and can figure the cost. If not I could have a figure submitted if the Department requires same.\n\nThe screening requires replacement in many places, 200 lin feet of 36 inch wire would cost about $40.00, I would beg to recommend that it be supplied.\n\nThe air compressor on the water system should be renewed, the cost is about $50.00. A trip by the plumber costs us $15.00 and we will save this work by supplying a new compressor.\n\nThe Principal asks if we will supply a barrel of lime for the outside closets, the cost is $5.50. This is a new item, but it seems reasonable.\n\nThe gasoline engine for pumping water is continually out of order. A new 6 h.p. field engine will be required, the cost is $250.00. This is another place where the plumber gets a revenue, and there seems little use in trying to carry on with the old machine, it is continually giving out.\n\nMr. Tinney also asks if the Department will allow a grant for further clearing of the land on the island, he has to enlarge his fields to get fodder for the cattle, and asks for a grant of $100.00 which would be paid out to Indians for work as done some years ago.\n\nHe also asks if the electric light plant was passed in the estimates, this has been promised before.\n\nI am not aware of the amount of funds on hand for this institution, but practically all the above requirements are urgent.\n\nI give on the next page an outline of the agricultural activities at this place.\n\nover...\nOttawa, June 1st, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, containing a report on your visit to the Mackey Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say we are pleased to note that the work in general at this school is progressing satisfactorily. We are also pleased to note the agricultural activities that have taken place, and the quantities of the different varieties of seeds that have been sown.\n\nRegarding the request of the Principal for the repairs and replacements mentioned by you, I beg to say with reference to the painting of the outside of the school building that it will not be possible to provide the funds required for the purpose during this fiscal year. The painting will, therefore, have to stand over until next year, and at that time you should make a request to have this work done. When forwarding the same, you should state approximately the cost of the paint and other material required, and also the cost of the labour in having the work done.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following: 200 feet of 36\" wire for screens, an air compressor for the water system, and a barrel of lime for the outside closets. It will be necessary to obtain competitive prices for the above material, which should be purchased from the firms quoting you the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded together with a memorandum showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nRegarding the supplying of a gasoline engine for pumping water, and a grant for the purpose of paying for the labour in clearing a further quantity of land, also regarding the installation of an electric lighting system, I beg to say that these matters will receive consideration, and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to state that I understand that the Principal of the Mackay Boarding is being sent to the University by the Church authorities and that they propose placing Rev E.V. Bird in the school as Principal.\n\nMr. Bird was employed at the school when I came to this district, and I would consider him suitable for the position. He may not have the education of some others, but I think he can handle the pupils. He is also favored by having a first class wife, Mrs Bird can handle the school herself if anything happens.\n\nI have just got home from the northern annuity trip and have a lot of business piled up here relating to school matters, I will try to get them straightened out at once.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, August 9, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 2209-135 of the 2nd instant, in which you report that the principal of the MacKay Indian Boarding School is going to university and that an acting principal will be nominated by the Church Authorities. I have noted, with satisfaction, your opinion that the Rev. E. V. Bird, who will be nominated, is suitable for the position.\n\nWhen the Department hears from the M. S. C. C., you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

E.V. Bird, formerly a member of the staff at the Mackay School, The Pas, Manitoba, but subsequently a teacher for some time on the Red Pheasant Reserve in Saskatchewan, should be nominated to your Department for appointment to the Principalship of this Institution. As Mr. Timney, the Acting Principal, after a year of very successful work, has been given a scholarship which will enable him to complete his course in Arts and Divinity at Manitoba University and St. John's College, Winnipeg, and will leave the School early in September, Mr. Bird will enter on his duties as Acting Principal from that date. Mr. Bird is at present in Deacon's Orders but it is hoped that he may be advanced to the Priesthood after a year or so of further study and probation. He comes to this work very finely recommended by those who know him best and I trust that his appointment may meet with your approval.\n\nYou will, no doubt, have an official communication from the Rev. Canon Gould, our General Secretary, when the Executive Committee have taken action in this matter but I thought it would be better to let you have this preliminary notice, as our recommendation cannot reach Toronto in time for the next meeting of the Executive Committee and consequently this information might be considerably delayed in reaching you.\n\nBelieve me\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nField Secretary M.S.C.O.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that I consider that the Principal of the Mackay School is too severe in punishing the children at that place.\n\nI have drawn his attention to that fact previously, but his idea of correct punishment is different to mine and he does not seem to get any better. The Indians have also had arguments with him on this question.\n\nLast Friday one of the pupils named Arthur Dorion, aged 15, was brought in to the office by his parents to show how he had been treated. He was black from his neck to his buttocks where he had been strapped; altogether too much abuse in these times, though I have had plenty worse myself in a different country than Canada. It appears that the boy could not work as he had blistered hands from handling a hay fork or some other tool, and he got trimmed for this. He fought back I understand when he was getting strapped, and made the Principal lose his temper.\n\nI called in Bishop Lloyd and Rev. Mr. Fraser to show them what was going on at the school as the Principal has always denied abusing the children. Nurse Lucas is at the school at present and I asked her to watch out and advise how the other children are treated.\n\nThe school is going on fairly well in other ways and I would be obliged if you could take up with proper authorities the matter of whipping the children, I can do nothing at this end.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Our representative's letter reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Last Friday one of the pupils, named Arthur Dorion, aged 15, was brought in to the office by his parents to show how he had been treated. He was black from his neck to his buttocks where he had been strapped, altogether too much abuse in these times, though I have had plenty worse myself in a different country than Canada.

Indian parents also have protested in this connection.\n\nMr. Indian Commissioner Graham recommends that the principal be summarily discharged and I am forced to agree that a man who apparently loses his temper is not a proper person to guide the lives of children.\n\nPlease give this question your earliest consideration and inform me concerning what action you propose to take.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

It is, therefore, impossible to take immediate action but the matter will come before the Commission as soon as it is possible to hold a representative meeting.

The Department have all the information that is necessary to deal with the subject, but in the face of this I am told that you are corresponding with the Church authorities. The chances are it will end like all the other cases. I think the Department ought to look at it from their own officers' side of the question. No officer likes to write a report and feel that nothing will result from it, and you can understand why they hesitate to report on inefficient members of staff, under the circumstances.\n\nThe Inspectors feel that where the churches are concerned there is practically no use in sending an adverse report, as the Department will listen to excuses from incompetent Principals of the schools more readily than to a report from our Inspectors based on facts as they find them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nTo the Members of the Commission\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI beg to submit the following explanation in regard to Arthur Dorian.\n\nOn August the 28th the above boy was reprimanded by Mr. Grant, the Farm Instructor, for sending another boy out to the barn to milk his cow, and not turning out himself. He said his hands were blistered. This, however, was not the case as he has a habit of getting another boy to do his duties whenever he can. The Farm Instructor informed him that he would not be allowed to play football at night as a punishment. The boy laughed and said something to the other boys in Cree and Mr. Grant then told him he would have to miss football for one week.\n\nMr. Grant reported this to me, and as I was getting some Gasoline in preparation for going to town, the boy came in the Engine house, apparently in a bad temper. I turned to the boy in the presence of another boy, and said to him \"You must not be rude to the staff or take things into your own hands. If you do not feel fit to do your duties report to Mr. Grant!\" He took no notice, so I said \"Arthur, did you hear me speak to you?\" He turned around and shouted back to me \"Yes, I hear!\" I walked over to him and placing my hand on his shoulder remarked \"Arthur, my boy, I do not allow any boy to speak to me like that.\" He threw my hand aside and caught hold of me, apparently with the intention to fight. After a struggle I got his arm behind his back and told him that he would have to come to the office to be punished. When we arrived in the office I gave him a few strokes with the strap on the hand. He put his hands up and in order to avoid a repetition of his closing in again struck with the strap at his arm. He received four or five strokes on his back and shoulders ere he put his hands down.\n\nI can well understand that it possibly left a mark as he would only have his summer clothes on covered with his jacket.\n\nI then told him that though boys in the past had wrestled with former Principals that I would not do so. Then I sent him out to his duties. On arriving home from town I heard that he had gone home. He was brought back next day.\n\nHis father who was away at the time, on arriving in The Pas, came up to see me, and brought an ex-pupil to interpret. On hearing my version of the affair, he stated \"that he was\nastounded that his boy would dare to attempt to fight either with the Principal or any other member of the staff, and that he felt the boy deserved all he got.\n\nI might state that in answer to Mr. Waddy's remark, when he speaks of \"too much abuse\" that there have only been three cases of punishment since March, and these were minor cases.\n\nI might also point out that there are only two alternatives for a Principal when a big boy attempts to fight him, that is to fight or wrestle, or beat his arms down. It has happened here, though not in my time, that a Principal has closed with a big boy and the boy has put him on the floor. Also one male member of the staff, who has left the school, was pushed or knocked in a corner, and another member had to stop the boy, and I think that this boy was trying the same thing out to see if it would work.\n\nI had received many complaints from the lady members of the staff that they would have to send Arthur Dorian in to me as he was getting very troublesome, and some of them had said that it would be better if I punished a little more. This is not my policy. If it is possible I always try to win a boy over.\n\nTrusting that this explanation is quite satisfactory.\n\nI am\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.) Rev. E.V. Bird\nPrincipal\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe the punishment of Arthur Dorion at the Mackay School\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 16 (No.128-1-1) relative to the punishment of the pupil, Arthur Dorion at the Mackay School, The Pas, Manitoba, I regret to state that owing to a month's absence in Eastern Canada in attendance at the Board and other important meetings of our Society, I have been unable to give to this important matter the prompt consideration which it deserves. I learned, however, on returning to my office, just a few days ago, that the Office Secretary had acknowledged the receipt of your letter, and forwarded an extract from the same to Mr. Bird, the Principal of the Mackay School, with a request that he should furnish our Commission with an explanation. This explanation has now come to hand and I enclose herewith a copy for your information.\n\nAs it is my intention to visit the Mackay School early in November when I shall have an opportunity of going more fully into the whole matter, I will reserve any further comment, which I may find it necessary to make, until after that date.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.G.\n\nTBRW/IMC\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nTORONTO, ONT., Oct. 18th 1924\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReferring to the letter dated Sept. 16th, to Dr. Westgate, of the Acting Deputy Superintendent General, and to subsequent correspondence \"re the punishment of Arthur Dorion at the Mackay School,\" I beg to say that, at the recent meeting of our General Synod, I interviewed the Rev. A. Fraser, of the Pas, whom Mr. Waddy states \"he called in to show what was going on at the school.\" Mr. Fraser stated that he found only two red marks on the shoulder of the boy and that, in his opinion, the punishment given was not excessive if the Principal, under the circumstances, was to maintain his position and the discipline of the School.\n\nMr. Fraser is one of our most experienced Indian missionaries. In view, therefore, of his statement and expression of opinion, as given above, I did not consider it necessary to question Bishop Lloyd on the subject. In view, also, of the same statement and opinion I find it difficult to appreciate Mr. Waddy's statement as contained in the Acting Deputy Superintendent General's letter of the date given as follows: \"He was black from his neck to his buttocks where he had been strapped, altogether too much abuse in these times.\" It was on this exaggerated statement of Mr. Waddy's that Mr. Commissioner Graham's recommendation \"that the Principal be summarily discharged\" was apparently based. Mr. Fraser speaks highly of the work done by Mr. Bird, as Principal of the Mackay School.\n\nI shall be glad to discuss this matter further, if necessary, in the course of our forthcoming interview.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nOttawa, October 29, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy:\n\nMy attention has been drawn to correspondence relative to the punishment meted out to Arthur Derion, of the Mackay Indian Residential School. The facts submitted to the Department are conflicting in some respects.\n\nIn your No. 2876-135 of the first ultimo to Mr. Commissioner Graham you state that the boy was black from his neck to his buttocks where he had been strapped and that you called in Bishop Lloyd and the Rev. Mr. Fraser to show them what was going on at the school. Please let me know if His Lordship and Mr. Fraser saw the boy's condition the same day that you examined him and let me have a general report in connection with this case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge letter 128-1-1 of the 29th ultimo, regarding report I made in letter 2878-135 to Mr. Commissioner Graham regards punishment of Arthur Dorion of the Mackay Boarding School.\n\nThere is little I can add to what I stated in my report, I saw the boy before he was shown to the two gentlemen mentioned in my letter and I was present when the boy was shown to them. The facts as I stated them are right, however, different people have opinions as to what is hard punishment that vary a lot and perhaps my witnesses think I overstated the matter. I would make the same report today on the same sort of case.\n\nIn any case matters have entirely changed at the school since they found out I did make a report, I hope they stay that way.\n\nI have had so much trouble to get things running right at the school without reporting matters that the Department may think this is a lone case. However, I thrashed this matter out with Mr. Bird before and thought I had it settled. I told him he had to be severe, but in any case when he punished a pupil he should take steps to keep the pupil in the school after punishment of any sort, as when a child gets away even after minor punishment the whole reserve gets up in arms and the school suffers in shortage of per capita grant for lack of pupils.\n\nMr. Bird is all right in other respects but when he gets at an unruly pupil he seems to lose control of himself, and if my report does nothing else than make him careful in the control of his temper it will be enough.\n\nIn my opinion no Indian child should be abused in the schools, they are not like white boys and girls and their parents look on matters differently also.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary  \nThe Department of Indian Affairs,  \nOttawa, Ontario  \n\nDear Sir:  \n\nRe the punishment of Arthur Dorion at the Mackay School.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of September 16, (128-1-1) and my letter of October 15, relative to the punishment of the pupil Arthur Dorion at the Mackay School, I beg to state that I have just returned to this city, after an absence of over three weeks, on a tour of inspection to some of our Society's Schools in the Prairie Provinces, during which I visited the Mackay School at The Pas in Manitoba and reviewed with your representative, Mr. Indian Agent Waddy, and the Rev. E.V. Bird, the Acting-Principal, all the circumstances connected with the punishment of the pupil in question.\n\nDuring my interview with Mr. Waddy which lasted about one hour, he gave it as his opinion that while corporal punishment was frequently a necessity in maintaining discipline and checking misdemeanours and had been resorted to by him as Indian Agent on various occasions for both purposes, he considered that the punishment administered to Arthur Dorion was too severe. As the statement contained in Mr. Waddy's report to you dated September 16 that the pupil \"was black from his neck to his buttocks where he had been strapped\" was not corroborated either by the Rev. Mr. Fraser, the Missionary living at The Pas as superintendent of the Indian missionary work of our Church in that part of Saskatchewan, and who saw the boy's back shortly after the punishment was administered, or by Bishop Lloyd, the Bishop of Saskatchewan, who saw the boy's back at the same time as Mr. Fraser, I was, and still remain, somewhat puzzled to know why so strong and damaging an assertion was made. Mr. Fraser, when interviewed, first in Toronto and subsequently at The Pas, emphatically declared that the statement was not only an exaggeration but quite at variance with the facts of the case, while...\nBishop Lloyd when I conferred with him on this matter in Prince Albert, also informed me that although traces of the punishment were visible, there was a lack of evidence to justify the descriptive terms used by the Indian Agent in his report.\n\nDuring the time I was at the School itself, namely from Saturday November 1 until November 3, I requested the Acting Principal to recapitulate the whole of the circumstances related to this matter, and as these did not vary from those set forth in his report of September 26, a copy of which has already been forwarded to you, I do not consider it necessary to repeat them here.\n\nAt the time of my visit the pupil in question was in residence at the School, and I learned that his conduct, which, prior to his punishment, had been one of defiance to various members of the staff, had undergone a very decided change for the better. This circumstance alone seemed to me to go quite a long way towards justifying the Acting Principal in the action he had taken. In addition to this, however, the Acting Principal informed me that the pupil's father when he had heard all about his son's misbehaviour, and which apparently he had not done when he took him to the Indian Agent, not only exonerated the Acting Principal from any act of unfairness or injustice, but thanked him for the strict discipline which was being maintained, and which he knew was necessary if the work of the School was to be a success.\n\nI conclude, therefore, in the light of the information presented to me, and none of which I have reason to doubt, that,\n\n(a) The punishment was deserved\n(b) It was not unnecessarily severe\n(c) It was not administered in anger or in a state of temper and that\n(d) It has thus far been productive of good results.\n\nWhy your representative should in this particular instance have written in such strong language I may never be able to understand. I myself, personally, have always found him both courteous and obliging, but I have been forced to the conclusion that if he had carefully and thoroughly investigated all the circumstances connected with the punishment of the pupil in question before forwarding his report he would have given expression to his opinion in somewhat more moderate terms.\n\nYou will know, I think, that our Society is extremely desirous of cooperating with your Department to the fullest extent possible, in all matters pertaining to the education of the Indian peoples of this land. In doing this we are prepared to welcome suggestions, to accept and act on criticism of any mistakes which may inadvertently have been made, to carry out, so far as our ability to do so will enable us, all legitimate rulings and instructions, and to do our utmost in every way to make this great and important work an unquestionable success. Experience, however, is teaching me more and more, as the days go by, that unless many of your representatives in\nIn charge of the Indian Agencies are prepared to meet in a friendly way the Principals or Acting Principals of the Indian Residential Schools administered by our Society and talk over together with them matters similar to the one which forms the subject of this letter before submitting to you an adverse report, there can be but small hope of our ever realizing the consummation of our wish in this respect.\n\nAny steps, therefore, which you may be able to take, and which will tend to secure the friendly counsel and closer cooperation in the way suggested will be greatly appreciated by us.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/IMC\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to state that I visited the Mackay Boarding School on the 4th inst.\n\nI went through the whole building and beg to say that everything was in first class clean condition, with a good supply of clothes for all the children in stock. The sewage system which was put in shape this fall was operating without giving any trouble. I had to get the seats put on the closets supplied, the old hinges did not fit so I had new ones put in. The cost was not very heavy and the work was necessary.\n\nThe children seem to be in first class health just now, we have been taking away those showing signs of T.B.\n\nThe electric light system gives trouble and I am having the Principal make out a statement of the difficulties he encounters which I will submit to the Department, I think it may be possible to get advice which will overcome the trouble, if not we will at least find out what is to be done. At present the Principal is afraid the machine will give out and leave the place in darkness, he has not auxiliary lighting system.\n\nI informed the Principal where he could get some new pupils to fill up the school; if the parents do not send them after he sees them I will recruit them myself. I would sooner the Principal tried it first as it gives him an idea of the home life of the people.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 8, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your No. 3005-135 of November 4th, with reference to the discipline at the Mackay Indian Residential School. I have also read your 3079-135 of the 6th instant, being a general report on the institution. The church officials, acting upon the request of the Department, looked into the matter of the punishment that was given to Arthur Dorion some weeks ago. The General Secretary of the M. S. C. C. saw the Rev. Mr. Fraser, of The Pas, in Toronto and secured his opinion. Further, the Field Secretary of the M. S. C. C. visited Mackay School and looked into the circumstances connected with the pupil in question.\n\nI am convinced that the Rev. Principal will exercise care in maintaining discipline in the future and I wish to thank you for your report, which brought the matter to the Department's attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, January 9, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of November 28th, last, with reference to the punishment of Arthur Dorion at the Mackay Indian Residential School. I have to thank you for investigating this case and I believe that the principal will in future give careful consideration to the methods employed in the maintenance of discipline at the school. With reference to the last paragraphs of your letter, I wish to assure you that the Department impresses on its agents and representatives from time to time the necessity for close and friendly cooperation with the principals of the Indian residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir;-\n\nI have the honor to report that I visited the Mackay Boarding School on the 13th inst.\n\nThere were 82 children on the register, and 79 were present in following Standards.\n\n| #   | Boys | Girls |\n|-----|------|-------|\n| #1  | 17   | 17    |\n| #2  | 8    | 8     |\n| #3  | 6    | 1     |\n| #4  | 5    | 8     |\n| #5  | 2    | 2     |\n| #6  | 1    | 4     |\n\nTotal 39 40\n\nThe pupils appear to be well fed, the dinner consisted of stew, bread, potatoes, lard, pudding.\n\nThere has been quite a lot of sickness at the school which gave considerable extra work to the staff, in the last six weeks an epidemic of influenza and one of German measles swept through the school.\n\nThe pupils are doing well in the class rooms, the teachers are very good, but are not qualified as well as could be desired in an institution of this class. I think when so many teachers are available that fully qualified ones could be supplied. However, the present ones might be allowed to remain until the summer holidays as they are first class smart girls, one of them has a temporary certificate to teach in Manitoba.\n\nThe state of the building is first class, and matters are running very smooth at present.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 21, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 4186-135 of the 16th instant, reporting generally on the Mackay Indian Residential School. I note your recommendation that arrangements be made to have fully qualified teachers in the classrooms at the beginning of the next academic year. I am today corresponding with the church authorities, with a view to taking action in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, March 21, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a general report from Mr. Indian Agent Waddy on the Mackay Indian Residential School. Our representative is favourably impressed with the general tone in the institution and with the training and care of the Indian children. He recommends that the Department concurs that professionally qualified teachers should be appointed for the two classrooms for the coming academic year. I should be pleased if you would give serious consideration to this question and inform the Department what steps you take.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWith further reference to your letter of March 21st, (no.128-1-1) relative to the appointment of professionally qualified teachers at the Mackay School, The Pas, Manitoba, I beg to state the teacher in charge of the senior class-room is not without Normal Training having taken a short course as prescribed by the Department of Education of the Province of Manitoba and may therefore be reckoned in the professional class. Her sister who is in charge of the junior room has not been through Normal but has an educational standing equal to a third class certificate in this Province.\n\nIt is the rule of our Society to appoint none but fully qualified teachers. An exception, however, had to be made in this instance in the case of the junior teacher owing to the sudden breakdown in health of one of the teachers at this school before the close of last year, and the unexpected and enforced retirement of the other at very short notice. Sooner than leave the class-rooms without teachers, these two ladies were sent at once from Winnipeg being transferred from the Peigan School while on short leave of absence in Winnipeg during the Christmas holiday season. They are not inexperienced and I am somewhat surprised at the recommendation made by your Agent. I referred your letter to the principal and in his reply he writes as follows:-\n\"I might say that this is the first I have heard that Mr. Waddy was not satisfied with the work of the teachers at this school. He visited the school early in March, spent a little time in each class-room when I was present with him but he passed no remark to me\".\n\nWith regard to the plans of our Society in the future relative to this matter I may say that as the two teachers now at this school purpose entering Normal this Autumn to undergo further Normal training, other fully-qualified teachers will be appointed to take their place as soon as the school opens after the summer holidays, and I trust this arrangement may be satisfactory to you.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JP\nOttawa, April 8, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to teaching services in the classrooms of the Mackay Indian Residential School. I note, with satisfaction, that it is your intention to secure professionally qualified teachers whenever possible, and I am pleased to learn that normal trained incumbents will be at this school during the coming academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Mackay School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSept. 25th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy:\n\nI arrived home on Monday with Baker Siwap, though I feel sure that on landing if there had been no boys to meet me, he would have run off as soon as the canoe touched the shore.\n\nHe was placed in the dormitory and brought down to supper and then taken back, thinking keeping him shut in for a day or two might do him good. I kept him in next day, but he slipped away after supper time and was caught near the Reserve and brought back (this was Tuesday) at 8 P.M., I fastened him to the bed at night, so as to make sure that he would get into no mischief, then released him next day and left him in the Dormitory - he was caught trying to pull the pins in the hinges on the door. I gave him a spanking over my knees with his clothes on. His clothes were taken away next day, but during Thursday afternoon he apparently put the bed near the clothes closet, climbed through the transom light and secured his clothes, got a window open and slipped down the fire escape. He had told the boys he meant to run away again, apparently he is going to make another Colin Tobacco.\n\nI sent a boy down the Reserve on Wednesday and on to town, he returned on Thursday noon - no news of the boy and he forget to call and notify you.\n\nQuestion what shall be done with him and Colvin?.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Rev. E.V.Bird.\nThe Pas. Man.\nOct. 1st, 1925\n\nCommissioner Graham,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nSir:\n\nI have at last decided to write and let you know how this McKay School is being run, and to ask if anything can be done immediately to find out the cause of troubles which rise from there. I have tried not to pay much attention to the various reports made to me in regard to the treatment of children there by the Principal; but having seen what he really does I have at last made up my mind to report same to you. On investigation several witness can be got to testify. I will just tell you of one instance which happened very recently. A young boy was flogged at the school and he ran away to his people. His parents then took him back and kindly asked Mr. Bird, Principal, not to flog the boy again, as he was not doing anything seriously wrong. The Principal replied that he would flog the boy again. As soon as the parents were out of sight he started to flog the boy. There were some person there from Moose Lake and they could hear the distressing cries of the boy. After the flogging the Principal told the boy he would again whip him in the evening. So he locked him up, but somehow the boy again made his escape almost naked and bare footed. There are some white men and some Indians who saw the boy in the state he was in after his flogging, in fact, we were afraid that he would probably die somewhere as those who saw him say that he was nearly out of his mind. Since then the boy has been found and as far as I know is kept at the hospital for treatment.\n\nTrusting that you will see to attend to this at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Pal Constant.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to report that the Principal of the Mackay School has been reported to me as having abused a pupil named Siwap.\n\nI enclose a letter from the Principal regards this pupil. Also a letter the Chief of the Pas Band handed to me to send to you.\n\nA Mr. St. Goddard reported to me that he saw the boy after he ran away, the youngster was welted all around one leg, black and blue. That if the Indian Department do nothing about the abuse of pupils at Mackay School he will take the matter with the S.P.C.A. like he would if a dog was abused. A young chap named A.Anderson tells me he picked the pupil up from the river bank and took him to St. Goddard's camp. That the boy was whaled black and blue.\n\nLast year I reported this same Principal for abuse of a pupil, my witnesses did not support me it seems. One of these times a pupil will starve to death in the bush after running away from school, this boy was away for a week and nearly made a nice case for publicity against the Department, as in the final analysis we are responsible. The boy tells me he was whaled twice across the rump with a paddle before the Principal took him into the school and gave him the strapping.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) J.W.Waddy,\nIndian Agent\n\nW.M.Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith for your information copy of a letter received from Mr. J. W. Waddy, Indian Agent at The Pas dated October 5th, together with copies of the letters referred to by him therein in the second paragraph. This relates to the infliction of corporal punishment by the Principal on an Indian pupil named Siwap.\n\nThis is the second occasion on which the methods adopted by the Principal of the Mackay School in disciplining the pupils has been brought to the attention of the Department. I wish to draw attention to Department letter #128-1-1 dated the 16th of September, 1924, in which you advised me that you were corresponding with the Church Authorities in regard to Mr. E. V. Bird, making the comment that the Principal was apparently not qualified for his position.\n\nWhile the whipping of pupils may at times be necessary in the hands of the Principal of this School this form of punishment becomes an abuse, and it seems to me that the time has arrived when the services of this Principal should be dispensed with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 23, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11 B of the 12th instant, with enclosures, which relate to corporal punishment administered by the Principal of the Mackay Indian Residential School. I shall bring this question to the attention of the Deputy Superintendent General at the first opportunity and shall have another communication for you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, October 31, 1925.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nA year ago, it was necessary to draw to Dr. Westgate's attention a report concerning the infliction of corporal punishment by the Principal of the Mackay Indian Residential School. Mr. Indian Agent Waddy stated in his letter at that time that he had spoken to the Rev. Mr. Bird relative to disciplinary measures on an earlier occasion. It appeared that Indian parents had protested to the local office. Dr. Westgate made enquiries and we hoped that the Principal would in future give careful consideration to the methods employed in the maintenance of discipline at the school.\n\nI regret to inform you that Mr. Commissioner Graham, Mr. Indian Agent Waddy, certain Indians and other residents of The Pas consider that the Rev. Mr. Bird, during the last week in September, was again abusive in the case of Baker (William) Siwap, a 10 year old pupil at the school. This second report tends to destroy confidence in Mr. Bird and I should like you to seriously consider that failure to remove him from his post will militate against the successful conduct of the institution. I am inclined to this opinion. Granted that the language of the reports may be exaggerated, the effect on the Indian community is such that Mr. Bird's usefulness is greatly impaired. I know that you will give this matter your customary careful attention and I shall be glad to hear from you at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.C.L.,\nGeneral Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n604 Jarvis St., Toronto (2) Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nD.C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYour letter dated Oct. 31st received. It is with great regret that I learn of the renewed complaints in relation to the disciplinary measures enforced by the Rev. E.V. Bird, Principal of the Mackay Indian Residential School. We shall, of course, follow up this matter with great care. In the meanwhile, however, I beg respectfully to suggest:\n\n(1) That we cannot make a proper investigation unless we are furnished with a copy of the specific statements and complaints made by those laying the charge. I shall, therefore, be greatly obliged if you will be good enough to direct that a copy of such statements and complaints be furnished me at an early date.\n\n(2) That, in our previous experience, when charges were made against the Rev. E.V. Bird, in relation to \"the punishment of Arthur Dorion\" as set out in the letter dated Sept. 16th, 1924, of the acting Deputy Superintendent General, in which it was stated on the authority of the local Indian agent that \"he (i.e., Arthur Dorion) was black from his neck to his buttocks where he had been strapped,\" such charges were, in my opinion, decisively rebutted by the evidence of the Rev. Rural Dean Fraser and of the Bishop of Saskatchewan, who both examined the back of the boy shortly after the infliction of the punishment in question. This decisive rebuttal of the charge laid by Mr. Indian Agent Waddy and backed up by Mr. Commissioner Graham (who apparently never saw the boy) was set out in my letter to you dated Oct. 18th, 1924, and in the letter of the Rev. Dr. Westgate to the Secretary of the Department under date Nov. 28th, 1924, and has never been controverted or, as far as I know, questioned.\n\nI have, also, before me a copy of the letter of Dr. Westgate, dated Oct. 31st, to the Secretary of the Department in relation to the case of the accident suffered by Anna Constant, a pupil at the same school. The manner in which both these cases have been reported to your Department appears to us to afford considerable ground for a suspicion that either Mr. Indian Agent Waddy, or his associates, are not well-disposed personally towards the principal of the Mackay School and that, in consequence, they are not only ready, but desirous, of placing the worst possible complexion upon all incidents in relation to the discipline and management of the school which may come to their notice. While I feel it my duty to state frankly this aspect of the general situation as it appears to me, my\ndoing so will not interfere, of course, with our carrying out the inquiries and investigations called for by your letter.\n\nI have engagements in Montreal for Sunday, Nov. 15th, and am proceeding from there direct to Winnipeg and points further west. I, therefore, propose, subject to your convenience, to leave Toronto for Ottawa on the evening of Friday the 13th, and to see you in relation to the above and other matters on the morning of Saturday the 14th. In the meanwhile I am forwarding a copy of your letter, together with copy of this reply, to the Rev. Dr. Westgate, Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Commission, with the request that the necessary inquiries with regard to the corporal punishment inflicted upon Baker Siwap be made.\n\nBelieve me, Dear Sir,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nNovember 5, 1925.\n\nDear Canon Gould,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, and to say in reply that I expect to be in my office on Saturday morning, the 14th instant, and would be very glad to see you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada,\nThe Church House,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto, Ont.\nNovember 6, 1925.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nAs requested in your letter of the 4th instant, I am forwarding herewith copies of the correspondence relating to the disciplinary measures enforced by the Principal of the Mackay Indian Residential School in the case of a pupil named Baker Siwap.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, 604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your #128-1-1 dated the 23rd ultimo, I shall be glad to know if further attention has been given to the question of dispensing with the services of the Principal at the Mackay Indian Residential School. In my letter of the 12th of October I drew the Department's attention a second time to his abuse of pupils, and I do not think that any further consideration should be given to his retention at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 11, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11 B of the 5th instant, with reference to the Rev. Principal of the Mackay Indian Residential School. As you were informed in my letter of the 23rd ultimo, this question is receiving the attention of the Deputy Superintendent General. On the 31st ultimo, a communication was directed to the General Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada. Canon Gould has replied and the question is receiving his serious attention. It is to be the subject of a conference between him and Dr. Scott on Saturday morning, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Mackay School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nNov. 9, 1925.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.\nThe Bible House,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nYour letter of the 3rd inst. to handle Baker Siwap.\n\nThe boy apparently intends to settle down, and I would prefer to try him out; we have another boy Colin Tobacco, (a brother of the Frederick Tobacco who was sent from here to Elkhorn, and who escaped from there and so I understand was caught in Winnipeg), this boy has constantly run away from here; he was brought to the school during 1923. Sergt. Grennan R.C.M.W.P. has instructions from the Department to bring him back from Moose Lake, as soon as the trails are fit enough for winter travel, this boy is indeed incorrigible and will do almost anything to run away.\n\nMr. Waddy wrote the department asking that these lads be transferred to some school away from here, the Department informed him that he was to turn them into the hands of the Mounted Police and see if this would bring any results. I trust that it will, if not then I will write Mr. Waddy to that effect and ask him to forward my letter re their discharge to Ottawa.\n\nThe third time that Baker Siwap ran away, I spent two days up the river hunting for traces of him, as we expected that he would make for Cumberland where his home is, we did not find him, three Indians hearing that he had been seen away up the river trying to get to Cumberland on foot, left their Duck hunt and hunted for him, they found him on the second day, and as he had had very little food, he was in an exhausted condition, they brought him back to The Pas and he was placed in hospital. The Agent referred them to me re payment, and as they had been three days hunting and a day bringing him in, and had to return all the way back to their camp, they charged me $15 for the leader and $10 each for the other two men or $35 in all, considering the time they had lost, this was a reasonable charge, I paid it out of my personal account, and enclose the receipt.\n\nMany thanks for your action re the Nurse, and remarks of the Agent.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) E. V. Bird.\nPrincipal.\nPrince Albert\n\nR. C. M. P.\n\nThe Pas Detachment,\nOct. 24th, 1925.\n\nREPORT.\n\nRE.

On arriving home last night, I have him in charge of some boys to look after him, he was in for breakfast was seen until 9 a.m., when after washing for school he went downstairs ready for Line-Up and out to the latrine, this was just a few minutes before school went in, he was missed in line and on looking around we found he had gone.\n\nYours sincerely, E. V. Bird.\n\nThis boy ran away from the school about a fortnight ago, was caught on the Saskatchewan river and brought to town he was taken to hospital as he had suffered a little from exposure.\n\nOn the 22nd inst., the Agent, Mr. Waddy asked me to take the boy over from the Hospital authorities and hand him over to Mr. Bird, who was in town at the time. I did this. The following morning, I received the above mentioned letter by special messenger. Shortly afterwards the boy in question was detained in the main street of The Pas by an Indian woman Alice Webb and turned over to me, in turn I handed him over to the Indian Agent, Mr. Waddy. The School is about 7 miles from town.\n\nThis boy who is thirteen years of age, is an incorrigible, and it is doubtful whether the School staff will be able to hold him for long.\n\nW. M. Grennan, Sgt.\nReg. No 4810 L/C Detachment.\n\nP.S. Mr. Waddy sent the boy back to the school in charge of his interpreter. FRANCIS FLETT.\n\nThe Officer Commanding, R. C. M. P.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of Oct. 31st, addressed to our General Secretary, and the reply on Nov. 4th, relative to the information conveyed to you that \"Mr. Commissioner Graham, Mr. Indian Agent Waddy, certain Indians, and other residents of The Pas considered that Rev. Mr. Bird, during the last week in September, was again abusive in the case of Baker (William) Siwap, a 10 year old pupil at the School\". I beg to state that on the occasion of my visit to this institution on Nov. 26th and 27th last, I gave special consideration to this important matter.\n\nDuring an interview I had with Mr. Waddy immediately after my arrival in The Pas on Nov. 26th I learned that his report in this connection was based very largely on information he had received from the man Sanquedor at whose house this pupil had arrived after leaving the school and was making his way back to his home at Cumberland. I also learned from Mr. Waddy that this man was a Frenchman and a member of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nOn my arrival at the School I saw the boy himself and his condition appeared to me to be so rugged and healthy that I did not consider any physical examination necessary.\nI discussed the whole matter personally first with Mr. Bird alone and subsequently with the whole staff when neither Mr. Bird nor Mrs. Bird were present, and both of whom were unaware until afterwards, of the action I had taken.\n\nDuring the meeting with the staff they unanimously assured me that the boy Baker (William) Siwap had not been \"abused\", and that, in their opinion Mr. Bird erred on the side of leniency rather than on the side of severity, in the punishment of any of the pupils. I have to state, therefore, that in the light of this information, and in view of the source from which Mr. Waddy received the information on which he based his report, I find no justification for the serious charge which that report contained.\n\nThat the boy was punished for a serious breach of discipline there is no doubt. That the punishment administered was neither abusive nor unduly severe, but barely what would be expected under the circumstances, is equally certain, and I am of the opinion that it would be a mistake to remove Mr. Bird from the Principalship of this institution at the present time.\n\nAbout a year ago, a similarly damaging report was issued by Mr. Indian Agent Waddy in connection with the punishment of the pupil Arthur Dorian. I investigated at that time all the circumstances and having satisfied myself that the report contained statements which were unsupported by the facts of the case informed your Department accordingly. Subsequent events have shown, I think, that the action taken by the Principal and his staff at that time were fully justified. The pupil Arthur Dorian is still at the School and is one of the best behaved, healthiest, and most helpful of the bigger boys. He played in the School's foot-ball team which won the Silver Cup this fall in competition against the foot-ball teams from The Pas School, and The Pas Mill.\n\nAt the time of my visit I had the pleasure of presenting this beautiful cup to the team, and with it a small silver medal presented by Premier Bracken of Manitoba to each member. After the presentation the captain (Joseph Bignell) and Arthur Dorian made short speeches in reply.\n\nThat punishment is necessary, at times, in the maintenance of discipline, must, I think, be acknowledged, and I have good reason to believe that the results in the case of Baker (William) Siwap will be equally as beneficial as they have proved to be in the case of Arthur Dorian.\n\nBut it can hardly be expected, I think, that a Principal can obtain the best results possible if he is to be subjected to\nadverse reports such as those referred to in this letter, and any action you may take to have it discontinued will be deeply appreciated by our Society.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTRW/JF.\nDecember 11th, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer further to your No. 205-11 B of the 5th ultimo, which relates to the Rev. Principal of the Mackay Indian Residential School. I have today received a letter from Dr. Westgate in this connection, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"I beg to state that on the occasion of my visit to this institution on November 26th and 27th, last, I gave special consideration to this important matter.\n\n\"During an interview I had with Mr. Waddy immediately after my arrival in The Pas on November 26th I learned that his report in this connection was based very largely on information he had received from the man Banquedor at whose house this pupil had arrived after leaving the school and was making his way back to his home at Cumberland.

McLEAN\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nJanuary 2nd 1926\n\nJ.W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nRegards Siwap, the boy who I picked up from the river bank and took to St Goddards camp last September when he ran away from school. I tell you the same thing I told you at the time I spoke of this matter before, that is that the boy Siwap was striped with black and blue marks all down one leg. He showed me these marks and told me he got them from someone at the school. I then took him to St Goddards camp and he jumped off there.\n\nSigned,\n\nArthur Anderson\nThe Pas, Man.\nJanuary 2nd 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy;-\n\nI am a member of the Pas Band and was fireman on Anderson's boat last summer in September when we picked young Siwap up on the river bank about three miles above the school. We thought he was lost as he waved his arm to us and yelled at us.\n\nWhen we picked up the young lad he pulled up his pants, he had on no stockings or coat. I saw marks on him black in the centre and red at the side. He told me Mr Bird had done this. I would say the boy had been abused. I talk and write English and have read this statement before I sign it.\n\nJoseph McGillivray\nDear Sir,\n\nThis boy Swag was picked up along the river by Barney Anderson and stayed all night at our camp. He didn't want to go to the Pas. I got the Indian to persuade him to stay with us. He said he wouldn't, he seems to be very scared. George Thom examined his legs and called me over to have a look at him. There were black and blue and swollen.\n\nI asked him how did he get hurt, he said Mr Bird had whipped him with a piece of\nLeather, it looked to me if it had been done with a heavy willow or a raw hide whip.\n\nThe boy stayed till about four o'clock and disappear, we warn't very sure that event by to look out for him, four days after was picked up by Hugh Johnson in awful condition.\n\nYours truly,\nAvila St Godard.\nSir:\n\nIn reference to letter #205-11B of the 17th ultimo, asking for further information regards my letter of the 5th October last #4679-135 reporting the case of a pupil named Siwap having been reported to me as being abused at the McKay Indian Residential School, I have the honor to enclose a statement from Mr. O.St.Goddard, also statements from Arthur Anderson and Joseph McGillivary.\n\nAs reported by Dr. Westgate I said that Mr. St. Goddard was a Roman Catholic; however, this information was not volunteered, but was an answer to his question. I did not say he was a Frenchman. Rev. Dr. Westgate asked me if he were a Frenchman, and I said he was a Canadian of French descent. There is nothing against Mr. St.Goddard in this, he is one of the most respectable citizens in the district.\n\nI do not like making these reports any more than anyone else, as I am a personal friend of Mr. Bird, but consider that it is part of my duty to take notice of these complaints.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Sgd.) J.W.Waddy\nIndian Agent\n\nW.M.Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th of December 128-1-1, informing me that you had received a letter from Dr. Westgate in connection with the treatment of William Siwap, a pupil at the McKay Indian Residential School, by the Principal, Mr. E.V.Bird, and containing extracts from same.\n\nI have read very carefully the extracts from Dr. Westgate's letter, and it seems to me that the investigation which he held was anything but satisfactory, and the inquiry or investigation was not carried on as it should have been in order to get at the true facts of the case. Dr. Westgate merely went to Mr. Bird's own staff, and to Mr. Bird himself, the accused; he did not go to the people who picked the boy up on the river bank and made the complaints to the Agent in the matter, and who were the parties in a position to say the condition in which the boy was found. It would not be very natural for Mr. Bird to admit to Dr. Westgate that he had punished this boy and left him in the condition described by Mr. St. Goddard and others.\n\nAfter receiving your letter I again took the matter up with Mr. Waddy, in fairness to him in view of Dr. Westgate's report. I asked Mr. Waddy to procure a signed statement from Mr. St.Goddard as to the boy's condition when he first saw him; this he did, and I am enclosing same herewith, as well as a copy of Mr. Waddy's letter. You will notice Mr. Waddy says that Mr. St. Goddard is one of the most respectable citizens in the district. Signed statements are also enclosed from Joseph McGillivray, who picked the boy up on the bank of the river, and from Arthur Anderson who was with McGillivray at the time. All of which statements go to show that the boy was abused.\n\nOn the 12th of October I forwarded to the Department a copy of a letter from Pat Constant, Chief of The Pas Band, in which he reported the unsatisfactory conditions existing at the McKay School. Mr. Indian Agent Taylor speaks highly of this Chief, and says that any complaints which he makes would be reliable. I also forwarded at that time a copy of Indian Agent Waddy's letter of Oct. 5th. in which he makes the following statement,-\n\n\"One of these times\"\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\"One of these times a pupil will starve to death in the bush after running away from school. This boy was away for a week and nearly made a nice case for publicity against the Department, as in the final analysis we are responsible. The boy tells me he was whaled twice across the rump with a paddle before the Principal took him into the school and gave him the strapping.\"\n\nDr. Westgate makes the following statement in his letter to you:\n\n\"About a year ago a similarly damaging report was issued by Mr. Indian Agent Waddy in connection with the punishment of the pupil Arthur Dorian. I investigated at that time all the circumstances and have satisfied myself that the report contained statements which were unsupported by the facts of the case informed your Department accordingly. Subsequent events have shown, I think, that the action taken by the Principal and his staff at that time were fully justified.\"\n\nIn connection with this matter I would quote from Mr. Waddy's report to me, dated Sept. 1st, 1924, as follows:\n\n\"Last Friday one of the pupils named Arthur Dorian, aged 15, was brought into the office by his parents to show how he had been treated. He was black from his neck to his buttocks where he had been strapped; altogether too much abuse in these times, though I have had plenty worse myself in different country than Canada. It appears that the boy could not work as he had blistered hands from handling a hay fork or some other tool and he got trimmed for this. He fought back, I understand, when he was getting strapped, and made the Principal lose his temper.\n\nI called in Bishop Lloyd and Rev. Mr. Fraser to show them what was going on at the school, as the Principal has always denied abusing the children.\"\n\nIn this instance there was no hearsay; the Agent actually saw the boy in the condition reported, and it seems to me that he was fully justified in reporting as he did. The Agent also states in this report that he had previously drawn the Principal's attention to the fact that he was too severe in the punishment of the children at the school, but he did not seem to get any better.\n\nIn my opinion Dr. Westgate is taking altogether the wrong view of these matters, and I think you will agree with me that this sort of thing cannot be allowed to go on, and that the Department should deal with the matter seriously.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\"\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nJan. 22, 1926.\n\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRE: The Superintendent General's License for the Mackay School to \"trade\" with the Indians.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Waddy, of The Pas, Man., having directed my attention at the time of my visit to the Mackay School last November to the necessity of procuring a license to operate a store at this institution, I requested the Principal to furnish me with a statement setting forth the nature of the business which the store in question transacted. In his reply he states, in part, as follows:\n\n1. \"The store is run by the School and not by any member of the staff.\"\n\n2. \"Groceries are stocked, and when an Indian brings any berries, meat, fish or moccasins, we trade them the value in groceries. There is no cash deal. They only bring the above when they have a surplus above their own necessity.\"\n\n3. \"I understand that at the time the School was opened, permission was given by the Department to trade (exchange would be more like the word, E.V.B) as above, and feel certain that a license has been granted in the past but I can find no record of the same.\"\nAs it would appear from sections 38 and 43 of the Indian Act, and especially section 42 as being the more directly applicable to the case in question, that the Superintendent General's license is necessary, I shall be grateful if you will furnish the Rev. E. V.

T. D. Conlin in connection with his proposed nomination for the Principalship of the Mackay School. In response to this request I now beg to state that, in the opinion of our Commission, Mr. Conlin possesses many of the qualifications required for a successful Principal of an Indian Residential School. He is 36 years of age being born in the north of Ireland in 1890, and holds the Diploma of King's Scholar from the Irish Church Training College. Since coming to Canada he studied theology at St. John's College, Winnipeg and was ordained as a graduate of that institution. He has had ten years experience in Indian missionary work, and has, therefore, a first hand knowledge of the Indian character. His qualifications as a Teacher, and his experience as a missionary, appear to our Commission to fit him about as well as any man they could secure for the responsible position in question. As Mr. Conlin is not unknown to you and to your Department, I shall be obliged if you will let me have an expression of your opinion in this matter which I may submit to our Commission for their consideration before any further definite action is taken.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nNovember 24th, 1928\n\nI have the honor to report as follows on a visit I made to the Mackay Indian Residential School on the 23rd inst.\n\nThe register shows the following attendance:\n\n- On register: 75\n- Average attendance: 70\n- Present: 39 boys, 30 girls\n\nIn classes Standard:\n- 1: 25\n- 2: 4\n- 3: 8\n- 4: 16\n- 5: 9\n- 6: 11\n- 7: 2\n\nOne pupil was in hospital, pupils Stella Thomas, Jimmy Johnson, Isaiah Flett, Arthur Brightness, and Molly Hall were absent without leave. I will see if I cannot locate the latter youngsters they are up near Split Lake someplace.\n\nThe pupils in the junior room were progressing quite well, the teacher there is Miss Vincent. She understands her work and kept good discipline.\n\nThe senior room pupils are in charge of Miss Farrow who is also a good teacher and the pupils there are getting on with their studies in a fair manner.\n\nThe children are well fed and were all healthy at time of my visit, they were also warmly clothed.\n\nThe school is clean, well ventilated and in fair shape all round. The broken windows have all been replaced.\n\nThe cows are not giving much milk at present, though nine are milking, so the pupils are not receiving much milk.\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Senior class room requires the following:\n4 rear seats, A.S.Co. Single seats No 1., as sold by Christie & Co., Brandon.\n4 wooden backs for repairs to C.O.& S.F.CO., Preston, single desks. 2 number 2.\n\n24pcs 1x4x10' stripping for placing the desks in sets so they can be moved without danger of breaking.\n2 gross wood screws for attaching desks.\n\nThe Principal asks for a visit from the dentist as he states that a number of the pupils need attention.\n\nThe feed for the live stock there is going to be quite a problem this winter. Last summer there was a flood in the Saskatchewan valley and hay could not be procured until late in August, and then it was of very poor quality swamp hay. A little hay was cut on the land given the school two years ago but this was also flooded and is poor stuff.\n\nThe cattle and horses are as follows:\nCow in milk 9.\nDry cows 2.\nBull 1.\nYearling heifer 1.\n\" steers 2.\nHeifer calf 1.\nSteer \" 6.\nHorses 5.\n\nTo support the above the supply of hay on hand is only about 80 tons. It would first appear as if we should request the school authorities to beef the young steers, with hay at twenty dollars a ton here it will not pay to raise them just now. This would leave nineteen animals. There are two or three old cows here that would be beefed out, but the expensive cost of feed alone but they would have to be replaced with others. If the school people eat the meat of the cows they could allow the value of this beef at time new cows are purchased, but I presume the Department would be asked to assume the balance. I am just suggesting these moves to save money, they could be avoided of course by supply of feed.\n\nIn any case the horses should be given a good supply of hay or they will die, they are loosing flesh rapidly from lack of nourishment from the swamp hay. At least ten tons of first class hay should be provided for them very soon, and a supply of hay of good quality supplied for a few of the best milking cows.\n\nThe warehouse has all been sheeted in with siding and the metallic sheeting will be placed on the flour warehouse next week.\n\nI regret to report that the new Principal has had quite a lot of trouble from the actions of a number of the elder children deserting. Hardly a day goes bye that one or more do not take leave on their own account. The fault is hard to spot, but I think it is mostly from a lot of those nearing the age of eighteen trying to get away before their time expires. I have assisted in getting these pupils home every time without abusing them so as to leave no opening for complaint on that account. Mr. Conlin has also acted very decently and quietly and has kept his temper where you might excuse him if took harsher steps.\nThis matter of the children deserting will probably pass away shortly but in the meanwhile it is operating against our recruiting pupils locally for the vacancies in the school. The Indians will not send children while they think we are having trouble to keep those already there.\n\nI do not know whether I should make the following remarks, but they are not made without consideration.\n\nThe Indian people here in the north respect size in a person much more than they do knowledge contained in a smaller person. Four of the staff at this school are very small and very young for this work, though they are well equipped for the work otherwise. The children really do not respect them at all. I would not suggest replacing them with matrons from a jail or rough people of any sort, but in future it would be well to supply good husky ladies for this school, a light weight one is out of place there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nPa.A.Ref. 26F 502-8-187\n\nThe Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\nREGINA - Sask.\nForwarded for your information.\n\nSupt.\nT.G.

Waddy Bgt., Indian Agent.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy,\n\nThere has been a serious case of theft here from stock of food, involving as we think certain of the senior boys. Many tins of corn, pounds of crackers, pounds of tea etc., in fact wholesale robbery by breaking the door transom. It is clearly a case for Statutory Proceedings. Would you be so good as to send out Sergt. Gromman or available officer to investigate. I will pay the Taxi Bill.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n24, II, 1928\n\nIn the afternoon I walked out to the school at the Big-Boy, a distance of a little over six miles. On arrival, I immediately started to investigate, the results of which were as follows: The following boys admitted going into their store-room through the transom window on the 21st & 22nd & 23rd inst., and stealing a quantity of food stuffs, to the value of approximately $25.00... TO WIT: Tinned Goods... Peaches, Sardines, Raisins, Pineapples & Salmon. Also: A large quantity of Soda Crackers & Prunes / Tea ADOLPHUS GEORGE... ALWICK DICK... HOP YOUNG... & TOM [illegible].\n\nThe following boys assisted in consuming these goods: TED YOUNG... ABRAHAM PACHEESE... SEBASTIAN MARTIN... JOHN YOUNG... ELIGAH TOBACCO... ADAM JEBB & JERRY MARLE.\n\nMy Comlin asked me what I thought was the best thing to do. I told him, that since the school was more or less a Departmental one, that the best thing would be, for him to await instructions from his superiors after my report had gone in. He concurred with me.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.C. Gromman Bgt.,\nW.C. Gromman - Regt No: 4810\nI.G.

The Commissioner has requested to be advised as to what action the Department wishes taken in the matter. It does not appear that this is a matter which requires any further action on the part of the Police, as it is considered that the Principal and staff of the school should be able to mete out any punishment which the case requires and to see that the theft of provisions does not occur in future.

To be a Principal of\nan institution of this sort requires good qualifi-\ncations. I know it is hard to get a good man.

AGENT WADDY, FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, 1929, ON THE MACKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nDiscipline is not first class. When the pupils want to go to a dance they seem to walk out and do so.\n\nThe staff is too small, there should be someone in charge of the pupils after school hours; we can hardly expect the teachers to do 24 hours duty daily.\n\nStaff is efficient but teachers too small in stature with result that pupils do not respect them.\n\nThe Principal manages all right but is not fitted for the job and is leaving on June 30th.\n\nSupply teachers large enough to handle the husky pupils and put in man and woman to take charge after school hours and watch pupils for desertions, etc. Attendance will have to be recruited soon, numbers should be at least 80.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 2)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nREGINA, SASK., Oct. 31st, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to make the following short report on three schools in The Pas Agency, inspected while there between October 23rd and 29th, 1929.\n\nMACKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe new house being erected for the Principal of the Mackay School was well along, being practically closed in, and the lathing was being started on the day I left. The house is 24x26, with 4 bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs and 1 small bedroom, kitchen, pantry, dining room, living room and hall downstairs. The work, up to the present, has been well done, and the house, no doubt, will be warm and comfortable. The difficulties experienced in digging the septic tank and outlet have been very expensive, due to the rock formations. I instructed the Principal to have all drains and outlets covered with manure and old hay to prevent freezing, and if these instructions are carried out, I do not think any trouble will be experienced.\n\nRev. Mr. Fraser has been Acting Principal during the past few months and expects to be appointed Principal on January 1st. The school is still sadly lacking in management, and I pointed this out to Mr. Fraser.\n\nThe Farming Instructor, Mr. Gibson, is a mere boy in appearance and has no experience to fit.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nhim for the position. The yards were littered with hay, rocks and broken pieces of boards and apparently no attempt has been made to clean up the surroundings. The barn was also in an untidy condition, and the doors needed repairing. I pointed this out to Mr. Gibson, but I doubt if he is capable of doing the repair work necessary.\n\nThe school is very short of milk and now receives about 1 gal. twice a day. At present there are about 75 pupils in residence. I understand 4 of the cows are of little use as their udders are partly destroyed, so that this leaves only 5 good milk cows and at present they are practically dry. I have no doubt that the condition of the cattle is due, somewhat, to careless management, and although milk is certainly needed for the children, I pointed out to Mr. Fraser that I was not prepared to make any recommendations until a capable Farming Instructor was appointed. The present man is a joke, as far as filling his position is concerned, and should be discharged.\n\nThe chicken house stands only a few feet from the girls' playground, which ground needs re-fencing and should be enlarged. If a capable man were in charge outside, this work could be done with little expense to the Department and it would greatly improve the appearance of the school grounds.\n\nI would further point out that the grounds have no equipment for the amusement of the children, and swings and teeters could be erected at little cost. Football, volley ball and basketball equipment could also be used to great advantage.\n\nI regret\nI regret I was unable to inspect the interior of the school building as it was quarantined on account of diphtheria. However, I was informed by Mr. Fraser that it is in much the same condition as when I last inspected it. The Acting Principal assured me that when he takes charge in January that a change will be made, and I would point out to the Department that this change is certainly needed.\n\nThe walls of the school building have been re-sided and are now in splendid condition. No paint was provided for the building, but this work should be done as soon as possible.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Fraser, Acting Principal, realizes that there is considerable room for improvement about the school, both inside and out, and if he is able to carry out his intentions, I will expect to find changed conditions when I next visit the school.\n\nAt present they have no flag. I feel that all the schools should be provided with a flag, and the boys and girls should be taught to respect and honour it.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an inspection made at the various schools in The Pas Agency by Mr. Hamilton. You will note what the Inspector has to say regarding the McKay School. This should be no surprise to the Department as the McKay School, ever since I have known it has not been properly managed, and in fact has not been a training school at all. I would ask the Department to see at once that Mr. Gibson, who is employed as Farming Instructor is dismissed. It is not fair to have a man like this in charge of Indian boys.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to the shortage of milk at this school. I am inclined to think that this is due entirely to carelessness. At one time I bought a herd of purebred cows for this school but they have just been destroyed through a lack of expert care. I would also draw your attention to the Inspector's remarks regarding the chicken house, which is situated only a few feet from the girls' playground. This is most unsatisfactory as there is nothing will litter a yard up quicker than to have chickens around.\n\nThis school was re-sided this year. It was at first thought that we would only do one end but after the work was begun we decided to do the whole building. It will require two coats of paint in the spring. Will the Department make provision for this in the Estimates? There should also be an amount placed in the Estimates to paint the school and teacher's residence at The Pas Day School. I note that the Agent did not provide for this when making up the Estimates.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nYou will note what the Inspector says regarding a storeroom for the use of the teacher, Mr. Humberstone.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 7, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11 of the last instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his inspection of the MacKay Indian Residential School. The Department is taking up with the Church authorities the question of obtaining the services of a competent farm instructor and the shortage of milk supplied the pupils.\n\nWe have noted for our Estimates the expenditure required in repainting the school building next summer; also in the painting of the school and teacher's residence at the Pas Indian Day School.\n\nWe are also taking up with Mr. Agent Tweedell the matter of a storeroom for the teacher's use at the Pas Indian Day School.\n\nA 9' flag has been forwarded for the use of the MacKay School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, November 7, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nOur Inspector, who recently visited the MacKay Indian Residential School, has drawn attention to the services being performed by the farming instructor, Mr. Gibson. He states that he is a mere boy in appearance and has had no experience to fit him for the position. The Inspector found the yards and barns in an untidy condition and states that he was not prepared to make any recommendations to the Principal until a capable farm instructor was appointed. He further adds that the services of Mr. Gibson are a joke as far as filling his position is concerned and that he should be discharged.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will give the matter of obtaining the services of a competent farming instructor at this school your early attention, and I shall be pleased to have the name and qualifications of the man whom you succeed in obtaining for this position.\n\nThe Inspector also draws attention to the shortage of milk for the use of the pupils. He states that the present condition of the cattle is due somewhat to careless management. You will agree with the Department that it is absolutely necessary that the pupils be furnished with an adequate supply of milk each day, and I shall be pleased if you will arrange to see that steps are taken at an early date towards this end.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF W. G.

No. 128-1-1, re the Principalship of the Mackay School, and note that you have not received any official nomination of the Rev. A. Fraser for this position. In reply, I beg to state, that our Commission entered into negotiations with Mr. Fraser with regard to this position as far back as February of last year, but as Mr. Fraser was under contract with the Diocese of Saskatchewan as Missionary in charge of the Devon Mission at The Pas, Manitoba, he was unable to reach any definite decision with regard to the Principalship of the Mackay School until the terms of his contract with the Diocese had been fulfilled. From our files, I notice that on September 9th, he expressed his willingness to accept our Commission's offer subject to the adjustment of certain matters which would be satisfactory to all the parties concerned. The process of adjustment with regard to the matters referred to occupied a longer period than was at first anticipated, and it was not until November 26th, that Mr. Fraser definitely decided to accept our Commission's offer of the Principalship of the Mackay School. In the meantime, he had been filling the position of Acting Principal of this School from August 22nd, last, but our Commission were awaiting further information in connection with certain important matters inseparably connected with our Church's work amongst the Indians in that part of the country before forwarding to you a specific nomination with regard to Mr. Fraser's appointment to the Acting Principalship of the Mackay School. As all the matters pertaining to this work appear at present to be within measurable distance of adjustment, I shall be obliged if you will accept this letter as our Commission's nomination of\nthe Rev. A. Fraser to the Acting Principalship of the Mackay School, his appointment as Principal, if agreeable to your Department, to be confirmed in due course by Order-in-Council.\n\nIn support of this nomination, I beg to state that Mr. Fraser has had many years of successful work amongst the Indians in northern Manitoba and speaks the Cree language fluently. His knowledge of their language and of the many problems which confront them from day to day and year to year, appears to our Commission to furnish him with very special fitness to administer an Indian Residential School.\n\nI shall be glad to furnish any further information you may desire in this connection upon receipt of your request.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, January 24, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, nominating Rev. A. Fraser as principal of the Mackay Indian Residential School and stating the negotiations between your Commission and Mr. Fraser regarding his acceptance of the position. In this connection I have to say that the Department approves of the appointment of Rev. Mr. Fraser. It is hoped he will meet with every success in his work and that under his charge this school will show a decided improvement in its various activities. It will not be necessary to obtain an Order in Council for the appointment of Mr. Fraser. The Department is informing the local Indian Agent and Mr. Commissioner Graham of the approval for his appointment. We are requesting the local Agent to give Mr. Fraser every assistance he can in his work at this school.\n\nI would refer you to official letter of November 7th, last, regarding the services of the farming instructor, Mr. Gibson. It is hoped that this matter has received attention and that the services of a competent farming instructor have been engaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

This struck me as being rather strange, owing to the fact that the Department had not only built a house for the Principal, but furnished it as well, and I wrote to the Agent at once for an explanation. I am today in receipt of his reply, in which he states that the Principal has a grown-up son, who is teaching in an outside school and this young man is occupying one of the rooms in the McKay School. This is a most unusual procedure and it is hard to believe that a man would do such a thing.\n\nThe Agent goes on to say that he spoke to the Principal several times about this, but without result.\n\nI should like to have your authority to have this young man removed from the school at once, owing to the fact that he has been occupying a room, the Department has been called upon to pay for hospital space which would otherwise have been unnecessary. This is the information I have from the Agent. Kindly let me have your instructions in this matter at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Will you please give instructions that this be discontinued without delay. If the Principal's son is employed elsewhere than at the school, he has no right to live there. During this young man's holidays or when he is not employed elsewhere, he must not use space that is required for school purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. G. Tweedell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir:-\n\nOn June 13th last, in forwarding Agent Tweddell's report on the McKay Indian Residential School for the month of May, I drew your attention to the fact that although the Principal had a residence built and furnished for him by the Department he was still making use of some of the rooms in the school proper for members of his family.\n\nYou wrote to me on the 18th of June stating that the Department was writing to the Agent ordering that this be discontinued. On the 21st of June I wrote to Agent Tweddell, asking him to advise me when the Department's instructions in this connection had been carried out. Not having heard from him I again wrote him on July 23rd, and am today in receipt of a letter in which he states that he visited the school on the 28th instant and found upon personal enquiry of Mr. Fraser that his two sons and one daughter were still occupying rooms in the school.\n\nThe Agent states that there has been a complaint from the cook, Mrs. Evans, in regard to Mr. Fraser's family. She claims that Dr. Westgate told her she was to cook for the pupils and ten members of staff, whereas she now has to cook for seven members of the Principal's family extra, making seventeen in all.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI would ask the Department to take some definite and decided stand in this matter. There is no reason why it should not be settled at once. It is absolutely wrong that this state of affairs should continue and it will only lead to further trouble if definite action is not taken without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, August 9, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11 of the 31st ultimo, with reference to members of the Principal's family at the MacKay Indian Residential School. The Department took a definite position in this matter in official letter of June 18th to the Indian Agent, but, as the situation is apparently the same as before, I am today writing the Church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, August 9, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIn June, last, Mr. Commissioner Graham reported that the son of the Principal of the MacKay Indian Residential School was occupying space in the main building which was required for school purposes. The Indian Agent was asked to instruct that this be discontinued. He was informed that, if the Principal's son is employed elsewhere than at the school, he has no right to live in the main building.\n\nOn June 28th, the Indian Agent reported to the Commissioner that two sons and one daughter of Mr. Fraser were occupying rooms in the school. He also states that the cook had to prepare meals for seven members of the Principal's family in addition to the pupils and ten members of the staff. Will you please take what action you consider necessary?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 9th instant, number 128-1-1, was received here yesterday, and in reply I beg to state as follows:\n\n1. As the daughter of Mr. Fraser, Principal of the Mackay School has received an official appointment on the school staff, she is entitled to occupy staff room space in the main school building, and I have advised the Principal accordingly.\n\n2. With regard to the statement made by the local Indian Agent to the Commissioner, that the cook had to prepare meals for 7 members of the Principal's family, I beg to state that this arrangement was only a temporary measure until the Principal had become fully established in his own residence, and his wife could undertake the responsibility of cooking for his family. Our Commission consider that the Principal himself is entitled to have his meals with the staff in the main school building, and he was instructed some time ago to take two meals at least each day in that way. They have found, by experience, that this arrangement has a wholesome effect on the general discipline of the school.\n\n3. With regard to the statement that two or three of the sons of the Principal were occupying space in the main school building, I beg to state that when the Principal took up residence at the school, and before the furnishings were all provided for his own official residence, permission was given to him for some of his family to occupy space in the main school building until they could be accommodated in the residence. I am advising the Principal of the reports and information set forth in your letter, and am asking him to let me know if all the members of his family, with the exception of those occupying official positions on the staff, can now be accommodated in the residence. At the same time, I should let you know, I think, that in the opinion of our Commission, the residence is rather small to adequately serve the\npurpose for which it was provided. In the report of the official representative of our Commission when he visited the Mackay School last February, he stated that \"the residence might with great advantage, and little extra cost have been made larger\". He also states that the dining and bedrooms are small.\n\nAfter I have received a statement from the Principal, I will, if I consider it necessary, write to you again with regard to the matters under consideration. In the meantime, I trust you may see from the information set forth above, that our Commission are fully cognizant of conditions obtaining at this school, and are doing their best to maintain the work at as high a standard of efficiency as the limited accommodation in the main school building as well as in the residence will permit.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INDIAN AGENT TWEDDELL,\non MacKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\ndated September, 1930.\n\nGENERAL:\n\nDiscipline at the school - STILL LAX.\nEfficiency of the Staff - FAIR.\nGeneral management - ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT.\nSuggestions - UNDERSTAND THREE OF PRINCIPAL'S FAMILY ON STAFF, WHICH IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO GOOD DISCIPLINE.\nOttawa, October 9, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Indian Agent, in a report on his inspection of the Mackay Indian Residential School, states that the discipline at the school is still lax, the efficiency of the staff only fair and that there is room for improvement. He also states that there are three of the Principal's family on the staff, which is not conducive to good discipline.\n\nIt is considered that the Principal cannot exercise the same discipline over the members of his own family on the staff as he would be able to do if others were engaged. I am drawing the Agent's report to your attention for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWinnipeg, Man. October 13, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 9th instant, #128-1-1, in which you make reference to the report of the Indian Agent and his inspection of the Mackay School, etc. I am writing today to the Principal of this school asking him for a statement bearing on the points raised in the Indian Agent's report, and will write to you again as soon as I have received his reply.\n\nThe statement made by the Agent that there are three of the Principal's family on the staff is not in harmony with the facts, as all staff agents are made by our Commission, and the only member of the Principal's family that has received an official appointment is Miss Irene Fraser who is Girls' Supervisor. The only explanation which suggests itself to me to account for the statement made by the Agent is in connection with day labour which was authorized by our Commission for providing the school's supply of hay for the coming winter. The Commission authorized Mr. Fesser to spend a certain sum of money in this connection, and it is probable that he gave this work to his two sons who were available for that service at that time. As day labourers are not staff agents, it does not seem to me to be quite fair to the Principal for your Agent to report to you that three of his family are on the staff. I will, however, write to you again as soon as I have received the Principal's reply to my letter, and after I have visited this school in person, should I consider it necessary to take this action after the Principal's statement has been received.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/W\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 2)\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of October 9th, #128-1-1, and my reply to the same on October 13th, relative to the report of your Indian Agent on his visit to the MacKay School, I beg to state that I have received from the Principal of this school a statement dealing with the points raised in the Indian Agent's report which confirms the information forwarded to you in my letter of October 13th, that there is only one member of the Principal's family on the school staff, and not three as you were informed. The Principal's sons were engaged to help in securing the hay supply, but only on a day labour basis.\n\nThe Principal's letter is too long to quote in full, but it is quite clear from the information which it contains that he has not been receiving the support and cooperation of the Indian Agent which he had expected. Amongst other things he refers to the following:\n\n(1) The attempt to proselytize on the part of the management of the Roman Catholic hospital in The Pas, any parents who are members of our Church, who were admitted to that institution for treatment. The Principal states that he requested the Indian Agent to protect our people against such interference, but no action was taken.\n\n(2) The Principal further states that he has received but little assistance from the Agent in the matter of recruiting pupils, and mentions an instance where the admission of pupils was sanctioned by your Department, but they were not brought to the school for five months after the sanction had been received.\n(3) The Principal also states that two boys from the local reserve had been placed in the school because they were a nuisance on the reserve. These boys have given the Principal and his staff a great deal of trouble, and I have asked the Principal to take up with the Indian Agent the question of their discharge or transfer to some reformatory.\n\n(4) The Principal also refers to a lack of co-operation on the part of the Agent in connection with certain repairs to such permanent items of equipment as the heating system.\n\nTo sum up the situation, I beg to state that it is the well-considered opinion of our Commission, that the present Principal of the MacKay School possesses in a very large measure the qualifications for the position which he holds. He speaks the native tongue, and has the confidence of the Indian people. He has already succeeded in bringing the enrolment at this school up to capacity, and could easily increase the enrolment if accommodation were available. This, you will understand, is a consideration which our Commission can neither overlook nor disregard. He has not, as yet, had a very long experience in presiding over an Indian Residential School, but our Commission are satisfied that if he is given a fair chance, he will be able to make that work a success. I shall endeavour to visit this school sometime towards the end of this year, but in the meantime, I beg to recommend that you instruct your Indian Agent to co-operate with the Principal a little more closely, and sympathetically, than he appears to have done in the past. If you take this action, I am not without good hope that a happier spirit will prevail between the school and the agency, and the Indian Peoples, both parents and children, will benefit accordingly.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The new principal has made many improvements but it is reported that the supervision of the boys is not at all good. The staff do not appear to have much control and it appears to be the chief weakness of the general management. Our officer suggests that there be appointed to the staff a boy's supervisor who is a strong disciplinarian and he is hopeful that there will be a vast difference in the general tone of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. McKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg,\nManitoba.\nWinnipeg, Man. December 2, 1930\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received your letter of Nov. 28th, #128-1-1, and have noted the report which has reached you that the supervision of the boys at the Mackay School is not at all good, and that your officer suggests that there be appointed to the staff a boys' supervisor who is a strong disciplinarian.\n\nFor your information, I beg to state that I visited the Mackay School on the 16th and 17th of November, and made a careful inspection of every department of the work, including that of the boys' supervisor. The young lady who is filling this position at present has had very considerable experience in Indian Residential School work, having served for some time on the staff at the Carcross School in the Yukon and later at the Shingwauk Home. Her services have always been fully satisfactory to our Commission, and to my mind her competency for the position she now holds cannot be questioned.\n\nI am not unaware of the fact that the boys at this school, especially the bigger ones have given the staff a good deal of trouble, but the impression which I received during my recent visit was that there was a considerable improvement in their behaviour. I attributed this change for the better, chiefly to the personal influence of the Principal, who is loyally supported by an efficient and hard-working staff.\nThe difficulty of handling the bigger boys and girls, as you will know, is not one which is confined to the Mackay School, but this difficulty is very much increased at the Mackay School through the lack of accommodation for class-room instruction as well as for vocational training. For some time past, our Commission have directed the attention of your Department to the urgent need for this additional accommodation, but so far it has not been provided, and, until it has been provided, the difficulty in handling the bigger boys is likely to continue. The school management find it necessary to keep them happily and profitably employed, but their task is at times rendered quite acute through the lack of proper facilities.\n\nDuring my recent visit I suggested that the bigger boys should be given the responsibility of selecting a site for and making a good-sized skating rink. A good deal of the lumber from the old hospital I thought might be used for this purpose, and the Principal undertook to act on my suggestion. My own observations, since I have been associated with the Indian educational work, bring an increasing conviction that the character of the Indian boys and girls cannot be so greatly influenced for the better by methods of compulsion and strong disciplinary measures, as by keeping them happily employed under wise and patient direction. For this reason, I should like to see Mr. Fraser given a fair opportunity of trying out this latter method. It is the one which has made a strong appeal to him, and without making any changes in the staff at present, I sincerely trust that you will allow the experiment a sufficient period to be carefully tested.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nThe Pas, Manitoba\nMay 6th, 1931\n\n637-135\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your 205-11 of the 4th instant, re April report of the McKay Indian Residential School, the reason for my remarks which you term obscure, is that I am not aware just how far it might be permissible for me to suggest any individual change in the staff.\n\nI have repeatedly suggested to the Principal that certain changes were needed, and his views have always coincided with mine, yet in no instance has there been any change made.\n\nThere are two (aged) ladies whom I consider should be superannuated - Miss Warner and Miss Norquay. Mr. Turner, the Engineer, also should be superannuated.\n\nMr. Fraser has two of his family (a boy and a girl) on the staff, which in principle is wrong.\n\nThe male pupils, some of whom are men size, have a young girl supervisor, a Miss Griffiths.\n\nOut of school, lack of supervision has led to a number of run-aways, causing a great deal of trouble and unnecessary expense. I will mention a case which occurred recently. A boy named Roderick Young ran away on Saturday morning, the 18th April, 1931, and this was not reported to me till the Monday evening following. On Saturday this boy was seen in The Pas, and this was reported to Mr. Fraser yet no action was taken. On Tuesday I reported this to the R.C.M.P., who immediately started a hunt for the boy up and down the river and on The Pas Reserve. The boy was found on Sunday following, and returned to the school on Monday.\n\nThis caused unnecessary trouble and expense, and the school to my knowledge took no steps to find the boy.\n\nI think I have given you enough detail to convince you that some change would be beneficial.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Sgd.) W. G. Tweddell\nIndian Agent\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI am attaching hereto Agent Tweedell's report for the month of April on the MacKay Indian Boarding School. Under the heading \"Efficiency of the staff\" you will note he makes the remark, \"changes required\". I wrote to the Agent asking him for an explanation of this and am also attaching hereto a copy of his reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Williams of our Toronto office, you state that the grant for this school for the June quarter would be paid on an average attendance of 80 only.\n\nOf the total number of pupils in attendance at this school I note, from the June Quarterly Return, that nine are listed as Orphans, and it appears to our Commission that our Society should receive special consideration for the maintenance of the Orphans over and above the sanctioned capacity pupilage of 80. In your letter of July 17th, #160-2, addressed to me, you have indicated the increased pupilage which has been sanctioned by your Department at our Sioux Lookout, Elkhorn, Onion Lake, and Alert Bay Schools, and our Commission desire to recommend that similar consideration be given to the Mackay School. In making this request they have not forgotten the statement made in your letter of Nov. 28th, 1930, #128-1-1, that the maximum accommodation at this school was 80, and that your Department did not consider the attic suitable for dormitory space. Nor, have they forgotten that for every 20 pupils one supernumerary is permitted to reside in the school, but not on a per capita grant earning basis. However, as matters stand at present, the school management have been asked to take care of the Orphans included in the June Quarterly Return, with the result that certain other Treaty children who should be admitted to the school, have to be excluded. Until your Department is in a\nposition to provide the accommodation necessary for the pupilage of 125 at this school which our Commission have been requesting for some years, they strongly recommend that the capacity of this school be increased from 60 to 90 pupils, and the grant paid accordingly from the beginning of the June Quarter of the current year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/W\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.\nOttawa, August 17, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the pupilage at the MacKay Indian Residential School. I regret that the Department cannot permit the building to be crowded, and I have to request that you inform the Principal that only 84 pupils should be enrolled. This will allow an average attendance of approximately 80 - the number for which grant is appropriated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nis also the girls' playroom and should be well aired at all times. A number of these windows should be placed on hinges so as to open out and allow for plenty of fresh air.\n\nThe junior room is in charge of Miss E. Payne who is a new member on the staff. Miss Payne, I understand, is qualified to teach, but I do not think she will obtain good results as her discipline is too lax. This I consider a bad fault, especially in a junior teacher, because if the children are not taught to mind in the junior room, a greater problem will be experienced when they reach the senior room. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 30     |\n| II    | 8      |\n\nThe room was tidy, but badly ventilated, in fact, as bad as the senior room. There is no cupboard in the room for supplies and the teacher is obliged to carry things back and forth from her own room. A proper cupboard should be built.\n\nThe school was clean, and the dormitories neat and tidy. Here, again, the ventilation is bad, but the Matron and Principal claim no windows can be left open or the boys and girls will get out by the use of the bed sheets.\n\nThe sewing room is in charge of Miss Fraser and fair work is accomplished.\n\nThe laundry machinery appeared in good condition, and I found the room tidy.\n\nThe kitchen work is supervised by Miss Spaulding who I do not think knows very much about cooking. I believe plenty of good food is provided, but lacks proper cooking and serving.\nThe fire equipment is in good condition, and the fire escapes are well located. All doors leading to the fire escapes are locked. The Principal and Matron claim they can do nothing else as the children run away at every opportunity.\n\nThe barn has been greatly improved by the new floor, and I found the place clean and whitewashed. Conditions about the barn and yards have greatly improved since my last visit, and I noticed that the boys were doing more work.\n\nThe chicken house is now in use, and a fine flock of birds are kept.\n\nThe root cellar had caved in, but was being repaired and made ready for the vegetables. The garden this year was good and there will be no shortage of vegetables.\n\nThe Principal's residence is in good repair. No window blinds have been provided for this house.\n\nGenerally speaking, conditions have improved at this school since my last inspection. However, conditions are not as they should be, and yet I believe Mr. Fraser has done his best with the staff which he is apparently obliged to retain. Miss Warner, the Matron, and Miss Northwood, who is in charge of the baking, both know their work, but certainly are too old to carry on and manage the girls. Miss Spaulding, as pointed out before, I do not think capable of instructing girls in cooking as I believe her knowledge along this line is very limited. Mr. Fraser claims he has pointed the above facts out to his officials, but as yet no action has been taken to make the necessary changes.\nThe meals served are as follows:\n\nBreakfast: Porridge, milk, bread, lard & tea.\n\nDinner: Fish or meat, potatoes, gravy, soup, usually a second vegetable, bread & tea for the large boys.\n\nSupper: Milk puddings, syrup or dried fruit, bread, lard & tea.\n\nThe new tables and benches supplied for the children's dining room were badly needed, and they are well made and satisfactory.\n\nI found no serious sickness, but two or three had minor ailments, and were in bed resting. I noticed two children with bad glands and two with discharging ears. The children were not as robust and healthy looking as one might expect to find them.\n\nThe cattle have improved during the last year, and I understand that during the greater part of the year sufficient milk had been obtained for the school. There are a number of young heifers, so that there should soon be no shortage of milk cows. The Principal informed me that plenty of hay had been secured for winter.\n\nThere appears to be little improvement in the water condition at this school, and I understand the Provincial Sanitary Inspector still insists that a chlorinator should be installed.\n\nMr. Fraser appears anxious to improve his school, and I believe, if supplied with a good staff, better results would be obtained. I still think, as expressed in my last report, that a man should be appointed as boys.\nMACKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (C.E.)

You will note what he has to say regarding the Misses Payne, Spaulding, Warner and Northwood. Unless the school is properly staffed, we will not accomplish very much. The work is difficult to handle, even with a good staff, and if there is an inefficient staff the Department will understand what kind of work will be carried on.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 18, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has received the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton, who recently visited the MacKay Indian Residential School. He states that the senior classroom, while large, bright and clean, is badly ventilated; the outside windows were all on and only one pane was cut to allow for ventilation. He recommends that several windows be placed on hinges to allow for ventilation. He also states that the junior room is badly ventilated and that there is no cupboard for supplies, and recommends that a proper cupboard be built. I shall be pleased if you will state whether it would not be possible for the staff to arrange to have several windows in each classroom placed on hinges and a cupboard erected in the junior room for classroom supplies. If not, I would request that you state the approximate cost of having this work done.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the ventilation in the dormitories is bad and that you claim no windows can be left open, as the boys and girls would escape. It is considered that a small window could be installed that would permit of proper ventilation.\n\nAttention is also drawn to the doors leading from the fire escapes, which are kept locked. In view of this, regular fire drill should be held and the keys to the doors kept in charge of a member of the staff. It is essential that there should be prompt access to the fire escapes should the necessity arise. I shall be pleased to have your report regarding this matter.\n\nRegarding the water at this school, I have to say that the Department has already taken action in this matter.\n\nThe Inspector has also drawn attention to the services being performed by several members of the staff. He states the discipline in the junior room, under Miss Payne, a new member of the staff, is too lax. This the Inspector\n\nRev. A. Fraser,\nPrincipal, MacKay Indian Res.

While good food is provided, proper cooking and serving are lacking, and she is not capable of instructing the girls in cooking. He also states that while Miss Warner, the housekeeper, and Miss Northwood, who is in charge of the baking, know their work, they are too old to carry on and manage the girls.\n\nHe recommends that a man be appointed as boys' supervisor, who is a disciplinarian, as he found all members of the present staff weak in this respect.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you regarding the above matters as referred to by the Inspector, stating what action, if any, is being taken to effect the necessary changes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, November 18, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nFor your information and any action you may desire to take, I am enclosing herewith copy of a communication which is being forwarded to the Principal of the MacKay Indian Residential School, The Pas, regarding certain members of the staff and also with reference to the ventilation, etc., of the classrooms and dormitories.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEnc. AGM\n\nRev. T. B. R.

F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of Nov. 18th, number 129-1-1 with a copy of your letter of the same date addressed to the Rev. A. Fraser, Principal of our Mackay School, The Pas, Manitoba. I am not a little surprised at some of the statements contained in Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report, but will refrain from further comment on the same, until I have received a copy of the Principal's reply to your letter addressed to him. The question of ventilation is one, which it seems to me can easily be solved, should any solution be required during the winter months. My recollection is that the chief difficulty which the school management have had in this connection is to overcome the excessive ventilation, especially during the cold weather.\n\nThe question of the laxity of discipline is one which, if it obtains must and will be remedied. I fully appreciate your desire to have regular fire drill maintained, and the Principals of all our Society's Schools have received a standing instruction not to neglect this important matter. The question of accessibility to the fire escapes is equally important, and I heartily wish that your Department had accepted the recommendation of our Commission, as submitted on different occasions, to install the spiral chute type of fire escape instead of the iron ladders. The iron ladders, in addition to being unsuitable for young children in time of emergency, provide a means for bigger boys and girls to get out of and return to the dormitories without being observed. They also afford a means for outsiders to enter the dormitories when the children are asleep.\n\nI am surprised that the Inspector has reported adversely on the services of certain staff agents. These agents have all been\nselected with great care, and I think it would be difficult to find workers with a wider experience and greater efficiency than Miss Warrener, the head matron, and Miss Northwood who is in charge of the laundry and bakery, and Miss Griffiths the boys' supervisor. Miss Warrener and Miss Northwood are not young, but their experience and efficiency should surely be worth a great deal in an institution of this sort. However, I am asking the Principal to furnish me with a specific recommendation with regard to the services of all the staff agents, and you may rest assured that where these are found to be below our standard requirements, remedial action will promptly be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nIndian Residential School Commission M.S.C.C.\n\nTHE MACKEY SCHOOL\n\nTHE PAS. MAN Nov., 26th., 1931,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe- Letter, #128-1-1\n\nIn answer to yours, of the 18th., instant, I beg to state:\n\nVentilation of Class rooms.\n\nIt is hardly possible to give mere ventilation, especially during the Winter Months; we must have storm windows, and in the class rooms, they have been made secure, with the exception of one, because of the cold, and to save breakages.\n\nRepeatedly have the teachers complained of the cold, and Miss Farrow, the Senior Teacher who has been here, for a number of years, states, that last Winter was the first time, she did not have to move her whole class into the dining room, to get to a part of the building that was sufficiently warm, to work in.\n\nThe Junior teacher, has had to take her classes, repeatedly into the dining room, because of cold. Her room being on the East side, makes it unbearably cold, when an East wind blows.\n\nThere are the warmer days, when the wind is not so strong, when the heat radiates more readily, and so warms up the building. Further, in the construction of the building, there is a large galvanised air chamber or passage, 2\u00bd ft., wide by 2 ft., deep, leading from front outer wall of the basement, into various parts of the interior, until it reaches the cupola, on the roof, which gives air circulation, into class rooms, dining room, dormitories, wash rooms, and halls.\n\nIt is the custom in this school, that as early in the spring time, as can be conveniently done, all storm windows, are taken off, and put back in the Autumn.\nLikewise there are the foul air exits, thus giving the necessary circulation.\n\nI do not see that we can improve on the present system, as in the summer time, all the windows are open there being screens replaced where the storm windows were taken from.\n\n**Cupboard in Junior class room.**\n\nI appreciate this suggestion very much, as it has been most inconvenient for the teacher in this room.\n\nThis we have brought to the notice of the Indian agent, but no action was taken, as in many other instances.\n\nAs this class room is used daily, except Saturday, and even then, has to serve as girls' play room, which it really is, it will be most convenient to have a built-in cupboard.\n\nI would suggest that a carpenter be asked to do this piece of work, the approximate cost of which would not be over $50.00, for material and labour.\n\n**The Dormitories.**\n\nApart from the windows opening out on to the veranda, which have to be made secure; we have three windows in each of the four dormitories, with a sliding sash, size, 12 X 16, in each window, which serve for ventilation likewise the fresh air inlet, and foul air exit, with similar in the halls and wash rooms.\n\nThe dormitories have a foul smell chiefly from the dreadful mattresses, we have to put up with.\n\nThe Mattresses used here, I am informed, were first used in the old Battleford Industrial School, and the beds also.\n\nThey are dreadfully foul, and should be burned; This I have repeatedly pointed out to Inspectors, Agents, Doctors, and other Officials, since taking over the Principalship of this School, and have requested for new ones, but it remains the same.\n\nI make request, Sir, that this very urgent need be attended to.\n\nI cannot see how children can rest on such beds, and mattresses, and keep healthy, as they are here.\nDoors leading to Fire escapes. These doors have to be kept locked, and your suggestion is the plan of action that has been followed; Two members of the Staff appointed to each of the four dormitories, with keys in their possession, to open doors leading to fire escapes.\n\nOccasional drills are had from dormitories, and at times during class work periods. The alarm is generally given, unknown to members of the staff and children.\n\nFurther, during the Winter Months, beginning Nov., 1st., to March, 31st., there is a night-watchman on duty.\n\nWe try to exercise the greatest of care to prevent fires, and also attention given for the safety of the children in case of a fire.\n\nWater. I am very pleased that some action has been taken, regarding the water, at this school.\n\nUp to the present no word has come to our notice, as to how soon the chlorinator is to be installed.\n\nI trust, before some serious outbreak of sickness results, because of the state of the water.\n\nThe engineer puts chloride in the water supply occasionally.\n\nJunior Class Room. Regarding the discipline in the junior class room, is quite true.\n\nMiss Payne does not seem to be able to handle the children in her class room, and further has no control over the bigger girls, when she has minor duties to perform with them.\n\nIt does not seem to be in her to command authority.\n\nShe does not seem capable to handle the position, which naturally affects the whole school. I am of the opinion, that a change, if the right person could be found, would be a move in the right direction.\n\nKitchen-Matron. Miss Spalding has improved in some ways, but seems very slow to see what is really required.\n\nApart from cleaning up, I do not think much is done, in instructing girls, in the art of cooking.\n\nWhile she is rather lax, and possibly incapable of instructing girls in the art of cooking, or preparing meals, nevertheless, she is a good Christian girl, and possibly she may yet turn out to a very capable, and earnest worker in her department.\n\nShe is young, but not foolish, and would like to give her another chance.\n\nThe Children are not suffering at all.\nit is more on the staff-table, that the service is lacking.\n\nThe Matron. I do not think a Matron's position is very easy, in the Indian Schools.\n\nWe have a very capable person in Miss Warrenner. But then all good things come to an end here on earth; and as far as I can judge, by what has taken place, quite a number of times, I have come to the conclusion, that she has lost to a great extent, the controle of the girls. She cannot handle them, and the girls know it.\n\nThe bigger girls become very unruly toward her, and even the smaller ones speak back very often.\n\nShe has not the ability to make them submit to her ruling. Miss Warrenner has done far more for the Indian children than will ever be recorded of her, and even now, she gives very attention to all their ailments, and readily sits up at night in attendance, over the sick, which is very important, especially where there is no nurse, and the Doctor's visits, few and far between.\n\nLaundry and Bakery. Truly Miss Northwood, the member in charge of this Department, has done a great work, and is still a good worker, but she has no controle over the girls. I would suggest a change.\n\nI am afraid she becomes very impatient, and nags at the girls, and upsets them, and then there is trouble.\n\nThis is a very important position, and much could be done in the way of instruction, in the laundry and Bakery, and requires someone that has a command over the big girls, that are allotted off for this kind of work.\n\nMale Supervisor. This would necessitate an extra member of the staff, which is really required, because, of the smaller boys, who need supervision during their hours of recreation.\n\nWere it possible, I would like to have a supervisor for the boys, whose duty would be to pay strict attention to the boys especially before and after school hours, providing we had equipment for physical and gymnastic exercises.\n\nI would suggest that the Night-watchman be an all-year position, during the five months in Winter, as night-watchman, and be a general help, during the other seven Months, with special attention given to the boys.\n\nTrusting that the above remarks will be of some service,\n\nI beg to remain sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nA. Fraser\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., NOVEMBER 30TH, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. A. G. Richardson, who is temporarily in charge of The Pas Agency, dealing with matters in connection with the Mackay Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Richardson states that numerous complaints have been received at the office regarding the food, but upon investigation it was found that plenty of good wholesome food is supplied. He states that the boys are constantly running away from school. This is well known to the Department; it has been brought to our attention so often, and apparently there is no change.\n\nThe Clerk states that the mattresses on nearly all the beds are worn out, and on some beds he found only blankets and sheets. This state of affairs should not exist.\n\nThe Clerk also says that new tables were installed last August, covered with battleship linoleum and cemented to the wood. He noticed that the linoleum is being pried off the boards, apparently with knives, and suggests that brass tape be put around the tables. Surely the Department did not allow them to put the linoleum on without binding of some kind. I am surprised that the Principal allowed the tables to be used before binding was put on. This should be attended to at once.\n\nApparently the school room is in bad shape. The plaster is giving way, and the interior requires a good coat of paint. This matter was reported to the Department a year ago, and I have inserted an item in the Estimates this year to cover same, but the work should have been done before now.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 2)\nThe roof of the school is reported to be in poor shape. This should not be allowed to stand as a great deal of destruction can take place by delaying a repair of this kind.\n\nThe floor is reported to be bulged in several places. It is just possible that this may have been caused by the roof leaking. However, I am not sure of this.\n\nMr. Richardson states that a male supervisor is badly required at this school. A male supervisor would be of very little use unless the school had a Principal who could direct, and I feel that we have not this in Mr. Fraser. I have not had good reports on this school for the past ten years, and it seems that there is no improvement.\n\nI think the Department should have the whole matter cleared up. You might read the reports that have been received during the past ten years, and I think you will agree with me that they have not been very encouraging.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M.

The management at this institution has been the subject of considerable correspondence with the church authorities and with the Principal direct. With the extra information contained in your letter, the Department is now in a position to make definite requests.\n\nThe necessary repairs and replacements to buildings and equipment are receiving attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, December 9, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of the 21st ultimo and to enquire if your Society is now prepared to make improvements in the staff at the MacKay Indian Residential School. The Department has received a special report from the Rev. Principal in this connection. It appears that Miss Payne's services should be discontinued as soon as possible. Miss Warriner, the matron, has given faithful service, as has Miss Northwood, in charge of the laundry and bakery; but their usefulness at the Mackay School is ended, as they cannot control the girls. I believe their services should be dispensed with in the very near future. Further, it appears that an extra man on the staff is really necessary. The Department wishes to know what steps you are taking in this important matter.\n\nI may say that the Department is arranging to provide new mattresses in the dormitories. The replacement of this type of equipment is generally a charge on the per capita grant, but, in the case of this school, the Department is prepared to meet one-half the cost. Please let me know, in a separate letter, if this will be satisfactory to your Society.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. H. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S C. G.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, December 9, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to conditions at the MacKay Indian Residential School. As you have been informed, the Department is taking steps to improve the equipment mentioned in your letter, and I write now to state that the services of certain members of the staff form the subject for communication to Dr. Westgate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. A. Fraser,\nPrincipal,\nMacKay Residential School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 9th inst. #128-1-1, re improvements in the staff at the Mackay Indian Residential School, and in reply beg to state that our Commission have already notified Miss Payne, the Junior Teacher, that her services will not be required after the end of this month, and have appointed Miss Anne Wright to take her place from the 1st of January next. Miss Wright is a fully qualified teacher, holding a Second Class Normal certificate in this country. She also holds the Oxford Senior certificate from England where she received special training in Kindergarten work. She is also a Girl Guide. Our Commission are hopeful that she will be a valuable addition to the staff. She is twenty-six years of age and is a keen disciplinarian.\n\nWith regard to the other staff agents you mention, namely, Miss Warrener and Miss Northwood, I beg to state that our Commission hope to be able to retain their services until mid-summer of next year. They are not convinced that these ladies are unable to control the girls, and to dismiss them at short notice, at a time like this when there is so much unemployment throughout this country, and they would both be obliged to return to England, would be to inflict a great hardship upon them, and one which existing conditions do not appear to justify. The Principal has already been notified that our Commission expect him and his staff to maintain the discipline of the school, and to operate it in such a way as to place it above criticism. They believe that by substituting Miss Wright for Miss Payne in the Junior class-room, that the existing staff will be able to achieve this result. At any rate, our\nCommission consider it but common justice to give them a fair trial, and you may rest assured that if the desired results are not obtained, steps will be taken promptly to obtain them.\n\nWith regard to the appointment of an extra man on the staff, I beg to state that at the present time four men agents are engaged - namely, the Principal, the Engineer, the Farm Instructor, and the Night Watchman. It is the opinion of our Commission that these are sufficient for a school with a pupilage of eighty. You will recall that on November 22nd. of last year, your Department was requested to increase the accommodation at this school, as well as at two of our other schools. In your reply of November 28th. #128-1-L, you stated that an increase in the pupilage could not be allowed, as the maximum accommodation available was for eighty. When accommodation has been provided for an increased pupilage, and there is an increased enrolment, our Commission will be able to meet the increased expenditure involved in the appointment of an additional man agent. Until then, they consider that those holding appointments at present should be sufficient.\n\nI trust the information set forth above may be sufficient to assure you that the matters to which you have referred are receiving our careful attention, and will continue to do so until every defect has been remedied, and the management placed on an unquestionably satisfactory basis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, December 16, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, regarding improvements in the staff at the MacKay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is noted that Miss Anne Wright has been appointed to succeed Miss Payne, the junior teacher, from the 1st of January, next. The qualifications which Miss Wright possesses have been noted. It is hoped that she will meet with success in her work and maintain proper discipline among the pupils under her charge.\n\nThe Department will approve of the retention of the services of Miss Warrener and Miss Northwood until midsummer of next year. It is hoped, however, that after that date your Commission will arrange for the appointment of two thoroughly competent women to take over their duties.\n\nRegarding the male members of the staff, I have to request that you will correspond with the Principal with a view to improving the supervision services. Some readjustment may be necessary in the duties of the men.\n\nThe Department is pleased to have assurance that any defects in management will receive attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.,\n39-43, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMcKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, C. of E., (Cont'd),\n\nthey are generally brought back the same day;\n\n3.- Also, that the children were not receiving sufficient food;\n\n4.- Further, to use some of the Indians' own words, \"the children eat at the table in the same way their fore-fathers did; with their fingers. They are not provided with knives and forks.\"\n\nI might say that I did not inspect the class rooms, as a representative from the Ninette Sanitorium was at the school that day examining the children, and consequently the class-rooms were closed. I noted, however, that a new teacher was in charge of the senior class-room, Miss Wright, who replaced Miss Payne, and I am satisfied that the new teacher is well qualified and maintains strict discipline in her class-room.\n\nThe children were well-dressed and I looked through all the clothing, and consider that the school is supplying them with all the clothing they require, and in this respect McKay School compares very favourably with any of the other boarding schools.\n\nI arrived at the school shortly before noon and was in the dining room while the children were having lunch. I found that the food, both in quantity and quality was just as good as at the average boarding school, and the school authorities had no chance to change the menu for that day as preparations would be well under way when I arrived. For this noon meal they had meat, potatoes, and carrots, with thick gravy, bread, bread-pudding and tea. The food was served in ample quantities to satisfy the needs of the children. On enquiring into the other meals, I came to the conclusion that there was no room for complaint as far as the food was concerned, and the children presented a healthy appearance.\n\nAs to the children eating with their fingers instead of\ninstead of using knives and forks, this is true. It can be explained, however, by the fact that the children are in the habit of taking their knives, forks and spoons away from the table and breaking them, and the matron informed me that it was practically impossible to keep them supplied with these articles.\n\nAfter going through the school and talking to the different members of the staff, I came to the conclusion that considerable friction exists between the members of the staff and principal. The Rev. Mr. Fraser, the Principal, is a man of whom I have a very high opinion. He has been in his present position for two years, and has been in the North country practically all his life, and is considered to be one of the most outstanding missionaries in that part of the country. I feel quite confident that he is putting forth his best efforts to manage the school properly, and has succeeded in bringing about a great many changes in the outside work by raising stock and seeing that a good garden is maintained for the school. However, I came to the conclusion that with the present staff the school will never function properly. In the first place some of the members of the staff have been at the school too long and I do not think they are even loyal to Mr. Fraser. The members referred to are the Matron, Miss Warner and Miss Northwood. They have been in the Indian work for a great number of years, and may be splendid women, but they are getting too old to look after the work at this school, and from my observations, have absolutely no authority over the children. Mr. Turner the engineer does not appear to be very helpful to the Principal.\n\nAs you will recall Mr. Turner was in charge of the school for a couple of years and I do not think there was very much discipline during that time. His successor, who preceded Mr. Fraser, was no better, and during these three years the children\nMcKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, C. of E., (Cont'd),\u2014\n\ndid just about what they liked, with the result that the older boys and girls are now very hard to manage.\n\nI had a long conversation with Mr. Fraser and he admitted that a change would have to be made in the staff and informed me that the Church authorities had given him to understand that a change would be made after the summer holidays. The staff mentioned by me might fill in at some other schools to better advantage, but they are certainly out of place in their present positions, and having lost control of the children, it is impossible for them to regain the prestige they should have over them. I am of the opinion that with a proper staff Mr. Fraser should show splendid results.\n\nThe building itself is in a fair state of repair, and outside of a little painting, fixing of plaster here and there, and other minor things, very little repairing is required. New mattresses have been furnished by the Department for several of the beds, and I have been informed that new springs are to be furnished also at the beginning of the next fiscal year. These springs are urgently required, as a great many of those now in use are tied up with wire and string, and are not fit to put the new mattresses on.\n\nThe fire escapes, extinguishers, etc., were all in good shape, but the doors leading to the fire escapes were padlocked. Instructions were sent out to all Principals of schools to leave the doors leading to fire escapes unlocked and I immediately brought this to the attention of Mr. Fraser, who informed me that if the doors were left unlocked several boys and girls would go out during the night, and boys from the Reserve would come into the girls' dormitory. The key to the door is in a glass cage alongside the door, and this cage is sealed. In case of fire the glass is to be broken\n\nand the key\nMcKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, C. of E., (Cont'd),-\n\nand the key removed. At this school there is no way of fixing the exit through the supervisor's room, and if a room were built for the supervisor in the present dormitory it would take up too much space. Under the present arrangement there is a wall between the dormitory and the supervisor's room, with a window cut in this wall, about three feet from the floor. To get from the supervisor's room to the dormitory it is necessary to either go through the window, or out into the hall and into the dormitory through another door. A night watchman is employed at the school, who makes the round of the buildings during the night, and keeps the fire going. Fire drill is held periodically, according to instructions.\n\nThe outside buildings are all in a fair state of repair.\n\nThe stock is well cared for, and at present they have thirteen (13) cows and five (5) fairly good horses. The boys milk the cows, but so far the girls have not been taught to do this. I pointed out to the Principal that according to instructions sent to Residential Schools, the older girls are to be taught to milk and do gardening.\n\nThe school, I understand, had an excellent garden last year and they have a sufficient quantity of potatoes and other vegetables to carry them over until the new crop is obtained.\n\nAs I have mentioned above, the children looked very healthy, and at the time of my visit there was no sickness in this school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMcKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, C. of E.,\u2014\n\nThis school is situated six miles from The Pas.\n\nAt the time of my inspection there were 86 children in residence.\n\nBefore visiting this school, the following complaints had been presented to me:\n\n1.- That the children were poorly clad;\n2.- That there was a great deal of truancy:\n   Both boys and girls were continually running away, usually to the Reserve, which is between the school and The Pas, and\n\nthey are generally\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., MARCH 3RD, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a report of an inspection made by Mr. Christianson at the Moose Lake Indian Day School and Mackay Indian Residential School, The Bas Agency.\n\nMoose Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI know little about the arrangements between the Department and the Manitoba Government regarding the management of this school, or who pays Mr. Lumb's salary and what authority this Department have to go in and give instructions to the teacher. It is also not known who is responsible for the upkeep of the school. You will note that a stove is badly needed. Whether this is to be supplied by the Manitoba Government or the Department, I do not know. Evidently the school and desks are in bad repair.\n\nMackay Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will notice that the Indians have made the usual complaints about their children not being properly fed and clothed. This matter has been thoroughly investigated and was found not to be the case. I believe they are receiving all the food and clothing they require. However, there is no excuse whatever for the children eating their food with their fingers on account of not having knives and forks, and the excuse offered by the Principal is one which should not be accepted. It does not speak well for the discipline of the school if the Principal and staff cannot control this matter by seeing that knives and forks are supplied.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMackay Indian Residential School (Cont'd.)\n\nI note there is friction between the Principal and his staff. It is probably true that the Principal has not had proper support from his staff; I do not know whether he has made requests to have the inefficient members of his staff replaced or not, or whether this is a matter which is only brought up when an Inspector goes to The Pas. If the staff is as bad as reported, it seems to me the Principal should have insisted on a change being made, rather than allow conditions to go on as they are. The fact that the property has been allowed to depreciate through leaky roofs, and the tables destroyed, does not lead me to believe that the Principal has very much control over matters. It seems to me he should have sufficient authority and influence to see that neglect of this kind is not tolerated. The engineer is reported by the Inspector as not being very helpful. I do not know whether Mr. Fraser has asked for his removal or not. If he has not, he should have. There is no record of anything here.\n\nWith regard to the fire escapes, on your instructions I sent out word that no doors leading to the fire escapes were to be padlocked. The Inspector reports that the doors at this school are kept locked, and that the keys are kept in a small glass box beside the door. This may meet the requirements, but I doubt it very much. However, the Principal should have carried out instructions and then taken the case up for further consideration. I do not think the present arrangements are safe or satisfactory. I am still of the opinion that we should have a room at one end of the dormitory with a door through it as a means of exit to the fire escape. This room could be made of beaver board at very little cost. However, if the Department are satisfied with the present arrangements, there is nothing more to say.\n\nThere is another matter mentioned regarding which repeated instructions have been issued by the Department, I believe, and also by this office. You will notice that cows are not being milked by the girls at this school. It does not say much for the training of a girl who has been at school for ten years, and cannot milk cows.\n\nIt seems\nMackay Indian Residential School (Contd.)\n\nIt seems superfluous to keep on repeating, but all I can say is that if these girls are not taught to milk cows while at school, they are not going to learn after they leave.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWm. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, March 11, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMr. Inspector Christianson, who recently visited the MacKay Indian Residential School, states that he found the children were eating their food with their fingers instead of using knives and forks. The Inspector states that this can be explained by the fact that the children are in the habit of taking their knives, forks, and spoons away from the table and breaking them.\n\nThe Department considers that there is something wrong with the discipline when the children are allowed to destroy the table equipment. I have, therefore, to request that you will take early action to see that an adequate supply of cutlery is furnished and that same is properly looked after and not damaged by the pupils. If proper discipline is exercised, there should be no further complaint from this source.\n\nIt has also been drawn to the attention of the Department that the older girl pupils receive no instruction in the milking of cows. As this is considered an important part of the girls' training, I have to request that you will arrange that they are given an opportunity to learn to milk. You should also see that proper oversight is kept of the girls during the milking period.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to hear as to the action taken regarding the providing and use of knives, forks and spoons by the pupils during their meals, and also regarding the steps you are taking to see that the girls are given a full opportunity to learn to milk.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that the children are well fed and clothed; that the stock is kept in good condition and that a good garden is maintained for the use of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

MAN March 18th, 1932\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa,\nCanada,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 128-1-1, dated March 11th, 1932, re-cutlery for children of the MacKay Residential School.\n\nI beg to state that during the past 18 months, every child sitting down to a meal has had the use of table-spoon, table-knife, and fork, as was necessary, for which purpose an adequate number are on hand.\n\nI take exception to the remarks of Inspector Christiansen, as I made an explanation to him when he visited the MacKay School, and showed him some broken and twisted cutlery. I have kept almost two years and explained our present method of dealing with the children, which has prevented further damage to the table cutlery, and which is bringing about the desired effect.\n\nThe Inspector was with us during the mid-day only; I understand he got his information from an Indian Meeting, and to see for himself, I invited him into the dining-room, when the children were assembling for their mid-day meal, nor did I inform any person of my intention, so that the Inspector would find things as they usually are.\n\nSome of the children are so grounded in their home habits and customs, which makes it hard drilling to teach them otherwise, and one of these habits is taking food with their fingers, even though they have the necessary cutlery, which practice is very common in all their homes.\n\nRe-Milking:\nGirls are being taught the necessity of keeping all the utensils used in the dairy clean, and also the art of making butter. As to the actual milking, we have not up to the present adopted, as the boys along with the Farmer do this work.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Fraser\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 23, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the supply of cutlery for the use of the pupils of the MacKay Indian Residential School. In this connection the Department is pleased to note that there is a sufficient supply of table cutlery in use at each meal. The staff should use every effort to see that the children make proper use of the various articles of cutlery during meals.\n\nRegarding the elder girl pupils receiving instruction in the milking of cows, I have to say it is noted that, while the girls are taught the necessity of keeping all the utensils used in the dairy clean and also the art of making butter, they receive no actual experience in milking. As this is considered an important part of a girl's training, I have to request that you will arrange, as soon as possible, to see that they are given an opportunity to learn to milk. Further, you should see that this is done under proper supervision. The Department expects that this matter will receive the attention of yourself and the staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Fraser,\nPrincipal,\nMacKay Indian Residential School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received from the Rev. A. Fraser, Principal of our Mackay Indian Residential School, copies of your letters of March 11th and March 23rd, #128-1-1, addressed to him and have submitted the same to our Commission for their consideration.\n\nIn connection with the direction you gave to the Rev. Principal Fraser with regard to the teaching of the older girls how to milk cows, I beg to state that I addressed a circular to the Principals of all of our Society's Schools, and requested them to give this matter careful consideration and attention.\n\nFrom the replies which have been received to this circular letter, it is apparent that a very considerable difference of opinion exists amongst the Principals as to the value of this branch of instruction. For your information I should like to quote the following comments which have been made in this connection.\n\nThe Rev. Principal Grant of our Carcross School writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"With regard to the girls of this school learning to milk, all of us feel that such instruction would have no value at all, for no Indian that I know of in the Yukon goes in for dairying. Even though the boys here do what milking there is to do, and this practice has been followed for some years, yet we cannot recall a single case in which such instruction has helped them to earn their livelihood after leaving school. Owing to climatic conditions it is not likely...\"\n\"that the Yukon will ever be suitable for farming activities. Gardening on a small scale is resorted to, but not with any success by the natives, especially in the southern part.\"\n\nThe Rev. Principal Middleton of our Blood School writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The aim of St. Paul's' has always been; that any girl on graduation can speak good English and is well versed in the Provincial Curriculum; make a bed; care for a sick patient; prepare a good meal and set a table properly; make, mend and sew their own clothes; keep a house clean and look after children; wash clothes, and conduct herself properly.\n\nTo add milking to this is simply a work of super-erogation. On the Reserve there are literally dozens and dozens of old school boys who have no cows to milk and again there are dozens of farmers who from sheer indifference and lack of interest will not keep a milk cow on their farms.\n\nI consider with many years of experience that the time spent in teaching Blood Indian girls to milk cows could be more profitably spent in other branches of education.\"\n\nThe Rev. Principal Vale of our Chapleau School writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Replying to your letter with regard to the girls being taught to milk cows, I beg to state it would be very awkward to carry out this suggestion for several reasons ............ My experience covers very nearly twenty-five years, and in all that time I have found very few cases where Indian girls had to milk cows on their return to their homes. I have actually heard of three and those only. In each case they were soon able to learn it, and so no real lack was felt. Some girls are far too nervous to approach a cow and it would require a great deal of time to accomplish the task, if ever.\"\nIn the light of the above statements, our Commission are of the opinion that the amount of stress to be laid on this branch of education might safely be left in the hands of the Principals of the respective schools. In the schools which are located in farming districts, this branch of education may have some value, but it can hardly have sufficient value in the schools which are located in the remoter parts of the country to necessitate its inclusion in the curriculum of instruction for the girl pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nAugust 2, 1932\n\nMR.

C., under whose auspices the school is conducted, requesting him to take the necessary action with a view to making a change in the farm instructor at this school.

He states that he visited the school and, upon inquiry into the complaint, found that Mr. White had struck a boy on the arm with a shovel for no real reason. He recommends that Mr. White be removed from the school as he considers him unsuitable to work with the boys.\n\nThe Department believes that there should be a change made in the farm instructor at this school and I should be pleased if you would give the matter your attention with a view to making a change. I shall be pleased to hear from you of the action taken in this regard, stating the name and qualifications of the man engaged for the position to replace Mr. White.\n\nWe are informing the Acting Indian Agent that this matter has been referred to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Turner.\n\nA. Fraser, Principal.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 1st instant, No. 128-1-1, setting forth the information you had received from the Acting Indian Agent at The Pas, Man., with regard to the conduct of Mr. White the Farm Instructor at the Mackay School, and expressing the opinion that he should be replaced by someone else. For your information I beg to state that on August 26th, the Rev. Principal Fraser of the Mackay School, reported to our Commission that Mr. White the Farm Instructor had struck one of the boys (Peter Lathlin) and that the boy had run away from the school. Immediately after receiving this letter I wrote to the Principal for a fuller statement in connection with the same, and enclosed herewith you will find a copy of the statement received, signed by Mr. White the Farm Instructor, by Mr. Turner the Engineer, and by Mr. Fraser the Principal. According to this statement it would appear that the boy was wilfully disobedient, his disobedience amounting practically to defiance, but even with the undoubted provocation this gave, Mr. White was not justified in striking the boy, as the instructions he received, at the time of his appointment, clearly insisted that corporal punishment or chastisement, when considered necessary, must be administered by the Principal only, as he is the official guardian of the children during the time they are in residence at the school.\n\nLast month this school was visited by Col. Mermagen, the Assistant Secretary-Treasurer of our Commission, and he reported very highly the diligence and efficiency of Mr. White's services. As I have already written to the Principal instructing him to inform Mr. White and the other staff agents that the ruling of the Commission with regard to the punishment of children must be strictly observed, and in view of the fact that Mr. White has\nrendered such excellent service over a period of many years, I trust that your Department may agree to allow him to remain at the Mackay School, until the Commission are able to arrange for him to be transferred to some other school. Our Commission will meet on the 13th instant, when all the correspondence bearing on the matter will be considered. At that meeting I will recommend that Mr. White be transferred as soon as a suitable vacancy is available.\n\nTrusting that this may meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 2)\nOttawa, September 12, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the conduct of the farm instructor at the MacKay Indian Residential School and the request that he be allowed to remain until your Commission is able to arrange for his transfer.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is considered that it would be in the best interests of the school if your Commission will take early steps to have this arrangement carried out. As his services are unsatisfactory at the MacKay School, it is doubtful if it would be advisable to have him placed at another school. I shall be pleased if the appointment of a competent man as farm instructor to succeed Mr. White is made at the early convenience of your Commission. The local Indian Agent is being informed that Mr. White is to remain until a successor is appointed.\n\nPlease advise the Department later regarding this matter, and, when the new farm instructor is appointed, I shall be pleased to receive particulars as to his qualifications and experience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

In a communication received from the Field Secretary, M. S. C. C., Winnipeg, under whose auspices the school is conducted, he requests that Mr. White be allowed to remain at the school until the Commission is able to arrange for his transfer to some other school. He stated that the question of the farm instructor's transfer would be considered at an early date. Please advise the Principal of the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nSamuel Lovell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe - Farm Instructor Mackay School.\n\nIn reply to your letter of Sept. 12th, #128-1-1, I beg to state that at a meeting of our Commission held on the 13th instant, it was decided to terminate the appointment of Mr. White who holds the position of Farm Instructor at the Mackay Indian Residential School, at the end of October next. Our Commission have not yet offered this position to another man, but they fully expect to be able to secure one with all the qualifications required before the end of October. I note from the closing paragraph of your letter that you desire to receive particulars as to the qualifications and experience of the man who receives the appointment to the position in question, and in due course will furnish you with the same. I have no recollection of receiving a similar request in the past from your Department, except in the case of Principals and Engineers, and as all our agents are selected with the greatest care, I should like you to feel assured that every effort will be made on our part to secure a man who will measure up to the full standard of your Department and of our Society.\n\nWith regard to Mr. White who is being dismissed, I beg to state that few staff agents have given our Commission better service. He is an indefatigable and efficient worker, and it is only during recent months that he had allowed himself to get out of patience with some of the bigger boys. Some of the bigger Indian boys, and especially those recruited from the districts around the Mackay School, are not easily managed, and while Mr. White is being dismissed, for violating one of the rules of the Commission which forbids any staff agent, except the Principal, to administer corporal punishment, our Commission feel that in view of the excellent services he has rendered, he should be given another chance next year at some other school,\nshould he desire to return to the Indian School work after a period of about six months enforced absence, which is about to be imposed upon him. Mr. White is the son of Canon White of High Prairie, Alberta, one of the veteran missionaries of our Society, and a younger brother has been working very satisfactorily for some time on the staff of our Shingwauk Home. Our Commission feel that it would not be quite fair to Mr. White to completely debar him from further service of the kind in which he has been engaged, simply on account of one transgression, and they trust that your Department, after receiving the information set forth in this letter, may take the same view of the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, September 21, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department that it has been decided by Your Commission to terminate the services of Mr. White, farm instructor at the Mackay Indian Residential School, as from the end of October, next.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be able to obtain the services of a fully qualified man to succeed Mr. White. The Department will rest assured that the man engaged by your Commission as farm instructor will be fully qualified and that he measures up to the required standard. It will not be necessary to furnish particulars regarding his qualifications, but I should be pleased to be informed of the name of the man who has been engaged.\n\nThere would be no objections to the re-engagement of Mr. White at one of the other schools conducted under the auspices of the M.S.C.G., and if there is a vacancy in the near future the Department would approve of his appointment. It is thought that, upon his re-engagement, if you inform him definitely of the rule which forbids any staff agent, except the Principal, to administer punishment, there would be no further cause for complaint in his case. The Department does not wish to penalize this man, but considers that it was in the best interests of the Mackay School that there be a change in his case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\nWinnipeg, Man. September 21, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPursuant to your letters dated Sept. 1st. and 12th., No.128-1-1, and my replies to the same dated Sept. 6th. and 15th., re the Farm Instructor at the Mackay School, I beg to say that I have consulted our Head office in Toronto on the principle governing the selection, including qualifications, and appointment of agents on the staffs of Indian Residential Schools, and administered or owned by the Church, and I am instructed to the effect that, under the terms of the agreement arrived at between the Honourable, the Superintendent General and the several Churches, the Principal is the only agent the approval of whose qualifications and appointment is reserved to the Department, and that, in all other cases, the Church of England must continue in the future, as in the past, to exercise full authority and control. Our Head office states that modifications in this practice could only be brought about as the result of a further conference and an agreement which would apply to each and all of the Churches concerned.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOCT 11 1932\n\nCANADA\n\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nOctober 5th, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Williams:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the McKay Indian Residential School, The Pas Agency, inspected on Monday, September 12th, 1932.\n\nThe junior room is in charge of Miss Wright who is a new teacher on the staff since my last visit. Miss Wright is a qualified teacher with several years experience and her services to date are very satisfactory. The roll calls for 33 pupils, who are arranged in the following grades:\n\n| Grade | Pupils |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 18     |\n| 2     | 15     |\n|       | 33     |\n\nThe discipline is the best I have ever found it in the junior room, and the children are brighter and more alert. I think if Miss Wright remains in charge, a big change will be noticeable by the end of the year. The room was well aired, tidy, and clean. The children were neatly dressed and clean in appearance.\n\nThe senior room is in charge of Miss Farrow who has been on the staff for a number of years. Miss Farrow is a qualified teacher, uses good methods in her work, but finds difficulty in the administration of discipline. The roll calls for 47 pupils, the grades being arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Pupils |\n|-------|--------|\n| 3     | 9      |\n| 4     | 7      |\n| 5     | 7      |\n| 6     | 10     |\n| 7     | 10     |\n| 8     | 4      |\n|       | 47     |\n\nA. S. Williams, Esq.,\nActg. Deputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 2)\nThe children appear fairly well along in their grades, but there is little, if any, improvement in the way in which they read or answer oral questions. Miss Farrow has had no success in having the children speak out, and it is almost impossible to hear them when standing only a few feet away.\n\nThe boys were dressed in overalls and shirts, some of which were rather ragged and untidy. The girls were neatly dressed and clean.\n\nThe burlap around the lower part of the classroom is broken in places and the plaster has been knocked off. This part of the wall has been repaired from time to time, but I think the only way to permanently fix it would be to put V-Joint on to the height of the burlap, which is about four feet.\n\nAlthough Miss Farrow, the teacher, is conscientious, I do not feel that any outstanding progress is being made by the pupils.\n\nThe kitchen work is in charge of Miss Spaulding who I have before reported on as being incapable of handling this position. Miss Spaulding is certainly not a cook, and this fact is realized by the girls over whom she has charge. I consider that much of the food is wasted, because of the fact that it is not properly prepared. These remarks apply to the staff meals as well as those supplied to the children. The following is the general menu served to the children:\n\n- **Breakfast** - Porridge with milk, Bread, Lard, Tea.\n- **Recess** - Slice of bread.\n- **Dinner** - Stew with vegetables or meat pie, roast or fish. Potatoes, Bread, Water.\n- **Supper** - Milk Pudding or stewed fruit or jam, Bread, Lard, either bannock or cake, Tea.\nMcKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nIt will be noted that for the noon meal no butter or lard is served, and the children receive only water to drink. Desserts of any kind are not served at this meal. The supper meal appears rather light in view of what they receive for dinner, namely, a dessert with bread, cake or bannock and tea to drink.\n\nMiss Fraser is in charge of the sewing room and acts as girls' supervisor. There is only one sewing machine in working condition, and Mr. Fraser pointed out that it was practically impossible to do the necessary sewing on the one machine. A new sewing machine should be provided in order that the work may be kept up to date.\n\nI would point out that during a recent visit of the T.B. Clinic, on which a report was submitted to Mr. Lovell of their findings, Miss Fraser was reported as having active tuberculosis of the lungs. This was brought to the attention of Mr. Fraser, her father, but I understand he considered she could quite well look after herself and also carry on her duties as girls' supervisor. Personally, I do not agree with Mr. Fraser in this respect, and for the sake of his own daughter, I do not think she should be allowed to remain on the staff of the school.\n\nMiss Vincent is in charge of the laundry and bake ovens. Her work in the laundry appears quite satisfactory, but she is certainly unable to handle the other Department.\n\nMiss Griffiths acts as boys' matron and looks after their clothing as well as the boys' dormitories. I found the dormitories clean and tidy. A number of the bed springs are entirely useless and should be discarded as they are past any further repairing. I might say these beds and springs are some which\nMcKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nSome which were brought down from the old Battleford Industrial School and have served in an institution for many years.\n\nThe toilets, especially in the girls' dormitories, were very offensive and certainly have not been properly looked after. I pointed this out to both Mr. Fraser and the Matron as there is no reason why these cannot be kept clean, and the ones in the dormitories should certainly receive special attention. The bathtubs were also dirty and had not been looked after since last being in use.\n\nThe hospital room is equipped with a homemade bed. A proper hospital bed should be provided. I found that one of the pupils from this school had been placed in St. Anthony Hospital to receive treatment because of some infectious skin disease. I took this up with the Principal, and pointed out that I felt the child could quite well have been cared for at school and isolated in the hospital ward. At times such as these, I am afraid the school authorities are only too willing to place the children in the hospital for treatment.\n\nThe fire escapes are all in good condition, and there is one fire extinguisher on each floor. I think it would be well if three new fire extinguishers were supplied in order that there might be one in each wing of the building. The Principal complained about being unable to keep a water pressure sufficient to be of much use in case of fire, but I am inclined to think that sufficient pressure could be obtained if this matter was carefully looked after. The pressure tanks are new and there is no reason why they will not stand the required pressure.\n\nThe boys'\nMcKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe boys' playroom is in the basement, and although there are steam pipes for heating purposes, this place is too cold during the winter months. Mr. Fraser intimated that it would be necessary to place a stove in the room in order to make it comfortable for the boys. This arrangement will add greatly to the risk of fire unless a chimney is erected on the outside of the school and this would entail considerable expense. It might be possible to add sufficient sections to the radiators to supply more heat.\n\nSince my last inspection Miss Schennells has been appointed Matron of the school. She is a graduate nurse and should render good service.\n\nMr. Turner, who for many years has acted as engineer and gardener, retired on the 30th of September. He has rendered excellent service all through the nineteen years he has been employed at the school, and the Department should see that a proper engineer and mechanic is placed in charge of the building at once. There is a lot of machinery in connection with the plant and only a competent man should be placed in charge. A chlorinating plant has been installed since my last inspection, costing over $1500.00, and new batteries and switchboard are now being installed, which will cost in the neighbourhood of $900.00. Mr. Fraser intimated that he would like to have his son take charge of this Department, but frankly I do not consider that he is capable of the task, and trust the Department will not sanction any such appointment. This is a matter which should receive immediate attention before some serious break occurs which might run into several hundred dollars.\n\nThe Farmer.\nMcKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe Farmer, Mr. White, was away with some of the boys cutting hay at the time of my visit. Mr. Fraser assured me there would be no shortage of feed as there is abundance of hay to be secured. I found the yards more tidy than at any other time I have visited this school, and the barns were clean. The cattle have greatly improved during the past two years, and with continued care, a fair herd of milk cows will be obtained.\n\nSplendid returns were obtained from the garden which contained all kinds of vegetables. The potato crop will not meet their requirements, but these can be purchased locally for around 50\u00a2 per bushel. The vegetables will be stored in a homemade storehouse, which was erected last year, and I received no complaints in regard to it not being satisfactory.\n\nI am glad to be able to report an improvement in connection with the staff at this school, and with a proper cook in charge of the kitchen, conditions should be much better.\n\nMr. Fraser, the Principal, I think, realizes the weak places in connection with his staff and administration. He is, however, inclined to want too many of his own family on the staff which policy I do not consider good, and it certainly does not always tend to render efficient service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nOttawa, October 13, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton, of Winnipeg, in a report on his recent inspection of the MacKay Indian Residential School, The Pas, has drawn attention to the services of certain members of the staff.\n\nWith reference to Miss Farrow, teacher of the senior room, the Inspector states that, although she is a qualified teacher, she finds difficulty in the administering of discipline; that the children appear fairly well along in their grades but there is little, if any, improvement in the way they read or answer oral questions. He reports that Miss Farrow has had no success in having the children speak out and it is almost impossible to hear them when standing only a few feet away.\n\nRegarding Miss Spaulding, who has charge of the kitchen work, the Inspector reports as follows: \"She is incapable of handling this position and is certainly not a cook and this fact is realized by the girls over whom she has charge. I consider that much of the food is wasted because of the fact that it is not properly prepared. These remarks apply to the staff meals as well as those supplied to the children.\"\n\nConcerning Miss Fraser, who is in charge of the sewing room and acts as girls' supervisor, the Inspector states: \"I would point out that, during a recent visit of the T. B. Clinic, on which a report of their findings was submitted to the Indian Agent, Miss Fraser was reported as having active tuberculosis of the lungs. This was brought to the attention of Mr. Fraser, her father, but I understand he considered she could quite well look after herself and also carry on her duties.\"\n\nThe Inspector reports that Mr. Turner, who for many years acted as engineer and gardener, retired on the 30th ultimo. He requests that steps be taken to see that a proper engineer-mechanic is placed in charge at once. There is considerable machinery in\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nconnection with the school and only a competent man should be placed in charge. A new chlorinating plant has been recently installed and new batteries and switch board are now being provided. The Inspector stated that Mr. Fraser intimated he would like to have his son take charge of this department but the Inspector did not consider that he was capable to perform the duties.\n\nThe Department would request that your Commission take early steps to appoint a competent man as engineer and mechanic. This is a matter which should receive immediate attention, before some serious break occurs in equipment. We will not be prepared to approve of the appointment of Mr. Fraser's son.\n\nWith reference to Miss Fraser, it is considered that she should be relieved of her duties as girls' supervisor, both in the interests of her health and that of the pupils. As she is tubercular, there would be a certain danger to the pupils from her associating with them. I would request that your Commission also give the matter of the appointment of a successor to Miss Fraser serious consideration.\n\nFurther, it would be advisable to make a change in securing the services of a new cook to replace Miss Spaulding.\n\nIt is considered that it would not tend to efficient service to have several members of the Principal's family on the staff.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear, later, what action your Commission takes in regard to the appointment of a competent staff at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, October 14, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11 of the 5th instant, submitting a report on your inspection on the 12th ultimo of the Mackay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department is taking up with Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, M.S.C.O., Winnipeg, under whose auspices this school is conducted, the matter of an improvement in the staff, with special reference to Miss Spaulding, who has charge of the kitchen work; Miss Fraser, girls' supervisor, and the appointment of a competent man as engineer-mechanic.\n\nA sewing machine is being ordered to be forwarded to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, #128-1-1 re MacKay School at The Pas, Manitoba, and beg to report as follows:\n\nRe - Miss Farrow. The Commission have previously had no adverse reports upon this agent, and we were under the impression that her services were fully satisfactory.\n\nRe - Miss Spalding. A change has already been made by the Commission, and this agent has been replaced by Miss D. Matthews who gave satisfactory service to the Commission at their Lac la Ronge School.\n\nRe - Miss Fraser. Inspector Hamilton's remarks in this connection also came as a surprise.\n\nRe - Engineer. The Commission have already dealt with this question, and have recently appointed Mr. H. Bicknell who comes to them with most satisfactory references.\n\nA meeting of the Staff Committee will consider all the points raised in your communication at a meeting to be held early in November, after which a further communication will be addressed to your office.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secy-Treas.\nIndian Residential School Commission.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nWinnipeg, Man., November 26, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of October 15th. #128-1-1 and the reply despatched to you from this office on October 17th., I beg to state that at the request of our Commission I visited the Mackay School on the 15th. and 16th. of this month in order that I might secure on the spot further information about the matters touched on in your letter. In this connection I beg to report as follows:\n\n(1) With regard to the services of Miss Farrow, the Teacher of the Senior room, I beg to state that I directed her attention to the Inspector's Report with regard to the difficulty in maintaining discipline, and lack of success in having the children speak out distinctly. So far as the question of discipline is concerned, neither the Principal nor Miss Farrow herself had any recollection of any serious difficulty. Miss Farrow is rather small of stature, but she is an experienced and very competent teacher, and her past record appears to me to fully justify her continuance in her present office.\n\nWith regard to lack of success in having the children speak out, I can only say that when I asked them to read, they read quite distinctly and they answered my questions sufficiently audibly to be heard from any part of the classroom. The teacher admitted that when the Inspector was there, the children disappointed her in this matter, but after she had explained to them how their conduct would reflect adversely on her ability, they showed a marked improvement.\n\n(2) With regard to Miss Fraser, the Girls' Supervisor, I beg to state that during my visit I gave special attention to the report you had received that she had active tuberculosis of the lungs, and reached the conclusion that the\nreport you received was drafted and despatched to you before the ultimate findings of the T.B. Clinic were known. These findings are set forth in the following letter written by Dr. D. A. Stewart, Medical Superintendent of the Sanatorium at Ninette, Manitoba, who was in charge of the Clinic, and who wrote to Dr. Stephenson of The Pas, Man., on October 28th, 1932:\n\n\"Many thanks for your plates of Lillian Fraser. It seems to us from a comparison of these two plates that there is a little improvement. We found something last winter in both sides. The new plate shows very little on the right side, but not far from the same on the left. I rather think that whatever trouble there is is receding, and likely will go on improving.\n\nLast March when she was examined there were no symptoms, and I presume there are none now. I think she should carry on with her present work. I don't think there is any great danger of her infecting others. She should have a plate again in six months or so, and we may possibly be there to do it. An Indian reserve and an Indian school are so full of infection that one with no symptoms and as little in the plate as Miss Fraser has should be all right - indeed I think I would be inclined, if she was without symptoms, to let her teach even in an ordinary school which has not got so much infection in it. We would be glad to know how she gets on. In the meantime if you don't mind, perhaps we will hold the plate you sent with the one we have and when future plates are taken, we will have both of these for comparison.\"\n\nIn the light of the information set forth in the above letter, I could see no reason why Miss Fraser should not continue to discharge the duties of the office to which she had been appointed by our Commission, and I authorized her to do so, subject to the approval of our Commission, and subject to the result of another X-Ray examination at the time indicated. Miss Fraser appeared to me to be in very good health, and she herself and her father who is the Principal, assured me that she had not been absent from duty on account of ill health, and that she had never found her duties beyond her strength.\n\nWith regard to the Engineership, I beg to inform you that this position is filled by a man who is fully competent to look after all the equipment in that department. He filled the engineership for over a year at the Indian School at Brandon. I am not certain as to whether he will remain in the work permanently, but should he sever his connection with the same, you\nmay rest assured that our Commission will secure a fully competent man to take his place.\n\nI regret that I was unable to see the Acting Indian Agent, Mr. Lovell, but when I called at the Agency I met his assistant, and took up with him certain matters relating to repairs and equipment which seemed to me to require immediate attention. As the Indian Agent will, no doubt, communicate with you direct with regard to these, I feel that I need not do more than tabulate the principal items which are as follows:\n\n1. re-shingling of the roof of the main school building.\n2. plastering and painting of the interior,\n3. building of a porch over the boys' entrance, as the prevailing winds strike on that part, and I know of no other means of helping to keep out the severe cold.\n4. the building of a partition at the head of the stairs on the boys' side of the building.\n5. improving the steps installed to take the place of the pole fire escape.\n6. some new bed springs.\n\nThe following new buildings are also greatly needed at this institution:\n\n- stock barn - cattle shed - ice house - root house.\n\nThe school management have made a temporary root house which they are using this winter, but it is not satisfactory as a permanent structure. The ice house now in use might be altered so as to make it serviceable which it certainly is not at present.\n\nFor some years past the attention of your Department has been directed in the comprehensive list submitted of the requirements at all of our Society's Schools, to the necessity of having a recreation room for the girls. At this school they have none at present, and are obliged to use the Junior class-room for this purpose. The lack of a recreation room imposes an additional strain upon the school management which is not fair either to them or to the children. Our Society has been asking for some time that, at this and other schools, a detached class-room be built, with space and equipment for manual training in\nthe basement of the same. If your Department will carefully consider this need, and take steps to supply the same, you will confer a great benefit on the school, and relieve the school management of one of the heaviest handicaps under which the work at this institution is being carried on at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the services of certain members of the staff at the Mackay Indian Residential School. It is noted that you recently visited this school and enquired into the services of the various members of the staff as referred to in letter to you dated October 13th, last.\n\nThe Department will approve of Miss Farrow continuing as teacher of the senior room until such time as our Inspector makes another visit to the School. It is fully expected that she will be able to carry on the work successfully.\n\nRegarding Miss Fraser, the girls' supervisor, it is noted you are of opinion that the condition of her health will permit her to continue to discharge her duties satisfactorily. Her case was drawn to your attention as we felt there was a possibility of danger to the health of the pupils by her associating with them.\n\nWe have already been advised of the appointment of Mr. H. Bicknell, whose qualifications for the position of engineer appear satisfactory.\n\nWe have also been advised that Miss Spalding, who had charge of the kitchen work, has been replaced by Miss D. Matthews, who gave satisfactory service at the Lac la Ronge School.\n\nThe Department is aware of the desire of your Commission to have competent members on the staff at this School, and it is hoped, as a result of your visit - when you, no doubt, discussed fully the duties of each member - there will be no further cause for complaint regarding their services. When our Inspector next visits this school, it is anticipated that he will find an improvement in the general conditions and in the work.\n\nRegarding the repairs and equipment enumerated in your letter, I have to say that a sum is being included in our Estimates for the next fiscal year to carry out the work and provide the equipment as mentioned by you. I would point out that during the present fiscal year the following expenditure has been authorized at this school: new batteries and switchboard, at a cost of $650; alterations and fire escapes, $150; gas engine, $207.50.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

This would indicate that there is no doubt room for improvement along both these lines.\n\nI would point out that in Nurse Pears' report for January she also comments on the diet, and the Department will note that very few vegetables are supplied and that the milk supply is low. Miss Pears also states \"very little attention is given to the care of the girls' heads.\"\n\nI intend to visit this Agency in the near future and will make a careful check of conditions existing at this school and will report my findings to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. H.

I would request that you enquire carefully into the food served the pupils, especially the quantity of milk. You should also ascertain if the children are kept in a cleanly condition, both as regards their bodies and clothing. You might also make careful investigation as to the duties being performed by the various members of the staff. We have recently taken up with the Church authorities the question of a change in a number of the staff. You might enquire into the work being performed by Miss Farrow, teacher of the senior room; also regarding the health and work being performed by Miss Fraser, the girls' supervisor. You might also enquire into the duties being performed by Mr. H. Bicknell, who was recently appointed as engineer.\n\nThe Department will await your report, after your visit, on the various matters in connection with this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

F. MACKENZIE.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nMarch 20th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to my telegram of the 19th instant, regarding the burning of the MacKay Indian Residential School, The Pas, I wish to report as follows:\n\nAt 15 minutes after one o'clock on the afternoon of March 19th, I received official notice from Mr. Fraser, Principal of the above school, that the school had burned down. I immediately left for the school accompanied by Constable Anderson R.C.M.P., to investigate the fire. On arriving I found the school to be a total loss, so we took statements from those directly connected with the fire which I enclose. There seemed to be a certain amount of carelessness on the part of the Engineer and Night-watchman in having this wood piled so close to the jacket heater mentioned in their statements, also a certain amount of carelessness in not making positively sure that the fire was out in the first place, by either tearing down the ceiling, or taking up the floor in the next storey, also in not sounding the fire alarm immediately which would have notified the whole staff of the fire. The hose pipes in the school were inspected by me in the presence of Mr. Fraser, Principal, on October 25th, 1932 and were found satisfactory, but there seemed to be a lack of pressure during the fire. A considerable amount of goods were salvaged, such as blankets, mattresses, piano, furniture etc., The pump house, barn and warehouse were not damaged to any extent during the fire. The roof of the ice-house was partly burned, but the walls are in good condition. Mr. Fraser and I arranged to billet possibly 50 children with the Indians of The Pas Reserve who at the present time have lots of food. About 30 of the smallest children are staying in the church which is being used for a dormitory at the time. Most of the staff are staying in Mr. Fraser's residence with the exception of those needed to supervise the church.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nReport from Mr. Fraser, Principal.\n\nMarch 19th, 1933.\n\nIt was about five minutes to eight when I went to the school on the morning of March 19th, everything seemed alright. I was going into the children's dining-room when I met Mr. Wilson and he did not say anything. Then I went to the staff dining-room. Mr. Wilson came in, the matron came in after him and said we had a fire this morning, in the basement. I said \"What\" and no alarm. Mr. Wilson said I was going to report to Mr. Fraser myself. Then Miss Favell came in and said there was a lot of smoke in the children's dining-room and kitchen and she looked alarming, so I went into my study and got my fire extinguisher and was rushing to the basement when Leonard was passing, so I gave it to him. I rushed back through the boy's play-room to look at the stove. The room was clear of smoke, but smoke was coming up under the boy's stairway. Mr. Wilson was there and I told him here is more fire. I then told him to ring the alarm. The fire was already breaking through the ventilator. I then went to the top floor and it was worse, I tore down the hose on the top floor but it did not work, no pressure. I yelled to get the pumps going. I went down to my office again to get some Pyrene and met Leonard on the stairs and he cut the can open with an axe. The hose on the second floor was working a little by this time. I told the boy's to save all they could, it was all over then. The boy's were wonderful. I went downstairs to the office to make sure that everybody was out.\nReport from Leonard Fraser, Night Watchman. March 19th, 1933.\n\nI came on duty at 9 P.M. March 18th, and everything was alright. I was in the basement at 6.30 A.M. the morning of the 19th March, then went out to the power house. I came back and woke Mr. Wilson at 6.35 A.M., everything was alright. After I woke Mr. Wilson I went out to the power house again. When I came in from the power-house I went in the kitchen and Mr. Wilson was having tea and we smelled smoke. Mr. Wilson went upstairs with tea for the ladies. When he came down we had our tea, then we noticed smoke, so we went down to the basement and found the wood at the jacket heater burning. We rushed back to the kitchen and got water, the fire was under the jacket heater, it was blazing. We threw the water on the fire and put the fire out. We made two or three trips to the kitchen for water, I went up and got more water to leave in the basement in case we needed it. Mr. Wilson went to get some boys to move the wood to the centre of the floor. I noticed a crack about 2 inch in width between the cement wall and the ceiling which was smouldering, but I could not get water to the fire on account of steam pipes being in the way. Mr. Wilson came down and I told him I could not get the water to the fire, so he rushed out and got a small fire extinguisher and it did not work, so he went back and got a big one. I climbed up on the wood pile and used the fire extinguisher in the crack and to the best of my knowledge I put the fire out, so when that was over Mr. Wilson and the boys moved the wood and we went out on the back stairways and felt the walls to see if they were warm, but there was no sign of fire. I mentioned to Mr. Wilson that we should get an axe and make sure but he seemed sure the fire was out, so we did not bother but went upstairs and finished our tea. I went down again and the boys had taken the wood away and I looked up at the crack again and I could not see any fire at all. While I was down Mr. Wilson came down, things looked alright. I went upstairs to get ready for breakfast. I don't know whether the wood at the jacket heater started the fire or not but the wood was very dry. While at breakfast Miss Favell came into the staff dining-room and told us the fire had started again. Mr. Fraser rushed and got a fire extinguisher and I put it on the same crack where the fire was burning again but it did not put the fire out so then I rushed upstairs to see if I could do anything there but the fire seemed to be in the air ventilator. The hose on the second floor was working a little, the hose on the first floor was working good but there did not seem enough pressure at the time to put water all through the school. Mr. Wilson was at the pumps, we were too busy carrying water from the kitchen to the basement for the first fire, and did not have time to ring the fire bell. I do not remember any iron being tore from the ceiling.\nReport from William H. Wilson, Engineer. March 19th, 1933.\n\nI went on duty at 7 A.M. March 19th, relieving Leonard Fraser, night-watchman. I was drinking a cup of tea in the kitchen when I smelled smoke. I asked Leonard Fraser what was smoking and he said I have just put on a fire but the smoke got worse so I went down in the basement followed by Fraser and found a pile of wood burning. The wood was in behind the hot water jacket, the wood was blazing. I ran back to the kitchen and got water. Fraser did the same, we carried water until the fire was out, then we discovered that the metallic covering on the ceiling was red hot. Fraser got a pail of water and a dipper and threw the water on the ceiling. I went out and got a small fire extinguisher but it was no good. I rushed to the second floor and got a big extinguisher from just outside Miss Fraser's room and took it down the basement and gave it to Leonard Fraser who was stood on the wood pile close to the ceiling, he used it and put the fire out. When we were through we could see no sign of fire, then I got boys and moved all the wood to be sure that the fire was out. I was sure there was no more fire. I then washed and went to breakfast. I only just sat down when someone came to the dining-room and reported smoke coming through the floor in beneath the back stairs. I then went out to start the pumps. I had 45 pounds of pressure but the hose was leaking. By this time the fire was in the air ventilator, in flames beyond control. We then tried to get out as much goods as possible. The alarm was sounded at once but not for the first fire which I thought was out. The matron went down in the basement and she was sure the first fire was out. We tore the metallic covering off the ceiling but could see no more fire. Fire was coming out of the roof when I went to start the pumps. Wood must have fallen against the fire door of the jacket heater to start the fire in the first place and the fire could easily start if that had happened.\nReport from Olive Wiatt, Matron March 19th, 1933.\n\nI am matron of the school. I was called at 6.45 A.M. March 19th, and did not notice any smoke until I opened the basement door, then I thought it was the furnace smoke, but the smoke got worse so Miss Neals and I went down to see, and I asked when the fire had started and was told it was the wood from the jacket heater that started the fire. I was sure the fire was out when I left the basement. I spoke to Mr. Wilson and he told me he thought the fire had started six or seven hours earlier than this, so we went back to breakfast, and I met Mr. Fraser and he did not know anything about the fire. Miss Favell came in the dining-room and told us heavy smoke was coming through again. Mr. Fraser rushed right out and got a fire extinguisher. Mr Rollings went out to help them. I went to the children's dining-room, then I went upstairs to dormitory and got the children out. The first I knew of the fire was when I opened the basement door, when I went upstairs I saw flames in the air ventilator. The first real warning the staff had was when Miss Favell came into the dining-room about five minutes past eight.\nRA140 22 COLLECT NO.\n\nSTANDARD TIME\n\nTHE PAS MAR MAR 23\n\nSECY DEPT INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOTTAWA ONT\n\nCAN SEND EIGHT MORE CHILDREN TO ELKHORN ALL DESTITUTE CASES\n\nCHURCH OF ENGLAND TO PAY ALL EXPENSES RE TRANSPORTATION PLEASE\n\nADVISE\n\nS LOVELL.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, March 24, 1933.\n\nS.

F. MACKENZIE.\n\nCHG. DEPT. I.A.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMarch 27th, 1933\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI visited the MacKay Indian Residential School on February 24th and again on March 6th. On both occasions I made a thorough inspection of the building, but was only able to visit the classroom on the latter date as the school was not in session on the occasion of my first visit, due to the fact that the furnace was being repaired and the classrooms were too cold to be opened.\n\nSince returning to Winnipeg I received word of the fire which occurred on March 19th, totally destroying this building. This is to be greatly regretted, and as the staff will not be retained, it hardly seems necessary to make as exhaustive a report as one might otherwise do.\n\nMiss L. Farrow, the senior teacher, is qualified and if proper discipline had been maintained throughout the school, there is no doubt that she would have obtained better results in her classroom.\n\nMiss Wright, who was in charge of the junior room on my previous visit, had left. Her resignation was brought about as a result of lax discipline throughout the school, she having attempted to punish one of the older girls who, I understand, would not take the punishment and turned on Miss Wright, resulting in a nervous breakdown.\n\nAfter Miss Wright's retirement, Mr. Fraser's son took over the classroom until Miss M. Neales was appointed. This Harold W. McGill, M.D., Deputy Superintendent General, Dept. of Indian Affairs, OTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 2)\nteacher intimated that she had no intentions of remaining longer than the end of June.\n\nSince my last visit Miss Schennells, the matron at that time, has been transferred to the Elkhorn School and Miss Lindsay was appointed matron at MacKay. She only carried on for a month or two and resigned, and Miss Wyatt, a graduate nurse, was appointed. Miss Wyatt is new to the Indian work and to her duties as a matron of such an institution. She appeared quite willing to co-operate in every way, but with the unrest quite evident among the staff, she was finding the work difficult.\n\nMiss Fraser is the sewing teacher and girls' supervisor. During my inspection Nurse Pears made a careful check of the condition of all the boys and girls in regard to their bodies and clothing. This examination was carried out in the presence of Miss Wyatt, the matron, who agreed that the condition of the girls was disgraceful. Almost 90% of the girls had nits in their hair, many of them being very bad, and over 50% were dirty in person. Both nurses agreed that in many cases the girls' underclothing was dirty. Miss Wyatt was surprised to find this condition as she naturally expected Miss Fraser, the girls' matron, to attend to all matters of this nature relating to the girls. Miss Fraser was certainly not fulfilling her duties as girls' supervisor.\n\nMiss Griffiths is boys' supervisor, and although conditions were none too good, we found the boys much better than the girls. Out of a total of 40, only 9 had nits, while 24 were dirty in person. The dormitories\nThe dormitories were in fair condition, but I found a number of cases in connection with the girls where no nightdresses appeared under their pillows. However, I learned later that the girls were wearing these in the daytime, which fact was discovered during their examination.\n\nThe boys' washroom and toilets were in good condition. The girls' were far from satisfactory, and this was pointed out both to the matron and Mr. Fraser. This work again was the duty of the girls' matron.\n\nMr. Fraser's son was acting as nightwatchman, and in view of the fact that I was not satisfied that his duties were being carried out as they should, it was my intention to ask that a clock be installed.\n\nMr. H. Bicknell, referred to in Department letter of February 15th, No.128-1-1, had left, having resigned after serving a couple of months. Mr. Wilson, the new appointment as engineer, had only been on the staff a short time, but I understand had his third class engineer's certificate.\n\nI am informed that during the past fifteen months, twelve or thirteen changes have taken place on the staff at this school which, to say the least, is a very unfortunate situation and certainly does not tend to the promotion of efficiency. There was a general lack of discipline throughout the whole institution, and the Principal certainly cannot be altogether excused on this ground. There are many other details which, had not the unfortunate disaster occurred on March 19th, could well have been reported, but as nothing is to be gained now by so doing.\nso doing, I submit the foregoing as a reply to Department letter 128-1-1 dated February 15th, 1933.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nMarch 27th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI acknowledge receipt of the $500.00 wired to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, The Pas, for the transportation of the pupils of the MacKay Indian Residential School, The Pas, to Elkhorn.\n\nAs there will be a number of pupils going home, I find I will require an additional $35.00 to complete the transportation of these children, so would be obliged to have a cheque for this amount as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst., Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 31, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, requesting a further advance of $35 to complete the transportation expenses of a number of the pupils of the MacKay Indian Residential School to their homes.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that it will not be possible to send this advance, as our funds for the fiscal year ending today are exhausted and the new Appropriation is not yet available. You should forward certified accounts, in triplicate, covering the above amount, when, by the time they reach the Department, funds will be available.\n\nI would request that you account as soon as possible for the expenditure of the $500 which was wired you to the Canadian Bank of Commerce. You should prepare a statement, in triplicate, accounting for the disbursement of this amount, and receipts, etc., should be attached.\n\nYou should, as requested by telegram of the 24th instant, forward a list of the names of the pupils who were sent to Elkhorn and their MacKay school register number, also the list of pupils who have returned to their homes.\n\nYour communication of the 20th instant, reporting on the burning of the school, together with statements from the Principal and members of the staff, was received. Mr. Inspector Hamilton was requested by wire to visit The Pas to make a thorough investigation into the cause of the fire and to advise regarding the disposal of any Government owned equipment and stock.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

School.\n\nThe forty children sent to Elkhorn were all destitute cases and were children from the furthest northern points, as it would have been practically impossible to get these children home until open water, which would not be until sometime in May. The eight pupils questioned in your telegram were not as destitute as the forty sent south, also they belong to reserves nearer The Pas. All the rest of the pupils from outside reserves are being sent home as soon as possible. All the children at the MacKay School of The Pas Reserve, with the exception of one, are attending Day Schools on The Pas Reserve.\n\nI attach herewith the required list of the children sent to Elkhorn, with their numbers, where they are from and their approximate ages, which I trust will meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nS. Lovell,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst., Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\n\nDiv.: Sub-Division Detachment\n\"D\" The Pas The Pas\nDistrict Manitoba\n\nDate March 20th;1933.\n\nFyle References Re: McKAYS INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL,BIG EDY,THE PAS,MAN:\nDESTROYED BY FIRE.\nAssistance to Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nHeadquarters\n\nDivision or Dist.\n\nDivision\n\n1. Reference the above I have to report that at 1.00 p.m. on March 19th;1933, information was received at this office to the effect that the McKay Indian Boarding School at Big Eddy, near The Pas, Manitoba had been destroyed by fire at about 8.00 a.m. that morning.\n\n2. Acting on instructions received from Sgt.P.Rose, I/c., The Pas Detachment, I left in company with Mr.S.Lovell, Acting Indian Agent for the Pas District, per horse team and proceeded to the school, arriving at 2.15 p.m.\n\n3. The building had been burned to the ground, only the two brick chimneys and cement foundations being left standing. The ruins were still burning strongly and the heat too great to allow a close investigation of the remains.\n\n4. A considerable quantity of bedding, furniture and personal property was saved, this being principally from the first and second floors, practically nothing was saved from the upper floor.\n\nI interviewed William H.Wilson, engineer at the school and he gave me the following statement:\n\n\"I was called at 6.40 a.m. Sunday March 19th;1933. At 7.00 a.m. I took over at 7.00 a.m. from Leo Fraser, night watchman. I was sitting in the kitchen drinking tea when Fraser came up from the basement and spoke and asked what was burning. He said he had smelled smoke. I sat there for a few minutes more and then went upstairs. I went into the basement and Fraser told me there was a pile of wood in below the hot water boiler. I ran up to the kitchen and grabbed a big pan of water and did the same and we threw the water on the fire. We continued to carry water until it was put out. We discovered that the ceiling was smouldering. I got a pail of water and a dipper and tried to put more water on it. I went upstairs and got a bucket but it wouldn't work, it was useless. I went to the second floor and got the big fire extinguisher Miss Fraser's room and we emptied that. We were through we could see no sign of fire. I called boys and got them to move the wood from the boiler to see if it was properly out and satisfied there was no further danger. I washed breakfast. We had just sat down to breakfast when I was asked when someone came to the window and reported that smoke was coming through the boys playroom. I ran out to the pump and turned the pump figuring we should need the sounds pressure of water on but the hose was leaking. Water ran all over the floor but...\"\nbut nothing came out of the nozzle. By this time the flames were in the air shaft and the fire had then got beyond control. I then went over to help get furniture and stuff out. No alarm was given during the first fire as it was only a small one and I did not consider it necessary. The fire went into the basement after the first fire and she was also satisfied that everything was alright. We have a regular system of fire alarms and the last fire drill was held about 4 days ago. During the first fire we pulled the tin roofing down to make sure the fire was out. There was absolutely no sign of fire after we finished. The only way I can think the fire started again was that it went further back under the metallic roofing. The first fire apparently started by some of the wood for the heater falling down against the cast iron door of the heater. This door at times gets practically red hot and a fire would easily start if that did happen.\"\n\nW.H.Wilson.\n\n6. I next interviewed Miss Olive Wyatt, matron at the school and obtained the following statement from her:\n\nSTATEMENT GIVEN BY MISS O.WYATT:\n\na) \"I am matron of the McKay Indian School at Big Eddy. When I went downstairs at about 7.00 a.m. on Sunday March 19th; 1933 into the kitchen I smelled smoke. I met Miss Griffiths on the stairs and she told me there had been a fire in the furnace room. I took Miss Hemmings into the basement. The fire to all appearances was out and there seemed no danger. I asked the origin of the fire and was told that a piece of small wood by the jacket heater had caught fire. There were several boys moving the wood away from where it had been piled. Several of the pieces were badly charred, but were absolutely out. I asked Mr. Wilson when it started and he told me he thought it must have started six or seven hours before, but I do not think this was possible. We went up to breakfast and Mr. Fraser came in and I asked him about it, but he had not heard anything about it. I had barely spoken to Mr. Fraser when Miss Flavelle came tearing into the dining room and said there was heavy smoke coming through - I didn't hear where. Mr. Fraser went out with an extinguisher with Mr. Rawlings. After that I went into the dining room to see if the children were alright. Then I went upstairs to see if the several sick children were alright. I told them to get dressed. Whilst upstairs I saw flames coming out of the cold air register. Up to the time Miss Flavelle came into the dining room this was the first real warning we had had of fire. This was about 8.05 a.m. The rest of the time I helped at saving things!\"\n\nOlive Wyatt.\n\n7. Leonard Fraser, night watchman, was then interviewed and gave the following statement:\n\nSTATEMENT GIVEN BY L.FRASER:\n\n\"I came on duty at 9.00 p.m. March 18th; 1933. Everything was alright when I went on. I was down in the basement about 6.30 a.m. on the 20th; and everything was alright then, no signs of any smoke. About 6.40 a.m. I woke Mr. Wilson and then went over to the powerhouse. When I came back Wilson was in the kitchen having some tea, he went upstairs and when he came down we had some more tea, and he then smelled smoke, he opened the door leading to the furnace room and went down and we saw a...\"\nMcKays Indian Boarding School, Big Eddy, The Pas, Man:\n\nDESTROYED BY FIRE.\n\nAssistance to Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nA pile of small wood under the jacket heater blazing. We both went upstairs and got pans of water and threw that on it and that put it out. We made two or three trips with water. Wilson went upstairs to get some boys to move the wood away. I noticed a crack between the cement wall and the ceiling that was smouldering. I tried to throw water on it but there were too many pipes in the way for me to do so. Mr. Wilson came down while I was doing this and he rushed upstairs to get a fire extinguisher. I asked him if it would work and he said he didn't know and tried it, but it wouldn't work. He went upstairs to get another one. This one worked and I turned it on the crack. After I had emptied it I looked all along the crack and couldn't see anything at all. It was all black and appeared to be out. We went upstairs by the boys stair railing the wood to see if it was hot, everything seemed alright and we thought the fire was out. I mentioned getting an axe to take up the flooring to see if it was alright. We felt the floor and as it wasn't hot we thought it was alright and so didn't worry about taking up the floor. Mr. Wilson went into the basement to see that the boys removed the wood from the heater and went into the kitchen. I later went downstairs and the wood had all been moved. I looked all along the crack and everything seemed alright. Mr. Wilson also came down while I was there. This fire started though the wood by the heater catching alight. I did not tear any of the metallic ceiling off, it did not seem necessary as the crack was about 1 inch wide and I could see right inside. Just after breakfast was started, the alarm was given. I immediately went into the furnace room. The crack was blazing again. Someone handed me an extinguisher and I turned it on. It worked alright but did not seem to have any effect on the flames. I went upstairs and the flames were shooting right up the air shaft. I then helped at saving furniture and so on. I went down to the second floor. The hose was working alright but there was not enough pressure on to do very much good. The hose on the first floor was also working alright. The hose was leaking badly. No alarm was given at the first fire all I thought of was of getting water at that time.\"\n\nLeonard Fraser.\n\n8. Mr. Albert Fraser, Principal of the McKays School was next interviewed and gave the following statement:\n\na) \"I always have breakfast with the staff and rose at 6.40 a.m. this morning and went over to the school at 7.55. I met Wilson at the door of the dining room. He did not say anything to me. No smell of smoke at that time. I said 'Grace' in the children's dining room and then went into the staff dining room. Miss Wyatt told me there had been a fire in the basement that morning. I asked why no alarm had been given. Wilson said he had been going to report it to me himself. Miss Favelle then came into the room and said there was a lot of smoke in the kitchen and dining room. I went into my study and got the fire extinguisher and went to the basement and Leonard (Fraser) passed me and I handed him the extinguisher. I then went into the boys playroom - it was alright there. There was heavy smoke on the boys staircase and the fire was already breaking through the air shaft ventilators. Wilson was with me then. I called for the alarm to be given. I went up to the top floor and it was worse up there. I got out the hose on the top floor but it didn't work, there not being enough pressure. I went downstairs and the hose on the second floor was working but did not have...\"\nhave very much pressure. I went down to my study and got a can of Pyrex and poured this on the flames upstairs, but it did not have any effect on the flames. I then saw that it was impossible to save the building and helped to save the furniture and to see that all the children were safe.\"\n\nAlbert Fraser.\n\n9. With reference to the statement by Wm.H.Wilson, engineer at the school, given in paragraph 5 it will be noted that he stated that though he had the pumps working the hoses were not good, that they were leaking. In the statements by Leonard Fraser, nightwatchman, paragraph 7 and that of Albert Fraser, principal, paragraph 8 it is stated by both that the hoses were working alright but there was not sufficient pressure of water.\n\n10. Wilson also stated that part of the metallic roofing was torn down to make sure that the fire had not gone further back. Leonard Fraser states that no roofing was torn down and further, that he suggested getting an axe and taking up the flooring on the first floor to make sure it was out, but after feeling the woodwork and finding that it wasn't hot, both he and Wilson decided it would not be necessary.\n\n11. It is apparent that the first fire started from the pile of small wood by the hot water jacket catching fire. And the second fire came from the ceiling under the metallic roofing, which had been alight during the first fire and which had not been properly put out. There being nearly 20 years accumulation of dust, etc., in between the flooring and the metallic ceiling there would be plenty for the fire to travel on and once it reached the air shaft it jumped right to the top floor and would have so many outlets that it would be impossible to combat it.\n\n12. Negligence on the part of Leonard Fraser and Wm. Wilson to give the alarm during the first fire and also in not tearing down the metallic ceiling or taking up the flooring on the first floor seems to have resulted in the fire gaining a fresh hold with the consequent loss of the entire building.\n\n13.

Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe: MACKEY SCHOOL FIRE\n\nWith further reference to my telegram to you on the 19th. inst. re the loss of the Mackay School through fire that day, I beg to state that our Commission have received from the Rev. A. Fraser, Principal of this school, a statement setting forth what he believes \"to be the cause of the fire based on reports given by night watchman and engineer.\"\n\nOur Commission have also received a report from their Assistant Secretary-Treasurer, Colonel E. W. Mernagen who was instructed to proceed to The Pas as soon as possible after the fire, to investigate the cause, and to deal with any matters pertaining to the remaining property, the staff and the pupils, etc. requiring immediate action.\n\nTHE PRINCIPAL'S STATEMENT, dated March 22nd., dealing with the cause of the fire, reads, in part, as follows:-\n\n\"No doubt it started in the furnace room near the jacket heater. The night watchman (Leonard Fraser) gives information that he was in the furnace room at 6.30 A.M. There was absolutely no sign of smoke or fire around the jacket heater at that time. He then went out to the power house and started the pump engine. On his return he went upstairs to awaken the engineer (Mr. Wilson); this would be about 6.40 A.M. After this he went down to the kitchen and made a cup of tea as usual. Mr. Wilson came downstairs shortly after 7 A.M. After the night watchman had awakened the engineer and a number of others he claimed he went out to the power house a second time and was in the power house when the rising bell sounded. He returned to the kitchen, detected no smoke from the furnace room and proceeded to have his morning cup of tea with the engineer. At this juncture they both simultaneously detected smoke. They both went down immediately into the furnace room and saw...\"\n\"the wood on fire under the jacket heater. They rushed back to the kitchen Mr. Wilson seizing a dishpan of water and the night watchman a cauldron of the children's tea with which they managed to extinguish the flames.\n\n\"The flames were leaping as high as the ceiling when they went down to investigate the first time they detected any sign of smoke. After extinguishing the flames they detected a red glow on the metallic ceiling near the cement wall. They got two pails of water with which the night watchman tried to cope with what he thought was fire in the ceiling. He used a dipper throwing the water upwards. Not being satisfied he called for a fire extinguisher to be brought in. Mr. Wilson brought a small one which was useless. Mr. Wilson ran up to the first flat and brought down a large one from Miss Fraser's station. This extinguisher worked shooting the liquid into the crack of the ceiling which the night watchman thought had a smoldering appearance. Both the engineer and the night watchman were satisfied that the fire was extinguished thoroughly and all danger over. The matron left her room about 7.15 A.M. having received no intimation whatever of what was going on until going down the stairway she met Miss Griffith ascending to the top flat and noticed a great volume of smoke when the door was opened leading to the stairway. Miss Griffith informed the matron the smoke was coming from the furnace room and had gone down to the kitchen to ask concerning it and had been informed that Mr. Wilson and the night watchman were down in the furnace room working with it then and she reasoned, therefore, that there was no need for alarm. The matron informed me she went down into the furnace room, meeting the night watchman coming through the door leading into the kitchen who informed her that there had been a fire in the jacket heater fuel pile but that it was then extinguished. She went down then and personally investigated and found everything seemingly all right. Before going down she had also seen the engineer who informed her also that the fire was absolutely out. After this she requested Miss Neales to come down with her a second time to investigate - this would be about 7.55 A.M. They did go down and thoroughly examined the woodpile and found three or four boys throwing it out of the corner into the middle of the basement. They noticed that a great many pieces were badly charred but no sign of sparks were to be seen.\"\n\"I came over from the residence as usual about 7:55 A.M. but did not detect any smoke whatever or anything unusual. After removing my coat I went in to the children's dining room met Mr. Wilson at the door of the dining room (children's), the boys were already in and the girls were just beginning to march in. I took my place near the centre of the floor as usual and after the usual procedure returned to the staff dining room for breakfast. I did not detect anything unusual at all and the place was quite free from smoke. I had no intimation whatever that there had been a fire until at the breakfast table the matron mentioned that there had been an exciting time fighting a fire. This was the very first intimation I had had of what had been going on and was filled with horror - this would be about 8:05 A.M. ........ While at breakfast the kitchen matron came in and excitedly informed me that she had detected smoke. I immediately jumped to my feet, rushed into the office, seized a fire extinguisher and ran in to the children's dining room towards the furnace room. The night watchman met me taking my extinguisher. I rushed back to the boys' stairway and was met by a huge volume of smoke. Mr. Wilson was with me. I told him that the fire must be under the stairway and to get in to it. I ran upstairs then to the first flat, already smoke was coming through around the air shaft. I yelled for the alarm to be sounded immediately, which was done. The matron followed closely in my wake and I at once ordered her to see that all the sick were out of the dormitories which she did. I then proceeded to the top flat, even there the flames were coming through around the air ventilator. I immediately took down the fire hose but it wouldn't function properly. I then went down to the first flat, the pressure of water there was somewhat better but not sufficient to fight the fire with. Seeing the advance the fire was making I was convinced that we were beaten by the fire. I gave orders to save as much of the movable property as possible, which was done. The children were all out of the building at the time the alarm was sounded - they being all together in their own dining room. I gave orders for a close check to be made of both boys and girls which was carried out. I have no hesitation in claiming that the fire originated in the furnace room over the jacket heater. The smoke being all drawn up through an opening leading from the basement to the cupola in the roof, through which opening the air shaft had been placed. The building proved itself...\"\na regular fire trap and had it occurred during the night season I am much afraid that certain of our staff members would have been trapped in their rooms. Half an hour after we got the first real warning of fire from the kitchen matron at about 8:05 A.M., it was unsafe to go across through the halls on first and second flat. Less than three hours the whole structure was demolished. I will give full verbal particulars to Colonel Mermagen on his arrival, and no doubt the staff members will do likewise to the best of their knowledge.\n\n\"The lady members of the staff were simply wonderful, keeping cool during the most trying experience that we have ever passed through. The senior boys and girls were splendid. My own boys worked unsparingly rendering every assistance possible to the last. The Indians were also wonderful in helping to rescue the storerooms where flour and fodder were stored and the children were practically taken off our hands for the time being by Indians asking that they might look after them for a day or so, seeing we had no proper place to house them. We kept eleven small ones that the matron felt we could not safely allow to go on account of their recent sickness - they having only been out of bed two days from an attack of 'flu. People from town sent word of their willingness to house staff members and even children if need be, for which we are very grateful but the staff members preferred to stay together on the premises and rough it for a few days rather than disperse to more comfortable quarters. I can only say that we have been very fortunate in having the type of staff we had as they have certainly proved themselves to be, even in the face of all they have recently passed through, loyal and most devoted ..........\"\n\nTHE REPORT OF COLONEL MERMAGEN, Assistant Secretary-Treasurer of our Commission, confirms the above statement of the Principal in every detail, and furnishes the following additional particulars:\n\n\"At about 7 a.m. the Night Watchman and Engineer noticed smoke coming from the furnace room, but as this happened frequently when the fires had been freshly made up, they at first paid little attention. As the smoke did not decrease, however, they went down and found that some of the small wood used for the jacket heater had fallen and come in contact with a cleanout door, in the furnace, which got very hot when a big fire was on, and ignited. This had started the whole pile of kindling, and there was a blaze in the corner under the boys' side of the dining room. Both men rushed to the kitchen, the Engineer taking a dish pan of water and the Night Watchman a boiler which was heating for\nthe children's tea. The dish pan extinguished the burning wood, and the Night Watchman climbing on a pipe and using a dipper, threw the contents of the boiler on to the metal ceiling which was red hot, and cooled that off. The Engineer in the meantime ran for one of the hand extinguishers in the kitchen, which refused to work. He then went to the hall on the second floor and brought down a large extinguisher which was in good working order, and together he and the Night Watchman thoroughly drenched the ceiling and the pile of kindling until no vestige of fire or smoke was visible. They stayed down for a time, but as no sign of fire was apparent when the breakfast bell rang, they went upstairs to the staff dining room and sat down.\n\nWhilst the Night Watchman and Engineer were thus engaged, the usual school routine was going forward. The Kitchen Matron came down about 7 a.m. and being informed that there was a slight fire in the basement, filled several pails of water for use. Miss Neales who was on table duty noticed smoke after she came down and went to the stairs leading to the furnace room, where she met the Engineer who informed her that the fire was out and all danger over. Shortly before 8 the Principal came over to the school for breakfast, and having visited the pupils' dining room, went to the staff dining room. Before breakfast was started the Head Matron came in and in apology for not being strictly on time, mentioned the morning's excitement. The Principal asked for an explanation, and on receiving it demanded to be informed why he had not been notified, and calling to the men to follow him, made for the furnace room. On his way through he met the Boys' Supervisor who reported a considerable volume of smoke coming up from the furnace room. The Principal immediately ordered the alarm bell sounded, and the children marched out, and himself went to the fire hose. The hose although recently inspected by the Principal and the Indian Agent, proved faulty in places, and the stream was inadequate. The Principal then went to the office and seized a large extinguisher which was taken from him by the Night Watchman for use in the furnace room. The Principal was then informed that smoke and flame was bursting from the large ventilator which ended in a cupola at the top of the building, and having ascertained this report to be true, he gave up hope of saving the building, and as the children were safely outside, devoted his energies to saving as much of the equipment as possible. In this work he was aided by members of the staff and spoke in the highest terms of the courage and devotion to duty of every one of them. The Indian men from the reserve also came flocking over and by their help the large supply of flour and feed was taken from the store house and placed in safety. Afterwards they kept\nthe roof of this building covered with snow to prevent sparks from setting fire to it.\n\n\"The wind was from the South East, so that the engine house, although nearest the main building, was out of danger. The ice house, some twenty yards further away had the south side of its roof badly charred in spite of repeated applications of snow. Had the ice house caught, the fate of the store house would have been sealed. Actually, the main building was the only one destroyed.\n\n\"During the early stages of the fire the salvage work went rapidly forward. 71 mattresses, 117 quilts, 47 flannel-ette sheets and 72 pillows were saved, as well as many bed spreads, pillow slips, etc. The office files were rescued as well as furniture from the staff sitting room, including the piano. The stock rooms where the spare clothing was kept were unfortunately attached to the ventilator shaft, and when efforts were made by the Supervisors to get at the contents they were driven back by clouds of smoke.\n\n\"The fire starting just at breakfast time, all the pupils were completely clad, and after the alarm, many secured their overcoats. There were at the time only two convalescent children to be looked after - a girl who was being retained until Monday, merely as a precaution, and a boy recovering from 'flu. The former walked over to the Residence herself, and the boy having been brought down by his Supervisor, was carried to the Residence by some of the bigger boys of the school, and later transferred to hospital. It is a magnificent tribute to the entire staff that their first thoughts were for the children, their second for bedding and the subsequent comfort of their charges, and only the third for their personal belongings. All suffered considerable loss, several practically everything. The Head Matron would at first appear to have been most fortunate, as owing to her recent arrival and the fact that her predecessor had occupied her quarters for a fortnight, Miss Wyatt had not unpacked her trunk which was rescued intact. Unfortunately the few things she had unpacked were her chief treasures, and most of all a Belgian war decoration, conferred by King Albert upon her deceased uncle for distinguished war services. Miss Farrow and Miss Neales, the two Teachers, both saved their certificates, but lost other valuable books, pictures, etc. Miss Fraser and Miss Griffiths, Supervisors, by looking after their charges, both lost heavily in personal effects, particularly the latter who was in attendance upon the sick boy until he was adequately cared for, lost more than...\"\nany other agent. Miss Favelle, Kitchen Matron, and Miss Vincent, Laundry Matron, both lost much of their belongings. Fortunately all saved their winter coats. Mr. Wilson, Engineer, lost his personal tools which he kept in his room as the school equipment was complete. He also lost a sum of money and clothing. Mr. Rawlings, Farmer, saved a portion of his effects, as did Mr. Leonard Fraser, the Night Watchman.\n\n\"The Principal commented most favourably upon the conduct of the Indians upon the reserve - the men as has been stated, gave valuable assistance in saving supplies, and both men and women when the disposal of the children was under consideration, offered to take in one or two additional, to their own homes until arrangements could be made. These offers were made entirely without ulterior motive, but in a subsequent conversation, Mr. Fraser asked if the Commission would be inclined to favourably consider a grant of some 25 lbs. of flour to the families who had undertaken this duty. I took it upon myself to promise this, and trust my action may be approved ...........................................\n\n\"I saw the Agent's report to Inspector Himilton, and noted that he had imputed carelessness to the Engineer and Night Watchman. With this opinion I disagree. An error in judgment, certainly, but not carelessness. Both men worked hard and were convinced that they had extinguished the fire. The error was in not tearing up part of the floor, and fighting the fire from above instead of below. I questioned every member of the staff, and from their replies am convinced that the cause of the fire was entirely accidental. I had the Engineer and Night Watchman in at the same time, and had them check each other's story. Replying to my query why had the Principal not been notified, the Engineer stated that they felt it was a simple job to put out the fire, but was distinctly a two-man job. At the time of the first outbreak, none of the other members of the staff or the children were up, and there was no one to send. Similarly as to ringing the alarm bell. If they extinguished the small blaze in time, of which they were quite confident, there was no necessity for raising the alarm. The reports from all members of the staff were substantially the same.\n\n\"My conclusion is, therefore, that the fire started accidentally. When it was discovered to be serious, the conduct of all concerned from the Principal to the youngest child in the school was above reproach, and that much valuable equipment was saved at considerable personal risk.\"\nI beg once more to direct attention to the fact, that from start to finish of this unfortunate occurrence, the entire staff of the MacKay School, displayed a devotion to duty of which the Commission may well be proud.\"\n\nThe Principal's statement and the Assistant Secretary-Treasurer's Report were presented to our Commission at a meeting held here on the 28th. inst. when the following decisions, inter alia, were reached:\n\n\"(1) The Commission decided to record their sincere regret over the loss of this school building, and their equally sincere gratitude to Almighty God for preserving the lives of the staff and pupils.\n\n(2) They accepted the finding of the Asst. Secy-Treas. as set forth in his report, and the statement of the Principal, that the fire was accidental in origin, and that the school management did their utmost to extinguish the same. The members present also accepted the Asst. Secy-Treasurer's statement that the Engineer and Night Watchman erred in their judgment when they were convinced that the fire had been extinguished and did not take the further action he suggests, in order that their conviction might be established by certainty.\n\n(3) The Commission approved the action of the Department in sending 40 children to the Elkhorn School and decided to record their regret that for reasons given in the Departmental telegrams, the remaining pupils could not be sent to other schools.\n\n(4) They instructed the Field Secretary to convey to the Principal and staff agents, an expression of the Commission's high appreciation of their conduct during the critical situation created by the fire, and approved the action of those who decided to return to their homes until other appointments might be available for any who desire to receive them.\"\n\nThe Principal, the Rev. A. Fraser, has been informed by our Commission that they will continue his salary until the end of June, and they trust that the Department may permit him and his family to occupy the Principal's residence until that date. As the Commission have no other appointment to offer Mr. Fraser, he will endeavour to secure ministerial work in one of our Church's Missionary Dioceses, where his splendid knowledge of the Cree language will be of special service. While remaining on the school premises he will exercise careful supervision of the remaining school property and equipment, and carry out any\ninstructions our Commission may give him with regard to the disposal of the supplies, wood fuel, live stock, implements, etc.\n\nThe services of a Farm Instructor will also be retained to look after the live stock, and assist in any way required either by Mr. Fraser or by our Commission.\n\nIt is the understanding of our Commission that the 71 mattresses and all the buildings except the Church, and all the land, including the hay land mentioned in your letter of March 12th, 1928, No.126-1-9 (and gazetted April 7th, 1928, page 3263) will pass under your Department's care as soon as our Commission have been able to dispose of the year's supply of hay, wood-fuel, flour, etc., and other items mentioned above.\n\nThe local Indian Agent will receive the study and exercise books which were rescued from the fire, and our Commission has addressed an inquiry to Mr. Fraser, the Principal, with regard to the possibility of disposing of the other items referred to.\n\nIn order that this matter may be handled in a way that will be satisfactory to both your Department and our Commission, it is recommended that power be given to Mr. Fraser as representing our Commission, and to Mr. Lovell, the local Indian Agent, as representing your Department, to deal with this important matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nSir:\n\nAs instructed by Department telegram dated March 24th, 1933, I left on the 26th for The Pas and investigated thoroughly conditions relating to the recent fire at the MacKay Indian Residential School. I herewith present my report.\n\nThe members of the staff and the pupils had all left the school - only the Fraser family remained. I investigated thoroughly the burned ruins, giving special attention to the furnace, jacket heater, and stove situated in the boys' playroom. The furnace was in good condition and in view of the pit in front of the furnace door, which is cemented on all sides and the bottom, a fire could scarcely occur, even though one might be somewhat careless.\n\nThe brick wall of the boiler is 18 ft. long and from this wall to the cement basement wall is 6 ft. The jacket heater is situated in this space and would be located about 10 ft. back from a line continuing past the front of the furnace and about 4 ft. away from the furnace wall. Attached is a sketch showing the exact location of boiler and jacket heater.\n\nDry jackpine had been thrown in a pile beyond the jacket heater in section on sketch marked \"A\". The wood had not been piled and no doubt some of it was on the floor around the heater. There is a further possibility.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\npossibility that small pieces of bark and other dirt had accumulated around the wood and about the jacket heater. In view of the carelessness displayed by those in charge, this condition could easily have existed, making a most suitable setting for a fire.\n\nThe children bath on Friday and Saturday nights and plenty of hot water is needed. The jacket heater is usually brought into use on these occasions. The boys finished bathing at 9 p.m. Saturday, the 18th, and no doubt a fire was still on in the heater. The night watchman, Leonard Fraser, states he did not check conditions around the heater on taking over at 9 p.m., as he was not aware it had been in use. This statement appears too absurd to be credible, and personally I am sure he did know, but I am also sure that his sense of responsibility would not cause him to check up and see if everything was safe and in satisfactory condition.\n\nA coal or spark from the heater, and all will agree that jackpine gives off frequent sparks, dropping on the wood and accumulated dirt, could easily smoulder along for some time and gradually work into a fire - especially under such favourable conditions.\n\nThe night watchman stated he fixed the furnace at 6 A.M., leaving the room at 6.30. At 7.15, only three quarters of an hour later, he and Mr. Wilson, the engineer, smelled smoke in the kitchen where they were enjoying tea, and going to the furnace room, found the jacket heater wood a mass of fire - the flames reaching to the ceiling. There is no way to prove that Mr. Fraser did attend the fire between 6 and 6.30 a.m., but if he did, it seems strange that such a fire could start.\nstart in thirty to forty minutes. This fire was presumably put out and the wood moved. The watchman stated he detected sparks along the top of the cement wall marked \"B\". The tin ceiling did not fit tight against this wall, allowing the flames to light the dust and dirt which undoubtedly had accumulated. He put out the sparks, but his responsibility did not prompt him to remove any of the tin ceiling, nor to open the floor above. He states he suggested doing this, but Mr. Wilson thought it unnecessary. It will be noted that this fire was detected at 7.15 a.m., and no doubt twenty or thirty minutes at least was required in extinguishing it, and yet no one remained on guard\u2014all were seated in the dining room at 8 a.m. Some of the children claim they detected smoke coming through the floor shortly after being seated for breakfast, and as the alarm was actually given about 8.10 a.m., one can only conclude the first fire had never been extinguished and that the disaster occurred as a result of gross carelessness and lack of responsibility both on the part of Mr. Wilson and Mr. L. Fraser; in fact, both failed to notify the Principal that the first blaze had occurred and this fact only came to his attention as he sat down to breakfast, when the Matron remarked that a fire had existed. Rev. Mr. Fraser stated that he was astounded and rebuked them for not informing him, and yet he went on serving breakfast instead of immediately checking up to see if all was well. Four or five minutes later the kitchen matron rushed in with news of smoke appearing in the kitchen. A hasty examination was made. The Principal stated there was no water pressure on the third floor.\nthird floor and he ordered the pumps started. The rumour is that Mr. Wilson started the engine, but it stopped almost immediately as there was no gasoline in the tank.\n\nThere was some pressure on the second floor, but too weak to be of any assistance. The fire hose did leak, as do all fabric hose, but they did not have any splits or punctures, and as soon as they had become soaked, the leaking or oozing through would have stopped. I feel that the reference by Mr. Wilson that the hose leaked was made to cover up the fact that when he came on duty at 7 a.m., he was busy making tea and carrying trays to the lady members of the staff, instead of starting the pump and attending to the furnace.\n\nIt will be noted by the sketch that a stove was kept in the boys' basement (this room is marked \"C\") and I was informed by Mr. Wilson and different Indian boys that a fire was burning in it on Saturday night. The sketch also shows the stovepipe connections. At point \"D\" the pipe passed through a door into the unused hallway and turned through an opening in the cement wall connecting by a \"T\" with the jacket heater. The door at \"D\", through which the pipe passed, was not in use. A foot of cement wall ran above the door frame and on top of this cement wall rested the wood frame of the school. At the side opposite the furnace room, a ventilating shaft ran to the dormitories. I am pointing out these facts because, had the door at \"D\" caught fire, it might have lighted the sill above the door, or again, the stovepipes at \"F\" may have been disconnected enough to let a spark drop into the wood directly below. This theory might be discarded by some as Rev. Mr. Fraser declares that\ndeclares that he went into the boys' playroom immediately after the warning of fire and that there was no smoke. I was unable to locate any boys who had visited the playroom prior to breakfast. I asked the night watchman if he had visited this room when coming on duty or during the night, and he replied \"No!\" One would at least expect a night watchman to visit all points where a fire was kept or where a fire had been in use during the day.\n\nOne other theory was presented by Rev. Mr. Fraser and his son, the watchman, and although practically impossible, I present same as it throws another light on the situation.\n\nThe boiler has a clean-out door marked \"C\", which is almost opposite the jacket heater. Rev. Mr. Fraser stated this door got hot and that perhaps wood rolled against it. The night man stated he had seen it red hot at times and that as there was no fire in the jacket heater, the fire must have started from the clean-out door. Prior to this, the impression given by both the Frasers was that the fire started from wood around the jacket heater - the story here changed to the boiler door.\n\nHowever, if the floor had been as clean about the jacket heater as these men claimed, it would also, of necessity, need to be in front of the clean-out door of the furnace as it is almost directly opposite and only twenty to thirty inches away. The men agreed that to start a fire, the wood, of necessity, would need to be against the door, which is four to five inches above the floor level. This condition would necessitate more than one small stick of wood lying around and would indicate,\n\nas I have\nas I have already intimated, that no check had been made on the condition existing about this heater. They went even further and stated that Mr. Wilson never meant to convey the impression that the fire started from the jacket heater as no fire had been lit in this heater for ten or twelve days. However, Wilson, in his statement to the R.C.M.Police closed the statement with the following sentence: \"Wood must have fallen against the door of the jacket heater and if it did a fire could easily have started.\" Undoubtedly, this indicates that he believed or knew a fire had been kept in the heater. I cannot help but ask how the Rev. Fraser or his son knew that Mr. Wilson did not intend to convey the impression that there was fire in the heater, nor can I understand why they now state that no fire had been there for ten or twelve days. I have a wire from Mr. Wilson and in spite of his statement to the R.C.M.Police, he writes, \"No fire in jacket heater for ten days previous to Saturday eighteenth\". It will be noted the first statements, all of which were forwarded by Mr. Lovell, The Agent, would lead one to believe that the jacket heater was the likely source of the fire. Now the scene changes, and all state that the heater had not been in use.\n\nRev. Mr. Fraser admits that he was last in the furnace room Saturday morning around 10 a.m. He states there was no fire in the heater then, although he does not admit opening the heater door.\n\nLeonard Fraser, night man, admits he did not examine the heater when he came on duty at 9 p.m. He stated there was no use to go near it as it had not been alight for\nalight for ten or twelve days.\n\nSaturday night is bath night, and the boys finished at 9 p.m., and several stated that they had lots of hot water. The jacket heater was usually in use on wash days and bath days.\n\nMy contention is that the Principal, Rev. Fraser, did not have close enough contact with school operations to know when the heater was in use. I am informed by certain boys and by one who actually attended to the fire, that the heater had been in use several times during the past ten days and was lit on Saturday, the 18th.\n\nFurther, if the night watchman paid no more attention to his work on other nights, than he did on the night in question, neither was he in a position to know whether it had been in use or not. When I informed him of my information relating to it, he was then not so sure and would not sign a declaration that the heater contained no fire. He further qualified his previous statement in reference to the smoke door in the boiler, and said he had only seen it red hot on one occasion and then the boiler had been fired heavily for some hours.\n\nI have not been able to consult Mr. Wilson personally and am at a loss to know why he changed his story and how it now happens to coincide with the one told by the Frasers.\n\nI am more prepared to accept the boys' statement and believe that the heater had been used. The other theory would perhaps have looked better, but is weak, in that an unusually hot and prolonged fire would be needed.\n\nMr. Wilson, in a remark to the Matron, Miss Wyatt, stated that he felt the fire had started six or seven hours earlier.\nhours earlier, which statement may be true. A spark or coal from the heater may have rolled on the floor in the dirt and smouldered for some time before actually bursting into flames. There is also a possibility that the night man did not visit the furnace at the time stated, and even if he had, his indifference, as indicated on so many other occasions, makes it impossible to accept his statement that all was well at 6.30.\n\nIn closing, I wish to point out that from the first statements submitted by Mr. Lovell, contradictions appeared. Mr. Wilson stated the hose were not good and that he had 45 lbs. pressure. The Principal and night man state that pressure was low and hose were in working order.\n\nWilson states tin was removed from the ceiling to make sure the fire was out. Leonard Fraser contradicts this and states that he suggested getting an axe to break in the floor, but Wilson thought that unnecessary.\n\nThese first statements conveyed the impression that the fire started from the jacket heater - now this has been contradicted.\n\nHowever, from my own observations, from the careful perusal of all statements, and from my check up on Rev. Mr. Fraser, his son, and the Indian boys, and communication from Mr. Wilson, I can only arrive at the following conclusions, namely:\n\n1. The fire started as a result of wood and bark near the jacket heater, which no doubt became lighted by a spark or coal falling either from the draft opening or ash door of the heater.\n\n2. The fire may have started from the pipes leading from the heater in the boys' playroom. This stove was attended to solely by the boys, and had the door through which it passed, caught fire or had the pipe become disconnected at the cement wall, a spark could easily drop on the wood piled in section marked \"A\".\nTo accept this theory one would need to disregard the Principal's statement that he visited this room first and found no smoke. Some statements must be disregarded or we have no cause for the fire.\n\nI believe the fire could have been extinguished if proper action had been followed when first found, and can only attribute the disaster to carelessness and lack of responsibility on the part of Mr. Wilson, the engineer, and Mr. L. Fraser, the night watchman. The positions these two men held are of vital importance in a school such as this, and I feel that men holding these positions should be appointed by the Department. They would then receive closer supervision by the Principal and in every way would need to measure up to the Department's expectations.\n\nI regret this report does not clear matters as it should, but I think the Department will agree that too much time had elapsed after the fire before I arrived. The staff and children had scattered, making it difficult to secure corroborative evidence in connection with the various statements. However, the actually starting of the fire may never be definitely known, but the investigation shows clearly the spirit of indifference, which undoubtedly existed - the lack of a strong guiding hand as Principal - the folly of allowing the employment of any but the best and most competent men to fill such responsible positions.

This is for the sending of the remaining pupils home over the Hudson's Bay Line. I also attach an account for $3.04 in favor of the Western Trading Store, as some clothing had to be bought for these children before sending them home. Clothing was bought to the value of $13.35 but as I had a balance on hand of $5.31, I paid this amount to leave this balance of $8.04.\n\nI attach herewith a statement of the expenditure of the $500 wired here, and trust this will meet with your approval. Receipts 33 to 42 inclusive were attached to my March 1933 returns, and I enclose herewith two Canadian National Telegraph receipts together with five receipts for food from Eddie & Fowler.\n\nThe list of the pupils sent to Elkhorn were attached to my letter No. 1844-136 of March 27th, 1933, and I attach herewith a list of the pupils sent home, with their register number and age.\n\nI trust this is what is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, April 24, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo, regarding the destruction by fire of the MacKay Indian Residential School, I have to say that the Department has received reports from Mr. Inspector Hamilton, the local Indian Agent and the R.C.M.P., relative to the matter.\n\nThe statements of the various members of the staff are somewhat conflicting. There is no doubt that there was great carelessness manifested on the part of Mr. L. Fraser, the night watchman, and Mr. Wilson, the engineer. If they had taken proper precautions after the first outbreak of fire around the jacket heater, there would have been no second outbreak which destroyed the building. The Principal, the Rev. A. Fraser, cannot be held entirely free from criticism and blame in the matter. It is considered the fire could have been extinguished if proper action had been followed when first found. The Department must attribute this disaster to carelessness and lack of responsibility on the part of the night watchman and the engineer. The Department could not approve of the re-appointment of either of these men to any of the other Indian residential schools under the auspices of your Commission.\n\nThe Principal will be allowed to occupy the principal's residence until approximately the end of June, next, as he should assist the local Agent with regard to the disposal of the supplies and equipment on hand. Instructions have been forwarded to Mr. Inspector Hamilton to arrange with your Commission for the distribution of all supplies, etc., remaining on the premises.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, April 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11 of the 4th instant, reporting on your investigation relating to the destruction by fire of the Mackay Indian Residential School. Your report and the report of the investigation made by the church authorities, the local Indian Agent and the Mounted Police have been considered. It would appear that the statements of the members of the staff vary from each other to a more or less extent. There was evident carelessness on the part of Mr. L. Fraser, the night watchman, and Mr. Wilson, the engineer, in not taking every precaution to see that the fire which first occurred was thoroughly extinguished.\n\nThe Department does not intend to take any further steps in this matter. The Anglican Church authorities, under whose auspices the school was conducted, are being informed that the burning of the building must be attributed to carelessness on the part of the two members of the staff referred to above. I wish to thank you for the report which you submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G.

Their nearest residential school is at Elkhorn 750 to 1000 miles away. A number of children from our Cree missions have been sent to Elkhorn, with the result that parents are unable to see their children for several years. On my visit to these people they begged that something be done to provide a school in their own area.\n\nI am aware that the late Canon Gould, formerly secretary of M.S.C.C., had such a proposed school in his estimates for several years, and in his last report to the Board of Management M.S.C.C. he referred to the need as urgent.\n\nAt a meeting of the Executive Committee, M.S.C.C., held in Winnipeg last November, I was given authority to make personal appeal to the Department of Indian Affairs for such a school. I have refrained from pressing the matter because I am of the opinion that your Department may not on account of war conditions entertain any suggested extension of schools. In duty to my people, and being well advised of the need, I would plead that such a school, north of The Pas, within the Diocese of Keewatin, be given first consideration if, and when, the Department considers extension possible. I thus write at this time that the matter may be kept before your notice.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The only provision made in the 1940-41 estimates for the construction of schools is a small appropriation to complete one or two schools already in the process of construction and to build one or two Indian day schools in respect to which a definite commitment had been made prior to the outbreak of the war.\n\nI desire to assure you, however, that we shall be glad to file Your Lordship's letter for future reference and carefully review the claim of these Indians for a residential school when the funds at our disposal justify us in taking such action.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nBishopstowe,\nKenora, Ontario.\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI beg to refer again to your personal letter of October 10th and to my reply of the 21st.\n\nNow that the authorized pupilage at Elkhorn has been reduced to 130 at our request we are experiencing continual difficulty through our inability to take children who are anxious to enter the school. After the report of Dr. Simes that the dormitories were overcrowded, we have been doing our best to restrict the attendance. Our Principal has been under continual pressure and even now the number is near 140. I have been in close contact with Inspector Hamilton and he has agreed with us that we should not receive any more pupils, so that we have been persuading various Anglican parents to send their children to Brandon, though they do this with reluctance as the children naturally prefer to be with their friends from the home reserve.\n\nAs I have heard from time to time that the Government is contemplating taking over the American Hospital north of The Pas, I beg to express again our Anglican desire for a residential school in the northern part of Manitoba in the hope that some of the present hospital buildings may be made available for this purpose. It is not only the fact that at the moment we have 60 children from the Northern part of the Province attending Elkhorn, and are being compelled to refuse admission to Southern children, but it is quite evident to us that some of the overcrowding at Prince Albert results from the lack of school facilities in Northern Manitoba. A number of the pupils now at Prince Albert could very readily go to The Pas if a school were established there.\n\nI trust that the claim of our Church will be taken into consideration if the acquisition of the American Hospital is definitely concluded. The fact that since the loss of the Mackay School we have had only one Anglican institution in a province in which our Church has a larger number of Indian members than any other, and that we can now accommodate only 130 at Elkhorn against 355 for the United Church and 340 for the Roman Catholic is surely an evidence of real need. It is true that our request was for a number of years for a new school somewhere on the Hudson\nBay line between The Pas and Churchill. The Bishop of Keewatin has continually urged this need upon our Commission and believes that a school is urgently needed at Gillam or some point north of it. Certainly we have in that area a very large number of Indian members of our Church and they appear to have little educational opportunity. It is evident, however, that the hospital site north of The Pas has a most central location and could readily be reached by railway from the north.\n\nCommending this matter to your usual kind attention,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.M. Alderwood\nSecretary.\n\nHAA:WS\nOttawa, February 14, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nRe: Residential School Facilities - The Pas Area,\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 9th, and have noted with a great deal of interest the suggestions contained therein.\n\nI have had a feeling for several years that additional school facilities should be provided in northern Manitoba, particularly in The Pas area. I am not in a position to state, however, with the limited information at my disposal, whether these facilities should consist of a Residential School or a number of improved Day Schools or both. There has been in recent years a great deal of criticism against a Residential School in northern Manitoba. If I remember correctly a certain amount of this criticism came from one of your own missionaries. When one of our officials visited The Pas about a year or so ago, the Indians with whom he discussed a number of matters expressed opposition to the establishment of a Residential School for the education of their children.\n\nIt is altogether likely that the hospital to which you refer in your communication will be taken over and operated by this Department in the immediate future. In this connection, it has been my hope that a representative of your Commission might have found it convenient to visit this hospital and by a visit, determine its suitability for educational purposes,\neducational purposes, or at least part of the accommodation available. I regret that with the limited staff at our disposal here we cannot send out an official to make a report on the suitability of the buildings, either from the standpoint of the buildings themselves or the area in which they are situated. I do feel, however, that some practical steps should be taken before our post-war building program is finally started. Doctor Moore, our Superintendent of Medical Services, is likely to visit Winnipeg within the next month or so and I shall be glad to ask him to discuss the matter with you then.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Director.\n\nReverend H.

Mr. Hoey has asked me to see you and have a discussion regarding educational facilities in The Pas area. I will be visiting The Pas in connection with our taking over the hospital built by the U.S. Army at that point. There is a number of buildings available there and it might be possible to establish a school at that point in the near future.

I am holding myself free in the latter part of March to visit The Pas and shall look forward to the pleasure of inspecting the former American Hospital buildings in your company in order that we may ascertain if some of them are suitable for residential school purposes.

I have been wondering if it would be possible for you to visit The Pas on the date suggested and look over the buildings with the object of determining their suitability for Residential School purposes. I have in mind one or two of the smaller buildings that might with little cost be reconstructed for classroom use. If you could do so without any great inconvenience, it would, I feel sure, be helpful to have with you an experienced Residential School principal or someone who has had experience in the actual administration of such a plant. Doctor Moore will be registered at the Fort Garry Hotel. It is just possible that you may be able to get in touch with him by telephone. I am sending him a copy of this communication.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nReverend H. A.

I shall endeavour to get in touch with him and have been holding myself in readiness for a short trip to The Pas. If it is possible to make the visit about the 28th it will suit me admirably and I shall endeavour to take someone with me whose counsel will be of value.\n\nI trust that out of this visit it may be found possible to establish a school which will meet the need that has been manifested.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood,\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 3)\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nFollowing out your kind suggestion I was able to visit the American Army Camp at Clearwater Lake last week in company with Dr. P.E. Moore and Mr. C. Buck. We thoroughly surveyed the buildings and examined some of them with special care to ascertain their construction. I have no doubt that the other gentlemen will be making their report as to the suitability of these buildings for residential school purposes, but I now beg to give you my personal conclusions.\n\nHaving in mind the splendid school erected at Carcross last year by the use of three large prefabricated buildings, I was clear about the possibility of repeating this method at Clearwater Lake. It would, of course, be regarded as something for a limited number of years only but I have no doubt that a school could be put into operation on this site with a minimum cost as compared with new construction. We found the buildings well-made and a number of them insulated. All would require to be protected in this way and probably some additional material on the exterior would make them warmer. The standard type has an inside measurement of $5\\frac{1}{2}$' x $19\\frac{3}{4}$' with ceiling a little less than $8$'. As to the suitability of such buildings for school purposes, I have already expressed my conviction that for Northern bush pupils there is positive advantage in housing them in simple surroundings not too far removed from their natural habitations. I selected a group of buildings which seemed to me to be most suitable for the purpose by reason of their location. They are situated on the main road entering the Camp and are as far away as possible, both from the Hospital and the Airfield. By moving some buildings across the road and connecting them with others I believe a workable institution could readily be obtained. This would allow us to work with only three or four units so that there would be as little need as possible of going out of doors when passing from one part of the school to another. I enclose a rough plan which suggests what I have in mind. This is, of course, purely tentative as I have not yet been able to work out the total floor space thus provided in comparison with other schools. I have had in mind a school of about 100 pupils and believe these could be easily accommodated.\n\nPhotograph attached.\nSome of the Camp buildings are already splendidly equipped for institutional purposes and especially the dining rooms, kitchen and washrooms. The whole Camp offers many advantages as compared with a new site which might be chosen for school purposes. It is on a splendid gravelled road, running to the Pas 18 miles away, and is also on the railway with a spur line running within a short distance of the buildings. Electric light is laid on to the Camp and it is possible that the water supply might also be used and the Camp arrangements for sewage disposal. The question of heating the buildings would have to be faced. There are a number of Duo-Therm heaters in use in the Camp which burn fuel oil. This method might be costly and a central heating plan might have to be installed, but these are details which the experts of the Department would doubtless work out. A great amount of work has been done in constructing gravelled roads in the Camp and in levelling the ground. Immediately behind the buildings suggested there is a large area of level ground which would be quite suitable for recreational purposes. It seemed to me that the soil would readily lend itself to the purpose of a school garden. Other points in favour of the site seemed to me to be the proximity of medical and hospital care; the fuller social life for staff members by reason of the number of hospital employees; and the possible openings for graduate pupils as wardmaids in the hospital.\n\nI was glad to have the opportunity of meeting both Indian Agent Lovell and Dr. Yule. I found both of them in favour of the general proposal and confident that a real need existed for an Anglican school of at least 100 in this area. Bearing in mind that the Mackay School has never been replaced and that 60 or more children from The Pas and north of it have continued to go to Elkhorn, I found general agreement that much of the feeling of unrest of both parents and children arose from the fact of taking children so far away from home. From missionary workers I received assurance that there would be no difficulty whatever in obtaining a large number of pupils, as in several areas there are numbers of children without school facilities at the present time.\n\nAfter hearing my report our Commission on April 10th went on record as warmly endorsing the proposal and I am directed to request that the Indian Affairs Branch will take over a sufficient number of these buildings to enable a workable institution to be put in operation in the near future.\n\nI shall await your further word with interest and meanwhile, remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHAA:WS\nEncls.\n\nIndian Affairs.

On most of the Northern Reserves the Day Schools are not an outstanding success. This is due to the fact that it is impossible to get regular attendance. The Indians, who get their living by hunting, fishing and trapping, do not live in large groups, but rather in small groups and communities where they think the hunting, trapping and fishing is good. The day schools are generally situated where the main group live and where the trading post and Church are. It is only the comparatively small number of children who live at the main settlement all the year round can possibly attend the school regularly.\n\nAfter the children have been away from school five or six months, speaking nothing but Cree, it is practically the same as making a complete new start every time they come back to School. It is little wonder therefore that few progress very far.\n\nThe only solution I see, is for the children of the northern reserves, where the parents engage in hunting and trapping, be sent to a boarding school.\n\nThe new Anglican Boarding School, the Department proposes establishing north of the Pas in the buildings now used by the U.S. forces, will fill a much needed want. I trust the Department will get it into operation as soon as possible.\n\nSamuel Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\nThe day schools are making as much progress as they have ever done.

I trust the Department will get it into operation as soon as possible.\n\nThe buildings, both classrooms and teacher's residences, of the day schools, are for the most part in poor condition and hardly worth repairing. We put in the Estimates for 1945-46 for a number of new buildings to replace them, but the Department have informed me they cannot be allowed. They certainly should be built at the first possible opportunity.\n\nIt might help matters if more food was provided for a more substantial mid-day meal. I mean a quantity of dehydrated foods, such as peas, beans, lentils, potatoes, etc. be provided as well as the biscuits and some for the older children taught to make a well cooked mid-day meal for the children. This would increase attendance, teach the children some domestic science and be beneficial to their health.\nSt. James' Church\nFlin Flon, Manitoba\n\nRev. R. B. Hossefield, B.A., R.D.\nRector\n\nSuperintendent-General of Indian Affairs\nDept. of the Interior, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIf I may first introduce myself:\nI have been a missionary to the Indians about The Pas, Man., for the past 20 years, have taught in four Indian day schools, and was a frequent visitor at the residential school at The Pas (the Mackay School) before its destruction by fire in 1933.\n\nIt happened that I had an opportunity 3 days ago to visit the American army air post near The Pas, where, I understand, you have plans to take over the hospital building for an Indian sanatorium and other buildings for a residential school.\n\nMay I thank you first, on behalf of all of us who have the Indians' welfare at heart, for the promise of the sanatorium, so very tragically needed.\n\nBut I have for years been a determined opponent of the residential schools. I have shared the opinion of scores of my fellow missionaries, of traders, of Indian Agents, and others who are in contact with Indians, that the boarding school Indian is a spoiled Indian. And now I have changed my ideas; at least, I see a wonderful opportunity for you and for the Indians.\n\nMy two principal objections to the residential schools were, (1) that they bring the child up in surroundings and atmosphere so utterly different from the simple Indian dwelling that he cannot apply to his own home the techniques of living that he learned at school; and (2) that in too many cases the trades he learns in the far-off school he has no slightest opportunity to practice on his return to the Reserve... e.g. our children from this bush country have been going to Elkhorn and learning tractor-farming. There never will be tractor-farming on these northern reserves: the land is all wrong for it.\n\nBut now you have a different situation. You have at present to your hand a group of small buildings, at least comparable in size to the Indians' homes, and they are in surroundings like those of the northern reserves.\n\nI venture to suggest, then, that you do not spoil these two admirable features by bringing the little buildings together under one roof, and laying out the land to field crops; but rather that you aim to demonstrate and teach right there what a northern reserve could and should be like.\n\nConcretely, I suggest that 15 to 20 children be housed in each separate building, which would be their home, under a member of the staff, who would be house-mother and also live there. The class rooms would become day-schools, and when the day's work was done there the children would go \"home\" just as on the Reserves, away from the atmosphere of chalk and geometry. As far as possible each household would consist of children from the same reserve, so that they would be among friends and the newcomer would not be afraid.\nEach house would have its home-size garden, tended by its own family, who would there learn something of the quantities of seed a normal family would require instead of how many bushels of potatoes to the acre.\n\nInside each house the older girls would have a share in the decorating, choosing colors, making curtains, studying different kinds of floor coverings, all on a set budget per house per year... the houses are uniform to start with.\n\nThe boys would learn to make small improvements, fences, garden walks, pantry shelves, etc., and one house might keep chickens, another pigs, and a third goats, or cows, the produce of each establishment being pooled and a fair price credited to that house for improvements.\n\nIn short, the whole place would be a model community, or junior reserve. Chief and councillors should be chosen among the children to introduce them to the processes of democratic government (which is an alien thing to the Cree), and would have powers similar to those of a student council in a city school, under the guidance of the principal or his deputy.\n\nTrophies, in the form of flags to be displayed on a staff in the front garden, would be awarded to the best-kept house and perhaps the best-kept garden; and in general a spirit of friendly rivalry between the houses should be fostered.\n\nAnd when the children returned at last to their own reserves, they would be able to practice all the skills they learned at school: the girls would be able to accumulate, little by little, the same simple equipment they had in their school home; and the boys would be able to garden in the way they had there, instead of coming down from diesel tractors to grub-hoes.\n\nAnother point: this site is on the shore of Clearwater Lake (\"Atikameg Lake\" on the maps) which is fairly well stocked with fish. I believe that commercial fishing has been closed on this lake for two seasons past, or very strictly limited in quantity. It might be possible to arrange with the Province of Manitoba for net fishing to be allowed only to the school, for its own use. (Since there are two small summer resorts on the lake, angling would probably have to be allowed the summer visitors).\n\nI hope very much that these suggestions will not reach you too late. I believe you have here an opportunity to change the residential schools from a positive evil, such as they appear to many of us to be now, into a wonderfully helpful device towards the education of the Indians in the art of living a healthy, happy and self-supporting rural life.\n\nIf anything in the above is not clear, please feel free, should you so desire, to refer it back to me, and\n\nBelieve me, yours for Indian welfare,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI am writing in similar terms to Dr Alderwood in Winnipeg, and to the field secretary of our missionary society at 604 Jarvis St., Toronto.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moore, M.D., D.P.H.\nActing Superintendent of Medical Services\nMay 14, 1945,\n\nAttention Mr. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey: Re: Proposed School north of the Pas\n\nI am in receipt of a long and interesting letter from the Rev. R.E. Horsefield who tells me that he has also written to you along the same lines. I am looking forward to the opportunity of discussing this matter with you but think it well to say at once that I find myself in very general agreement with Mr. Horsefield. You will recall that both in the case of Wabasca and this proposed School in northern Manitoba I have urged that we should avoid anything like a large Institution and aim at log buildings of a simpler type in which the children might live under conditions much more akin to their natural environment. I think we might carry out a very valuable experiment along the lines suggested by Mr. Horsefield and that the present buildings could be adapted for that purpose at a very reasonable cost.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you on the 18th or 19th, with kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nN.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\nOttawa, May 18, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nRe: Proposed School - The Pas Area, Manitoba.\n\nI have hesitated to reply to your letter of May 14th until now so that I would have an opportunity to discuss Mr. Horsefield's proposals with you personally and this opportunity, as you know, occurred this morning.\n\nIt would, I feel sure, prove helpful to the officials and to myself if we could have from you, representing the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, a definite proposal with respect to the establishment of a Residential School at The Pas, utilizing to the utmost extent possible the buildings now available. In this submission, you should indicate the exact enrolment you have in mind, the per capita grant that in your judgment should be paid, the course of studies that your Commission would be prepared to provide for these Indians and any comment you may care to offer in detail on Mr. Horsefield's suggestions. When this submission reaches me, I shall be glad to pass it on to the Minister for his consideration.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend H. A.

Allan Esq.,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Allan,\n\nWhen you were up here last fall the Indians and the halfbreeds talked to you about a proposed \"improved day school\" to accommodate the Indian and halfbreed children of the district. They pointed out that the educational facilities are inadequate here to properly take care of the native children. The drawbacks of sending their children out to mission schools etc., were pointed out.\n\nThe suggestion was, and still is, that the Department of Indian Affairs, in cooperation with the Manitoba Department of Education, build an up-to-date school to house the children of Big Eddy, some from The Pas, and the Indian Reserve. This school, it is suggested, should be of the \"consolidated\" type, providing transportation and lunches at noon.\n\nAt the present time there are approximately 45 Indian children in Elkhorn, and the parents are not satisfied with the arrangements. There are about the same number here at home, which is more than the present school can accommodate.\n\nI understand from the Department of Education that arrangements had been made to use the present school for this type of operation, but there are too many children.\n\nThe number of children should never be an excuse for failing to provide educational facilities. In fact, a large number of children in one place should be enough in itself to guarantee the provision of more modern and adequate educational services.\n\nThe only answer it seems is the building of a school jointly by the two departments concerned. I am sending a copy of this letter to the provincial department, sincerely hoping that you will reopen your negotiations with respect to the education of these children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.R. Richards.\nOttawa, July 28th, 1945.\n\nMr. B. R. Richards, M.L.A., Box 42, The Pas, Manitoba.\n\nYour letter of the 19th instant addressed to Mr. D.J. Allan of this branch has been referred to me for attention.\n\nNo special funds have been provided in the Current Year's Appropriation for the purpose mentioned in your letter. Consequently, I regret that no action can be taken at the present time. However, the necessity for additional new schools in the Pas area have been receiving our consideration and it is hoped to make provision for new schools in the Post-War Program.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nWinnipeg, Man., July 17, 1945.\n\nREPORT ON YORK FACTORY AND SHANNATTAWA DISTRICTS inspected between June 26th and 30th, 1945.\n\nFOX LAKE BAND\n\nThere are about 30 children of school age.

Hoey,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: PROPOSED SCHOOL, The Pas area, Manitoba\n\nI regret that so long a time has elapsed since the receipt of your letter Reference 128-1-1, of May 18th. I had to leave the city shortly after it came to hand and have since been absent from the office or greatly burdened by reason of lack of help.\n\nI now beg to refer to our previous correspondence and to my detailed report after visiting the American Army buildings at Clear Water Lake in company with Dr. Moore. This matter has also been placed before the Missionary Society of our Church and I am now able to make a definite request.\n\n(1) It is our conviction that a residential school for Anglican Indians has really been needed in The Pas area ever since the MacKay School was destroyed by fire twelve years ago. We have been caring for as many as 60 children at Elkhorn who came from The Pas and points further north. This has always been considered an unsatisfactory arrangement and has caused much discontent both among parents and children. We believe firmly that wherever possible all of our pupils should return home for the summer months but the cost of transportation between Elkhorn and these northern points is exceedingly high. Furthermore, we have just been asked if we can increase the number of pupils from the Pas area for the coming school year, as the payment of family allowances in the area will provide far more pupils than the Day Schools in the area will be able to handle. Missionaries of our Church in this northern area have asserted that many children will be served by the proposed school who are without educational facilities at the present time.\n\n(2) The Clear Water Lake site appears to us to be eminently suitable for such a school. It is directly linked with the railway and has a good road to The Pas. The large lake and the heavy bush around suggest healthy living conditions and the fact that hospital and full medical care are available gives the site an enormous advantage over anything else that might be suggested in the area. The opportunity of having electric light, the possibility of having a supply of tested water and the many advantages accruing from the presence of the hospital staff, all make the site desirable. The buildings will require to be improved and made warmer for winter conditions, and at first sight did not appear to be very suitable for the purpose. However, I am glad to have had my conviction of their suitability reinforced by the verdict of such an experienced Indian missionary as the Rev. R.B.Horsefield.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 3)\nAfter visiting the camp he became very enthusiastic as to the possibilities for establishing a residential school of a new kind. In brief, he would aim to retain something of the simplicity in which many of these children have lived. He would endeavour to keep children drawn from the different reserves together, so that instead of a large institution under one roof there would be a number of large families doing a great deal of their own work, and providing their own recreation and other activities. It has been my own conclusion that a large modern building is not really suitable for our purpose in northern areas, and that a school should consist of a number of smaller buildings, preferably of log construction, so that our children might feel at home and receive training of a type suited to the life they will probably lead. Mr. Horsefield's plan might be a little idealistic but I believe it offers a valuable suggestion. My conclusion, when visiting the camp, was that a number of the buildings should be moved a short distance and connected up and that this would greatly reduce the work of the staff.\n\nWe, therefore, urge that the Department take over a sufficient number of these camp buildings to provide accommodation for 125 or 150 pupils. From a comparison with other schools we believe that a fair per capita grant would be $170.00. It would be our aim to follow the Manitoba Provincial curriculum as far as possible, especially stressing English, simple Arithmetic and such studies as tend towards intelligent citizenship. We believe that the group system suggested would increase the possibilities of giving real training in gardening and that the environment would make it possible for the boys to acquire skill in fishing and trapping while at the school. We understand that the R.C.A.F. intend to maintain a small staff at the Airport, and it occurs to us that from their personnel we might be able to secure help in giving the boys that simple mechanical training which is demanded by modern needs. The Sanatorium already established has been asking for Indian girls as helpers, and we believe the school might find an outlet for many of its graduates in this institution.\n\nI trust that this matter may soon be brought to a conclusion and that we may be enabled to plan for something different in education for northern Indian children on the site suggested.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, August 2nd, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nReverend Doctor Alderwood of the M.S.C.C. has been in communication with Mr. Hoey regarding the establishment of a Residential School in The Pas area. As you are probably aware Doctor Alderwood and Doctor Moore visited the American Army buildings in Clear Water Lake and I understand Doctor Moore intends to take over the Hospital facilities at that point.\n\nAt Mr. Hoey's request I am writing to Mr. Doucet and forwarding copies of correspondence that we have received. Mr. Doucet is being directed to return to Winnipeg, Saturday, August 11th and we would like to have a meeting between Doctor Alderwood, Mr. Doucet and yourself to discuss the matter. Then, Mr. Doucet could go to The Pas to look over the site. I do not know exactly when the train leaves for The Pas but I suggest that you reserve a berth for him either for Saturday night or Sunday morning. I think you know that during the period August 6th to August 9th Mr. Doucet will be at the Qu'Appelle Residential School, Labret, Saskatchewan.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 2nd, 1945.\n\nDear Doucet:\n\nMr. Hoey has asked me to forward to you the enclosed letter which is a copy of one just received from Reverend Doctor Alderwood of the M.S.O.C.\n\nThe proposals covered in the letter were discussed personally with Mr. Hoey by Doctor Alderwood last May. I understand that Doctor Moore is taking over the hospital.\n\nMr. Hoey has not yet had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Minister and consequently no definite commitment of any kind has been made to Doctor Alderwood.\n\nHowever, the proposals contained in paragraph No. two of Doctor Alderwood's letter is interesting and if put into effect would be altogether different from any other Residential school. The proposal mentioned would be most suitable for Northern Indians.\n\nI also enclose for your information a copy of a letter received from Reverend Mr. Horsefield to whom Doctor Alderwood refers in his communication.\n\nMr. Hoey thinks it advisable for you to proceed to The Pas and look over the whole site and endeavour to ascertain if the proposals made by Reverend Mr. Horsefield and Reverend Doctor Alderwood are practical. We would also like to have some idea of what it would cost to winterize any buildings that we intend to use. If at all possible a rough idea should also be obtained regarding other expenses that might be incurred in establishing a school along the lines suggested in the two letters enclosed.\nBefore proceeding to The Pas Mr. Hoey thought it advisable that you hold a meeting with Doctor Alderwood and Inspector Hamilton. The latter will return to Winnipeg from his trip to Northern Manitoba August 10th and I thought it would be possible for you to return to Winnipeg either on the night of the tenth or the morning of the eleventh and on the eleventh you could have a meeting with the gentlemen just mentioned. This would permit you leaving for The Pas either Saturday night or Sunday.\n\nI am writing to Inspector Hamilton so that he will expect you in Winnipeg on the day mentioned above. I hope that your Winnipeg convention went over successfully and that you will have a pleasant week-end in Qu'Appelle.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet,\nc/o Rev. P. Piche, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Residential School,\nLebret, Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, August 2nd, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nMr. Hoey has received your letter of July 27th, with reference to the proposed school for The Pas area and discussed its contents with me yesterday.\n\nMr. Hoey has not yet had an opportunity of discussing your proposal with the Minister. It is considered advisable to obtain more definite information not only with regard to the feasibility of the proposal that has been made but in addition we require a reasonably accurate estimate of the expenditure that would be incurred.\n\nConsequently, Mr. Doucet who is at present in the West is being instructed to proceed to The Pas at the end of next week.\n\nHe will be in Winnipeg on August 11th at which time I hope that Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Doucet will have an opportunity of interviewing you and discussing with you the whole matter previous to Mr. Doucet going to The Pas. We have already forwarded him a copy of your recent letter as well as a copy of Reverend Mr. Horsefield's letter of April 29th.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada,\n184 Alexander Ave., E.,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-1, part 3)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. HOEK.\n\nRe: Survey of Air Force Buildings at The Pas Airport.\n\nIn conformity with instructions received on August 2nd from Mr. Phelan, I proceeded, at the close of the summer course at Lebret, to Winnipeg to meet Inspector Hamilton and Reverend Dr. Alderwood. Dr. Alderwood explained what he had in mind in reference to the buildings at The Pas Airport. I then proceeded to The Pas in order to check over the buildings in question and endeavour to decide the feasibility of utilizing some of these buildings for a Residential school. As a result of this survey, I wish to submit the following:\n\nBUILDINGS:\n\n1. With the exception of the washroom and mess hall these buildings are all 52 ft. long x 20 ft. wide. Natural lighting is from both sides. The ceilings are approximately 8 ft. high.\n\n2. These buildings have not been completed according to specifications. None of those which could be taken over are insulated. There is but one row of sheeting at the outside composed of tongue and groove lumber. This sheeting is covered with heavy paper. The inside of the buildings are not sheeted. A one-half inch wallboard (somewhat similar to Ten-Test) is nailed to the studding. This finish, of course would be unsatisfactory for children. A slight blow would break through the sheeting - in fact, it is already broken in, in several places although most of the buildings have not been occupied.\n\n3. The proposal was to move one of these buildings between two others in order to join them into one unit. The accompanying sketch will indicate what Dr. Alderwood had in mind. This, I believe, would be impractical and for the following reasons:\n\n(a) They are of a very weak construction, there being no bracing. They would have to be thoroughly braced before attempting to move them.\n\n(b) The buildings are not evenly spaced, hence a building will not join these unless considerable alterations are made. As stated above, the buildings are 52 ft. long and the space between the buildings vary from 49 ft. 10 inches to 82 ft. 8 inches.\n\n4. These buildings would be very difficult to heat. At present they have two oil heaters in each - one at each end. Each unit (three buildings reunited) would require at least five heaters. It would, therefore, be a question of approximately two dozen heaters to supply sufficient heat to make these units comfortable. This would prove very expensive and moreover would multiply the fire hazards.\n5. It is obvious that the suggested arrangement would make supervision and administration very difficult. I doubt that any personnel would stick to a job that would require such supervision any length of time. It would also require more personnel to adequately supervise this set-up and would, therefore, prove very uneconomical.\n\n6. These buildings are not in any way connected to water supply. This might be done but would prove rather expensive as the water tank is approximately 500 yards away. Moreover, as these buildings have no foundations, continuous trouble by freezing would be experienced if the water piping were joined to them. It would, therefore, entail the problem of hauling water to the various units.\n\n7. The lavatories are of the chemical type. It is doubtful if this system would prove satisfactory for a boarding school. It must be remembered that these installations were intended as a temporary arrangement. These toilets, moreover, are in a separate building. Two of these buildings are provided in the proposed section, but one is on the wrong side of the road. Children using these would have to cross the main road. To move it would mean a new installation. Toilets would have to be installed in the dormitories.\n\n8. I believe, that it would take approximately $20,000.00 to bring about the changes necessary. This would include repair of the buildings, inside and outside, the moving of some buildings, the installation of water, preparing quarters for the personnel. This would not include a residence for the Principal. And in the end, what would we have?\n\nLOCATION:\n\nThis area is an ideal place for a school. Medical care would be available. A certain amount of social life would be possible for the personnel of the hospital as well as for the personnel of the school. There is an adequate water supply and good means of transportation. Electrical power would be plentiful. A good deal of the material might be used in the erection of a school, although, I doubt whether the use of this material would be really economical. The time and labour it would take to tear down these buildings, salvage the materials, would really wipe out any savings that would be accomplished.\n\nTYPE OF BUILDING:\n\nMuch may be said in favour of smaller building units for Residential Schools such as special dormitories, special classrooms. However, in our present set-up such an organization would give rise to many difficulties:\n\n1. Supervision would be rather difficult.\n2. Such supervision would necessarily have to be by trained personnel in this particular kind of work.\n3. The heating proposition would add a number of difficulties.\n4. The number of personnel would have to be greatly increased.\n5. The Per Capita Grants available would be inadequate to take care of the extra cost. It is obvious that in a great number of cases the present grant does not permit the obtaining of properly trained teachers and instructors, for the kind of education that our Residential Schools should be giving. Such a small group of buildings should be especially designed for this kind of work in order to be effective.\nI do not think that the buildings at The Pas would lend themselves efficiently to smaller grouping. The up-keep of these buildings would, I believe, be very expensive.\n\nIt may be contended that the school buildings in Residential Schools are not conducive to the development of Indians. It will never be possible to bring the school to the level of Indian life. In my opinion, it is not so much the buildings that will affect the Indian as the kind of training that will be given in these schools. A great deal of the criticism of our Indian education in Residential Schools may be traced to the unpreparedness of the personnel to carry out the important work of Indian education. No matter what kind of schools we may have the training results will be in proportion to the quality of the educator.\n\nEDUCATIONAL FACILITIES OF THE PAS AGENCY:\n\nThe 1939 Census tells us that the population of this Agency is 2478 for the Manitoba section and 1194 for Saskatchewan, a total then of 3672. It is generally accepted that about 25% of the population is composed of children of school age. This means that the student population would be about 900. There are nine day schools with an enrolment of 245, 3 combined schools with an enrolment of 36 and one Roman Catholic Residential School with an enrolment of 113. This means that the schools could accommodate about 400 children. It is readily seen that more educational facilities are necessary. A part of the population of this Reserve are nomadic, being hunters. Apparently to provide education for these children the Residential School is the answer. It must be kept in mind, however, that the school must adopt itself to the necessities of the child and the community.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nK.J.

I then proceeded to The Pas in order to check over the buildings in question and endeavour to decide the feasibility of utilizing some of these buildings for a Residential School. As a result of this survey, I wish to submit the following:\n\nBUILDINGS:\n\n1. With the exception of the washroom and mess hall these buildings are all 52 ft. long x 20 ft. wide. Natural lighting is from both sides. The ceilings are approximately 8 ft. high.\n\n2. These buildings have not been completed according to specifications. None of those which could be taken over are insulated. There is but one row of sheeting at the outside composed of tongue and groove lumber. This sheeting is covered with heavy paper. The inside of the buildings are not sheeted. A one-half inch wallboard (somewhat similar to Ten/Test) is nailed to the studding. This finish, of course, would be unsatisfactory for children. A slight blow would break through the sheeting - in fact, it is already broken in, in several places although most of the buildings have not been occupied.\n\n3. The proposal was to move one of these buildings between two others in order to join them into one unit. The accompanying sketch will indicate what Dr. Alderwood had in mind. This, I believe, would be impractical and for the following reasons:\n\n(a) They are of a very weak construction, there being no bracing. They would have to be thoroughly braced before attempting to move them.\n\n(b) The buildings are not evenly spaced, hence a building will not join these unless considerable alterations are made. As stated above, the buildings are 52 ft. long and the space between the buildings vary from 49 ft. 10 inches to 82 ft. 8 inches.\n\n4. These buildings would be very difficult to heat. At present they have two oil heaters in each - one at each end. Each unit (three buildings reunited) would require at least five heaters. It would, therefore, be a question of approximately two dozen heaters to supply sufficient heat to make these units comfortable. This would prove very expensive and moreover would multiply the fire hazard.\n\n5. It is obvious that the suggested arrangement would make supervision and administration very difficult. I doubt that any personnel would stick to a job that would require such supervision any length of time. It would also require more personnel to adequately supervise this set-up and would, therefore, prove very uneconomical.\nThese buildings are not in any way connected to water supply. This might be done but would prove rather expensive as the water tank is approximately 500 yards away. Moreover, as these buildings have no foundations, continuous trouble by freezing would be experienced if the water piping were joined to them. It would, therefore, entail the problem of hauling water to the various units.\n\n7. The lavatories are of the chemical type. It is doubtful if this system would prove satisfactory for a boarding school. It must be remembered that these installations were intended as a temporary arrangement. These toilets, moreover, are in a separate building. Two of these buildings are provided in the proposed section; but one is on the wrong side of the road. Children using these would have to cross the main road. To move it would mean a new installation. Toilets would have to be installed in the dormitories.\n\n8. I believe, that it would take approximately $20,000.00 to bring about the changes necessary. This would include repair of the buildings, inside and outside, the moving of some buildings, the installation of water, preparing quarters for the personnel. This would not include a residence for the Principal. And in the end, what would we have?\n\nLOCATION:\n\nThis area is an ideal place for a school. Medical care would be available. A certain amount of social life would be possible for the personnel of the hospital as well as for the personnel of the school. There is an adequate water supply and good means of transportation. Electrical power would be plentiful. A good deal of the material might be used in the erection of a school, although, I doubt whether the use of this material would be really economical. The time and labour it would take to tear down these buildings, salvage the materials, would really wipe out any savings that would be accomplished.\n\nTYPE OF BUILDINGS:\n\nMuch may be said in favour of smaller building units for Residential Schools such as special dormitories, special classrooms. However, in our present set-up such an organization would give rise to many difficulties:\n\n1. Supervision would be rather difficult.\n2. Such supervision would necessarily have to be by trained personnel in this particular kind of work.\n3. The heating proposition would add a number of difficulties.\n4. The number of personnel would have to be greatly increased.\n5. The Per Capita Grants available would be inadequate to take care of the extra cost. It is obvious that in a great number of cases the present grant does not permit the obtaining of properly trained teachers and instructors, for the kind of education that our Residential Schools should be giving. Such a small group of buildings should be especially designed for this kind of work in order to be effective.\n\nI do not think that the buildings at The Pas would lend themselves efficiently to smaller grouping. The upkeep of these buildings would, I believe, be very expensive.\nIt may be contended that the school buildings in Residential Schools are not conducive to the development of Indians. It will never be possible to bring the school to the level of Indian life. In my opinion, it is not so much the buildings that will affect the Indian as the kind of training that will be given in these schools. A great deal of the criticism of our Indian education in Residential Schools may be traced to the unpreparedness of the personnel to carry out the important work of Indian education. No matter what kind of schools we may have the training results will be in proportion to the quality of the educator.\n\nEDUCATIONAL FACILITIES OF THE PAS AGENCY:\n\nThe 1939 Census tells us that the population of this Agency is, 2478 for the Manitoba section and 1194 for Saskatchewan, a total then of 3672. It is generally accepted that about 25% of the population is composed of children of school age. This means that the student population would be about 900. There are nine day schools with an enrolment of 245, 3 combined schools with an enrolment of 36 and one Roman Catholic Residential School with an enrolment of 113. This means that the schools could accommodate about 400 children. It is readily seen that more educational facilities are necessary. A part of the population of this Reserve are nomadic, being hunters. Apparently to provide education for these children the Residential School is the answer. It must be kept in mind, however, that the school must adopt itself to the necessities of the child and the community.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\n\nOttawa, August 28th, 1945.\nFile\n\n1. Mr. [illegible]\n\nColby [illegible]\n\n[illegible] report\n\nP.O.\n\n17/9/45\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa Canada.\n\nOctober 22, 1945.\n\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Proposed School for the Pas Area.\n\nYour letter\u2014reference 128-1-1\u2014of September 17th has been given careful consideration by our Commission. The report of Mr. A. J. Boucet has received our close attention and we note the objections to the use of the present camp buildings and the estimate of the high cost of putting them in fit state for school use. We are prepared to agree with Mr. Boucet's conclusion in view of the careful examination he has made as to the construction of the buildings and the fuller information he was able to obtain in regard to the possibility of water and heating systems. When the writer visited the camp the weather was too cold to permit this kind of survey and the points raised by Mr. Boucet could not be settled.\n\nI am glad, however, to note that the report fully agrees that additional educational facilities are needed in Northern Manitoba and that your representative declares the location to be ideal for a residential school. In view of the fact that the Mackay school has never been replaced and that we are assured there are a large number of Anglican children in the district whose parents are still nomadic, I am authorized by our Commission and by the Executive Committee of our Missionary Society to urge that provision be made for the erection of a new school on this site.\n\nWe believe that much use can be made of some of the existing buildings and that the work already done in preparing the site would make it possible to provide a school for approximately 125 children at a very reasonable cost. May I refer to the plan suggested for Wabasca as a basis for discussion? It was suggested that there should be a large central building with several smaller units. The main building would have a full basement of cement and stone, a complete first floor using local logs for walls, and an attic for certain staff and storage purposes. One heating plant would suffice for this building and fire risk thus be reduced to a\nminimum. This plan was for 50 pupils only but additional dormitory accommodation could be provided at The Pas by using one of the excellent mess halls for kitchen and dining-room purposes. Some of the other camp buildings could certainly be used for storage, workshop, and recreational purposes. The estimate we received from a reliable lumber company in Edmonton for the Wabasca building was $15,000 including materials, labor, freighting by team over the 100 mile bush trail from Slave Lake and a lighting plant. Costs would be considerably lower at The Pas and I believe that $20,000 should go a long way to provide this type of building.\n\nMay I, therefore, express the hope that the conclusion of the Department that the proposed conversion of the camp buildings is inadvisable may not set aside the positive advantages of the site, and that further consideration be given to the matter along the lines outlined above.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Alderwood\n\nSecretary.\nOctober 2, 1946\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI have an apology to make to you with regard to your letter to me of September 8th, 1945, (your file No. 128-1-1), concerning Big Eddy School District. In some way which I cannot explain, this letter was not acknowledged, but was sent forward to our Inspector at The Pas, Mr. Scott Bateman, who is Official Trustee of the Big Eddy School District and who has been making a study of the problem of Indian and Half-Breed education in this and other similar districts. This letter was just returned to me this week.\n\nMr. Bateman has now completed the survey of these districts and he estimates that it would cost about $4,200.00 to repair and enlarge the Indian School at Big Eddy to enable it to take care of both Indian and Half-Breed children. I understand that there has been some correspondence between our Ministers on this subject, but that any specific action here has been held up pending some agreement on the old problem of Indian and Half-Breed education in the Northern part of this Province.\n\nI hope you will accept this explanation for the unfortunate delay in answering the question raised in your letter referred to above.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.O. MacFarlane\nDeputy Minister of Education.\nOttawa, October 5, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor MacFarlane:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 2nd, in which you refer to a letter dated September 8, 1945, sent forward by me to your department.\n\nI must, in fairness, state that the delay in replying to this communication has not proved at all embarrassing. As a matter of fact, we were not in a position until now to secure the funds necessary for the remodelling of the Big Eddy Indian Day School. I have, however, following an interview with Mr. Dryden yesterday, asked the officials of the Welfare and Training Division to put in the estimates of next year, which are now in course of preparation, the sum of $500.00 for the construction of an additional class-room in the Big Eddy School. This work will be undertaken on the understanding that the school will be operated jointly by the Indian Affairs Branch and your department. Mr. Dryden suggested that the school might be operated effectively under the supervision of a local advisory board made up of the public school inspectors for the district, the Indian Agent and the missionary in the district. This is a matter, however, to which we can give additional thought during the months immediately ahead of us.\n\nThis arrangement is largely experimental. It is my earnest hope that it will prove a success. There are a number of districts in the northern sections of the three prairie provinces where it will be necessary to operate the schools jointly, and there is no valid reason in my mind why such schools should not be operated efficiently and economically, and to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. There are questions relating to the operation of such schools, however, which we should keep in mind, such as the right of the provincial authorities to compel the attendance of Indians at such schools, and the right of the Dominion to insist upon attendance in the case of white or half-breed children. My own feeling is...\nown feeling is that all these matters should be adjusted by mutual consent. This will be comparatively easy if we keep the educational needs of the Indians and of the half-breeds and their general advancement constantly to the forefront.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to your Minister for his information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

As this offer was only available for one week I have sent a wire authorizing this expenditure but as it comes as a heavy and unexpected demand on our Society's resources and exceeds the credit set apart for this School for this year I am regretably obliged to write and ask if your Department will kindly come to our assistance in this matter by making a special grant of $400.00 to help to meet the cost of the same.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.B.

We have not figured on any chandeliers as we do not think them necessary but we have figured drop lights with shades in principal rooms and plain drops in other rooms and outbuildings and ceiling receptacles in halls and lavatories. There is also a fire alarm system needed, a gong on 1st floor and break glass stations on each floor. We have included this in our estimate which includes the materials shown on the attached list and the sales tax but not our percentage and amounts to One thousand and fifty dollars ($1050.00) for wiring and installing.\n\nWe trust that these figures will prove acceptable and assure you of our best attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSTAR ELECTRIC CO., LTD.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Combination seat and locker to be placed around the boys' play room. If the lumber at a cost of $20.00 was supplied he would have the staff do the work.\n\n3. 200 feet fire hose, 1\u00bd\" diameter.

The mattresses in the school have been in use for over 9 years and are practically all worn out.\n\nThe first item can not be obtained locally. If the Department decides to grant the request the stove could be purchased from the Manufacturer. Item No. 3 cannot be obtained locally unless the merchants send away. One of the merchants informs me it would probably cost .50\u00a2 a foot for this hose. Item No. 4, the mattresses could probably be obtained much cheaper by the Department than if obtained locally.

The Department will also approve of the supplying of 200' of fire hose, 1/2\" in diameter, with the necessary couplings, if required. The stove of the dimensions required may be purchased from the manufacturer. The lumber and fire hose may be purchased locally, competitive prices, if possible, being obtained. When the above supplies have been received, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRegarding the mattresses, I have to request that you will state whether it would not be possible for the school authorities to purchase the quantity required from the per capita grant or other revenue of the school.

However, I wish to point out to the Department that it seems this plant is probably too small for an institution of this size. I am just remarking this in case the Department intends using a similar plant elsewhere, as this plant at the McKay School will give all the light required at that place, but it is over loaded, and the principal trouble is the labor keeping the plant going continually while the lights are turned on.\n\nI recommend that the account for the Star Electric Company be paid if it is according to contract. They did a very satisfactory job.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst.

These supplies were left over when the plant was completed so I asked the Contractor to leave them and send in his account.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Letter 128-1-5, of January 31st, second paragraph, regards purchasing of an ironing stove for McKay Boarding School, I beg to state that the Company manufacturing these stoves reports that they do not market them any longer.\n\nThere was an old cook stove left at the hospital near the McKay School, so I transferred this stove to the McKay School and the Principal informs me that it will be quite satisfactory, so the new stove will not be purchased.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that I visited the Mackay Boarding School on the 28th inst., in company with the Medical Officer.\n\nThe health of the pupils was fair, some of them have been suffering from the whooping cough lately, but it seems to be about over now. The pupils were warmly clad, well fed and tidy. The food they get at present consists mainly of fresh fish, moose meat, beef, plenty of fresh vegetables, milk and porridge.\n\nIn the class rooms there is a big change since the elder children were transferred to Elkhorn. The ones in the two primary grades far outnumber those in higher grades, and this overcrowds the junior classroom, but this situation will right itself after Easter holidays.\n\nThe staff has been undermanned for past month, due to the resignation of the teacher in the senior classroom; this lady and her husband have taken up farm, and left the school before a new teacher could be arranged for. The matron in the kitchen also left this month on account of sickness in her family at home. The present staff are helped out by Mrs Bird, the wife of the Principal, and have got along very well. A new Senior teacher, Junior teacher, and kitchen Matron will start work after Easter. The present Junior teacher is taking up duties at the Big Eddy Day School at that time.\n\nThe appearance of the school outside is fairly shabby, I hope the estimates are large enough to allow us to get the place painted. If this is allowed it will be necessary to have this office supplied with specifications of the class of paint to be used, as the local painters will use gasoline to thin the paint every time if they are not held down with specifications.\n\nThe Principal asks for the sum of $120.00 to be spent on paint for some inside work, such as boys wash room, hospital rooms etc.; he will have the work done by the staff. I think this should be allowed.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 5, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 2592-135 of the 29th ultimo, reporting on general conditions at the Mackay Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your recommendation that the main building be painted, I have to inform you that the sum of $1,000 is provided in the Estimates for this school. It was proposed to make alterations to the old hospital building so that store room accommodation could be provided. This suggestion was from the M. S. C. G. authorities. Please discuss this with the Rev. Principal and make a joint recommendation concerning using the funds provided for alterations or for painting the main building.\n\nI have noted that you recommend an expenditure of $120 for paint for the interior finish and I am pleased to authorize you to expend this amount for materials, after securing competitive prices. When you are submitting the account, in duplicate, in favour of the firm given the business, please support it with an Abstract of Tender form showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. The labour for the inside painting must be undertaken by the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, April 5, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Waddy and the Reverend Principal of the Mackay Indian Residential School have recommended that the exterior of the main building at the institution be painted. Certain funds were provided for the fiscal year 1924-25 for the Mackay School, but it was proposed to use them for alterations to the old hospital building so as to arrange for store room space. Please indicate whether you consider these alterations more necessary than the painting, as both cannot be undertaken this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Bird, Principal\n\nWe have your acknowledgment of the 27th. ult. with reference to a Cylindrical Washer.\n\nWe are pleased to advise you that we sell a very large number of these type Washers to the various Indian Schools, laundries, hotels and hospitals in Western Canada, and for your information we are enclosing herewith cut of a Washer, on which we quote you as follows:\u2014\n\n1 - Only 36\" x 54\" Galvanized Trimmed, one door, single gear, belt driven, Globe Wood Washer \u2014\u2014\u2014 $424.00\nF.O.B. Toronto.\n\nThis Washer is just about the right size for your School, and can be driven by a 1\u00bd H.P. gasoline engine.\n\nYou could either drive from the gasoline engine up to a line shaft, and then belt the washer pulley to a pulley on your line shaft, or secondly, the gasoline motor could be elevated just a little in order that the belt from the gasoline engine to the washer would be horizontal.\n\nWe certainly trust that you will be interested in this washer, and any further information that we can give you, we certainly will be pleased to do so.\n\nRegarding laundry supplies - by this we mean, soap and soda. We are wondering if we could not supply you with some of the soap which is being used there. We sell Procter & Gamble's soap to many of the Indian Schools and small institutions, and certainly would appreciate if we could have some of your business along these lines also.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.H.B./R.\nencl.\nSir:-\n\nWith further reference to your letter of December 23rd., 1923, No. 128-1-5, concerning the installation of a power driven washer at the MacKay Indian School, I find myself impelled to appeal to you once more on behalf of our agents at this institution, in the hope that you may be able to do something to relieve them of the laborious methods which they are now obliged to use in discharging the duties of their department.\n\nThis school, as you are aware, has a capacity of eighty pupils whose interests are presided over by a staff of eleven. The laundry work of an institution containing so many workers and pupils cannot be satisfactorily executed with the small hand washing machines now in use, all of which, the Principal states, in a letter dated on the 28th. of last month, are in very poor condition and in constant need of repair.\n\nAs you were under the impression when you wrote your letter of December 22nd., that a power driven washer could not be operated by power obtained from the lighting plant which you were about to install at this school, I beg to enclose herewith for your consideration the original of a letter and circular from a Winnipeg firm dealing with this matter; as they state that the Globewood washer is just about the right size to be driven by a 1\u00bd h.p. gasoline engine, such as you have installed at the MacKay School. I shall be deeply obliged if you will reconsider this matter and do your utmost to provide this school with this very necessary item of equipment.\nThanking you on behalf of our Society for the installation of the electric light at this institution, and for the courteous consideration which you have given to the many applications for assistance which I have been obliged to make on behalf of our Society's Schools,\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/K.\nEnc1.2.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 24th, 1923, No 116-1-5, in which you state that your Department has arranged for funds to light electrically the MacKay and Carcross Indian Residential Schools, I shall be obliged if you will let me know if steps are being taken to provide the Carcross School with an electric light system this summer.\n\nIt is quite unnecessary, I feel certain, for me to attempt to point out the advisability and the necessity of having such a lighting system installed. I trust that nothing may prevent your Department from having it in readiness before the long dark nights of next winter set in.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, April 9, 1924.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nA letter has been received from Reverend Doctor Westgate requesting that a power driven washer be supplied in the MacKay Indian School. He states that something should be done to relieve the school staff of the labourious methods which they are now compelled to use in discharging their duties in the laundry department.\n\nThe cost of a 36\" x 54\" wood washer would be approximately $450.00.\n\nWill you please advise if favourable consideration is to be given to his request.\n\nARCHITECT.\n\nMr. Paget:\n\nThe washing machine referred to above and required for the MacKay Indian School is a 36\"x54\" Globe Washer, belt driven as manufactured by the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. of Toronto.\n\nThe price of this machine, fob Toronto, is $400.00. The washer as manufactured by this firm has always given entire satisfaction.

As I have mentioned before the place is a ruin and an eyesore, the roofing is blown off and the wall covering is going, the only good material in it is a good cellar wall, and the hardwood floors, with doors etc. Even the floors are going rotten now as the roof leaks everyplace.\n\nThe whole question hinges now on whether the Department wishes to protect their own property, the school building, or whether the supplies are the most important. If the funds were sufficient both matters should be attended to.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

McLean Esq.\nAsst t. Deputy Sec.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Agent has informed me that the Department has granted $1000 for the school this year, and that possibly the main part of this amount ($900) will be expended in painting the school. Though the school needs painting, yet I beg to suggest that this be left over until next year, as our most urgent need is the proposed warehouse.\n\nWe have 320 bags of flour and 10 tons of bran, 15 tons of shorts, & 200 bushels of oats stored in the Hospital at the present time; these will have to be stored in a dryer place than this at an early period, as the roof of the hospital leaks in many places, and the walls are only composed of 1 layer of boards covered with Tar-paper. To fix this building to make it watertight would cost far in excess of the cost of the warehouse.\n\nAt the present time we have goods stored on the verandahs of the school, which could also be stored in the warehouse, and leave a clearer passage to the fire-escapes.\n\nWe are willing to erect the warehouse without any cost to the Department, if you can see your way to allow us to build it this spring and let the painting go for another year, by allowing the painting to stand over to next year will not have any bad effect on the building as far as I can see.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Indian Agent strongly recommends that the main building be painted and Mr. Orr concurs in his recommendation. Dr. Westgate and the principal both urge the necessity of providing a warehouse and offer to perform all labour in this connection without charge to the Department.\n\nI wish to recommend that the Indian agent be authorized to expend $600 for materials and arrange with the school authorities for the erection of the warehouse and that he secure the paint necessary for the main building and have this activity undertaken by day labour. The paint will cost approximately $900.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 9, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, regarding the painting of the exterior of the MacKay Residential School and the erection of a warehouse for storage purposes. In reply I have to say that it has been found possible to provide the amounts mentioned by you for both these purposes.\n\nRegarding the painting of the exterior of the main building, you may arrange for the purchase of the paint required and for the labour necessary in performing the work.\n\nWith reference to the erection of the warehouse, you should arrange for the purchase of the lumber and other materials required and also make arrangements with the school authorities that the work of putting up the building be done by the school staff, without cost to the Department. Any material in the old hospital building which will be serviceable should be used in the construction of the warehouse. It should be ascertained how much material from this source is suitable, before purchasing the balance.\n\nIn the purchase of the paint and the material for the erection of the warehouse, competitive prices should be obtained from a number of dealers and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Please keep proper time sheets, in duplicate, covering the labour employed in painting the main building. Accounts in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded, covering the cost of the materials. As much of the painting as possible should be done by the older boys of the school, without cost to the Department. You will be good enough to consult the principal and endeavour to arrange that the above work is carried out satisfactorily and economically as possible. The cost of the materials and labour for the painting of the building should not exceed your estimate of approximately $1,000 and the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the materials for the warehouse should not exceed the amount mentioned by you, viz.: $600.\n\nRegarding the size and type of building to be erected for a warehouse, the Department will leave this matter in the hands of yourself and the principal to put up a satisfactory and serviceable building for storage purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I think it would be advisable to call for tenders for the work, giving specifications of the quality of paint to be used. I will be obliged if the Department will allow this to be done, and also if they will have the architect supply me with the specifications usually used in giving painting contracts. As this matter will be up in the neighbourhood of $900.00 I would forward the tenders to Ottawa without delay.\n\nI could have Mr. Fred Turner of the McKay Boarding School staff superintend the contractor and see that he fulfills the terms of the contract. We will probably pay Mr. Turner about $25.00 for doing this work. It could be done in his extra time and I think it would be money well spent.\n\nIn regard to having the elder boys help with the painting, I beg to inform the Department that there are no big boys at this school at present. Practically the whole lot are young chaps I have recruited in the last\n\nDEPT. OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nMAY 21 1924\nARCHITECT.\nfew years.

Please communicate with Mr. Indian Agent Waddy and secure a list of the materials necessary and arrange for the work to be undertaken at the first opportunity. Mr. Waddy will be absent from his office paying treaty for the major portion of the next two months and it may not be possible for him to supervise the work so you will have to make whatever other arrangements seem the best. The pupils at the school will not be able to assist in this case, as they are all too young. The cost has been estimated at $900, and I should be pleased if you would endeavour to keep the expenditure within this figure.

Dickens, Esq., The Pas, Man., repairing electrical light system and plant at Mackay Boarding School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Emergent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to letter 2795/135 of the 24th ultimo regards the electric light plant at the Mackay Boarding School, I beg to state that the town electrician did not know I had written the letter referred to and he had studied out the trouble and made a trip to the school on the 1st inst. When he came back he informed me that he had traced every wire in the whole system and found the ones which were causing the overheating of the rheostat.\n\nHe states that he put the system in shape and that he stopped at the school and ran the engine for four hours afterwards, during which time the batteries were being charged, that the electricity was being stored in the batteries and tested out all right.\n\nWhen he told me this I thought it best to wire to the Star Electric Co of Winnipeg not to send a man to The Pas until further instructed, I considered that probably the Department had acted on my letter of the 24th ultimo, and it is not necessary now that they come here.\n\nI trust my action is approved.\n\nI enclose the account for work on this engine from the time it went wrong. Mr. Dickens went to considerable trouble to get acquainted with the layout of the machinery, I beg to recommend that the account be paid.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nWill you kindly let me know what action has been taken with reference to the tenders for painting the McKay Indian boarding school near The Pas. A request has been received at the Minister's office that tenders be called for again, as none of those received were accepted, all but one being considered too high and that one too low. It is represented that the tenderers, after examination of the building, would be in a position to submit tenders at much lower figures than they did from examination of the blue prints.\n\nI presume that if none of the tenders already received are satisfactory, there would be no objection to asking for quotations again, and this action should be taken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn connection with the painting of the MacKay Indian Boarding School, near The Pas, I wish to inform you that I have spent the last month in endeavouring to get proper tenders for this work, and at last, I have received, I think, what is a fair estimate of the cost. There is still one more tender for this work to come in, and I wired Mr. Waddy yesterday, and asked him to notify me by wire, if this party wished to again tender. The lowest price, which I have received to date, is from Mr. G. B. Davis, of The Pas, for Four Hundred and Twelve Dollars ($412.00). The lowest tender for the material is from The Hudson Bay Company at The Pas for Three Hundred and Forty-One Dollars and Thirty Cents ($341.30), making a total of Seven Hundred and Fifty-Three Dollars and Sixty Cents.\n\nI have given Mr. Waddy instructions to go on with the work and purchase the material from the Hudson Bay Company as their tender is the lowest. The work will be under way immediately and will be kept well under the Nine Hundred Dollars ($900.00), which was authorized by the Department. The letter was dated May 22nd.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nOf Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, August 15, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your general letter of the 26th ultimo, and in reply to your query regarding the work that is being undertaken at the Mackay Indian Residential School, I wish to inform you that the erection of the new storeroom or warehouse is being undertaken by Mr. Indian Agent Waddy.

This lime sediment forms a hard crust inside the trap of the bowl where it is impossible to get at to keep clean and sets hard just like Portland Cement and the only remedy for this trouble is to replace these bowls with new ones. All the other toilets were in fairly good condition I think for the reason that they are not so frequently used.\n\nYours Truly\n\nChas S. Dickens\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that Travelling Nurse Lucas, who is at the McKay boarding School, reported that some of the toilet bowls were in bad shape. I had them examined by the plumber but he states that it is impossible to do anything with them. Four toilet bowls are required. These with the expense of plumber installing same would amount to at least $125.00.\n\nI beg to recommend that they be put in immediately. I enclose a letter from Mr. Dickens, the plumber.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Sept. 23, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, regarding the report of Travelling Nurse Lucas on the condition of the toilets at the Mackay Indian Residential School, also enclosing a communication from Chas. S. Dickens as to the cause of the trouble and stating the cost of replacing four of the toilet bowls.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange to have the four bowls replaced. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained in the purchase of the bowls and you should arrange for the labour of having them installed. It is noted that you estimate the cost of the bowls and the installation to be approximately $125. If possible, this amount should not be exceeded. You may arrange to have this work carried out as soon as possible and, when completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate to cover the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Graham\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nIn reference to your letter #128-1-5 of Sept. 23rd, regards toilet bowls and plumbing at the McKay Boarding School.\n\nI beg to state that when this work was attempted it was discovered that the soil pipes from the top of the school to the outlet in the basement were entirely blocked with sediment.\n\nI inspected this place with the plumber and discussed what would be the best way to have it fixed. It appeared at first that we would have to get the entire sewage system torn out of the school. However, the plumber sent away and got a set of rods with the necessary augers and attachments, and I think we will be able to get the pipes bored out. The expense of doing this will be, of course, more than the original estimate, but it was absolutely necessary that the work be done. I am taking the plumber and his assistants to work every morning and bringing them back in the evening with the Indian Department launch to try to keep the expense down as low as possible. I think it is about a three day job for a plumber and two assistants. I trust my actions are approved.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to state that the Principal of the McKay Boarding School requests that he be supplied with 70 sheets of glass for repairs. The cost of these sheets of glass will amount to approximately $25.00. I would be obliged if the expenditure can be allowed.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 15, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 2940/135 of the 9th instant, requesting authority to buy 70 sheets of glass for the purpose of making repairs to the windows at the McKay Indian Residential School. An explanation should be furnished by the principal as to why there is need of such a quantity of glass and who is responsible for the breakage.\n\nI have also your No. 2933/135 of the 9th instant, regarding the repairs required to the toilet bowls and plumbing. It is difficult to understand how the soil pipes could be blocked from the top to the outlet in the basement. If proper care was taken, there should be no danger of having this occur.\n\nUnless good reasons can be given for the breakage of the glass and the blocking of the soil pipes, it is considered that there has been poor management shown by the principal or the members of the staff. However, as it will be necessary to have these repairs made, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the 70 sheets of glass required and your action in arranging with a plumber to bore out the soil pipes is approved. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded, covering the cost of the glass and the repairs to the soil pipes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir:\n\nIn reference to letter 128-1-4 of the 23rd ultimo regarding seats required for the Mackay Boarding School, I beg to state that the make of the seats is C.O.&.School Furnishing Co., Preston, Ont., the size is for children 10 to 14 years old.\n\nWhen the school was being built no recreation room was put up for the girls, consequently they play in one of the school rooms.

D. McLean Esq.,\nSec. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the plumbing recently done at the Mackay Boarding School:\n\nThe Agent at The Pas allowed me to read a letter, in which it appears, that the need of the new plumbing fixtures was due to the negligence of the Principal or of the Staff, apparently a wrong impression has been given to the Department, and I beg to supply the following particulars:\n\nWith reference to the closet basins, these were corroded so that there was only a small passage for the matter to pass through. This corrosion was caused by the action of the acid in the urine and the very hard water, and first of all takes place in the trap, showing a brown, and as years pass by this stain thickens and eventually prevents proper flushing, and becomes as hard as the porcelain itself, is inside the trap and cannot be prevented, chemicals such as Sani-Flush may be used to lengthen the life of the basin but after some years service fails to have any great effect, and then the basins have to be renewed, as in the case here, many such cases are found daily in the cities where the water is not so hard.\n\nAccording to the Engineer, the Agent knew that we often had to use plungers two or three years ago, as these cleared the basins for the time, it was considered satisfactory, but owing to the dormitories having to be turned into isolation wards during the recent epidemic of Measles, and the basins being in constant use during the day, the plungers were not enough to keep the closets basins clear.\n\nWith reference to the down-pipes being blocked, this is wrong, there was a certain amount of matter attached to the side of the down pipe, but there was a passage through the pipe, and this matter was quickly cleared with a proper cleaning brush.\n\nThere would have been nothing attached to the inside of the down pipe if the basins had flushed properly, as the matter in the basins only ran away slowly instead of with a rapid flush, this would allow the sediment to adhere to the side of the pipe.\n\nI served five years at the practical side of plumbing, and passed most of the theoretical work for Sanitary Engineer ere leaving for this country many years ago, so feel that I know something about the plumbing.\n\nThe only solution that I can arrive at, (and the plumber is of the same opinion) that to avoid having to replace so many basins at a time, is when one shows signs of becoming corroded.\nto have it replaced.\n\nThe W.C. Basins that were taken out had been in use for seven years, and the corrosion was so hard that one could not operate it from the trap when the trap was broken open to inspect it.\n\nI would like to add that both the Matron daily see that all closets are in proper order, and if any of the staff find one in bad order it is at once reported to me.\n\nTrusting that the above explanation is satisfactory and proves that it was not due to negligence on the part of any member of the school,\n\nI remain Yours faithfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, Nov. 18, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, furnishing an explanation regarding the need of new plumbing fixtures and the blocking of the soil pipe at the MacKay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the explanation furnished by you is quite satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

MACKAY (THE PAS.)\n(a) LAUNDRY\n(b) ENLARGEMENT OF PIGGERY\n(c) ENLARGEMENT OF POULTRY HOUSE\n(d) INSTALLATION OF TELEPHONE\n\n(a) With a School of 80 children and a large staff, the obsolete laundry system now in use makes it quite impossible to keep the clothing as clean as it should be to assist in maintaining healthy conditions.\n\n(b) & (c) With regard to (b) and (c) it may be stated that small buildings do exist, but neither are sufficiently commodious for the purpose for which it exists.\n\n(d) The Society through its staff at the School will be prepared to provide the telephone poles, if the Department will procure the wire and instruments and make a grant of about $100, to assist in placing the poles in position. The distance from The Pas will be from 5 to 6 miles.\n\nXIV. SHINGWAUK HOME\n(a) COMPLETION OF REPAIRS TO THE DRILL HALL.\n(b) BAKERY\n\n(a) The Department very kindly made a grant for repairs to the roof of this building, and these have already been completed. The interior of the building however requires a great deal of attention, particularly the two floors, both of which will have to be very largely renewed. It is requested that a sum of not less than $700 be included in the estimates for 1925 for this purpose.\n\n(b) The necessity for the Bakery is well known to the Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nXV. CHARLEAU.\n(a) IMPLEMENT SHED ETC.\n(b) COMPLETION OF STOCK-BARN WITH SILO ATTACHED\n\n(a) Implement Shed. No building suitable for this purpose exists at present and in consequence proper care can not be taken of machinery and implements.\n\n(b) Completion of stock-barn and building of silo. The barn was never completed, an addition of some 2 or 3 feet having to be made to the height of the walls. For this reason only temporary roof was supplied and this leaking as it does, cannot but injure the whole of the interior. The building of the silo which is a great necessity, may best be done at the time when the barn is being completed.\n\nSec Dr. Westgate's letter to the Secretary, July 24.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I enclose for your information a rough sketch of the basement of the hospital, and another of the ground floor. As the ground floor, if the isolation wards, kitchen, etc., were eliminated, would be sufficient for the recreation room which could also be used as a drill hall, auditorium, etc., the basement, seeing that it has already two furnaces, might very well be adapted for a root cellar.\n\nThis school stands urgently in need of modern laundry equipment, but as this could be accommodated in the main school building I am not of the opinion that it would be advisable to adapt any part of the hospital building for this purpose, chiefly for the reason that as it is situated about 75 yards away from the main school building it would be inconvenient.\n\nAs your Department has recently very kindly provided this school with an electric lighting system, and a new store-room, I was instructed by our Commission to convey to you an expression of their appreciation of the real benefit you have conferred on this institution in the above action, and to express\nexpress the hope that you may be able in the near future not only to furnish the laundry equipment, but to take action in connection with the hospital building along the lines suggested above.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nSir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.A.R.

As it is probable that some funds will be available during the coming building season for improvements at this institution, I should be pleased if you would indicate what is most needed and comment on the requests of the church authorities.\n\nIt has been represented that a modern laundry building with equipment is urgently required. The Department has been asked to enlarge both the hog pen and the chicken house. We have also received a request to purchase wire and instruments and make a grant of $100 to assist in placing poles, which the church will secure, for a telephone line from the school to The Pas. Lastly, the Department has been asked to give consideration to the using of the old hospital building as a girls' playroom - the basement to be fixed up as a root cellar. In connection with this last request, I have to inform you that the Department was of the opinion that the building was so dilapidated that the only course was to demolish it and use and use the materials that are in good condition.\n\nYou might give a rough estimate of the cost of each of the proposed improvements, when you are sending in your recommendation as to which should be undertaken first.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to my telegram of the 12th inst and your reply of same date, regards fire at the Mackay Boarding School, which destroyed the pump house, I beg to report as follows:\n\nThe fire started when the staff of the school were at church on Jan 11th, and flames were seen coming from the pump house when the church service was over. The fire had got such a start that it was practically impossible to save anything. Two members of the staff had been in the building at 9 A.M., at which time everything appeared to be alright. It is thought that the fire started in the chimney.\n\nThe building was composed of a pump house 18' X 21' attached to the store house and Work shop 16' X 43', the whole place was destroyed. Contents were as follows:\n- 6 H.P. Fairbanks Engine.\n- Hoosier deep well pump and jack.\n- Curtis #163 single cylinder double wheel air compressor with check valve and stop cock.\n- All necessary belting and pipes to connect above.\n- Two stoves and pipes.\n- Pressure gauge.\n- Electric light fittings.\n\nAll the above should be replaced immediately and on instructions received in your telegram I have already started to get the lumber delivered for the pump house. I will have the carpenters on the job to-morrow I expect.\n\nThe matter of construction of the 16' X 43' store house and work shop can be left over for the present. I have had the plumber at the school for past three days and expect he will get things in shape to supply water to the building to-day, he has patched up the pump and put in an old engine to do until we get the new machinery. The fire took the life out of the machinery, it is just junk now, and we are in doubt if the old pump will stand up for the time being.\n\nThere was also lost all the supplies used in trading with the Indians for fish etc. Value 100.00\nMoccasins $400.00. Private tools $200.00\nFarm utensils and harness $200.00. TOTAL $900.00\nAnd old time printing press.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-5, part 3)\nOttawa, January 20, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 4077-135 of the 14th instant, reporting on the fire which destroyed outbuildings at the Mackay Indian Residential School. With reference to the machinery required to replace that destroyed in the pump house, you are authorized to purchase, after securing competitive prices, and have installed:\n\n1 - 6 H. P. Fairbanks Engine.\n1 Heosier deep well pump and jack.\n1 Curtis #163 single cylinder, double wheel Air Compressor, with check valve and stop cock.\n1 Pressure Gauge.\nThe necessary belting and pipes for connections.\n\nYou may also purchase a small stove and have it installed, have the pump house wired for electricity and the necessary inexpensive fittings provided.\n\nI regret to learn that the school lost certain supplies in the fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI very much regret to have to report to you that the Engine House at the Mackay Boarding School, The Pas, Manitoba, was destroyed by fire on the morning of the 11th inst.\n\nThe Principal immediately informed me of this misfortune by telegram which read as follows -\n\n\"Engine House and Store burned down. Letter following. All safe.\"\n\nAs I thought it well to await the receipt of his letter, this will explain the delay in forwarding this information to you.\n\nIn reporting on the fire, the Principal states as follows:\n\n\"As we were coming from church this morning we observed smoke coming from the roof of the Engine House. On arrival there I rushed in but was glad to close the door again, as the inside was such a mass of flame as to be a veritable inferno. We managed to get only a few tools out before it became too hot to get more.\n\nAs the flames did not touch the printing house for a while, I was able to get out practically all the type, but in three quarters of an hour only half the walls were standing, and these were soon burned up.\"\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\n\"I sent Mr. Turner to town at 2 o'clock to notify the Agent.\n\nA new Pump and Engine will have to be installed.\n\nMr. Turner and Mr. Grant were in the Engine House at 9.30 A.M., and everything was all right then. So far as we are able to tell the fire started at the bottom of the chimney where the bricks rested on the wooden support underneath.\n\nA large stock of moccasins, tools supplies etc. were completely destroyed.\n\nI am taking the liberty of purchasing a small galvanized Water Tank for melting ice by the kitchen fire until the water supply can be restored again.\"\n\nWhile deeply regretting this misfortune, I am unable to detect any culpable negligence, either on the part of the Principal or the Engineer. They are both very reliable men and have the complete confidence of our Society.\n\nAs Mr. Waddy, your representative in that part kindly informed me of the action taken by him towards having the water system and the Engine House restored, it does not seem necessary for me to make any further statement in connection with this matter, except that, I trust that these may be affected with the least possible delay.\n\nBelieve me Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/T.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of letter 128-15 of the 12th inst regards Mackay School.\n\nThe principal work required is instalment of up to date laundry equipment. The present arrangements are entirely hand work. I do not know the cost of this machinery; a whole outfit is required if anything is done. A new laundry is not needed in my opinion, the present place appears suitable.\n\nIt would be well if the pig pen was made larger, and a hen house built on to it. This would leave the present hen house to be used as a carpenter shop and move the poultry further away from the school, it is too close now. I will advise of the probable cost after I measure up this place.\n\nA plan of the old hospital building is being sent to the Department to-day, I would be obliged if it is returned to me later on. To make this place of use as a school room, with a large play room, the following is necessary.\n\nCover roof with shingles.\nPaint whole place two coats, roof one coat.\nRemove verandah to allow light into the room used as school room.\nRemove all partitions downstairs.\nInstall partition down centre of place with large sliding doors.\nPaint inside walls two coats light color paint.\nRepair floors which have bulged with moisture.\nCut off stairs to top floor, and put in flooring to avoid having to heat up-stairs.\nPut in new window glass where required.\nRepair heating system.\n\nThere is no way of draining this place so outside closets will have to be built. The place looks like a wreck as the paper on outside walls and roof is in such bad shape, but with outlay of about $3000.00 it could be fixed up; however a place like this eats up money when repair work is undertaken.\n\nI have not mentioned equipment for this place as I do not quite know what is intended to be installed.\n\nThe matter of telephone will be taken up in separate letter. I am enquiring from the forest officials as to cost to them of putting in phone system in bush, and will advise the Department when I get their answer.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn reply to your letter of January 12 relative to a list of requirements at the McKay School, The Pas, in the order from the standpoint of urgency and importance in which they should be furnished, I beg to state as follows:\n\nIn my letter of October 30th, addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, the list is given as follows: (see Pages 5 and 9)\n\n(A) Laundry\n(B) Enlargement of Piggery.\n(C) Enlargement of Poultry House\n(D) Installation of Telephone (see my letter to you dated July 26, 1924)\n\nSince the above list was forwarded to the Deputy Superintendent General, I visited this school, and after discussing with your Agent and the Principal the question of the disposal of the old Hospital Building, I addressed to you a letter in this connection on the 18th December. This item should therefore, be added to the above list.\n\nThe destruction of the Engine House and Store Room with contents of both, which has since taken place, and is referred to in another letter of even date, furnishes another requirement, and one which should of course have priority of claim over all the others.\n\nWith regard to the relative importance of the others mentioned, they should, in my opinion be furnished as follows:\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\n1. Laundry\n2. Alteration of Hospital as suggested in my letter of December 18th last\n3. Installation of the Telephone.\n4. Enlargement of the Poultry House\n5. Enlargement of Piggery.\n\nTrusting that this information will meet your requirements, believe me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTRW/T.\nOttawa, February 2, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, recapitulating the needs at the Mackay Indian Residential School. I have noted that better laundry facilities is the most imperative requirement. Mr. Indian Agent Waddy has reported that the present laundry building is suitable for the time being and he recommends that modern machinery be installed. Please let me have an expression of your views in this connection.\n\nThe other requirements of the school have been noted for future estimates.\n\nI have also your letter of the 23rd ultimo, reporting on the fire which destroyed the engine and storehouse at the school. Mr. Indian Agent Waddy has been instructed to replace the engine house with its equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

I have noted your opinion that laundry machinery is most important; that a pigpen and henhouse are required and that you will send estimates; and that it would require approximately $3,000 to repair the old hospital building and make it suitable for a classroom and playroom.

However, we give the Department of Indian Affairs\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n\"a little better price, and this would possibly amount to 10% off these prices.\n\nWe are making a note on your plan how these could be installed, and they can be driven easily by a 5 horse power engine. We supplied the belting for the Indian Schools also, and it takes about $30.00 or $35.00 worth of belting for this installation.\n\nThe 36\" X 54\" Washer is possibly the standard size, and we believe that you will find this size O.K. for your School.\n\nWe are trying to make up a carload of laundry machinery for Winnipeg, and if successful we can give the head of your department, carload rate of freight from Toronto to Winnipeg, which is a very large saving; in fact we brought the last two orders we received from Mr. Bunn into Winnipeg in a carload of machinery, then we shipped from here.\"\n\nTrusting that the above information may be satisfactory to you, and that you may be able to furnish this school with this very necessary requirement.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary M.S.O.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The chicken house is the most needed, but both should be constructed if there are any funds on hand.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir;-\n\nI have the honor to report that the Principal of the Mackay Boarding School has asked me if the Department will consider allowing him a grant, in addition to per capita grant, to purchase an outboard engine for his freight canoe. His engine was burnt when the pump house was destroyed.\n\nThe freighting in summer at this school is done by canoe as there is no summer road to the town, and I would beg to recommend that the engine be allowed if possible. The cost would be $185.00.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 21, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 4185-135 of the 16th instant, estimating the cost of enlarging the hogpen and henhouse at the Mackay Indian Residential School. I have been in correspondence with the church authorities concerning the most needed expenditure at this school, and they have requested that laundry machinery and equipment be supplied first. There is an item in the Estimates in this connection, and, if allowed by Parliament, laundry machinery will be purchased in the near future. The enlarging of the two outbuildings mentioned in your letter cannot be undertaken by the Department at the present time, as our funds are extremely limited.\n\nI have also your No. 4187-135 of the 16th instant, with reference to the principal's request for an outboard engine for his freight canoe. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, Indian Education funds are entirely assigned at the present time and I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to the Rev.

This matter should be attended to at once. The Agent, I think, has done his best to secure these, but so far without success probably because the 1924-25 fiscal year is just closing and the estimates for 1925-26 fiscal year have not yet been passed\".\n\nIf you will be so good as to give these items early and favourable consideration our Society will be very grateful indeed.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTRW/JF\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is, therefore, not prepared to authorize the purchase of a mowing machine as asked for by the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

You may also arrange for any extra labour required in making the repairs. You should keep the expense of these repairs down to the lowest possible point, and you should see that the work is completed in a satisfactory manner.\n\nPlease forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expense incurred in the purchase of the materials, as well as for any labour employed.\n\nThese repairs should receive early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The material throughout is of the best grade and no pains have been spared to produce a machine that can be relied upon to give many years of satisfactory service.\n\nThe Main Trunion Journals operate in roller bearings. Less power is required to drive the machine and wear is almost entirely eliminated, with the result that all gears are always in correct mesh and alignment. Broken gears, worn trunion journals and bearing replacements are never necessary on this washer. The main bearings are entirely separated from the tub by packed stuffing boxes, which absolutely prevents oil and grease from entering the washer or water from coming out.\n\nThe Reversing Movement is our Beaver Ball Bearing type in which all the thrust of operating the belt shifter slides is taken by hardened steel balls. The movement is designed so as to give a positive even shifting of the belts, irrespective of wear, so that the...\nBeaver Roller Bearing Washer\u2014Header on End\n\ncylinder runs the same number of revolutions in either direction. The gears are machine cut from solid blanks and the main gear is thirty inches in diameter. The gear has a split hub to facilitate easy removal. A combined gear lock and hand wheel is provided.\n\nThe Cylinder is of the best grade all heart stock long-leaf yellow pine with hard Maple ribs. The three lifting ribs are extra deep to ensure rapid washing. The trunions are bolted to heavy brass rings. The hinges are of brass bolted through a brass batten with an enclosed brass lock.\n\nThe Outer Case is of the finest clear Cypress and is furnished with a brass apron at the door opening. Inspection plates are provided in each end so that trunion bolts may be tightened without removing the upper half of the case.\n\nThe Inlet and Outlet Tees are connected by a 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch pipe into which steam can be injected. When steam is being used to heat the water this construction gives a rapid circulation and absolutely prevents any steam from coming in contact with the wood of the cylinder or case. The water inlet is 2 inches in diameter. The steam inlet is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inch. A 3 inch plug type discharge valve is supplied.\n\nThis Washer can be arranged for motor drive, in which case it is driven from the motor through short belts. The motor is carried on a substantial cast iron base bolted firmly to the frame of the machine.\n\nAt a small additional cost these machines may be equipped with a Beaver 6 inch foot operated discharge valve, Beaver Water Level Indicator, visible anywhere in the wash room, Beaver Soap and Soda filling doors, and Monel Metal Lifting Ribs in the cylinder.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n| SIZE    | NUMBER OF DOORS | NUMBER OF COMPARTMENTS | PULLEYS | SPEED | FLOOR SPACE | WEIGHT |\n|---------|-----------------|------------------------|---------|-------|-------------|--------|\n| 36 x 36 | One             | One                    | 16 inch | 250 RPM | 44 x 72     | 1500 lbs. |\n| 36 x 52 | One             | Two                    | 16 inch | 250 RPM | 44 x 88     | 1650 lbs. |\n| 40 x 40 | One             | One                    | 16 inch | 250 RPM | 48 x 76     | 1600 lbs. |\n| 40 x 52 | One             | Two                    | 16 inch | 250 RPM | 48 x 88     | 1750 lbs. |\n\nSINGLE GEARED ONLY\n\nThe above are our standard sizes.

This tends to absorb vibration, allows the Machine to balance easily, and to pick up speed quickly.\n\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO., LIMITED\nTORONTO\nWESTERN AGENTS THE BEAVER SOAP CO., LIMITED, WINNIPEG\nBeaver Heavy Duty Extractor\u2014Continued\n\nThe Wide Square Base distributes the weight over a large area, and allows this Machine to be operated at higher speeds than is possible with a small or round base.\n\nThe Basket is of Perforated Copper, heavily tinned and strongly reinforced by steel bands. The Oversize Steel Spindle operates on a hardened ball point and button running in a long bronze bearing. The bearing is supported by two large rubber springs, so arranged and designed as to make this Machine self-balancing. A large amount of working space has been provided round the bearing, making very easy and quick the adjustment or changing of the rubber springs. An oil retaining well is provided, which requires only occasional filling.\n\nAll Beaver Extractors have countershafts attached to the curb, and may be for straight or angle drive. The angle drive, as shown in the cut, costs a little more than the straight drive, but effects a saving in floor space, and allows the Extractor to be placed in line with the washers. All Extractors have our improved adjustable friction clutch pulley, which gives a gradual increase in speed without strain to any part of the Machine. Motor drive extractors are direct connected with push button control.\n\nA Galvanized wire safety cover is fitted and so arranged that the cover must be closed before the Machine can be started.\n\n| Size   | Drive    | Speed of Counter R.P.M. | Diam. of Counter | Floor Space inches | Shipping Weight |\n|--------|----------|-------------------------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| 26 inch| Straight | 550                     | 7 inch           | 36 x 60            | 1550 lbs.       |\n| 26 \"   | Angle    | 550                     | 7 inch           | 36 x 36            | 1600 lbs.       |\n| 26 \"   | Motor    |                         |                  | 36 x 40            | 1700 lbs.       |\n| 30 \"   | Straight | 500                     | 7 inch           | 40 x 64            | 1750 lbs.       |\n| 30 \"   | Angle    | 500                     | 7 inch           | 40 x 40            | 1800 lbs.       |\n| 30 \"   | Motor    |                         |                  | 40 x 44            | 1950 lbs.       |\n\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO., LIMITED\nTORONTO\nWESTERN AGENTS: THE BEAVER SOAP CO., LIMITED, WINNIPEG\nThe Beaver Laundry Machinery Co., Limited\n80 Perth Ave. - West Toronto\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nONT.\nThe Beaver Laundry Machinery Co.

This we are able to do because it is coming to Winnipeg in carload, and we will reship L.C.L. to The Pas.\n\nThe less than carload rate of freight from Toronto to The Pas is around $115.65, which is figured at a rate of $3.85\u00bd, and by bringing this material to Winnipeg and reshipping the freight rate is only $2.50 plus a cartage of $10.00 at Winnipeg.\n\nHoping that we may receive this order from you, which can be reshipped immediately, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED.\n\nW.H.B./R.\nccB\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Paget,\n\nThe following prices have been received for a washer and extractor required for the McKay School.\n\nStanley Brock, Ltd., Winnipeg, $910.80\nBeaver Laundry Machinery Co., Toronto, Ont., $895.00\nGuarantee Laundry Machinery Co., Winnipeg, Man., $792.25\n\nAfter examining the descriptions and illustrations submitted with these tenders I would recommend that the order be placed with the Beaver Laundry Machinery Co. of Toronto.\n\nIf you will examine the description and cuts of the machinery proposed by the Guarantee Laundry Machinery Co. of Winnipeg, you will see that they are not up to the standard of the machinery manufactured by the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. or the Beaver Laundry Machinery Co.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, Oct. 2, 1925.\n\nDear Sirs\u2014\n\nWith reference to your quotation of the 31st August for washer and extractor required for the Mackay Indian Residential School, I beg to advise you that your price of $896.00 is accepted for a 26\" x 54\" Beaver Roller Bearing Washer and one 26\" Belt Driven Solid Curb Extractor.

(RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-5, part 3)\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Waddy in which he informs me that you have instructed him to make an estimate of the cost of a workshop required at the McKay Boarding School and submit it to me. The Agent goes on to say that the Principal prepared a plan which includes a store in the end of the workshop.\n\nIt seems to me a most extraordinary way for the Department to do business after the repeated instructions I have had from the Minister that work of this kind was to be taken up through my office. I now get a plan of a building that was prepared by an impractical man, Mr. Bird. He is also asking for something, the necessity for which I am doubtful of. Why was Mr. Waddy written to direct on this matter? We cannot carry on business in this way. I am prepared to hand the whole building programme back to where it was if the Department are not prepared to assist me and carry out the instructions given by the Minister. Mr. Stewart is in the West now and I hope before he returns to Ottawa to have this matter threshed out once again.\n\nI am enclosing herewith the plan which I received from Mr. Waddy, and I wish to make no comment on it. If you wish the work finished, carry it out with Mr. Waddy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOctober 10th, 1925.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your 205-11A of the 1st instant with reference to the proposed new workshop at the Mackay Indian Residential School. The church authorities pressed for immediate action in connection with this matter and solely in the interests of despatch, the Department telegraphed Mr. Indian Agent Waddy to make a recommendation to you. You will please note that the instructions of the Honourable, The Superintendent General were kept in mind when this telegram was directed. Our local representative's recommendation was to go to your office and not direct to the Department.\n\nRest assured that I am endeavouring to carry out Mr. Stewart's wishes and to this end I am returning the rough sketch and list of material for your criticism and recommendation. As the building season is rapidly drawing to a close, I should be grateful if you would let me have your report by telegram as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D.
