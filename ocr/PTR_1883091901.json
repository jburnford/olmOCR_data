Of course not. The best does not get leeching with the Company. When vessel Captain P. Murray was towing to the extreme boundary of water in Clearwater, many vessels would find them asrstance not not make for traction behind it. They were forced to tie up to the bank. But the men they are in hopes of doing much better. Murray has brought in the boat again by the South Branch, which has carried at least two passengers in across the river, but as high as Highwood Lake. The reputers are the thousands that have joined rising during the spring and rapidly climb for an early start in setting improvements.\n\nAn important business has been closed for a government called attention to the necessity for the formation of an agricultural community. District No. 27, where this note is written, recognizes that much of the population are engaged in agriculture. Such should be encouraged, and similar plans will be adopted in other districts at future meetings. The Department of Agriculture, through the Billi, the Minister of Public Instruction of Lunanyg, \"representing consultations\" upon the subject, have increased the demand. Something similar to that will follow for this Territory, when the opportunity is opened upon it\u2014the people who are interested in farming should take advantage of same opportunity. The reasonable rates that the farmers will get for their crops will largely increase their returns.\n\nThe wind itself.\n\nThe town has existed two stories chimed!

The time has passed and there is no prospect of an immediate settlement. The memorial which had been prepared by two of our prominent residents at the special request of the Premier, and presented to the Government a year ago last spring, which would have satisfied the present requirements of this district, has been allowed to fall into desuetude. Since then another memorial\u2014this time addressed to the House of Commons\u2014has been prepared and presented by the inhabitants on the same subject, which was presented to Parliament by a prominent supporter of the Government in the House. In the meantime, however, the question has been raised again, and a new petition has been presented by Mr. Blair, the leader of the Opposition. It is now time to inquire what has been the result? Literally nothing\u2014except the expenditure of thousands of dollars. The Government has not yet answered the petition, nor has any satisfactory reply been given to the many grievances which have been so long laboring under.
