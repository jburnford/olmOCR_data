B. McLean Esq.\nSecretary Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\u2014 Mr. F. E. George of Gore Bay has handed me copy of your letter to Mr. J. Russell McGregor, acting Indian Agent, with respect to Mr. George's account for lumber dated 30th December last.\n\nI feel sure that inquiry by your department will show that the account is just and true and that your department will not refuse to pay it.\n\nI may say the lumber was regularly ordered by Mr. F. E. Baxter, your agent here under authority. It was duly manufactured under instructions of Mr. Baxter. It was piled at the most convenient place for loading within a short time after the order was given. It was to be removed by Mr. Baxter as soon as possible, but he did not get it away from there where piled it was burned.\n\nFor some reason known only to your Mr. Baxter it was left there for several months. Mr. George several times spoke to Mr. Baxter to permit Mr. George to sell it but your agent would not permit this as he figured on getting it away as he informed Mr. George.\n\nThe lumber was piled on the side of the road where directed. Under ordinary circumstances this lumber kept in stock by Mr. George was always kept in his buildings and never piled outside.\nOttawa, 5th February, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo with reference to the claim of Mr. R.E. George against the Department for lumber ordered by the late Agent Mr. Baxter, and note your observations with respect to this matter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the representations made in your letter with respect to the ordering and disposal of this lumber were set forth in a letter from Mr. George on the 4th August last and were considered before writing Mr. George on the 20th December last. It appears that Mr. Baxter ordered this siding but had not taken it away when the fire occurred so that he did not get the siding that he ordered. While Mr. George, as alleged, asked Mr. Baxter if he might dispose of the siding that was available for Mr. Baxter and supply other siding in its place. There does not appear to be anything to show that Mr. George had not a perfect right to do this without any reference to Mr. Baxter. The reason apparently for this reference was that Mr. George wanted to be sure of having the siding for Mr. Baxter when he called. With this view of the matter it does not appear that the Department could be properly called upon to pay this claim.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn H.

You will be good enough to purchase the above and have them sent to the school as soon as possible.\n\nWhen making these purchases you should secure prices from different dealers and purchase from the party quoting the lowest price.\n\nThe inspector also recommends that the hard wood, which is now in the yard, be placed in the woodshed. You will be good enough to have this matter attended to at an early date as possible.\n\nHe also states that the stove requires a new grate, and, if so, you may purchase the same.

As soon as the work is completed you should furnish properly certified voucher, in duplicate, for the expenditure incurred.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher does not require storm windows for the room occupied by her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Russell McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nWest Bay School,\nNovember 5, 1926\n\nDear Sir,\n\nKindly permit me to address you these few lines.\n\nDuring his visit to our school, Inspector Bennett recommended two storm windows upstairs, for north side of school which is extremely cold.\n\nYou probably remember that here in West Bay, the north wind has a long thirty mile drive.\n\nI mentioned this matter twice to Mr. Rogers but so far nothing has been done.\n\nI admit that the windows are rather wide but the difficulty would be surmounted by having folding windows on the inside.\n\nI would be very grateful to you if you could do anything to help me in this respect.\n\nI am very happy to be back to the Indian Missions after three years absence.\n\nHoping you are enjoying the best of health, and thanking you for past favors, I remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nS. Adelaide [signature]\nOttawa, November 10, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nA communication has been received from the teacher of the West Bay Indian Day School, in which she requests that two storm windows be supplied for the north side of the school upstairs.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of September 24th, last, in which you were informed that the Separate School Inspector recommended that these windows be supplied, and your reply thereto of the 30th of the same month.\n\nAs the Department is anxious to make the building as comfortable as possible for the teacher, it has been decided to authorize the placing of two storm windows on the north side of the school building. As you stated that the windows are wide, it is considered that the difficulty in placing the windows would be overcome by having folding windows on hinges placed on the inside of the present windows. You should arrange to have these windows put on as soon as possible. It may be necessary to have them made to the proper size, if the sashes cannot be obtained locally, and you may engage the services of a carpenter to complete the windows and put them on. The cost of this work should be kept down to the lowest possible point, and, when completed, you will be good enough to forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. It is hoped that you will be able to arrange for the putting on of these two double windows at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Ass't. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.

It is hoped that the Agent will be able to obtain the services of a competent man to make and put on the windows and that they will greatly add to the comfort of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You may have a small stand made for the water pails, the two steps repaired, a small window put in each closet, a storm door made and placed in position, a flag pole complete with the necessary rope, pulleys, etc., erected and the certificate awarded the pupils framed with an inexpensive frame. You will be good enough to see that all this work is done as cheaply as possible and, when completed, you should forward itemised vouchers, in duplicate, properly certified for the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Russell McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSir,\n\nAttention of A.F. McKenzie, Esq.,\n\nReferring to your letter of 10th instant and subsequent conversation, I beg to advise that I have obtained approximate cost of putting in two storm windows in West Bay school as follows:\n\n- 4 x \u00bd sash $7.40\n- 6 panes glass $17.00\n- 4 pr hinges $.80\n- 2 fasteners $.50\n- Delivery, say $2.00\n- Fitting & putting in probably $6.00\n- Painting, say $2.00\n\nThe steps in windows would have to be taken out and ripped narrower to give room for the storm windows & I can hardly say what the cost would be for putting in.\n\nThe present windows are apparently well fitted, and a stove in each room, when the storm windows are on they could not be opened back against the wall, owing to hip ceiling on one side of each window, and on the other side bed in one room and weshin material on the other (the latter might be moved).\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOttawa, November 26, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant furnishing an estimate of the cost of putting two storm windows in the West Bay School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may obtain the services of a carpenter to have these storm windows put on the two upstairs windows. The cost of this work should be as low as possible and the Department will leave the matter in your hands to make the best arrangements you can to have the storm windows put on. As soon as the work is completed you should furnish properly certified accounts, in duplicate, for the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

Floor is in a poor and very unhealthy condition.

She also states that the floor is in a poor and unhealthy condition and that the bell when rung shakes the whole building.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to furnish an estimate of the cost of having the school building painted both inside and outside. You should state the cost of having the inside painted separate from the cost of the painting of the outside. You should also furnish an estimate of the cost of having the floor repaired, or, if required, the cost of a new floor also the cost of installing sufficient supports for the bell.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give as full information as you can regarding the repairs to the school building and the approximate cost of the same, in order that, if it is decided to have this work done it can be completed during the coming summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Maclean, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCove Bay,\nOnt.\nExtract from Inspector's report West Bay School, May 11, 1921. 151727-6\n\nTo prevent weathering, painting outside should be done as soon as possible.\n\nWalls upstairs in the teacher's rooms need painting urgently.\n\nIn the hallway where the Indian children wash and obtain drinking water, it is real dark. A small window 2' x 1' should and could be easily placed in at a little expense.\n\nJ. M. Bennett\nInsp.\nSir,\n\nI beg to reply to your letter of May 19th re repairs to West Bay School as follows:\n\nI have been unable to get a price from local painters as they are very busy and have some schools to paint during the holidays; at the time this should be done, but it might be done by local men, but they would hardly be able to mix the paint and mixed might not be satisfactory for outside work, and it would have to be done by day work as none would take a contract.\n\nAs regards the floor it is all alike and the only thing that would improve it would be a new floor, the present one being pine and cracks allow the dirt to lodge and teacher complains that it is hard to sweep and is dusty when being done. I made request at one time for floor base or some preparation to use to keep the dust down when floor was being swept and request not granted. A new floor if put down should be hardwood and none satisfactory could be procured on the Island, and the cost for a No.1 or XXX maple would be about $185. to $175. and if done I would suggest that teachers platform would be deeper.\n\nI find that the supports of bell are useless and require new frame, it has been braced as some time but now requires all new, and would probably cost $10. or $15.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune 9th, 1921.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMR. SCOTT,\n\nThe Agent, Separate School Inspector and Teacher have drawn attention from time to time to the condition of the school building at West Bay. They state that the school building requires painting both inside and out, and the plaster needs repairing; the floor is in very poor condition and the building needs to be re-floored. The supports of the bell are useless, and when the bell is rung the whole building shakes. A new frame and a strong brace for its support are required.\n\nThe Agent was requested to forward an estimate of the cost of having the above work done, and the building put in a good state of repair. With reference to the painting, he states that he has been unable to secure a price from any of the local painters, but suggests that the work be done by day labour; the paint required to be purchased and supplied properly mixed. The material would cost approximately $100.00 and the labour about $100.00.\n\nRegarding the flooring; the Agent suggests that it should be of hardwood, and as the flooring required could not be obtained on the Island (Manitoulin) it would cost about $175.00 delivered at the school. The labour and finishing (ciling) would cost approximately $80.00.\n\nIt would require an expenditure of about $15.00 to provide supports and braces for the bell tower.\n\nThe total expenditure required to put the building in a good state of repair would be approximately $300.00.\n\nThe West Bay Band, Account #251, have not sufficient funds to their credit in interest account, but have to their credit in capital account $105,326.60, and as these repairs would represent a capital expenditure, I would suggest that the funds be taken from the capital at the credit of the Band, and that an Order-In-Council be obtained approving of this being done.\n\nIf you consider that these repairs should be undertaken this summer, I would request that the necessary instructions be given to have the Order-In-Council prepared, and afterwards to authorize the Agent to have the work done.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, June 20, 1921\n\nHis Excellency\nThe Governor General in Council.\n\nThe undersigned begs to report that the Indian day school on the West Bay Indian reserve, on Manitoulin Island in the province of Ontario, is in need of repair; it being pointed out by the Indian Agent, the Separate School Inspector and the teacher of the school that the building requires painting inside and out, that it needs to be re-floored and that new supports should be supplied for the bell.\n\nThe cost of the necessary repairs are estimated by the Department as follows:\u2014painting $250.00, re-flooring $255.00, and new supports for bell $15.00, $520.00 in all.\n\nThe undersigned would therefore recommend that under Section 89 of the Indian Act authority be given for the above mentioned expenditure of $520.00 being made from the capital at the credit of the West Bay band, which amounts to $103,370.64.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nHerewith is a recommendation for authority to spend $520.00 from West Bay band capital on repairs to the school-house on the reserve.\n\nThese repairs are represented by the Indian Agent, the Separate School Inspector and the teacher of the school as being necessary.\n\nThe expenditure may properly be made under Section 79 of the Indian Act.\n\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, June 20, 1921.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nGore Bay,\n\nJune 23rd 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI further reference to your letter of May 19th.

If any materials, such as pulley, guy wires or halyard are required, you may purchase the same. Any expense in connection with the pole and putting it in a serviceable condition should be performed at the lowest possible cost, and you should forward properly receipted vouchers covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRegarding the painting of the school building, both inside and out, and reflooring the same, I beg to say that this matter is now before council for approval of the funds required, and it is hoped to be able to inform you definitely regarding this work in a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. Russell McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nThe Board had under consideration a memorandum from the Honourable the Minister of Indian Affairs, reporting that the Indian Day School on the West Bay Indian Reserve, on Manitoulin Island in the Province of Ontario is in need of repair, it being pointed out by the Indian Agent, the Separate School Inspector and the teacher of the school, that the building requires painting inside and out, that it needs to be re-floored and that new supports should be supplied for the bell; that the cost of the necessary repairs are estimated by the Department of Indian Affairs as follows:\u2014 painting $250.00, re-flooring $255.00, and new supports for bell $15.00; $520.00 in all.\n\nThe Superintendent General therefore recommends that under the provisions of Section 89 of the Indian Act, authority be given for the above mentioned expenditure of $520.00 being made from the capital at the credit of the West Bay band, which amounts to $105,326.60.\n\nThe Board concur in the above recommendation and submit the same for favourable consideration.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nHonourable Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, August 3rd, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of June 4th, last, regarding the repairs required to the West Bay School building, I beg to say that authority for the expenditure required has been approved from the capital at the credit of the West Bay Band. I have, therefore, to request that you will take immediate steps to have the building painted, both inside and outside, the plaster repaired, where required, new floor laid and supports to the bell strengthened and put in good condition.\n\nRegarding the painting, it is noted that you were unable to obtain prices from local painters and you recommend that this work be done by day labour. It will be necessary for you to purchase the paint and oils required, which should be of a good grade of material, and before making the purchase of the quantity required, you should obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers and purchase from the one quoting you the lowest price. You should see that the paint is properly mixed. The amount authorized for this work is $150 for the material and $100 for the labour, and this should not be exceeded.\n\nRegarding the flooring required, you should also arrange for the purchase of the quantity required, which should be of a good grade of hard wood flooring. It will also be necessary to obtain competitive prices before making the purchase, and the purchase made from the firm quoting you the lowest price. The expenditure for the cost of the material and labour, and oiling the floor after it is laid, should not exceed $75.\n\nThe expenditure in providing supports and braces for the bell, and the labour, should not exceed $15.00.\n\nThe Department will expect you to see that the above work is carried out in a satisfactory manner, and, if possible, completed before the end of the present month in order that the school building will be ready to reopen after the holidays. You should give the work your frequent oversight, and see that it is being done satisfactorily.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, you should forward properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred to which should be attached a memorandum showing the names of the firms quoted by you to quote prices and the prices quoted by them in each case for the paint and hard wood flooring.\n\nJ. R. McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCore Bay, Ont.\nShould you require an advance to pay for the wages, it will be sent you upon request stating the amount required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

As I feared that I had not sufficiently explained to him I thought best to write to you.\n\nThere is no well near Seal Bay School. We have to get our water from a spring which is at the foot of a steep hill. Though steps have been made it is very hard to carry all the water necessary.\n\nFor some reason the stone troughs which should have been used in the school were not finished and the work was left for this spring. If the Department would provide a cement tank to hold the water coming from the spring trough we could consider it a great favor.\n\nA tank a cistern holding 10 or 12 ft. should I think be large enough to hold the water to be used for washing, etc., etc.\nIt possible this action could be placed just below the boiler which would secure surely prevent freezing or in case it could not be placed under the building at the place where the same trouble of the two sides can occur.\n\nI would be most grateful if the Department would see fit to make this recommendation to the Street Board.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nMost respectfully yours,\nElizabeth Lenehan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, May 27th, 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, requesting that a cement tank be built for the purpose of storing the water from the eaves in connection with the West Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are taking this matter up with Mr. Agent McGregor, and asking him to furnish a report as to the probable cost of having this work done.\n\nAs soon as his report is received, we will be in a position to consider your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Elisabeth Leusch,\nSacred Heart Hospital,\nOaughnawaga, P. Q.\nOTTAWA, May 27th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Miss Elizabeth Leusch, teacher of the West Bay Indian Day School, in which she requests that a cement tank of 10 or 12 barrels capacity be built below the kitchen in order to store the water coming from the caves troughs.\n\nMiss Leusch states that there is no well near the school, and that the present water supply is obtained from a spring which is at the foot of a steep hill, and that it is very hard to carry the water required for school, laundry and household purposes. She also states that she has written you regarding this matter.\n\nI will, therefore, be pleased to have a report from you at an early date stating your views regarding this request. If you recommend that this work be carried out, you should state how this tank should be installed in order to prevent freezing during winter, and also the probable cost of having the work done. You should also state whether labour could be obtained locally to do the cement work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. Russell McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCora Bay, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that I have requisition from West Bay School, for locks to be placed on cupboard there to cost $2.00, and that a galvanized top be put on the chimney of kitchen lean-to, the old one rusted down and stove is smoking badly, cost $5.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOttawa, May 30, 1922.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, regarding the requisition which you received for locks to be placed on the cupboard and a galvanized top to be put on the chimney of the kitchen at the West Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have the locks required placed on the cupboard and a new galvanized top put on the chimney of the kitchen. The cost of this work should not exceed the estimate submitted by you.\n\nProperly certified vouchers should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nKindly give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. T. F.\n\nRussell T. Fowler,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. Russell McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nReferring to your letter of May 27th last, I beg to advise that cistern at West Bay is really needed as all water has to be carried up a steep hill at rear of school, and if put in it would have to be outside of building, and should be about 15 barrels capacity, and be covered with double cover of cedar with air space and no danger from frost and labor should be got on the reserve and I could supervise the cement work by being there one day.\n\nThe cost would be about $60.00; excavating $8. Frames $6. Cement $15. Gravel & Sand $12; cover $6.00, Labor $15.\n\nPump, sink and drain would cost installed about $25. which would be necessary as while man hole would be necessary, it should be double and with children around all the time it should be kept closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, June 9th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst., furnishing an estimate of the cost of installing a cistern at the West Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as the Department is anxious to provide an adequate water supply for this school, and to overcome the difficulty at present existing whereby all water required has to be carried up a steep hill, authority is granted you to have a cistern installed of the capacity mentioned by you. It is noted that the labour required in the cement work can be obtained on the Reserve, so that you will supervise the work. The cistern should be installed in a manner to prevent freezing. A pump, sink and drain should also be installed, and the pump connected with the cistern. The entire cost of the cistern and pump, including the material and labour, should not exceed approximately $100, and a less amount, if possible.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands, and will expect that a satisfactory job is carried out, so that when the cistern is completed it will be frost proof, and will be adequate to serve the purpose for which it is required. It should be so arranged that the water from the eaves-troughs can be collected and run into the cistern.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers covering the expenditure incurred for both the material and the labour required.\n\nIn the purchase of any material required, competitive prices should, if possible, be obtained, and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nYou should give this matter your early attention and, if possible, have the work completed during the coming summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am convinced it can be done. It has been mentioned to agree Mr. Kaye and I have discussed him against the idea. Why not give them a chance or opportunity to do such an arrangement? We must only hope for a space provided actually will not help them. I might say that it would encourage attendance here under something is done. If 3 were present less 35 in the capacity and 34 covered with an outside porch. Kindly do something in the meantime, as feelings should not be considered, just put\nExtract from Report of Inspector Bennett on the West Bay Indian Day School - dated May 12th, 1926.\n\nSome desks broken.\nStove set on bricks (no legs) - Shouldn't a new one be arranged for?\nBlackboards should be refinished.\nDrinking cups needed.\n7 new shades needed, teacher will give dimensions.\n\nThe attendance this spring has been good considering the distance some have to come. Yet the enrolment is only a little more than half what could attend. Yet the seating capacity is only 88 (almost Aver. Att.) and the room is crowded. Consequently they cannot urge a full attendance. Room is 20 x 20 x 8\u00bd = 1100 cu. ft., which is only 129 cu.ft. of air space per child when ordinary health requirements demand 250 cu. ft. air space per child. As it is there were 5 pupils sitting on boxes. Yet you cannot add more seats. The classroom needs enlargement. In winter terms I understand that the odors are terrible at times since the windows and doors cannot be left open long. The school gets the full force of winds down West Bay from the North. (See Gen. Remarks etc.)\n\n(See also attached page from Inspector's Report.)\nSir!\n\nOttawa, May 15th, 1926.\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the West Bay Indian Day School, states that some of the desks are broken; that the stove is set on bricks and that a new stove should be supplied. He also states that the blackboards should be refinished, and that a supply of drinking cups and window shades should be furnished.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to have any broken desks repaired and placed in good condition.\n\nPlease furnish a report regarding the stove, stating whether you would recommend that a new one be supplied for next winter's use. If so, you should give the approximate cost of a new stove of a type considered satisfactory to heat the school.\n\nPlease also furnish a report regarding the condition of the blackboards and state what is required to have them placed in a good state of repair.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and installation of 7 new window shades of the size required. The teacher will be able to give you the dimensions.\n\nYou may also purchase a small number of granite ware drinking cups, and you should forward recently certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the blinds and drinking cups.\n\nThe Inspector has drawn attention to the accommodation provided in the present classroom, which he states is far too small to accommodate the number of pupils who could attend. He states the seating capacity is for 35 pupils only; that the room is crowded and that the enrollment is only a little more than half the number that should attend. The present classroom is 30' x 20' x 48', which only gives 129 cubic feet of air space per child. Ordinary health requirements demand that 250 cubic feet of air space per child be provided. He recommends that an addition be built to the present classroom by an extension to the building of at least 15 feet or more, if required. More cloak room space is also required.\n\nI have to request that you will make full enquiry regarding the accommodation, and furnish a report regarding the size of the addition required to the present building to provide ample accommodation for all the Indian children who would attend.\n\nJ. R. McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\n\n- If possible -\nIf possible, you should state the approximate cost of having this addition built, and a rough sketch should be furnished by you showing the dimensions of the present classroom and the proposed addition. You should state whether, if it is decided to have this addition built, you can arrange to have the work done by day labour under the charge of a competent foreman, you to purchase all material after obtaining competitive prices. The Department will expect to have a reply from you at an early date giving as full information as possible regarding the addition to the building, the cost of same, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The present classroom is 30 x 22, which is wholly inadequate for the enrolment of 48 and the average attendance of 34. Mr. Indian Agent McGregor states that the present building should be condemned as nothing satisfactory can be done with it. The ceiling is very low and the building is not worth any expenditure. He strongly recommends a new classroom and teacher's residence, combined.\n\nThe Band has to its credit, Capital Account, $104,872.38.

Davies\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 8, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the building in use at the West Bay Indian Day School. I note your recommendation that a new building be erected. There are no funds in the Appropriation for Indian Education to make replacement and I have to suggest that the capital funds of the Indian Band (at present $104,872.53) be used. I should be grateful if you would have the Indian Band in Council pass a resolution, asking the Department to expend the sum of $7,000 for a new classroom and teacher's residence combined.\n\nYou should indicate the best method of erecting the proposed new building, i.e., by contract or by day labour. If by day labour, you would have to purchase the materials, secure a competent foreman and have the work done under your direction, using Indian labour as much as possible. If by contract, tenders would be called and the work given to the contractor quoting the lowest and you would be responsible to see that the building is erected according to plans and specifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Father Papineau to try and get the Indians to favor it and I was surprised yesterday that anything was known there about it, but their minds were made up at a meeting they had held themselves and I did not have a chance. As far as I could learn Father Papineau was in favor of it and they probably had too much time to talk it over.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 30, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to the provision of a new school and teacher's residence at West Bay. I note that the members of the Band voted against our proposal. The Department wishes to arrange suitable classroom accommodation as soon as possible and it has been decided to recommend to His Excellency the Governor in Council that the capital funds of the Band be used for the purpose. I believe this motion to be in the best interests of the Indian Band \u2014 see Section 90 of the Indian Act.\n\nIt is possible that the present classroom could be converted into a teacher's residence and a new classroom erected. The materials in the lean-to might be used to fit up the residence. Please let me have your opinion of this procedure as such arrangement would mean a much smaller expenditure. You might let me know what type of foundation is under the classroom and what is the condition of the whole structure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. B.

Deputy & Secretary.\nCertified copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 10th July 1926\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council, on the recommendation of the Acting Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, advise that an expenditure of $7,000.00 be authorised for necessary reconstruction work in connection with the class-room and teacher's residence at the West Bay Indian Day School, in the Gore Bay Indian Agency, in the Province of Ontario, from the capital funds of the West Bay Indian Band which now amount to $104,578.36, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 89 and 90 of the Indian Act.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nReferring to your letter of 8th instant re new school building at West Bay I beg to advise that without the specifications it is hard to say whether it could be built by day labor by the Indians or not, of course it could be done by day labor by bringing in other workmen as might be necessary but it might be better to try contract first as it might be more satisfactory and if this does not seem advisable when tenders were received the other could be tried.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, July 20, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Ferris,\n\nMr. George Strain, Sr., of Gore Bay, Ont., may be engaged as Foreman on the construction of the new Indian day school on the West Bay Reserve.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nIt is now in order to proceed with new classroom for 42 desks + to convert present building into teacher's residence. Old D.S.G.I.M. must be torn down.\n\nPlease note name of Foreman: Proposed to submit report attached with list materials.\n\n[Signature]\nR.F.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nReport should be informed. We need an immediate response.\nJuly 27, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that you may proceed with the building of the new classroom for the Indian Day School on the Bear Bay Indian Reserve by day labour, and that you may employ Mr. George Strain, Sr., of Bear Bay to act as foreman. As much of the labour as possible on the building should be done by the Indians. It is the intention to convert the present classroom into a teacher's residence, and to build a new classroom to the present residence with accommodation for 45 desks. In the purchase of materials required competitive prices should be obtained and the purchases made from the firm quoting the lowest prices. Time sheets should be kept for all labour, and I am sending you, under separate cover, forms for this purpose. They should be prepared and forwarded to the Department in duplicate.\n\nAn advance cheque to pay for labour will be sent you on application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McGregor,\nIndian Agent,\nBear Bay, Ont.\n\nJ. D. Milne,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 27th instant re building classroom at West Bay I beg to advise that I saw Mr Strain today and he is willing to take on the work and wants $9. per day.\n\nWill plans and specifications be sent me?\n\nI suppose that the room will be heated by furnace from basement and should provision be made to heat the teacher's residence in the same way. Have you any particular advice as to how to place the new part. The front door of the present school could be closed for the time, if thought necessary. Roof of present building has mansard roof.\n\nAll wood materials would have to come from Owen Sound as no dry lumber could be obtained. By ordering everything at one time a better freight could, no doubt, be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAugust 5, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the building of a new classroom at Red Bay, I beg to say that you may employ Mr. Strain to act as foreman for this work. The classroom should be built in such a way that it will join up to the best advantage with the present building, which is to be converted into a teacher's residence. It is not thought necessary to place a cellar under this classroom, as it can be more economically and satisfactorily heated by means of a stove. When you have consulted with Mr. Strain on the best way of building the classroom, he should furnish you with a list of the materials required, and reasonable prices should be obtained and the materials purchased to the best advantage.\n\nTime sheets should be kept for all labour and forwarded to the Department in duplicate. An accountable cheque will be sent you to pay for wages on application. I am sending you, under separate cover, copies of time sheets.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F.

Russell McGregor, Esq.,\nGore Bay, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed is our estimate covering your inquiry in full delivered to Dock here, and freight allowed to West Bay, but not Dockage there.\n\nWe have made two changes in our estimate to you. First, The hardwood flooring was asked for in No. 2. No 2 flooring is so very poor that we discontinued handling it five years ago, but we have included in our estimate 50% No. 1 Standard lengths, and 50% short flooring in No. 1 & 2. the short flooring will run 90% No. 1. This will give you a superior flooring to any No. 2 ever made. But if you prefer the Number 2 we will furnish it for $5.50 less than our estimate.\n\nSecond, the item of 3200 feet of 1 x 4 Georgia Pine V Joint has been changed to ready no. 1 Clear Fir. If you wish we can furnish you 1/2\" Fir V Joint at $38.00 off estimate and in same grade. Or, if you prefer can furnish you 3/8\" Yellow Pine Clear Beaded Ceiling at Estimate price.\n\nIf our tender should be in order, ask that you have your Mr. Strain forward sketch showing thickness of walls, and 1\" strapping around doors frames. With this information we can give you immediate shipment.\n\nWe would appreciate your order, and can assure you our usual good grade.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nF.H.\n\nSOO LUMBER & MILL CO.

They are in terrible condition.\"\nOttawa, May 25th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the West Bay Indian Day School, recommends that the following equipment be supplied for the use of the school and teacher's residence:\n\n- 3 kitchen chairs\n- 1 broom\n- 3 sheets\n- 2 pillow cases\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of these supplies. While serviceable articles should be obtained, they should be purchased as cheaply as possible.\n\nThe Inspector further states that a lock is required for the dining-room door. You may purchase same and arrange to have it installed.\n\nProperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred for the above authorized purchases.\n\nThe Inspector has drawn attention of the condition of the toilets. He states that they are in a terrible condition and should be replaced. He also recommends that the interior of the teacher's residence be painted. I have to request that you will forward a report regarding the toilets and painting. You should state whether it is necessary that new toilets be erected and, if so, you should give an approximate cost of having the work done. Please report, also, regarding the painting mentioned and give an estimate of the cost of having same done, stating whether or not you would recommend that this work be carried out. Your early attention to the above will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nReplying to yours of the 26th, re. Sperate School Inspector's report on West Bay Indian School I have to report that it is quite necessary to have new toilets erected, and I have made enquiries as to the probable cost and find that it will be approximately $40.00 for each toilet.\n\nRegarding the painting the interior of the teacher's residence, this was given one coat at the time it was built and Miss Lavalle wished it to be left until Spring; it was never completed, and I would recommend that same be done during the summer vacation. The paint and varnish figuring will cost in the neighborhood of $20.00, and getting it put on $28.00, and I possibly will have to buy some brushes, possibly $1.75.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nWm. Jackson\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 2nd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, regarding the erection of two new toilets in connection with the West Bay Indian Day School and stating the approximate cost of same; also regarding the painting of the interior of the teacher's residence.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange during the present summer to have two separate toilets erected, and the work should be carried out as inexpensively as possible. You should purchase the material and arrange for the labour. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to see that a satisfactory job is completed. Padlocks should be installed on the door of each closet and the keys kept in the possession of the teacher.\n\nRelative to the painting of the interior of the teacher's residence, you may arrange during the summer holidays to have this painting performed. You should purchase the paint, varnish, brushes, etc., and arrange for the labour. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained in the purchase of the paint required and for the lumber, etc., for the toilets.\n\nYou should see that all work is finished to your satisfaction, and, when completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material and also for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWilliam Jackson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCora Bay,\nOnt.\n\nActing Asst.

It is noted from the returns received that the enrolment varies from 35 to 45 children, and the average from 25 to 30 children. In view of this, it is thought that there should be a sufficient number of desks to provide seating accommodation. However, if you will forward the name of the manufacturer of the desks at present in use, and also give the sizes and number of each size of the 6 single seats required, consideration will be given to supplying this extra number, if you and the teacher are of the opinion that they are absolutely necessary. Please consult the teacher regarding these extra desks, and ascertain definitely the sizes required. Full shipping directions should also be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE. F. Priddle, Esq.\nActing Indian Agent,\nCove Bay, Ont.\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 21st 1928 No 12-4-5 I beg to advise that Mr Cunningham and myself are of the opinion that it is absolutely necessary that new seats be furnished West Bay day school, the attendance was such before Easter holidays that Mr Cunningham had to seat three in a seat on one or two occasions.\n\nI would recommend the furnishing of six new single seats, I could not find the name of the manufacturer on the single seats now in the school the only thing I could find was A. S. Co. 2. The seats are 2 ft 6 inches from the floor to the top of the back and the size of the back is 14\" x 23\".\n\nThese seats should be shipped via Little Current thence stage to West Bay.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.

Our records show that in 1918 eight double and six single desks were supplied this school by the Globe Furniture Co. Ltd., Waterloo, Ont.

Please state whether this type of desk would be satisfactory, and ascertain from the teacher the number and size of each number required.

Please state whether you would advise that this school building be painted this summer or not, and, if so, you should give full particulars as to the amount of painting required and the approximate cost of same and how you would recommend that the work be carried out. I may say that our funds are very limited and, unless this painting is urgent, we would not be prepared to authorize having it done this summer. The Department will, however, await your report as to the amount of painting required, cost, etc.\n\nPlease also furnish your views relative to the providing of a well at this school, or what other means you would recommend in furnishing a supply of water. You should give an estimate of the cost of any work which you would recommend be carried out for the purpose.\n\nThe above matters should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. F. Priddle, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to official letter file No 12-4-5 July 8th 1930 I beg to advise that the school at West Bay would be the better for painting but it is not absolutely necessary and would not hurt to have it left till next year. The cost of painting the school and residence attached with a good grade of paint and the work done by an experienced man would be around $250.00.\n\nThe water for the school has always been obtained from a spring creek at the back of the school and water from this creek is also used by a good many residents in the village as well. Digging and drilling in the vicinity has always proven a failure in your official letter file No 12-4-5 Nov. 26th 1928 permission was given for me to have a new set of steps built down to the creek but as winter set in so early I could not get the work done but explained to Mr McGookin on his visit to the school what was intended and he thought same would be satisfactory and I am therefore having the steps put in now before school resumes.\n\nI would recommend leaving the painting of the school until next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont\nOttawa, July 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the painting of the West Bay Indian Day School building and residence and also to the drilling of a well. In this connection it is noted that the painting is not absolutely necessary and could stand over until next year.\n\nThe Department has also noted your report relative to the water supply. As our funds this fiscal year are extremely limited, both the painting and providing of a well will have to stand over until next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

It is a Indian to given charge of the work and I could secure either good labour or no good labour and if either one would do then the work will get done every other day or so, if I had either only one good or no good men and nothing else they would get done on the same day.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, August 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, informing the Department that Thomas Prestage, whom you were authorized to engage as overseer of the painting and repairs required at the West Bay Indian Day School, is unable, on account of other work, to accept the position.\n\nIt will be satisfactory if you arrange to have this work carried out by Indian labour under your supervision. You should give the Indians employed definite instructions as to the work to be carried out. In the purchase of the paint and other materials required, you should be guided by instructions in official letter of May 16th, last. The total cost of the material and labour should be kept within your estimate as contained in letter of April 24th, last, viz., $275. If you can effect a saving in this amount, I would request that you endeavour to do so, as our funds this year are extremely limited.\n\nYou should keep proper time sheets, in duplicates, of the labour employed. These you should certify and forward to the Department, together with itemized accounts, in duplicate, certified by you, covering the cost of the paint and other materials.\n\nPlease arrange to have this work begun as early as possible, in order that it may be completed before the school reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

E. Cook Supt. of Hydro here of $75.00 to wire the school with four lights, three upstairs in the residence and four downstairs in the residence with a switch on the upstairs part and a plug in downstairs, all connected up with the power line and bulbs furnished ready to turn on the lights, but no fixtures just drop lights with bulbs. Fixtures would run into quite a lot more money and Miss Wrinn states that drop lights would be perfectly satisfactory.\n\nRegarding the fence, I have obtained a price of $35.00 for a new fence all along the front of the school grounds and all but eight rods across the back as there is eight rods there that would be alright, the end fence between Jos. D. Corkins and the school ground is all right and also the end fence between D.W. Dehassige and the school ground.\n\nThe price quoted of $35 was made by D.W. Dehassige and this includes 30 rolls of new wire fence No 9 wire 16 staves to roll and about 30 new fence post. Dehassige will take down the old fence and post that are of no use and put in new post where necessary and put the fence in good shape at above price. The fencing of the garden plot would cost at least $20 and as the garden would not need to be fenced off by itself if the school grounds were fenced I would recommend that the grounds of the school be fenced.\n\nA new rocking chair for the school can be purchased for $7.75 and 3 kitchen chairs at 90\u00a2 each and I would recommend that these be supplied.\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that when in West Bay yesterday I visited the school and found Miss Wrinn confined to the house with a bad cold. The children had been sent home with bad colds also under Doctor Davis orders. Miss Wrinn expects to open school again the first of next week.\n\nIt was necessary to buy a new pipe and several stove pipe lengths for the kitchen stove in the school residence as the old pipes were getting dangerous.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario\nOttawa, January 30, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, giving an estimate of the cost of installing wiring for electric light purposes in the West Bay Indian Day School and teacher's residence. It is noted that it would cost $75.00 to wire the classroom with four lights and the teacher's residence with three drop lights upstairs and four downstairs, with a switch on the upstairs part and a plug-in downstairs - all connected up with the power line and bulbs furnished.\n\nBefore the Department can consider authorising this work, it will be necessary to have full information concerning the rates that would be charged for supplying the current for lighting purposes. You should obtain this information and advise the Department. We would not be prepared to undertake the expense of wiring the building, should the rates charged for current be high.\n\nWith reference to the fencing of the school grounds, I note that it will cost $35.00 for a new fence along the front of the grounds and all but 8 rods across the back. I would request that you again draw this matter to the Department's attention early in the spring. At that time, we will be in a position to decide whether funds for the purpose can be provided from the Appropriation for Indian Education for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of a new rocking chair, at a cost not to exceed $3.75, and also three kitchen chairs, at 90\u00a2 each. Please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should also forward a certified account, in triplicate, for payment of the new \"T\" pipe and the length of stove pipe which you obtained for the kitchen stove.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Miss Wright, head girl forwarded two samples of water to Toronto for analysis, No 1 was taken from the creek and No 2 was taken from the cistern. I have enclosed the report with regard to this water.\n\nI am informed by the Indians that a few years ago a well was drilled on the school grounds and water was obtained at 40 ft but this did not satisfy the drillers and they went deeper and came up with the result that no water was obtained at all, therefore it is considered by the Indians that if another well is drilled at the 40 ft level it will be successful. However, there are dug wells near by which are not over 20 ft deep.\n\nThere is a hill rising out of the school grounds about eight miles from here and I would like to make an inquiry for drilling at a point that is about 1,700 feet above sea level.\n\nMay your expedition be successful and satisfactory.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nMay your expedition be successful and satisfactory.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, October 10, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, regarding contamination of the source from which the drinking water for use at the West Bay Indian Day School is obtained, enclosing an analysis of the water and requesting that a well be drilled. In connection with the drilling of a well, it is noted you and the Indians are of opinion that it would not be necessary to go deeper than, approximately, 20 ft. to obtain a supply of water and that the cost, for drilling and casing, would not exceed $2.00 per foot and would possibly be less. It is noted that there is a well drilling outfit which can be obtained.\n\nI would request that Indian labour be utilized, as far as possible. The total expenditure, including drilling, casing, supplying pump and any pipe required, covering the well and placing it in a satisfactory condition, should not exceed the sum of $60.00. If you are satisfied that water can be obtained at a depth of, approximately, 20 ft., you may proceed with the work of having the well drilled as soon as possible and purchase and install the necessary pump.\n\nI have also your letter of the third instant, advising that the platform inside the school building requires repairs and also the belfry of the school. In this connection I have to say that you may incur an expenditure of approximately $10.00 in having the platform and the belfry repaired. Indian labour should be utilized as far as possible - you to purchase any materials required. You may also arrange for the purchase and delivery of a comforter for use in the teacher's residence.\n\nAfter the well has been drilled and the repairs to the school carried out, you should forward a voucher, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. I would request that you keep all costs as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. F. Fridile, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to official letter 12-4-5 Oct. 10th last regarding drilling of well at Point Bay school, I have to say that 40 feet (for y) was the length that I mentioned in my letter of 3rd inst in speaking of getting water at the school, this would mean an expenditure of about $100 and I cannot guarantee that we would get water then but I am satisfied that there is every likelihood of doing so.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario\nOttawa, October 22, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the drilling of a well at the West Bay Indian Day School. In this connection it is noted you consider that there is every likelihood of obtaining water if the well was drilled to a depth of 40 ft., requiring an expenditure of approximately $100.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging to have this well drilled, to a depth not exceeding 40 ft. It is hoped that a supply of water can be obtained at less depth, but, in the event that water is not obtained at a depth of 40 ft., you should communicate with the Department before proceeding to drill deeper. At the same time, you should submit a further report as to the prospect of obtaining water and the additional depth you consider it would be necessary to drill.\n\nOur funds are extremely limited, and it is hoped that a good supply of water can be obtained without the necessity of going beyond a depth of 40 ft. The cost, including installing of pump, casing, etc., should not exceed your estimate. In the drilling of the well, Indian labour should be utilized as far as possible. This matter should receive your prompt attention, in order that the work can be completed before the extremely cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. F.

The frame work on the top which supports the covering is in a state of deterioration and will have to be replaced by new material. The pipe which connect the cistern with the pump in the kitchen in the teacher's residence is rusted through and will require new piping, also the eaves troughing is badly in need of repair as the water leaks through and runs down between the walls of the building. The plaster on the ceiling in the teacher's living quarters is in need of repairs as it is broken and is falling off in one corner of the living room.\n\nI estimate the it will cost approximately $35.00 to have the necessary repairs carried out to the cistern, eaves troughing and ceiling plaster at this school, and would respectfully request authority be granted to have the work carried out without delay as the teacher finds it very inconvenient to get along without the use of the cistern when there is so much spring cleaning to be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nManitowaning, April 5th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a requisition by Miss Mary Wrinn for articles for use in the classroom and teacher's residence at West Bay Indian School.\n\nThe hand towels, pillow cases and table oilcloth asked for are for use in the teacher's living quarters to replace these articles, towels, pillow cases and oilcloth which are past further usefulness.\n\nChloride lime and lysol should be supplied for the outside toilets.\n\nSix window fasteners and 3 door-bolts are required for classroom windows, and outside doors of school and teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nApril 8, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant enclosing requisition for supplies for the East Bay School you may purchase 2 pairs of towels, 2 pairs of pillow cases, 6 tins of chloride of lime, 1 pint of lysol, 2 yards of table oilcloth, 6 window locks and 3 door bolts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Farquhar, M. P., regarding the West Bay Indian Day School.\n\nA new well was drilled at this school in June, 1936, and I have been unable to locate on our file any report showing that the water was injurious to the health of the children. I might add that it is not our usual practice to install electrically operated pumps in Indian Day Schools, not only on account of the primary cost but also the maintenance of such installation is a constant cause for expenditure. I note that you have been informed that it would require approximately $300.00 for the installation mentioned in your correspondent's letter. No funds for this purpose have been provided in our current year's appropriation.\n\nHowever, as requested by Mr. Pratt the Indian Agent is being written and requested to report immediately. As soon as his reply is received the matter will have further consideration and another memorandum will be submitted to you.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJune 28, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been reported to the Department that the West Bay Indian Day School requires some alterations and repairs. It has also been urged that water be brought into the building and in this regard our correspondent writes as follows:\n\n\"That the only source of water supply is a nearby creek of which the water is highly polluted with typhoid germs; that two wells have been drilled but both were failures.\n\n\"That not far from the School, say around 600 ft., there is good spring water which comes out of the ground; that this spring is on the other side of the creek, thus making it difficult to reach.\n\n\"It is suggested that the water from this spring could be brought into the school without much difficulty if an electric pump were installed; that the electricity with which to run the pump could easily be procured as the Hydro runs through there, and that there is a transformer at the school gate.\n\n\"It is stated that every Fall there is an outbreak of Dysentery among the children and the Doctors maintain it is caused by the impure water from this creek; that Dr. Davis condemned this creek years ago.\n\n\"That the estimated cost of having this work done would be in the neighbourhood of $300.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitoulin, Ont.\n\"It is represented that the health of the children being so essential, the need is very urgent.\"\n\nPlease visit this school immediately and let me have a complete report as soon as possible regarding the West Bay School. You should report fully on any repairs or alterations necessary, giving an estimate of their cost. You should also comment on the representations made to us regarding the proposed installation of a new water system.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJune 23, 1958.\n\nDear Mr. Farquhar:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of June 22 with reference to alterations, repairs and installation of a new water system at the West Bay Indian Day School.\n\nThe Indian Agent is being written and requested to report immediately regarding the representations contained in your letter. As soon as his report is available the matter will receive very careful consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nReceived June 30\n\n[Handwritten note:]\n1P\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that I visited this school recently and made an investigation of the water supply. The two wells which have been drilled are both total failures. The supply intended for use at the school has been carried from a spring creek near the school, and from this creek a large number of the Indian families get their supply of water. There is another shallow spring, which your correspondent refers to, but this spring contains the water in its mouth, and no doubt there are found in the spring, or within a short distance of it, plenty of water, besides it would be costly to force the water from the spring by means of a electric pump as I have seen in other cases. It might be well to lay a short pipe across the creek near the school and this would enable water to be carried from the spring for drinking purpose. A suitable bridge should not cost over $100.00, or it might be advisable to have the supply of drinking water required delivered by the Bay which is only a short distance from the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\"The school building appears to be in good condition except the ceiling plaster in the teacher's living quarters which is in need of repair. The cost of having this work carried out should not exceed $25.00.\"\n\nIn view of the agent's report, I believe that you will agree that it would not be advisable to incur the expenditure that would be necessary to pump the water from the spring to the school.\n\nI do not see much advantage in any of the suggestions with reference to securing water. The agent is being written again with a view to ascertaining if there is any possible way of securing an adequate supply of water by digging another well.\n\nThe repairing of the plaster in the teacher's living quarters is being authorized.\n\nT. R. L. Maclean\nActing Director\n\nHon. Deputy Minister\nJuly 22, 1938.\n\nDeputy Minister\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Pratt's memoranda of June 23 and June 25, also Dr. McGill's reply of June 26, in connection with representations made in a letter from Mr. Thomas Farquhar, M.P., regarding the East Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIndian Agent Lewis recently visited East Bay, and reports as follows in connection with the contents of Mr. Farquhar's letter:\n\n\"I have the honour to report that I visited this school recently and made an investigation of this matter. The two wells which have been drilled are both total failures. The supply of water for use at the school has been carried from a spring creek near the school, and from this creek a large number of the Indian families get their supply of water. There is another shallow spring, which your correspondent refers to, but during the spring months the water in this spring would not be any more pure than in the spring creek where at present they get their supply of water, besides it would be costly to force the water from the spring to the school by an electric pump as it is over 1,000 feet away from the school building. I estimate that it would cost approximately $1500. It might be well to have a narrow bridge built across the creek near the school and this would enable water to be carried from the spring for drinking purpose. A suitable bridge should not cost over $100.00, or it might be advisable to have the supply of drinking water required hauled from the Bay which is only a short distance from the school.\"\nWhereas\n\n1.

In any case we have no funds for the purpose this year.\n\nDo you consider it would be feasible to dig another well close to the school? If so, is there any likelihood of obtaining good water? Please let me have your comments in this regard and if you consider it would be advisable to dig another well you might let me have an estimate of the expenditure that would be involved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR.

Water cannot be obtained by digging in the school yard as several wells have been put down in the vicinity of the school and all have been a failure. The only means to try and solve the water problem at this school would be to have a well put down on the bank of the creek a short distance from the school. It would be necessary to dig down to several feet below the level of the creek, put a galvanized steel crib of 23\" diameter, and have a ditch of about two feet wide to the bottom of the creek and fill with good gravel to the bottom of the well so all water entering would be filtered, and as the creek never has gone dry it would mean a lasting supply of good water, which they have never had yet.\n\nI have had Mr. Oliver Bond a contractor of Mindemoya make an estimate on the cost of this work and he is willing to dig the well, supply the galvanized steel crib, put a good lumber top on crib covering it with galvanized iron so that no dirt can get in, and would repair the present pump in the old well to first class repair and install it in new well leaving everything in fair-perfect-working order for the sum of $110.00.\n\nThis would appear to me to be the cheapest and most satisfactory means to get a supply of water to the school and teacher's residence. The work should be carried out before the middle of March in order to miss the flood water, as the well would have to be an approx. depth of 22 feet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nHouse of Commons,\nCanada,\n1st March, 1939\n\nW.

I am informed that it would be a very easy matter to get a proper water supply from the spring creek running through the school grounds, and, as the Hydro line is in close proximity, the cost of installing a good water system would be very little.\n\nI am also advised that there is a great deal of disease and sickness there which may be attributable to the existing unsanitary conditions and I would appreciate your looking into this matter with a view to having a proper water supply for the school and residence.

J. F. Pratt, Esq.,\nPrivate Secretary to the Minister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Pratt:\n\nThe matter of the poor lighting facilities in the Indian school at West Bay, Ontario, has been brought to my attention. I am advised that on dull days children with rather poor eyesight have great difficulty in reading.\n\nAs the Hydro power line runs within a few rods of the school I thought that the Department might consider the wiring of the building; this would also be a great convenience for the school teacher who resides in a part of the school building.\n\nWill you kindly have the Department look into this matter with a view to giving the school better lighting accommodation.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your early attention to this matter, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) Thos. Farquhar,\nMember for Algoma East.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRequest for improved Lighting facilities at Indian School at West Bay, Ont.\n\nThe attached letter from Mr. Thos. Farquhar, M.P., Apr. 14, is submitted for consideration of the representations therein, and his request that better lighting facilities be provided.\n\nPlease return the letter, with a draft reply.\n\nW.J.A.F. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnc.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor draft reply as requested.\nlighting facilities are the facilities usually installed at Indian day schools. I have in mind the number of windows, their size, etc. If the windows are in any sense faulty, you might suggest ways and means whereby they might be improved.\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 21, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Thomas Farquhar, Esq., M.P., in which he states that a complaint has reached him with respect to the lighting facilities at the West Bay Indian Day School. Mr. Farquhar in his letter suggests that the Department might seriously consider the advisability of supplying this school with electric energy.\n\nThe claim of this school for electric lighting was carefully considered by the Department a couple of years ago, but in view of all the circumstances it was definitely decided at that time that the Department could not assume the responsibility for supplying electric light to this particular school.\n\nMr. Farquhar states that on dull days certain children with rather poor eyesight have great difficulty in reading. If there are children in attendance at this school with defective eyesight, these cases should be carefully investigated by the Doctor. In addition to this a number of our school teachers take up vocational instruction on dull days, such as crochet work, hand loom weaving, etc., for girls and carpentry work and wood carving for boys. You might discuss this matter with the teacher. You might also state in your reply if the existing lighting -\n\nCharles R. Johnston, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, April 12, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Ferguson:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 14, in which you ask that the lighting facilities at the East Bay Indian Day School, in your constituency, be investigated by the Department.\n\nThe officials of the Indian Affairs Branch inform me that the Branch has not at any time installed electric lighting facilities at Indian day schools, although the matter has been investigated on a number of occasions. Correspondence on file indicates that the Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario are not prepared to supply electrical energy to Indian day schools unless this Department, as owner of the premises, signs a contract guaranteeing the payment of all charges incurred in connection with the electrical service. In view of this and a number of other conditions, it has never been considered advisable to proceed with the installation of electric lighting at our schools.\n\nOn dull days a number of teachers take up vocational instruction, such as knitting, crochet work for girls and carpentry and wood carving for boys. It is just possible that the teacher of the East Bay School might be encouraged to follow this practice.\n\nThe Indian agent will be asked to visit this school and to make an investigation of the existing lighting facilities with the object of having them improved, if improvement is at all possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nTheo. Ferguson, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\n\nRAH\nOttawa, April 21, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Farcuhar:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 14, in which you ask that the lighting facilities at the East Bay Indian Day School 1, in your constituency, be investigated by the Department.\n\nThe officials of the Indian Affairs Branch inform me that the Branch has not at any time installed electric lighting facilities at Indian day schools, although the matter has been investigated on a number of occasions.

An amount is paid monthly to the teacher of this school for caretaking services and as long as this payment continues she should arrange for the necessary work. We are, of course, prepared to pay extra for cleaning the toilets.\n\nIt is noted that on your voucher form you give as authority for the expenditure letter of November 8, 1939, also letter of October 26, 1939. These have been reviewed and we cannot find any mention of authority in these letters for the expenditure covered by your voucher No. 40-92. In any case I would point out that when authority is given by this Branch for any expenditure it only applies to the fiscal year in which it is allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A.

Johnston,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter No.12-4-5 dated May 17, 1940, in regard to duties of caretaker.\n\nIt is impossible to get this adjusted immediately, as apparently the present caretakers were engaged by the former agent with the understanding that such jobs as cutting grass and weeds, removing storm windows, screens etc. were not included in the caretakers duties.\n\nI would suggest that we get this straightened out at the beginning of the next school term, and have it distinctly understood what their duties are.\n\nIn regard to splitting wood, with the exception of two or three schools, the kitchen wood was purchased split ready for use, and was paid for accordingly, and I will endeavour next year to have it all supplied in this way.\n\nIn most cases the salary paid as caretaker does not cover what she pays out to Indians for sweeping, scrubbing etc.; as most of them hire the work done, partly to help the Indians out, but where the teacher resides at the school, it is better to appoint her as caretaker, so she can oversee the work anyway.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nCRJ / JH\n| Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 2 Cans Glo Cota             |          |            | $3.00   |\n| 1/4 Cup of Sauce            |          |            | $1.50   |\n| **Total**                   |          |            | $4.50   |\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Kingsboro & Baxter,\nADDRESS: Little Current, Ontario.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1940 | Authorized by Dept. letter No. 12-4-5 dated April 9, 1940 |\n| Aug. 7 | To, Articles furnished for use at the West Bay Indian Day School, Aug. 8/0. | 4.50 |\n| (Allotment No. 76-10-692... 83.00) |\n| 76-12-415... 1.50 |\n\nTOTAL: 4.50\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\nVoucher No.: 40-289\nDate: August 16, 1940\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No. 1083\n\nOffice of the Manitoulin Island Indian Agency,\n\nAugust 16, 1940\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 40-289, amounting to $4.50 in favour of Kingsboro & Baxter, Little Current, Ontario, for Articles furnished to West Bay Indian Day School, Aug. a/c.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 12-4-5 dated April 9, 1940.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nORJ / JH\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\nHanitowaning, Ontario,\n\nSeptember 11, 1940\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI wish to make a report on West Bay School.

Johnston,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:\u2014 At your request I have examined the Sink drainage etc., at West Bay Indian day School at West Bay and find that the Sink trap is worn out also the drainage pipes are done as well as the drainage pit, and it is useless to try and repair it as it would only be waste time and money. So am giving you price on new job complete, with stoned wall in pit. Price as follows:\n\n1. 1\u00bd\" Sink trap, $2.00\n1. Sink connection, 75.\n16. ft. 1\u00bd\" pipe, $4.60.\n3. 1\u00bd Elbows, 1.00\nTruck hauling stone, 6.00\nLabor installing 9.00\n\nTotal costs $23.25\n\nTwenty three dollars and twenty five cents is what will be needed to do a job that will last, and give good service for a life time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nOliver Bond\nSir:-\n\nThe drainage system from the kitchen sink at West Bay School went out of commission early last winter and has been cause for considerable annoyance and inconvenience to Mr. and Mrs. Joyce ever since.\n\nI prevailed with them to put up with it until the frost went out in the spring, as it would be difficult and expensive to get a good job in the winter time.\n\nThe old arrangement was a timber cess pool outside the building with a part board drain and has always given considerable trouble in the winter time. The old trap is all worn out, and as there is no basement in the building, we think much better service would be received with having a cess pool built up with rock directly beneath the sink underneath the building, eliminating the difficulty from frost, the estimated cost of which is $23.25.\n\nMr. Oliver Bond has given me a quotation on a complete new system, which I think is very reasonable, and I would recommend that I be authorized to make the alterations without delay. Mr. Bond's estimate is enclosed herewith.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nORJ / JH\n12-4-5\n\nOttawa,\nMay 9, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant you may incur an expenditure of $23.25 in repairing the drainage system of the kitchen at the West Bay Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The casing got broken, short tire peg, and the teacher, Mr. Joyce took the part off and set it aside at his own expense. Another small casing which is attached to the broken part, was screwed back on the sucker rod while the part was sent away for welding, and while Mr. Joyce was away over a weekend, some mischievous person, probably children, took the threaded casing off, put a lot of gravel stones down the pipe and also put a lot of refuse, tin cans etc., in the well, which necessitated pulling the job out, taking the cylinder apart to remove the gravel stones and thoroughly clean the well.\n\nThe top has now been made secure so that it cannot be lifted without some tools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nCHJ / JH\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nJune 6, 1943\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nWest Bay Indian Day School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 02-289\n\nSHIP TO (Local purchase) C.

It is requested that you insist on the job being done to your satisfaction so that you can conscientiously sign a voucher for the balance due.

However, it is noted that you consider the chimney is still unsafe. It is considered that to make the chimney safe was the essence of the contract and therefore, you should be able to safely insist on this being done.\n\nYour voucher No. 43-223 is returned herewith and when the work is properly completed will you please let us have an amended voucher covering the expenditure.\n\nD.

As there are some additional items which will be attended to in school, the order will not be required for a few weeks. The prices quoted on the list were from Christie's Limited, and I would refer to have you purchase the supplies to West Bay School, Tweedsmuir, Ontario, via Toronto, to little current, Ontario. The stove at this school is altogether beyond repair and in need of an immediate replacement. I can secure a fine new one with reasonable cost from C. W. Wilson, Whitewater, Ontario.\n\nI would request that you give this matter your earliest attention.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. R. Johnston,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa,\nAugust 10, 1944.\n\nMr. C.R.

The grant for manual training supplies will be withheld until you reply to our letter of today's date.

She particularly complained that the bed was not fit to sleep on, and has also requested to have a partition made in the kitchen which is 12' X 22' so that she can have a bedroom downstairs, as it is very cold upstairs. Some of the walls and ceilings are done with murocco, which are scaly and shabby and requests to have these painted.\n\nSome of the doors fit poorly etc., and altogether I would estimate $100.00 will be required for labour.\n\nThe quotations were secured from C.W. Hinds and S.W. McPhee & Co. of Manitowaning, and T. Eaton's Catalogue.\n\nMiss DesCoteaux brought a gas stove with her, and has requested to be supplied with gasoline for this as well as coal oil for lighting. I presume the gas stove would conserve other fuel, particularly during Spring and Fall, and would recommend this be supplied. Apparently Miss DesCoteaux had coal oil supplied where she taught in other agencies, while in this agency, Shehegwaning is the only instance where coal oil for light has been supplied.\n\nI cannot offer any explanation for this, and I would suggest there should be uniformity. I would estimate from 15 to 20 gallons per year for each school would be sufficient.\n\nI would recommend local purchase of these supplies as per quotations at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nO.R.

Johnston, Indian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nRe: West Bay Indian Day School\n\nFollowing your discussions with Inspector Arnsil and Mr. Clark, Departmental officials have decided to alter the present building.\n\nThe class room was built and the living quarters changed in the fall of 1946. No plans are available here but some sketches or drawings may be in your office. We consider the following renovations should be made as soon as possible so as to be ready for the new academic year:\n\n(1) Connect the school with the nearby Hydro Electric system - please let us know the cost of carrying out this work and we would also like to know the approximate monthly cost of the current required for both the school and living quarters.\n\n(2) Partitions on the ground floor of the present living quarters should be taken down as we feel the upstairs portion should provide sufficient accommodation for two teachers. By doing this we will provide a second classroom.\n\n(3) Repair the present lean-to so it will be comfortable for use as a kitchen in winter and in order that it may be accessible from above by the outside stairway.\n\n(4) Wire the classrooms and the upstairs living quarters and lean-to. Please obtain a quotation for doing this work using ordinary fixtures and providing extra outlets.

Before Mr. Arnell left for British Columbia, he made a specific request that we consider a two-room school for West Bay and a one-room school near Wikwemikong.\n\nIt is my intention to visit your agency as soon as the snow is off the ground, so can then go over the situation together and decide exactly where these schools should be constructed. In the meantime, could I please be advised if Mr. Wm. Ferguson, who is now constructing the R.C.M.P. barracks at Manitowaning would be interested in the construction of either of these schools on a day labour basis. The Department would provide the necessary materials and would also arrange sub-contracts for heating, painting, etc. It is suggested that you approach Mr. Ferguson in this regard, so that we can thoroughly discuss the matter on my visit to Manitoulin. Under separate cover I am forwarding you the following plans and specifications:\n\n(a) Standard blue prints, specifications and bill of materials for our one-room school with attached teacher's residence.\n\n(b) Blue prints, and specifications for our standard two-room school with attached teacher's residences.\n\nPlease note that we do not have a bill of materials prepared as yet for the two-room school.\n\nBernard F.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. 39-6-5 (471) dated Dec. 16, 1947.\n\nVoucher No.: 48-305\n\nDate: March 18, 1948\nMarch 1st 1948\n\nSir,\n\nSome of the Councilors of the Waskemikong Band have been anxious to have the two schools at Matimoon Village moved to the new school building by the end of this month.\n\nThe council requested the service for a long time.\n\nSchool children now attending off-reserve schools should be helped at these schools too.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDavid [signature]\nSam. Commissioner\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith a resolution passed in Council by Manitoulin Island Unceded Band requesting Day Schools be erected on the reserve, one at the Matangowi Settlement, and one at South Bay.\n\nThis matter has been previously considered and it was proposed at one time last year to rent a house at the Matangowi Settlement to open a school. Taking into consideration the pupils that are in Spanish Residential School from this district there would be approximately thirty pupils attend this school, a great many of whom are too far from Wikwemikong, the nearest school. As previously stated, I consider the settlers are too scattered at South Bay to warrant the building of a school there at present.\n\nAlthough a school is needed at the Matangowi Settlement, I wish to point out again that West Bay Reserve should have the first consideration. We have a farm house rented there now for three terms and which is altogether unsatisfactory. There are thirty-six pupils on the roll with adequate space for about half that number. The owner of the house is living in cramped quarters to make his house available for a school and has positively refused to rent the house another winter. When I first made the arrangement to rent the farm house, I advised the owner it was expected it would be only for one term and had great difficulty in getting his consent for last term and then only by raising the rental by $10.00 per month.\n\nI would suggest by all means a new school should be erected here this summer and if it is possible to erect two schools in the Agency, the Matangowi settlement should have second consideration.\n\n[Signature]\nC. B. Johnston,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nOttawa, March 23, 1948.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Manitowaning, Ont.\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th instant, file 186-132 (19) with reference to the erection of new day schools in your Agency. At the present time we are considering the erection of the school at both the places mentioned in your letter. However, a final decision in this regard has not yet been made.\n\nAs I advised you recently, I intend to visit Manitoulin Island late next month but I am awaiting an answer to my previous letter to you before I settle on the date. At the time of my visit we will make a final decision regarding the buildings that are to be erected this year.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: West Bay Indian Day School.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of Department Letter dated March 15, 1948, with reference to construction of a new school at West Bay and Manitoulin Island Unceded Reserves, also parcel of blue prints and specifications.\n\nI have discussed with Mr. Wm. J. Ferguson, the prospect of his building one of these schools on a day labour basis, and wish to advise Mr. Ferguson would not make any commitments at this time. He would be particularly interested in the school at West Bay, as it is near his home, but requires more details regarding hours of work and rates of pay before making any commitments.\n\nHe has prospects of other work near home where he would not be restricted to a forty-four hour week.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohnston,\n\nSuperintendent Indian Agency.\nCredit Advice\n\nMarch 3rd, 1948.\n\nThe following remittance has been received from\nIndian Agent C.

At the one school, we have an old building which was added to approximately fifteen years ago. There are two classrooms which are fairly satisfactory. At this school there are two teachers:\n\n(1) Miss Virginia Trudeau - She is an Indian girl aged nineteen who after spending two years at St. Joseph's College in North Bay was living at Wikwemikong. We hired her to complete the rest of the school year. She is teaching the Senior room which is a fairly good classroom. There are six windows providing light from the proper side. These children tested well and it is obvious that with a qualified teacher good work could be done with them. Miss Trudeau will only be continuing in this school until the end of June.\n\n(2) Miss B. Bruyere - This teacher has no qualifications but had five years in our normal schools. She is a natural teacher and has the primary room doing very well in their work. Unfortunately, this room is a converted part of the house but it is adequate for the present time. It was formerly a classroom which was brought into use as a bedroom and is now back in use as a classroom.\n\nThe teacher's quarters are attached to the old part of the school and is definitely in need of insulation. My recommendations are as follows:\n(1) That Mr. Doucet visit this school during the summer holidays when he is inspecting the new buildings at Lakewiew and Murray Hill.\n\n(2) That arrangements be made to insulate the hall and the entire second floor with ten feet.\n\n(3) A new door and storm door are required for the hall.\n\n(4) The entrance hall should be provided for use by the children entering the classroom. At the present time, we are losing a great deal of heat from the school door.\n\n(5) Mr. Doucet could approach the owner of the Manitowaning Lodge who is a former contractor who told me that he would tender on any repair work or new construction. He will not be available, of course, until October.\n\nBernard F.

Johnston, Supt. of Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nFrom his recent visit to several schools in your Agency, Mr. Doucet reports the following:\n\n1. Wikwemikong Indian Day School - The school plumbing is leaking between the two floors above the kitchen. The Agent has been authorized to have this checked immediately and the necessary repairs made. The school roof leaks at two places. The Agent has been authorized to have this thoroughly inspected and have the spots where the leakage occurs re-shingled. This may entail a few shingles or a couple of square feet, however, as it is ruining the ceilings and walls, it was necessary to have this done immediately. Ceilings at the spot of leakage will have to be re-plastered. It is not more than a few square feet at each spot.\n\nThere is plenty of water in the well but apparently the cylinder of the pump is leaking and would need new leathers. The Agent has been asked to have this done. It should entail very little expense.\n\nThe Department confirms the decisions made by Mr. Doucet and wish you to have the above done as soon as possible.\n\nWe have received your wire re the condenser and coil for the electrical plant. These articles have been ordered through Fairbanks-Morse and will be forwarded to you as soon as they arrive.\n\n2. West Bay Indian Day School. - A great deal of the cold air enters the kitchen from the foundation. This should be thoroughly banked with the surrounding soil in the Fall and in the Spring cleared away to prevent the lumber from decaying. Prices should be obtained immediately from an insulation company on insulating the school and building.\nA storm porch approximately 5' x 6' should be built at the entrance of the second classroom.\n\nThe Department desires you to obtain prices for this insulation at your earliest convenience and also the cost of building the above mentioned porch.\n\n3. Lakeview and Murray Hill - You are authorized to use the rock siding insul brick instead of the red brick for the Lakeview School and if the Company supplying the asbestos shingles for the siding of the Murray Hill School is willing to substitute the rock insul brick, you are hereby authorized to make this substitution.\n\nObtain a contract for the forced air stoker fed heating plant for the Lakeview two-room school and the gravity system with the automatic draft controls for the Murray Hill one-room Day School. Have these contracts sent to this office at your earliest convenience so that the construction of these buildings may not be held up by the heating installation.\n\nBernard F.

This site was chosen for the building of the new school erected here.\n\nOur Indian Agent, Mr. Johnston, told me to bring the matter of the sale and price of this two acres, into our meeting.

I am a hard working man, and I need this money.\n\nWhen they took this land, and had started to drill the well, seventeen horses got into my grain, because the horses did not keep the gate open. These animals ruined about twenty dollars worth of grain. And the Indian Agent promised me that he would make supply me with the fence. As yet, I haven't heard anything about the payment for the land nor any...\nanything about the fence.\n\nPlease advise me concerning this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Joe P.

It was closed and one of the teachers had left before I arrived. The ceiling of the Junior room should be painted white. At present it looks nice but is very dark with no light reflection. Patches of plaster and the floor in the Senior room need attention.\n\nA new pump is on hand and should be installed. The old one is not working at all. One electric light outlet in the storeroom is not working.\n\nFor use during the hot weather, I would recommend that a two burner electric grill be supplied. It would be cheaper to use than wood in the cookstove and much more comfortable for the teachers.\nJuly 22nd, 1949.\n\nMr. C.R.

They admitted that when they had a Day School on the reserve years ago it was closed owing to the difficulty of getting the children to attend. It was pointed out to them that under the treaty the Department was not obliged to open a Day School on every reserve, but only as may be advisable. They were told that the Department had provided two schools in the Lake of the Woods District, one at Shoal Lake, and the other at Shoal Lake. The Indians replied that they would send their children to either of these schools. They complained of bad feeding, overcrowding, and wrongful punishment at the Kenora School. The boys they said spent a great deal of their time in sawing wood and when their children returned home they could not talk English. Girls also had been tied up, etc. They also heard bad reports of the Cecelia Jeffrey School at Shoal Lake, of immorality amongst the pupils, etc.\n\nThere are about 20 children of school age at this reserve and they were all lined up before us at the meeting. Solemn promises were made that they would keep their children at home during the school term if the Department would provide the teacher and they promised to erect the school building, if the Department would furnish such material as Roofing, Flooring, Doors, Sash, Windows, and Hardware. They will get the logs at this coming winter and only need to be supplied with a small quantity of provisions while performing the work.\n\nAs the cost to the Department will not be great, I told them that I would recommend to the Department that their offer be accepted. As most of these Indians are Pagans the school could be non-denominational. Capt. Edwards, however, is of the opinion that the school will not be a\nsuccess, that the Indians will take their children away from the Reserve, on hunting trips when they should be at school. As the cost of the building, however, will not be large, I feel bound to recommend another trial and leave it with the Department to decide. A large enough building will be erected by the Indians to permit of partitioning off one end of it in order to provide living quarters for the teacher. If it is decided to go ahead a plan should be sent to me that will show what Indians will have the dimensions of the logs they should get out.\n\nx x x\n\nA. H. Pratt,\nAccountant.\nOttawa, September 11, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Paget, of this Department, reports that there are 20 children of school age on the Whitefish Bay Reserve. The Department has decided to try a day school at this point, provided that there will be no large capital expense. You're authorized to purchase the roofing, flooring, doors, sash, windows and hardware that are necessary for the school building, which can be used for both classroom and teacher's residence.\n\nThe Indians have promised to get out the logs and to erect a building, giving their labour gratis. You may purchase materials for those engaged on the building. No unnecessary expenses should be incurred, and competitive prices should be sought before making the purchases. If an expenditure of more than $300 is necessary for finishing materials, please make an interim report and estimate.\n\nA requisition for school desks and other classroom equipment should be forwarded when the commencement of the school has been assured.\n\nIt might be well for you to secure a promise in writing from the Chief and parents of the Band to the effect that the children will attend regularly for the periods the school is in operation. As the majority of the Indians have no church affiliation, the school will be non-denominational, under your supervision. When it is timely, you may make a recommendation regarding the engagement of a teacher. It is doubtful if a properly qualified incumbent could be persuaded to accept this position because of the living conditions. You should make enquiries, however, and, if possible, secure applications. I am prepared to allow a salary of only $500 and bonus, as the activity is somewhat of an experiment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Ass't Deputy Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, P.E.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSir,\n\nRe: Whitefish Bay School.\n\nReplying to your letter File No 129-8-1 dated September 11th 1924, your instructions contained therein will be strictly carried out.\n\nVery little can be accomplished this fall in the matter of building other than the Indians cutting and preparing the logs, and when they are all ready the school building will be erected next spring.\n\nI think that an expenditure of $300 would not be sufficient for finishing material, but when the time comes an estimate will be made and a report rendered.\n\nI will see the Chief and obtain from him and all parents who have children of school age a promise in writing that they will cause their children to attend the school regularly.\n\nI would like further details regarding what bonus the Department will allow a teacher for this school, and also what furniture if any (such as stoves, beds, tables etc) will be supplied. I desire this information in order to be in a position deal with applicants for this position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Frank Edwards),\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 24, 1924.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the erection of a day school building at Whitefish Bay.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted that you will arrange with the Indians to get out the logs this winter and erect the building next spring.\n\nWhen it is timely you should forward an estimate of the finishing material required, such as roofing, flooring, doors, sash, windows and hardware. The Department will also provide a small quantity of furnishings for the teacher's living quarters, such as stove, bed, tables, etc. You should also furnish a list of the articles which you consider necessary.\n\nThe Department will be prepared to allow a salary not exceeding $500.00 a year and bonus. I may say that the bonus provided for teachers in Indian day schools for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1925, is at the rate of $15.00 per teaching month. We have no knowledge that this bonus will be continued after the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF.

Jones\nLate of Godfria, Esquimalt Point & Victoria, B.C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoor Copy\nOttawa, October 23rd, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, regarding the opening of a school at Whitefish Bay in the Kenora Indian Agency, and applying for the position as teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the school building at this point has not yet been erected. The Agent will consult with the Indians to get out the logs this winter and erect the building next spring. It is not expected that the school will be ready to commence work until the early spring of 1925.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMr. Wm. E. Jones,\n540 Dovercourt Road,\nToronto, Ont.\nWhitefish Bay Reserve 32A.\nWhitefish Bay, Ont.\n\n1924.\n\nWe, the Chief, Councillors and Indians of Whitefish Bay Band do hereby promise and agree to send our children between the ages of 7 and 16 years to the DAY SCHOOL which is proposed to be erected at the Reserve, and to make them attend school regularly when the school is open, except during the regular and specified holidays; the only excuse for non-attendance is sickness, when the Agent, Doctor or Teacher may decide, and the Agent's decision to be final.\n\nThis having been clearly explained to us, and we, having considered that we have at times to leave the Reserve for an indefinite period, such as Berry picking, Rice picking, Lumbering, Trapping, Fishing etc., we are obliged to make provision for our children during our absence and that their attendance at the school at these times being absolutely imperative.\n\nSigned.\n\nRobt Roy \u2014 Chief,\n\nCouncillors\n\nAt Whitefish Bay Reserve, this third day of December, 1924.\nSir,\n\nIn compliance with above noted file, I enclose herewith a note in writing outlining the Indians of the nation by name. The Indians who have children have not signed it as they were away at the time, and I have since been unable to get in touch with them. It is understood that the Indians have been able to sign.\n\nThe Indians have been instructed to turn out the logs for a building 10x4x10 with a loft 6x12 ft. Building operations cannot commence before the spring.\n\nI have estimated the amount of lumber for flooring, partitions, shelves, cupboards, etc., and doors, windows and shingles, together with tables and chairs, etc., and am confident that all will be required. This is in accordance with the department letter notation of date of this letter. I respectfully request that you be informed of the same.\n\nAs to other matters, outlined in the separate letter, will be attended to in due course.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nGovernment.\nOttawa, January 27th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing a promise obtained from the Indians of the Whitefish Bay Band to send their children between the ages of 7 and 16 years to the day school which it is proposed to erect on the reserve. In this connection it is noted that a sufficient number of Indian parents have agreed to send their children to school regularly to warrant the Department incurring the expense in assisting them to erect a suitable building. The size of the building which it is proposed to erect has been noted, also that the Indians will take out the logs for same this winter.\n\nRegarding the lumber for flooring and partitions, and the doors, windows, shingles and hardware, etc., required, I beg to say that the Department will allow of an expenditure not exceeding $500 in the purchase and delivery of these materials. You should arrange in due time to obtain the quantities required and have them delivered at the school. It will be necessary to obtain competitive prices, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting you the lowest price. The Department will expect you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred. You should obtain detailed accounts, in duplicate, from the firm from whom you make the purchase, which you should certify and send to the Department in order that payment can be made. A memo. should accompany the account showing the names of the firms asked by you to quote and the prices quoted. You should arrange to have building operations commence as early in the spring as weather conditions permit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with general reference to the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School. The Department approves of the appointment of Mr. Dacharme at a salary of $70 per teaching month, and you may employ him immediately to supervise the completion of the building that will be used as classroom and teacher's residence. The department will allow wood for the heating of both the classroom and the residence, but I regret that no transportation can be allowed the teacher and his family.\n\nWhen the teacher arrives at the school, he should make requisition for whatever is required to complete the equipment and to conduct classes. Immediate and favorable consideration will be given to whatever you recommend. It should be remembered, however, that only what is absolutely necessary will be allowed, because of the experimental nature of this activity.\n\nAt the end of September you should in a separate communication make application for Mr. Dacharme's salary. His appointment as teacher will date from the day that he arrives at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. H. L. MacInnes,\nFor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Havard, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI should be glad to receive a cheque for $210.00 in favour of Mr. Dominic Ducharme, principal of Whitefish Bay Day School, this being his salary for the quarter ending June 30th, 1926, the cheque to be sent here at the earliest opportunity, for transmission to him just before the end of the quarter, since I shall be away at that time.\n\nWe inspected the Whitefish Bay School on the 10th inst., finding an excellent attendance and much satisfaction with Mr. Ducharme on the part of the Indians.\n\nI would suggest that Mr. Ducharme's salary be increased, if possible, and that failing such an increase a bonus be given him, as it is almost impossible for him to get along on his present salary. He has a wife and three children, and is 45 miles from town, finding groceries and other commodities very expensive. I also understand he does not get paid during the vacation period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nB/A\nSir,\n\nThe Indians at Whitefish Bay held a council during my visit there yesterday, and agree that the Department should take enough from their band funds to let us pay $10.00 a month to the teacher Mr. D. Ducharme in addition to the $70.00 paid by the Department each month. In my opinion this would be an admirable arrangement, as I understand from Mr. Paget that the Department can not increase the teacher's salary, and an increase provided from the band funds would make the Indians conscious of the value attaching to the teacher's help and advice.\n\nMr. Ducharme arrived here from vacation without funds, and I have had to make an advance for groceries. He will also require a further supply of provisions against the winter. As these are very expensive at Whitefish Bay owing to freight charges might I advance him about $150.00. Part of this will be due him at the end of this month. A voucher will be sent in in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP'A\nOttawa, September 14th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 9th instant, number 108-21, I beg to say that Mr. DuCharme may be paid $10.00 a month from the Band Funds to date from last April 1st, and a voucher for the amount due at the end of the present month may be forwarded, and in future quarterly.\n\nIt is noted that you have advanced him $150.00 which will be charged to his salary as School Teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ducharme, the teacher, covering his salary at $70.00 per month for the quarter mentioned, (authority Dept. Letter 129-8-5 June 6th, 1925) and the increase of $10.00 per month from band funds as from April last, 1926, (authority Dept. letter 115-8-1 of the 14th ult.) I should be glad to have the cheques sent to this office, as we have made some advances to Mr. Ducharme.\n\nDuring my last visit to the school the matter of salary increase was brought up, and I indicated the Department's inability in this direction, suggesting a small withdrawal from band funds, to which the Indians agreed, since it would not amount to more than $2.00 per head per annum. I should be glad, therefore, to receive cheques as per the vouchers enclosed.\n\nOwing to the distance of the school from town Mr. Ducharme needs winter supplies before freeze-up, and asks for an advance of $50.00 in addition to these vouchers, which latter amounts will take care of any advances made by us here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nE/A Enc.\nOctober 10th, 1926.\n\nIn reference to my letter 1.8-21 of the 7th inst. regarding the salary of Mr. Dominic Ducharme, teacher at Whitefish Bay Day School, I would mention the receipt, today, of cheques Nos. 5440 for $60.00, salary increase, April 1st to Sept. 30th, 1926 and 5441 for $50.00 apparently representing the advance asked for. In the case of the former cheque I presume it covers our voucher #3698 for $40.00 but that the Department has decided to pay the increase with no deduction for vacation. I have, however, not yet received a cheque for voucher #3697 for $70.00, but have no doubt it will come along in a day or two.

He was apparently disappointed at the poor attendance of children at his school, but I pointed out to him that owing to illness this was no fault of his, and that he had given good satisfaction. I also pointed out that he was an old man (being about 60 years old) and it was foolish to give up this position when he had nothing else to do. I intend looking around to see if there is anyone else to fill his position should he decide to leave. Possibly Mr. Fugel might allow Mr. Ducharme as it was thought him we got Mr. Ducharme who previously taught at Nipigon School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, informing the Department that you have been advised by Mr. Ducharme, teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School, that he intends to retire during the coming summer. In this connection I have to say it is hoped that Mr. Ducharme will continue teaching during the balance of the present school year, until June 30th, next. If, at that time, he desires to give up duties as teacher, the matter of obtaining a successor could be dealt with during the summer holidays, in time for you to nominate a suitable teacher to succeed him for the next academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Ducharme, for his salary to the end of June 1st.\n\nMr. Ducharme is definitely not fit to receive the honor, and worse yet, she should not be allowed to fulfill her duties.\n\nWe cannot keep the school open. It is overcrowded and cannot accommodate all the Indians.\n\nThere is no one else in town to take over the school so it should just be closed down.\n\nThe school is overcrowded and cannot handle more students.\n\nI am unable to make a decision, and I do not advise us to want to hold on to the school. We have room for the T.C. Cecilia School, but this is a large school and the Indians would not send their children there. The school is overcrowded, as the Whitefish Bay School was classified as a T.C. School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 11, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing the June quarter return of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School and informing the Department that Mr. D. Ducharme, the teacher, gave up duties at the end of that quarter. The Department regrets that Mr. Ducharme has decided to retire from teaching.\n\nWe will be pleased to have this school continue in operation, and I have to request that you will make enquiry and endeavour to obtain the services of a teacher who would be suitable to carry on the work at this school. It is hoped that you will be able to find a teacher of the type that would be satisfactory for this rather isolated school. You should give the matter your consideration. The name, together with particulars regarding qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you recommend, should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. It would be difficult to place the Indian children at Whitefish Bay in residential schools, and the Department, therefore, wishes, if possible, to have the day school at Whitefish Bay continue in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Duchesne, who left Manitoulin Bay last summer, and we have been endeavoring to get him as teacher.\n\nIn connection therewith, we have today received a letter from the Reverend Father Joseph, S.J., of St. Boniface, Manitoba, who writes that Mr. Duchesne will accept the position if approved.\n\nMr. Duchesne has been engaged by the Department of Education as a teacher at Manitoulin Island School, and he has already visited the school in appearance and manner. He is well liked by the people of Manitoulin, and is expected to be highly successful.\n\nWe have written to Mr. Duchesne for more information, and in the meantime, we shall be obliged if you would recommend Teacher Duchesne for the position.\n\nThere is much to be said in favor of the school so we shall be glad to receive authority to make the engagement. Crocker, Steele, etc., have been very enthusiastic about the school, and we shall be happy to hear any further statement.\n\nThe money, if the place should not be vacant, should be paid to the new teacher upon his arrival.\n\nWe presume we can pay the salary that Mr. Duchesne has received, namely $70.00 per teaching month and $120.00 from the funds for annual expenses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\n[Signature]\n\n68-129\nOttawa, August 1, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, relative to the application which you received for the appointment of Mr. Lacoursiere as teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School for the coming school year, and stating the qualifications and experience which he possesses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Lacoursiere, with salary at the rate of $70 per teaching month, and will also allow him payment at the rate of $120.00 per annum from Band Funds, the same as was allowed the former teacher, Mr. D. Ducharme.\n\nIt will not be necessary for you to forward a voucher for the salary due Mr. Lacoursiere as teacher, as these vouchers are prepared here upon receipt of the quarterly return showing the attendance, days taught, etc. You should however, prepare the usual voucher, in duplicate, for the salary due each quarter which is payable from Band Funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nXenora, Ont.\nOttawa, December 31, 1931.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nShould D. Lacroix resign his position as teacher at Whitefish Bay, Mr. Greening, Inspector of Separate Schools, states that he has asked Mr. Agent Edwards to keep in mind the question of the transfer of Miss Violet Hamer, the present teacher of the Sand Point Indian Day School in the Fort William Agency.\n\nSee Mr. Greening's letter dated December 24, 1931, on file 9-10-1.\nApril 11, 1932\n\nDear Mr. Miller,\n\nI thought you might be interested in the following information:\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\n[Handwritten note: End notarized]\nOttawa, April 22, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Greening:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with enclosures, regarding Mr. Lacourciere, teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School. I think it will be most unfortunate if he marries an Indian girl, and the Department would be grateful if you, in conjunction with Mr. Edwards, would do everything possible to discourage him. His usefulness as teacher might be seriously impaired if he married a member of the Band. I am returning the correspondence.\n\nI was much interested in the copy of your letter of the 13th instant to Dr. Jones. The model Indian villages might be of real help to the Normal School. If they are not too cumbersome, I should be very glad to have one in the Schools Branch here at Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nF. J. Greening, Esq., B.A., B.Paed.,\nInspector of Separate Schools,\n438 Robinson Street,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nFebruary 8, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt has been brought to my attention by the Auditor General's Office that a payment of $120.00 a year is made to Mr. D. Lecouciere for supervising the Indians in farming operations in addition to his salary of $70.00 a month for ten teaching months as Teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School in your agency. These payments, of course, are subject to the 10% deduction in the present fiscal year.\n\nOn looking at the file, I find that this payment of $120.00 has been made from Band Funds since April 1, 1926, when Mr. D. Lecouciere was the Teacher, i.e., Lecouciere having succeeded him in September, 1930. I should like to have a report from you with as little delay as possible as to the duties performed by Mr. Lecouciere for the above mentioned additional payment, and whether you consider such an expenditure is warranted. We have no position in our establishment for a part time Farming Instructor at your agency.\n\nVouchers have been submitted quarterly. I notice that Mr. Lecouciere has been paid $30.00 for the September quarter although the school would be closed for two months during this quarter for the summer vacation. Kindly let me have your views in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nKenora, Ontario.\nFebruary 7th, 1933.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 3rd inst. re payment of $120.00 per annum to the School Teacher at the Whitefish Bay Indian Reserve.\n\nThis arrangement was made with the Band in 1926, when D. Ducharme was teacher, and was continued when D. Laguerriere took over, and was that he should receive $10.00 per month for the full year from Band Funds, account #81 in addition to his regular salary of $70.00 per month, for the teaching months. Neither of the two teachers are Farm Instructors but have given assistance and advice to the Indians, and in addition teach the children of treaty women of the Band who are married to other than treaty Indians. This was arranged at the request of the Indians, and with the approval of Mr. F. C. Paget, who was superannuated last year.\n\nIf the grant from the Band Funds was discontinued, we are afraid we would have difficulty in getting a Teacher, as the school is old and dilapidated and is not very comfortable, in fact it was an Indian house which was obtained from one of the Indians in exchange for a cow, but of course the Department have spent money on the building since that time.\n\nWe consider the $10.00 per month well warranted and should be continued, but do not consider that the Teacher should be called a Farm Instructor, although he gives advice when needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nMarch 3, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo with reference to the payment of $120 a year to Mr. D. Lacouciere in addition to his salary as Teacher, for giving the Indians instruction in farming and gardening, and to advise you in reply that it has been decided to discontinue this additional payment from the 31st March. You may, therefore, advise Mr. Lacouciere accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora,\nOnt.\nKenora, Ontario.\nJune 24th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have seen Mr. D. Lacourciere the teacher at Whitefish Bay Day School and he informs us that he is allowing the children to start on holiday on Monday first 24th. The reason being that a number of the Indians wish to take their children to Kenora for July, 1st, and also the teacher will be able to get a job at one of the mines during his vacation. As he is a married man and only receives a small salary, this would be of great assistance to him and we are pleased to approve of it, and hope it will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSome of the Indians of the Whitefish Bay Band wish to transfer their children from the Whitefish Bay R.C. Day School to the nearby Residential R.C. School. They wish the following transferred:\n\nMaggie Bird, #61 aged 11.\nIsaac Neaskookanais or Paypompee #4 aged 12.\nSamuel Neaskookanais or Paypompee #4 aged 11.\n\nThe Department lately approved of the transfer to this school of Michael Michegabo #62 aged 11. Out of the remainder attending the Whitefish Bay School, there is a dearth of Indians, and only a way to treaty a little.\n\nThese Indians would much be better off in the residential schools, as it would be more convenient for them to attend school and keep up their education.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 14, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to placing children from the Whitefish Bay Indian Reserve in the Kenora Residential School.\n\nThe Department considers that those children whose parents are able to properly care for them should continue to attend the day school on the Whitefish Bay Reserve.\n\nIt is understood that the Kenora Residential School has few, if any, vacancies, and only those children whose home conditions are extremely bad should be sent to the Kenora School this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, August 9, 1934.\n\nEnclosed are two letters recently received from James Robinson, of Kenora, Ont. Please report on the statement made in Mr. Robinson's letters, and, when replying, the communications should be returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nKenora, Ontario,\nAugust 16th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter No. 2-1 of this date, including correspondence of Mr. James Koehler of Kenora, who has returned recently, re School Teacher at Whitefish Bay Day School.\n\nThe Department was against operating a Day School in this Agency, but after a visit of Mr. F. T. Page of Ottawa, Mr. Robinson, and myself to Whitefish, it was decided to try one on a pilot scale.\n\nA teacher was purchased from Chief Charlie Lacourciere, and Mr. Robinson was appointed teacher. He resigned and the present teacher, Mr. Lacourciere, was appointed by the Department in the recommendation of the Catholic priests. In connection to the school starting, we sent instructions from Ottawa, but a reply was not received.\n\nLacourciere is a French Canadian from Montreal, and the teachers in all the Catholic Schools in the Agency are of French descent.\n\nLacourciere was located upon as a good teacher, but after consultation with Mr. Greening, Separate School Inspector, it was decided to keep him, owing to the difficulty of getting another.\n\nIn connection to the trust children to the school, there is no lack of funds, mostly of Indian descent, to pay teacher teachers in the future, and we understand does not teach properly.\n\nLet Mr. Scott know my attitude regarding the Indians quiet and not bother the Department, as a matter of fact every complaint however trivial has been taken up and looked into thoroughly, and if necessary the Department notified.\n\nI am in charge of the Catholic schools, part of the return of this report will be completed when the school\nwas burned down, and the Department authorized a small amount to repair the damage, but in view of the fact that the Chief owes the Department a large amount of money, we told him if he would endeavour to clear off this debt, we would help to repair the house, but he has made no attempt to do this, unless when he hands back his share of cash distribution made from time to time from Land Funds.\n\nThis Mr. Robinson is the same man who caused trouble a few years ago, and all the correspondence is on file in Ottawa, and it was partly on account of him that an amendment to the Indian Act was made, Section 141.\n\nMr. Robinson is an old man and we understand in receipt of the old age pension, and has always been a trouble maker, and we presume accepts payment from the Indians for fostering agitation, but we do not think his complaints can be taken seriously.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nP.S. I would suggest he be notified when he has complaints from Indians he should discuss the matter with the local agent before writing Ottawa. I would also suggest a report be sent from the Separate School Inspector.\nJAMES ROBINSON\nRETIRED BARRISTER\nOFFICE: CARMICHAEL BLOCK\nKENORA, ONTARIO\n\nAugust 17th 1934\n\nJ.M. Sutherland Esq.\nActing General Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have recently been down to Ottawa. While there I was introduced to Mr. Murray, who is the Chief. He had me look over his house. That is the type of house he lives in. The clock tower was broken. (I believe that all) the time that he has been in Ottawa, the clock tower has been broken several times at least twice. He does not want you to pay him anything because he says that the clock tower is not worth much.\n\nMy estimate is that Mr. Murray's lawyer may have been doing something wrong.\n\nThe Chief seems very determined that the current chief be paid for the damage. He tells me that the teacher had some insurance on the school house, but I do not know.\n\nAndrea thinks that he should get $200, for the house, but that is more than the actual damage is worth.\n\nObviously, it will be better to let the Chief have his allowance and the money is continued.\n\nYours Truly,\nJames Robinson.\nJAMES ROBINSON\nRETIRED BARRISTER\nOFFICE: CARMICHAEL BLOCK\nKENORA, ONTARIO\n\nAugust 1, 1934\n\nTo Mr. Smith\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn this connection, the Chief of Whitefish informs me that Frank Edwards - the Indian agent at Kenora - is the main reason I am here for the employment of the recent teacher at Whitefish.\n\nI may say that it was through my agitation in 1923, on behalf of the Indian people at Whitefish, that the school there was secured. Frank Edwards violently opposed everything that I suggested on their behalf, but everything in his power to prevent any new reform that was proposed on their behalf.\n\nWithout positive knowledge - my surmise is that it was the man who suggested a Frenchman as a teacher - he does not make little of what was gained through the employment of a Teacher.\n\nAll the people in the vicinity are English in race, and it is the English language especially that the Indians need and require.\n\nI had not been down to that vicinity since 1923 till a couple of weeks ago, and only then did I learn that the Teacher was Frenchman. Naturally, wish to speak the French language and teach the French language. That has been a permanent calamity to the school. Even now the change would be disastrous.\n\nFrank Edwards ever since his appointment here, has been violently opposed to everything that would advance the interests of the Indians in this agency, and the reason - he knew that was the attitude of his Chief, the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nJAMES ROBINSON\nRETIRED BARRISTER\nOFFICE: CARMICHAEL BLOCK\nKENORA, ONTARIO\n\nIn Ottawa, the late Duncan Campbell Scott, of Ottawa.\n\nIn fact the express instructions of the latter to Edwards was:\n\"You keep the Indians of the district quiet and don't bother me about them.\" That was his attitude respecting the Indians.\n\nAnd the Indians of the district aware of that fact, have been ever since, ed to Edwards, and have been awaiting for his removal, ever since.\n\nYours Truly,\nJames Robinson.\nOttawa, August 21, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letters of the 4th instant, referring to various matters in connection with the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School, in the Kenora agency.\n\nRegarding the teacher, Mr. D. Lecourciere, I have to say that he was appointed on the recommendation of the Reverend Father Provincial of the Oblate Order. Previous to his appointment, he had 6 years' teaching experience - 5 years in Montreal and one in Saskatchewan. The Separate School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the school on March 12th last, states that he examined the pupils in Reading, Writing, English, Literature, and Arithmetic. So far as these subjects pertain to their grades, good progress is being made. The Inspector further states that he is quite satisfied that Mr. Lecourciere is doing as well as possible with the present equipment in the school. The instruction in the classroom is in the English language.\n\nWith reference to the damage to the Chief's house, the Department understands that part of the shooting was badly scorched when the school was burned. The Department authorized a small amount for repairs, but the local Agent reports that, in view of the fact that the Chief owes the Department a large amount of money - which he has made no effort to pay - assistance would be given him to repair the house if he would make an attempt to pay his indebtedness.\n\nI would suggest, when you have any complaints from Indians, that you discuss the matter with the local Agent before writing the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJames Robinson, Esq.,\nCarmichael Block,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, August 21, 1934.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, returning correspondence of Mr. James Robinson, relative to matters in connection with the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nFor your information, I enclose copy of a letter which is today being directed to Mr. Robinson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If you have received Mr. Lacourciere's resignation, you should forward same to the Department.\n\nIt is noted from your letter of July 25th, 1930, that Mr. Lacourciere was nominated by Very Rev. J. Magnan, O.M.I., St. Boniface, Man. It would appear advisable to consult Father Magnan again, with a view to ascertaining if he wishes to nominate Mr. Lacourciere's successor. If so, the name, age and qualifications of the teacher nominated by Father Magnan should be forwarded to the Department as soon as possible, in order that a teacher may be engaged before October 31st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Department had already written you on the 15th instant regarding this matter.\n\nIf Reverend J. Magnan, O. M.

My father died in November 1918 from a variety of influenza epidemic. For a living, my mother is still giving private French lessons and has done so for the past 16 yrs. As a result of the depression pupils have not been as numerous. I am single and I reside with my mother at the same address.\n\nI have taught school on a permit. I graduated from the University of Manitoba proper in 1934. Positions are rare and I am still without anything to do. I am financially embarrassed and would like to teach. So respectfully I would accept the position of teacher at Whitefish Bay Day School if you desire to have me. I never lived among Indians before, but I could imagine that if the position has been filled previously...\nby a white man as your sentence seems to suggest,\nthen I would have to be prepared to rough it a little,\nthen the position is feasible and am ready to\naccept the position.\n\nIf I am designated to teach at Whitefish Bay,\nit will be necessary for me to buy comfortable winter\nclothes for the country, especially outdoor garments,\nperhaps a wind-breaker lined with sheepskin,\nmoccasins and so forth. The bedding is an\nimportant thing out there and will necessitate\nmy buying warm blankets in addition to\ntravelling clothes. All these things among others\nwill require a certain amount of money. I could\nbe very much obliged to you if you could pay\nme partially in advance; otherwise, I do not know\nhow I could possibly manage to go it the way\nthe university does. If the College of the\nUniversity of Manitoba and I am the head of the\nsame university will, I am certain, recommend me\nif necessary.\n\nI understand that you will forward my\napplication to Ottawa as soon as possible. Trusting\nthat I may receive a favorable reply, I remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nCapt. Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nPovesh, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing you, at the instance of Mr. Bourde, concerning the position of teacher for Whitefish Bay Day School. I have had some experience in teaching having taught in the district of St. Ambroise. I have my B.A. degree after graduating from the University of Manitoba in 1934.\n\nMr. Bourde told me that you wanted someone, and that he would write you on my behalf. I have informed myself at both railways as to the facilities of transportation to Whitefish Bay. I was told that there were neither railway nor roads between Povesh and the Bay and that the only way of arriving at destinations was by boat. Is there a daily service on Lake of the Woods? Is there any means of travelling after freeze-up? Will it be possible for me to return home for the Christmas holidays? Am I responsible for travelling expenses? What is the teacher's salary? Does the teacher live in a private home or above the school? I presume that there is very little farming, if any, and that all means of subsistence depend almost entirely...\non communication between Kenora and the Bay.\n\nGently write to me at No. 2 Bank of Commerce Bldg., Portage, Winnipeg, Manitoba. I have, presently, nothing to prevent me from starting at your earliest convenience if you desire to have me. I hope that my efforts will be found satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGuy Shaver\nCaptain P.

Frank Edwards\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nKinora\n\nDear Sir:\n\nNow that the school year is over I wish to advise you that I am well satisfied with the results obtained; I have done the very best I could. I have taken a real liking to this place & intend to bring my \"bride\" here shortly after the 25th. But, I sincerely believe that my present salary of $70 a month is not quite sufficient.\n\nOf course there's the P.O. revenue but, since the K.C. mail has been passing through Eagle River during the winter months my salary warrant has diminished a great deal.\n\nYou are well aware of the conditions here. We must send to town for everything we need, the charges are very high; $3 a lb. by plane... Trips to town are also very expensive. At the time being\nI am pursuing a course of studies (M.A. in Lett.) which necessitates my presence in Pteg every 4 mo. This course is costing me on the average for registration fees, books (etc.) between $5 & $6 a month apart from the travelling expenses.\n\nWhen I first came up here the place was in a rather bad shape. There was no fence, no garden, no cupboards in the residence, not even a bedroom. I built a fence myself; then came the garden (soft by 26), then the rest: cupboards, partitions ceiling in the school (etc.), I have whitewashed the walls, painted the roof etc etc.\n\nAnother thing. Not one cent was spent by the depart for the buying & splitting of the wood for the school; not one cent was spent for the care of the schoolroom, the sweeping, scrubbing etc. This the teacher had to do himself or pay someone else to have it done.\n\nI am very glad to have been of some use & I am purely ready to do the same thing over again but, I sincerely believe that $6 a month is the least\na married woman should expect under these circumstances.\n\nI think that if you were willing to put in a good word for me to that effect I would get this little raise.\n\nAs the depart. has refused to provide me with cooking utensils, I bought myself an 8\u00a2 pg. I also bought all my furniture for, as you know there is nothing here along that line.\n\nHoping that you will oblige me as you have already done so often & so well, I remain\n\nYour faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name] (signature)\nOttawa, August 13, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the third instant, you may inform Mr. Armand LaFleche, teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School, that it has been decided to increase his salary from $70.00 to $80.00 per teaching month, effective from September first, next.\n\nWhen supplying the wood for this school for the coming winter, you should arrange to have it cut in proper stove lengths.\n\nIf there are any small articles of furniture that you consider necessary for the teacher's residence, you might submit a list of them and give their approximate cost. The Department will then be in a position to decide what amount can be allowed in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nKenora, Ontario,\n13th April, 1937\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find Whitefish Bay Bay School returns for quarter ending 31st March, 1937.\n\nYou will note the teacher kept the school open during Easter Holiday week, and he writes asking me to authorize the change. This was done as he wishes to go to Winnipeg for a couple of days to enable him to write his examinations at the Manitoba University, and the Indians were quite agreeable to the change.\n\nI have authorized this subject to your approval, and have signed the returns.\n\nPlease note the teacher asks for blackboard surface; this is blackboard slating and can be purchased here for about 45 cents a half pint tin. Shall we purchase it locally?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 24th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, the Department approves your action in allowing the teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School to teach during the Easter holiday week.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

He would like to have leave of absence for the 4th to 26th.\n\nI would recommend that permission be given, I do not know if his wife will accompany him or not, but she was a school teacher and could, if not going away, take his place, in any case he has done splendid work at this school, according to the Inspector, and I would recommend permission for this leave of absence be given with pay if possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant you may allow Mr. Lafleche leave of absence from the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School for the period April 24 to 25.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJune 18, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant enclosing letter received from Mr. Lafl\u00e8che, teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department regrets that owing to conditions existing at present our appropriation has been reduced and as a consequence funds are only available for salaries for teachers of Indian day schools for a nine-month period during the academic year 1940-41. As the deduction in the appropriation affects the current year's vote it will only be possible to pay six months' salary to each teacher of an Indian day school between September 1, 1940, and March 31, 1941. As a result it was suggested in our previous circular that the schools should be closed for the month of September. If, however, you would prefer the Whitefish Bay School to remain open in September and close for any other month between the dates mentioned above you might let me know.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 20, 1941.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant with reference to Mr. Laplache. Before making any decision on your request I would like to discuss his position with you. No doubt you will be in Ottawa in the near future and at that time we will consider the matter fully.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O.

Even though an increase were given Mr. LaFleche, it would be a small amount, and I agree with you that in his own best interests he should endeavour to secure more remunerative employment. The present seems an opportune time for him to act in this way. In making this statement I do not wish to imply that we are not satisfied with his services, because all reports indicate that he has done splendid work. However, as you know, there is a limit to salaries of teachers of Indian day schools beyond which we cannot go.\n\nWe will keep your recommendation in mind, and in the event of Mr. LaFleche deciding to stay in our employment for another year, arrangements will be made to grant him a small increase before October first.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Frank
