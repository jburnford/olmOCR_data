State prosecutor will return in two or three days. Until then police will hold, when prisoner can be remanded as desired. Will give matter best attention. John Mackay.\"\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nActing D.M.J.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Department.\nA. Power, Esq., K.C.,\nActing D'y Minister of Justice,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs wired you I attended at the American Sault upon receipt of your telegram and found Jonathan Flaxton in the hands of the police there. The State Prosecutor was absent and pending his return nothing could be done. He is expected in a day or two. The Chief Police undertook to retain the prisoner until the return of the State Prosecutor. We apprehend no difficulty in obtaining the remand required. I will be notified when the matter can be taken up and will attend and endeavor to see done what may be necessary and shall then further advise.\n\nFrom Mr. King, the Principal of the Wawanosh Home, I have obtained the statement of facts following: Flaxton called at the Home some days prior to the abduction; with him was a woman, said to be his wife, and two children. He wanted the children taken into the Home. Flaxton is white; the children showed no Indian blood and were denied admission. Flaxton claimed to be an uncle of the two girls whom he afterwards abducted. By marriage it is possible he may be their uncle but this supposition is improbable. Immediately after for some days Flaxton was seen about the premises in the vicinity of the Home. It is supposed his object was to get the girls away to Duluth for immoral purposes. Both girls are between fifteen and sixteen years. The final\u2014and probably correct\u2014story told by the girls is to the effect that Flaxton told them to come with him.\nand he would look after them, dress them and take care of them in future. The day they went away he induced them to go with him into the adjoining woodland where they were hidden until dark; thence they proceeded along the C.P. Railway track\u2014which lies adjacent\u2014and so across the International Railway bridge to the American Sault. Flaxton had been employed as a brakeman on the Algoma Central Railway. This would facilitate the unquestioned crossing the Railway bridge and would make him familiar with the railway yards at the American Sault where he took the girls and kept them over night in a box car. To one of the girls he gave $35. in cash saying it was to buy clothes. In the morning dresses were bought and it is understood Flaxton was heading for the train when apprehended. The girls were recognized by one of the Indian boys detailed to watch. With the boy the girls returned to the Home. At first they were disposed to tell everything but the truth. Persistent enquiry finally elicited the story as above and this considered by Mr. King to be true. Apart from the abduction, no harm would appear to have happened the girls.\n\nTo prevent a repetition of similar exploits, Mr. King is anxious to have an example made. From the interference of relatives and others Mr. King claims to have much to contend with and he realized that were anything such as this attempted abduction permitted with impunity the result would be little short of deplorable.\n\nWe have written Mr. King impressing the importance of being prepared with conclusive evidence of the age of the girls, that is, of being able to establish the age as under\nsixteen years. As soon as we hear we will report further.\n\nYours &c,\n\nCopy.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\nRe Jonathan Flaxton.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose you herewith copy of a letter received from our agent in connection with this matter, for your information. Subsequent to the date of that letter our agent writes to say that he has been keeping in touch with the American authorities with respect to the charge against this man. The prisoner having been taken in charge by the United States marshal consented to return to Canada waiving further extradition proceedings. He was brought across to Sault Ste Marie and lodged in the district jail, where he is now confined.

Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nOct. 1st./'02\n\nSir:\n\nWe are in great difficulty regarding the obtaining of necessary fuel for the heating of our Indian Homes during the rapidly approaching winter.\n\nIt is impossible to obtain coal here at any price, and wood on the Shingwauk property became exhausted many years ago.\n\nIn addition to the heating of outside buildings, such as the School house, Laundry, and Trade shops we have three large coal furnaces in the main building to feed, which however economically managed consumes not less than sixty five tons of hard coal each winter.\n\nNo other course suggests itself but to convert the coal furnaces into wood furnaces by obtaining from the manufacturers wood grates, dampers etc., and to import at once before the close of navigation hardwood from St. Joseph's Island. This however will prove a costly way of heating for it will I presume take at least two cords of hardwood to equal one ton of anthracite coal.\n\nBut we have no alternative.\n\nWe are already six hundred dollars in debt and it is simply impossible to incur this increased and unlooked for expenditure with-\nout some assistance from the Department.\n\nI earnestly ask the Department therefore to assist us in our\ndilemma to the extent of five hundred dollars which sum I would re-\nspectfully suggest might fairly and justly be a charge on those Bands\nfrom which our pupils are drawn; since it is solely for their children's\nbenefit the assistance is asked.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nPrincipal\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI venture to hope that the Department of Indian Affairs may see its way to grant a favourable reply to Mr. King's appeal. The crisis is a real one. Owing to the scarcity of coal and the high rate being charged for both coal and wood, we do not see our way through the task of providing fuel for our women during the coming winter. Yet to disband our forces at such a season of the year would be a most distressing course. Such considerations seem fully to justify an appeal for special aid. I trust it may be granted.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nGeorge A. Agawa\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\nOttawa, 6th October, 1902.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nThe Acting Secretary:\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Algoma forwards under cover of a letter dated the 3rd instant an application from Mr. King, Principal of the Shingwauk Home for a grant of $500.00 to assist the school in converting the coal furnaces into wood furnaces.\n\nThis application is made owing to the impossibility of obtaining hard coal at Sault Ste. Marie for the winter's supply. Mr. King suggests that this amount might be charged against the bands from whom their pupils are drawn since it is solely for their benefit.\n\nI do not think that it would be a fair charge to make against the Indians as they are in no way responsible for the coal famine. The Department has no funds at present available to which such a contribution could be properly charged and it seems to me that it would be incurring great expense to change the furnaces for one winter. It would be much cheaper to revert to the old system of heating by stoves, however as the matter stands it is one for the consideration of the Department. If they cannot get coal or proper appliances to burn wood the school will most likely have to be closed for the winter as the Institution has no funds of its own to make the suggested change, in fact it is some $600.00 in debt at present and the extra charge of fuel will increase their liabilities. This is the first application of the kind received and if it were granted there would no doubt be many others as all the Indian schools would find themselves in a similar dilemma.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The grant of $500 asked for was not for the purpose of converting our coal furnaces into wood furnaces. A sum of less than $50 would probably cover such cost of alteration. The assistance is asked however to meet the unexpected and largely increased cost of fuel due to the recent coal strike and our inability to obtain either hard or soft coal, and thus being driven as a result, to import hard dry wood and which for reasons stated in my previous letter will prove a costly mode of heating compared with former years.\n\nWeighted down as we are at the present time with a deficit of some $600 incurred in our maintenance account, I cannot see how we can possibly incur such increased liability, without some assistance from the Department.\n\nThe sixty or seventy children now in the home are not less the Department's wards than ours.

He has this week issued through the English press an appeal for \u00a31,500 in connection with the removal to a more desirable locality of schools established among the Blackfoot Indians in the diocese of Calgary. He explains that the Canadian Government has promised \u00a3500, which we hope will be considerably increased but in the meantime he asks the British public to put both hands in its pockets\". I have frequently denounced this sort of thing, the last clerical mendicant who put Canada to shame having hailed from Montreal, and I am sure that all Canadians agree with the \"Gazette\" that this sort of thing is most distasteful to Canadian self-respect and most unfair to the many English institutions and causes which should have a first claim upon the English charitable. The writer admits that in the early days of Canadian settlement it was inevitable that these appeals should have been made, \"but\" he adds \"to-day Canada is rich beyond the most sanguine expectations of her early days. She is not alone rich; she has assumed the dignity of matronhood, and among the charges which have thus fallen upon her ample revenues is that of her Indian citizens and fellow-subjects. How can the English public bring itself to believe that Canada is, at this harvest time, overflowing with prosperity when at the same moment Canadian clerics encroach upon English munificence for the religious education and support of a few Indian children in the heart of the very country which is now realizing such abundant wealth?\" In conclusion the \"Gazette\" very properly declares, \"The whole proceeding is unreasonable and undignified to the last degree, and\nwe would appeal to the many leaders of Canadian opinion who\nwe know sympathize with our view, to echo this protest among\nthose to whom Canon Gibbon Stocken and other Canadian religious\nworkers should make their first and last appeal. When, oh when\nwill officious people cease humiliating Canadians abroad by\nappealing to the English purse in aid of patriotic funds, fire\nsufferers, missions, church funds, and all sorts of things which\nif we cannot ourselves supply, we certainly ought not to have\ngiven to us. We boast that the West is a granary bursting\nwith riches and yet it appears that there is a wail going up\nfrom that very country for help. It is nauseatingly contemp-\ntible.\n\nAs a further instance I may mention that the Bishop\nof Metlakatla, who called at the Department on his return\nfrom England, told me that as a result of an appeal made by\nhim through the English press, he had collected about $40,000\nto assist him in the mission and school buildings destroyed\nby fire about fifteen months ago.\nEXTRACT from the \"London Times\", weekly edition, London, Friday, Sept. 12th, 1902.\n\nCalgary Diocese\u2014An Appeal.\n\nTo the Editor of the Times,\n\nSir,\n\nWill you allow me to use the medium of your valuable paper to lay the following appeal before the friends of foreign and Colonial missions?\n\nIn 1883 the Church Missionary Society commenced its work amongst the Blackfoot Indians in what is now the diocese of Calgary\u2014in the district so fast being settled from the home land\u2014in North-West Canada. That work has made steady progress, not merely in its general equipment, in the reduction of the language to writing, the adoption of a syllabic system, and in the translation of portions of the Scriptures and the Prayer-Book, etc., but (which we value most) in the foundation of a native Church, with two Blackfoot Catechists who are accepted by the Bishop as candidates for holy orders.\n\nA church, mission-room and hospital have been built and are maintained free of debt. But in connection with the school work, and to meet the needs, two large boarding schools were built, and have been maintained with considerable difficulty. As long as a fairly large average attendance was obtainable, all went well; but when this failed the mission had to appeal (not always successfully) for increased funds to supplement the consequently reduced per capita grant-in-aid\u2014from the Dominion Government.\n\nIt has now been arranged to amalgamate the two schools, which are ten miles apart; and towards the necessary expense of taking down the one, and enlarging\n\nIndian Affairs.

We shall, indeed, be grateful if the need \nis met through your generous assistance.\n\nAny moneys may be sent to me, care of the Church \nMissionary Society, Salisbury Square, London E.C.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nH.W.

Upon reading Mr King's letter I understood him to ask for this assistance on account of the coal famine and my memorandum, which was submitted to the Minister, was based on this interpretation. His Lordship now forwards another communication from Mr King which explains that the application was made to assist them in paying a deficit of some $600 incurred last year, and which he states will be largely increased owing to the cost of fuel this year. It appears from His Lordship's letter that the Diocese of Algoma is unable to come to his assistance and they therefore pray the Department to help them in their present straits.\n\nThe Shingwauk Home is one of the four industrial schools in Ontario in receipt of a per capita grant of $60.00. The amount contributed by the Department last year was $4017.95, while the expenditure, including a previous deficit amounted to $9171.18. The balance of receipts to meet this expenditure was made up of contributions from England and Canada. On the subject of English contributions I beg to refer you to the enclosed clippings (copies) from the \"London Times\" and \"Toronto Saturday Night.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Shingwauk Home was established about 28 years ago by the Rev. R.F. Wilson with funds obtained in England. Mr. Wilson was a most successful solicitor of alms and extended his work to Elkhorn, Manitoba, which he bequeathed to the charge of his son, and is now carrying on similar work in British Columbia. Like his good works, the contributions followed him, leaving the Shingwauk Home in the position in which it now finds itself.\n\nMr. Wilson, when selecting the site for this school had an eye for the beautiful but none for the practical necessities of the work to be carried on as the greater portion of the 95 acres they own is unproductive and the wood on the farm was nearly all stripped before Mr. King took charge.\n\nMr. King is an excellent Principal, capable and economical, but prices at Sault Ste Marie are high; and a school of this class cannot be carried on there with the present numbers for less than $120.00 a head.\n\nThe other three schools in Ontario are quite able to make the difference between the grant and their cost out of their farming operations. The one at Brantford, in addition to this, has a liberal grant from the New England Company. Mr. Sheppard of Mt. Elgin is an extensive stock dealer and makes it pay, while I have never found the Jesuits, who conduct the Wikwemikong school, to be unable to find money when they want it.\n\nQuite lately the friends of the institution and the Department have between them defrayed the cost of an addition to the school and this has taxed their generosity about as far as it can stand. The adherents of the Church of England in Canada are not specially notorious for free giving to missions and\nand this work is looked upon as being even outside the mission field.\n\nThe School has, therefore, no one to fall back upon but the Department and it would be a pity to see it closed as it furnishes the best English and Industrial education of any of the Ontario schools, numbers of boys having passed through and taken up the white man's burden.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\nSault Ste Marie 0254088\nDec. 31905\n\nTo the Honourable\nClifford Wilson\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg leave to lay before you the following statement in connection with the Shingwauk and Bawantock Industrial Schools for Indian children situated in this place, and to urge the proposal embodied in it.\n\nA short time since, in view of the high price of coal or wood, and under the pressure of very serious financial need, I ventured to ask the Department for a special grant towards the purchase of our winter's fuel. Unhappily, the Department felt itself unable to comply with my request.\n\nWe are now in great straits, and are quite unable even our way before us. At a meeting of our Committee of Management held a few days ago, it was felt to be a serious question whether we should much longer face the risks to which we find ourselves involved. The Government grants supplies only one half of the cost of our house maintenance leaving the other half to be obtained in the form of\ncontributions from private parties. Due to the varied and increasing claims of the far back our share in such charitable contributions is annually decreasing. Year by year, for some time past we have been falling behind in our accounts. Our deficit at the present moment is more than $600 and we have no means as yet for providing our winter's fuel.\n\nThe money, though labour already expended upon these institutions; the excellent work being done in them; the fact that they receive children both from this region only but from all parts of older Canada; their importance as a refuge to which the Department finds it convenient from time to time to send Indian wards who have no home; all these considerations are good reasons for continuing the work in its present efficiency form. But if we cannot secure more regular and liberal financial support in the near future it will be impossible to go on upon the present scale, if indeed we can go on at all.\n\nIn view of these facts and as a possible solution of our problem I venture to urge on the Department the necessity of a substantial...\nincrease being made in the per capita grant\nfor all schools in Ontario situated as we\nare at these homes. Everything considered\nwe have reason to believe that the expense of\nmaintaining such Industrial Schools in the East\nis not materially less than in the West. Yet\nso far the West has received double the\namount of money assigned to us in the East.\n\nIf there should be any prospect of the proposal\nnow made being favourably considered by the\nDepartment, we should be encouraged to make\nevery possible effort to carry on our work as it\nis until the increase of grants becomes\navailable.\n\nI have the honour to remain\n\nmost faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Thomson\nBishop of Algoma\nMy dear Mr. Lean,\n\nThe enclosed letter speaks for itself. Will you kindly forward it to its destination and do what you can to secure for it a favorable reception and consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. Algoma\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 3rd December, 1962\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn October last His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma forwarded an application from Mr King, Principal of the Shingwauk Home, for a grant of $500 to assist in paying off the deficit incurred in the maintenance of this school. In reply he was informed that the Department regretted that it could not grant his request.\n\nUnder date of the 2nd instant His Lordship has asked that, for the reasons stated in his letter hereunder, a substantial increase be made to the per capita grant to this school, which now receives only $60.00, the same amount as paid to the other three Industrial schools in Ontario. The Bishop makes a strong argument in favor of an increase and in this connection I would refer you to my memorandum of the 24th October last in which I referred to the causes which have led to this school going behind in its finances. Even if the Department had granted the previous application for a lump sum the relief would only have been temporary as under the condition in which this school is now placed owing to the withdrawal of former contributions, there would be a constantly recurring deficit.\n\nIf the Department is favorable to this application, which is similar to the one lately submitted by the Principal of the Mt. Elgin school, it would be well to fix upon an amount which would\nafford permanent relief. The present method of appealing for supplementary funds from outside sources to carry on the school, is open to objection equally as much as ever working the pupils to make ends meet.\n\nIn my previous memorandum above referred to I stated that this school had been in operation 28 years and was doing good work, and that it would be a pity to see it closed for lack of financial assistance.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

E.g., to be placed\non a more equal footing with similar\nclashed Indian schools in the North West\nwhich receive a per capita grant allowing\nof $110 to $140. The cost of maintaining\neach child, divided into\nthe Shingwauk to be allowed $100\n(including salary of teachers & instructors,\nmedical expenses, insurance etc.) is\n$135 per annum. Towards this the\nDominion Government at present\ncontribute a $60 per capita grant only\nleaving us dependent for the difference.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will see from the accompanying letter that the Governor General has already been asked to take our case into consideration.\n\nIn regard of your former kindness in connection with our Indian Homes, in my father's lifetime, I am writing to beg you to kindly write the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs or the Hon.

I am glad to know from your letter of the 16th inst., to the Reverend Mr King that you are taking into consideration the grant to be given to the Shingwauk Home. I do not think that the feeling can be said to be sentimental which prompts to the conclusion that as our country is becoming great and rich through the vast territories at one time held by the Indians we should give to them every possible consideration in exchange for all the wealth that we have obtained from them. How small even if all the demands were answered would be the price that we pay! However, why need I write to you in this strain\u2014all is better known to you than to me.

Marie, Ont.\n\n1. The schools were established as a private venture by the Rev. L. F. Wilson in 1875.\n\n2. The government gave them an annual per capita grant of $60.\n\n3. At the outset great interest was shown in the schools by the general public; and money towards their support was obtained with comparative ease. After a time however the interest waned, and in 1890, harassed and broken down with the financial strain of his work, Mr. Wilson abandoned the schools, and the Church of England in Algoma, to prevent their being closed, became responsible for them.\n\n4. From the beginning of her responsibility the church had a hard struggle to maintain the work. In addition to the grant of $60, a sum of $75, has had to be provided each year for each child admitted to the schools. The average number of pupils being 65 an aggregate of nearly $5000, has been provided annually from outside sources.\n\n5. Year by year it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain money. General interest has slackened and missionary contributions have multiplied. As a result our income has been inadequate even for maintenance apart from special expenditure as the following statement shows.\nReceipts:\n\nGovernment Grants: $2400\n\nContributions from outside sources:\n\nTotal Expenditure: $10975.56\n\n6. This deficiency has been made up in part by an annual grant of about $1000 from the Mission Fund of Algoma. But this fund was created for other purposes and cannot much longer bear the strain thus put upon it. Even with this grant from the Mission Fund a deficit on account of maintenance has been gradually accumulating which amounted on May 1st to $660.00. This amount is due on current accounts to business men in small amounts.\n\n7. Through lack of means we have never been able to admit the full number of pupils permitted us by the government, viz 150, our average number being 65. At present we have only 50. Ten applications for admission have been refused during the past year.\n\n8. Because of a supposed difference in the cost of maintaining the small R.C. Marie School, like the three other Industrial Schools of Ontario, has received a grant of only $30 per capita, one half the amount paid to similar schools west of Ontario, which receive from $110 to $140 per capita. Yet the difference in the cost of maintenance, instead of being as one to two, is all things considered, comparatively slight.\n\n9. Owing to the state of our finances our school property has seriously deteriorated and need extensive repair. While a sum of $2000 at least is required to restore our exhausted stock and equipment.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\nIn view of the above facts, the utter inadequacy of the per capita grant, the increasing difficulty of obtaining aid from outside, the crippled condition of our work generally and the heavy deficit now facing us; we deem it essential to the proper maintenance, if not the very existence of our work, that the government per capita grant should be increased to $100 at least. Even that would leave us some $3500 to collect annually from outside sources, for ordinary maintenance, apart from the cost of repairs and the payment of our deficit.\n\nGeorge Thomeloe\nBishop of Algoma\n\nG.

The average number of pupils being 65 an aggregate of nearly $5000, has had to be provided annually from outside sources.\n\n5. Year by year it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain this money. General interest has slackened and missionary appeals have multiplied. As a result our income has been inadequate even for maintenance apart from special expenditure as the following statement shows.\nReceipts:\n\nGovernment Grants $2400. $4265.00 $3860.00\n\nContributions from outside sources,\n\nEngland & Canada $525.56 $556.78 $465.22\n\nDeficit $1025.66 $10821.82 $9295.82\n\nTotal Expenditure $1025.66 $10821.82 $9295.82\n\n6. This deficiency has been made up in part by an Annual grant of about $1000. from the Mission Fund of Algoma. But this fund was created for other purposes and cannot much longer bear the strain thus put upon it. Even with this grant from the Mission Fund a deficit on account of maintenance has been gradually accumulating which amounted on March 1st to $960.02. This amount is due on current accounts to business men in Sault Ste Marie.\n\n7. Through lack of means we have never been able to admit the full number of pupils permitted us by the government, viz 100. Our average number being 65. At present we have only 50. Ten applications for admission have been refused during the past year.\n\n8. Because of a supposed difference in the cost of maintenance the Sault Ste. Marie School, like the three other Industrial Schools of Ontario, has received a grant of only $60. per capita, one half the amount paid to similar schools west of Ontario, which receive from $110 to $145 per capita. Yet the difference in the cost of maintenance, instead of being as one to two, is all things considered, comparatively slight.\n\n9. Owing to the state of our finances our School properties have seriously deteriorated and need extensive repairs, while a sum of $200 at least is required to renew our exhausted stock and equipment.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\nIn view of the above facts, the utter inadequacy of the per capita grant, the increasing difficulty of obtaining aid from outside, the crippled condition of our work generally and the heavy deficit now facing us; we deem it essential to the proper maintenance, if not the very existence of our work, that the Government per capita grant should be increased to $100 at least. Even that would leave us some $3500 to collect annually from outside sources, for ordinary maintenance, apart from the cost of repairs and the payment of our deficit.\n\nGeorge Thorncroft\nBishop of Algoma\n\nH.

(RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 9th May, 1903\n\nThe Acting Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the application of His Lordship, the Bishop of Algoma for an increased per capita grant to the Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste Marie, I beg to say that this school is at present in receipt of a grant of $60.00 for each of 100 pupils but as His Lordship has pointed out in his memorandum of the 11th ultimo herewith, this sum, owing to the increased cost of living, is not sufficient to pay for the maintenance and management of the Institution without large contributions from outside sources. The receipts from outside sources have decreased from $8525.56 in 1892 to $4653.22 in 1902 and the school now has a deficit of $960.02, which the Diocese of Algoma is unable to meet out of its present resources.\n\nI consider that a per capita grant of $60.00 for an institution of this class is insufficient and places too much responsibility on the Church authorities in obtaining outside aid, which as the Bishop has pointed out, is hard to get. I therefore consider that the Department would be justified in increasing the grant to this school to $72.00 per capita, which would only be putting it on a par with the boarding schools in Manitoba and the Territories, while it is doing as good work as any of our Industrial schools.\n## Statement\n\nshowing per capita cost of Industrial Schools for year ended 30th June, 1902.\n\n| SCHOOL          | Enrollment | Average attend. | No. provided for | Rate per cap. | Amt. voted | Total expenditure | Per cap. cost on average att. |\n|-----------------|------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|------------|------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Mohawk Institute | 130        | 118             | 91               | $60.00        | $5460.00   | $14845.25        | $125.80                       |\n| Mt.

Elgin \" \" Methodists\nWikwemikong \" \" Roman Catholics\nMohawk Institute \" \" New England Co. (Protestant denominational)\n\nhas been brought to the notice of the Department. Its attention to the inadequacy of the present grant of $60.00 a head to meet the cost of maintenance and management having been called thereto by His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma on behalf of the Shingwauk Home, and the late Rev. W.W. Shepherd, Principal of the Mt Elgin Institute. One of the directors of the New England Company who lately visited the Department also referred to this subject and the authorities of the Wikwemikong school have the same difficulties to contend with.\n\nThe cost of living has increased of late so that these schools find it necessary to appeal to the Department and it must be conceded that $60.00 a head is a very small sum on which to feed, clothe an educate a pupil. These schools are all well equipped and in good working order, and provide a useful training for their pupils.\n\nProfission\nProvision is made at each of the schools for the following number of pupils at the present rate of $60.00:\n\n- Shingwauk Home.............100\n- Mt Elgin....................100\n- Wikwemikong..................120\n- Mohawk Institute..........91\n\nFor many years these schools were carried on without any Government aid by voluntary contributions from outside sources. These contributions have latterly fallen off to such an extent that they find themselves in financial straits and in need of a larger per capita grant. They are at least entitled to receive as much as the boarding schools in Manitoba and the Territories, $72.00, and if the Department could see its way to go to the extent of $100.00 a head it would not be an extravagant outlay for the results obtained.\n\nThe statement next hereunder shows the per capita cost of all the industrial schools for the year ended 30th June 1902 with other details bearing on this subject, from which you will see that there is but one industrial school which does not receive twice the grant, or more, than that given the Ontario industrial schools.\n\nThe Indians enrolled in these four schools are more advanced in civilization and better able to profit by their opportunities than those in the west.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\nTo provide for an increase in grant to the Shingwauk Wawmash Homes, C. of England, 100 pupils @ $......\n\nThe Bishop of Algoma, in making application for increased grant, states that the minimum cost of maintenance and education of each pupil is $135.00. The Department grant is only $60.00 per capita, so that the Church authorities have to provide $75.00 per pupil, by grant from Church funds, subscriptions, etc. This has become so difficult by reason of the waning of public interest and the multiplication of demands upon the Church as to render it impossible to make up the deficit.\n\nHe states that it has been impossible to obtain funds on their part to supplement the Government grant sufficiently to take the number of pupils allowed by the Department, viz: 100, that last year they only had 50 pupils, having to refuse 10 applications. On March 1st, this school owed $960.00 on current account to merchants in Sault Ste. Marie. Added to this the school property has seriously deteriorated and requires extensive repairs, while a sum of $2,500 at least is needed to renew the exhausted stock and equipment. The Bishop states that it is essential to the proper maintenance, if not to the very existence of the work, that the Government grant be increased to at least $190.00. The Public School Inspector speaks in the highest terms of the work done in this Home as compared with other Indian Schools in his Inspectorate.\n\nThis appeal from the Bishop is practically the same as that from the Mount Elgin Industrial School, viz: the utter inadequacy of the\nof the Government grant of $60.00 per annum, the practical impossibility of obtaining outside subscriptions to supplement such grant to a minimum maintenance allowance for each child, and the makeshifts to which the schools are put to increase their income and decrease their expenditure. There is no doubt that something will have to be done in order to secure the large financial interests which the Department now holds in these schools. They are so hampered at present that it is impossible for them to do the work required of them in the scholastic and industrial training of Indian youth. It is therefore a question as to what increased grant can be allowed to them all. For it must be borne in mind that there are four schools of this class in Ontario, the present provision (which will all have to be treated alike) for which is as follows:\n\n| Name                  | Denom'n. | No. provided for | P.C.

It would be your duty, therefore, to audit the books of the school and to prepare a statement supported by vouchers and subsidiary statements where necessary.

Sir William Mulock K.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the beginning of April last, with the Bishop of Ottawa and others, I had the privilege of an interview with you upon the subject of the Indian Homes at Sainte-Marie.\n\nThe object of this interview, as you will remember, was to secure from the Government, through your interest as Acting Minister of the Interior, an increase in the per capita grant of $60, which is utterly inadequate for the maintenance of our work.\n\nWe explained that this sum ($60), which is only one half the amount given to similar Industrial Schools in the West, leaves us much more to be provided by us; and that we find it increasingly difficult to obtain the voluntary aid we need to supplement the grant.\n\nAt the time of our interview a deficit of $960 had, in consequence of the facts mentioned above, accrued upon our operations.\n\nYou were good enough to receive us kindly.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\nand to assure us of your interest and aid. At the same time you informed us that nothing had been done while the Estimates were brought down and you requested us to supply you with a statement of our condition and needs etc., that you might be provided with the requisite information when the matter came up. This statement we seek you in due course.\n\nWe have been anxiously awaiting the result of our appeals. And acting upon the encouraging assurances given us we have been going on with our work, though it involved a daily increase of our deficit. It is an unfortunate year in this respect being the year of our financial payment on account of interest, and the year when our children's outfit (uniform) is needed. The increase of our deficit has therefore been unusually rapid. It has now reached such proportions that it will be folly for us to continue our work unless we receive assurance of immediate relief. The accompanying statement shows the exact condition of our affairs.\n\nMay God you therefore be let us hear at your earliest convenience what we are to expect from the Government that may decide.\nwhether or no it will be safe for us to keep the schools open any longer. We are on the verge of winter without fuel, without money to buy it, and in need of medical supplies, appliances, and school equipment. Unless our per capita grant is to be increased materially and our deficit paid, I see no way other than that to send our children away immediately.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI have the honour to remain\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Hornebeck\nBishop of Algoma\nOTTAWA, November 2nd, 1863.\n\nSIR:\n\nIn the absence of the Postmaster General, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo enclosing a financial statement with reference to the Shingwauk case. Your communication will be brought to Sir William's attention as soon as he returns to Ottawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nThe Right Reverend\n\nThe Bishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nOTTAWA, November 17th, 1903.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn returning to Ottawa I found awaiting me your communication of the 26th ultimo in which you urge an increase in the per capita grant made by the Department of Indian Affairs to the Shingwauk Home. I am no longer Acting Minister of the Interior, and as the Honourable Clifford Sifton has now returned to Canada, I have forwarded to him your communication together with the accompanying statement, and have no doubt that he will give the subject careful consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Right Reverend\n\nThe Bishop of Algoma,\n\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nOTTAWA, November 17th, 1903.\n\nMy dear Sifton:\n\nEnclosed please find a letter from the Bishop of Algoma together with copy of my reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHon. Clifford Sifton,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nSault Ste Marie, O.\nOct 26th 1903\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nAt the beginning of April last, with the Bishop of Ottawa, Mr. Sneltinger, Mr. Meig and others, I had the privilege of an interview with you on the subject of our Indian Home at Sault Ste Marie.\n\nThe object of this interview was to urge upon the Department of Indian Affairs the absolute necessity, if our Home were to be kept alive, of an increase in our per capita grant from only $60 per annum\u2014a sum utterly inadequate for the maintenance of the work.\n\nWe explained that the sum mentioned is only one half the amount given to similar district schools in the West; and that the increasing difficulty of obtaining voluntary aid to supplement the Government grant had resulted in a large deficit of $960.\n\nWe also, at the same time, had an interview with Sir William Mulock to the same end; and\nat his request after our return home we forwarded a statement of the condition of our affairs, and urged still further the necessity of the relief we asked.\n\nOn the occasion of their interview as you will doubtless remember we received assurances from yourself and Sir William Allibone, that the matter would receive favourable consideration in due course; and in particular you were good enough to say that you were prepared to urge our claim upon the Minister.\n\nAgain in company with the Bishop of Ottawa had the privilege of waiting upon you in May, when I received a renewal of your assurance, yesternight, but was informed that nothing could be done at present, but that we must wait patiently until the Estimates were brought down.\n\nOn the strength of those assurances we have been waiting anxiously, yet as patiently as possible, ever since; and, relying upon your words, we have gone on with our work increasing our deficit daily, and that the more rapidly because this is the least for the renewal of our financial assurance, and for furnishing our\nChildren will much need uniforms. The result may be seen in the accompanying statement. It is truly alarming!\n\nWe see that Parliament is prorogued; and we are anxiously looking for notice of the action taken by the Government in response to our appeal, and in fulfillment of your pledges.\n\nWith a deficit of such proportions it would be worse than folly to continue our work unless we had at least some assurance of immediate relief.\n\nWe therefore beg you to inform us, at the earliest possible moment, what action the Government has taken to its matter, and what measure of relief we may expect.\n\nUnless our per capita grant be materially increased and our deficit paid we see no way to carry on the work farther. We need also, at once, the renewal of appliances and outfit for our work reduced in value and efficiency by constant wear and tear.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\nP.S. We are on the verge of breaking without food,\nwith no money today, if we do, and unless\nrelief comes immediately there is no way open\nfor us but to send our children away.\n\nG.A.\nMy dear Mr. Pedley,\n\nYour telegram asking when it thing would return, and announcing your intention of sending an officer to inspect our stores, reached me in due course. I had expected a letter also. But none has come. I have therefore no information from the Department as to what we are to expect other than what may be inferred from your message. As this is vague I am still in much doubt and uncertainty.\n\nIf no relief is forthcoming I do not see how I can avoid closing the schools immediately. After all that has been expended upon them by the Government and by the Church this will be a grievous thing. But I dare not take the risk of going on any further without assurance of relief. We are close up to winter without supplies, and a debt of $1500. My Diocese cannot afford us for it is itself largely dependent upon outside aid. And the Church generally will not be likely to share its loss with me after the schools are closed. I fear therefore there will\nhave no alternative. I must close our doors, and\nsent away the children, without a day's delay,\nif I receive an announcement adverse to\nour hopes.\n\nI will of course do nothing until the\nInspector has been, and you have had time\nto act upon his report. Meanwhile I will\ncling to hope; for I cannot bear the idea of\nclosing up so good a work although it has been\nworthless but an expense to the Church, and\na worry to me personally, from the beginning\nof my connection with. Were it not for the\npersonal risk involved I should feel easier\nin mind.\n\nBelieve me\n\nVery faithfully yours\n\nGeorge Algernon\n\nTo Frank Pedley Esq.\nDept. Sup't Indian Department\nOttawa, O.\nOttawa, November 2nd, 1903.\n\nRt. Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 26th and 30th ultimo, with reference principally to a grant to the Shingwauk Home, and to say that the Department did not see its way clear to make any further contribution to the school, as requested some time ago, and that it regrets exceedingly that you are faced to face with a deficit for the present year. As I wired you, however, on the 28th ultimo, an officer has been instructed to make an examination of the books and school so that the Department may be advised fully, by one of its own officers, as to the actual condition of affairs there and on his report we will be able to decide to what extent assistance can be rendered towards balancing the account. I may say that in the statement of assets furnished by you it would appear that by far the greater if not all of your receipts are from government sources but if the Church is contributing towards the support of the school I trust that\n\nRight Reverend George Thornloe,\nBishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIn compliance with instructions contained in your letter to me of the 31st ultimo, I proceeded to Sault Ste. Marie on the 1st instant to make an examination of the Shingwauk Institution at that place.\n\nThe Principal of the Institution was absent on my arrival so that I did not commence my duties till the 3rd instant when I began an examination of the accounts which I found to be kept in a very careful and satisfactory manner. The books have been audited annually by officers appointed for the purpose, the last audit having been made in February last by His Honour, Judge Johnston and A.W. Roberts, Esquire, Manager of the Bank of Commerce, which covered the year ended the 31st December, 1902; and it is shown that the Institution had at that time a deficit of $600.01; this did not occur altogether during that year, but has been gradually accumulating since 1894, at which time it was $189.41.\n\nThe books are written up to 30th September and at that date show the amount of debts owing to be $5,617.39 and available assets from which to pay the same $1,064.41 leaving a shortage of $1,552.98\n\nI append a list of the creditors with detailed accounts from which it will be seen that Messrs. W.H. Plummer & Co. are the largest, their account amounting to $1,617.83. That firm furnished nearly all the supplies in the way of staples, and has carried the deficit since it commenced. I have examined these accounts for some years back and the goods that have been supplied are of the same class as those named in the detailed accounts attached. I have noticed in going through the accounts that\nMemorandum\u2014\n\nthe deficit has increased annually, and this has been occasioned until recently by the fact that every third year the pupils are supplied with new uniforms at a cost of about $250.00, and during the same years insurances to the amount of about $150.00 fall due and this they seem to have been unable to make good during the next year. The deficit during 1894 was $189.41, and increased gradually to $600 on 1st. of January 1903; but during the nine months ending on 30th. September last, it has taken a jump of $900.00 reaching the sum of $1,552.98. This is caused, however, by part of the fuel account having been carried forward from the previous year........................................... $300.00\n\nthe necessity to replace a horse.......................... 150.00\n\nand the usual expenditure for triennial clothing\n\nand insurance.............................................. 450.00\n\nand the whole expenditure.................................. $900.00\n\nthrough which the deficit has occurred, has been perfectly legitimate.\n\nOne of the principal problems in the economic management of the Institution appears to be that of fuel, owing to its increased price. In former years considerable donations of wood were made, the only cost to the Institution being the cutting and hauling by the farmer and pupils.\n\nIn 1900 the cost of wood fuel was............ $-\n\n\" 1901 \" \" \" ............. 32.35\n\n\" 1902 \" \" \" ............. 283.70\n\nWhile the cost of coal has remained about the same, $550.00.\n\nThere is no doubt that fuel might be greatly economized. The building has been in existence between 25 and 30 years, and naturally windows and outside doors have become shrunken, but there is not a single storm-sash on any window, nor, as far as I could see, a porch on any of the outside doors, notwithstanding the fact that carpentry is one of the trades taught in the Institution. The explanation given is that there was no money to buy materials. There is also a great waste of fuel at the pump-\npump-house on account of the bad condition of the boiler and engine. The water for fire protection and domestic purposes is conveyed to the Institution by means of a steam pump which is situated at the carpenter shop on the St. Mary's River, about a quarter of a mile from the main building; and although the pump appears to be pretty good, the immense loss of steam from the boiler and engine seems to me to require an immediate examination by some person experienced in such matters, with a view to ascertaining what can be done to remedy its condition which may possibly be dangerous, and is certainly occasioning a great waste of fuel and occupying too much of the carpenter's time in attendance. Should anything happen to the water system during the winter especially, considerable distress would be occasioned and the danger from fire much increased.\n\nI find that some expenditure for repairs and equipment is necessary throughout the institution, and I append a statement of the estimated cost amounting to $800. Some of the repairs mentioned are not an immediate necessity, but should be undertaken at an early date and carried on gradually so as to utilize as far as possible the services of the pupils and the regular staff. I will mention some of what I consider to be the immediate requirements:\n\n**Main building** (material only).\n- Repairs to roof........... 10.00\n- Fire ladders- 4............ 10.00\n- Lumber (in meantime)...... 15.00\n\nThe other repairs mentioned might be done by degrees but they are all necessary, and the inside wood work should be painted throughout.\n\n**Laundry** (material).\n- New floor required........... 15.15\n\n**New Stable** (material), for horses.\n- New floor, repairs to stalls & roof............. 62.85\n\n(Over)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\nMemorandum:\n\nCow stable\u2014(material)\n\nNew floor and stalls.................. 44.87\n\nThe floor in both these stables are worn very thin and have already been repaired in many places, but their condition is such as to endanger the lives of the stock.\n\nPig pen\u2014(material)\n\nRequires to be nearly re-constructed...... 23.17\n\nCarpenter shop:\n\nNew outfit of tools.................... 100.00\n\nThe tools now in use are antiquated and have not been renewed for years, are much worn and there is not enough of them. There is also a circular saw in connection with the shop which should be renewed. It is used chiefly for cutting fuel for the Institution. The shop is, in my opinion, situated too far from the other building (about a quarter of a mile) involving great waste of time in passing backward and forward.\n\nThe Farm requires some expenditure for equipment to the extent of about $70.00 details of which are given in the estimate. There are 40 acres under cultivation. I append an inventory of the stock which is all in good condition; one cow, however, is old and should be replaced, and three or two more should be added. It is noticed that only two pigs are in stock, and it seems to me that in connection with an institution of this kind where meat has to be purchased, and where there must naturally be considerable refuse, this kind of stock should be more numerous and would be more profitable.\n\nI attach a statement of the crops raised last year, which is creditable under the circumstances. The farm is in a very low situation, and the soil is light and sandy; the time of the farmer and horses is also considerable taken up with freighting.\n\n(Over)\nsupplies, etc., for the institution which is situated about 1\u00bd miles from the business part of the town of Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nThe hospital is in good condition and well-equipped with iron bedsteads and good bedding accommodation for nurses, and suitable culinary appliances. There were no inmates at the time of my visit.\n\nAs the different kind of supplies required for the institution are purchased from local dealers as required, there is practically nothing in stock in the institution for maintenance except the triennial uniforms, the greater portion of the clothing used (except boots) appears to be that donated by different missionary societies, which is repaired and altered to suit, and cleansed in the institution.\n\nThe institution is well-equipped with good iron beds and good bedding for about 68 pupils, whereas there are only about 58 in attendance, and the Department has made provision for a per capita grant for 60 pupils.\n\nThe contributions from various sources have, during the 8 years ended on 31st December last, averaged $4,100 a year. There has been a falling off of the cash donations for the first nine months of the current year of about $200 which partly accounts for the increase in the deficit.\n\nThe receipts for the first nine months of the current year have been:\n\n- Departmental grant.......................... $ 2,445.00\n- Contributions from other sources........... 2,881.84\n\n$ 5,326.84\n\nand the expenditure and new liabilities incurred for maintenance during the same period, have amounted to.................................. $ 6,279.81\n\nan increase of liabilities of................ $ 952.97\n\nto which may be added the deficit at end of 1902... $ 600.01\n\nmaking the deficit now....................... $ 1,542.98\n\n(Over)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\nMemorandum:\n\nThe institution appears to be as well managed as can reasonably be expected considering the disposal of the authorities, and I see no direction in which more economy could be exercised except in the matter of fuel.\n\nI attach a list of the members of the staff with their respective salaries, the amount of which is $2,876.00 annually or more than one-half of the Department's grant; still I do not see how the staff could be reduced, having due regard to efficiency.\n\nIt seems quite evident to me that the Institution cannot long continue to carry on the work without assistance from some source. The amounts due to the creditors require to be paid at an early date. The equipment and repairs which I have named are necessary, and the institution has no funds with which to meet the requirements. The per capita grant should be increased if possible; the contributions from outside sources (in cash and kind) are variable and precarious, and the cash receipts are not, in my opinion, sufficient for proper maintenance, repairs and renewal of equipment.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Supt. General of I.A.\n\nI beg to transmit herewith a report by Mr. R.G. Dalton of the Office upon the Shingwauk Home. The report is short and to the point, and it is only necessary to read it to obtain a clear idea as to the position which this school now occupies financially. To my mind the report shows that the Institution has been carefully managed and that the present deficit has not accrued owing to extravagant management. In view of this fact, and taking into consideration the attitude of the Department in the past with reference to the frequent deficits which have arisen at Industrial Schools in Manitoba and the North West Territories (which I am bound to say have not always been incurred under such unavoidable circumstances) I would recommend that the Department come to the assistance of the Shingwauk Home. To refuse to do so at this juncture would mean the closing of the school. I am of the opinion that the present per capita grant paid in Ontario is not sufficiently large to meet the cost of conducting these schools. The question of increasing this per capita grant was taken up last year, but no decision was arrived at. It is my object, therefore, to recommend action by which the present stringency may be relieved without increasing the estimates of the Department.\n\nI would propose to pay the deficit in two instalments: one on the 1st. of January, proximo, the other on the 1st. of July, if the supply fund is at that time available, if not, as soon after as possible. In addition to this I would propose to provide gradually the material required to place the building in a fair state of repair. When this is accomplished and when the boiler...\nboiler and engine are removed a saving of fuel will, I am sure, ensue. The expenditure that I propose by this recommendation will not be subject to any supplementary vote; it can be made from the current appropriations without detriment to our present obligations. By thus dealing with the Shingwauk Home we will not be according it better treatment than the Mount Elgin Institute. We have practically assisted that Institution in meeting its obligations by very considerable grants for re-building, and improving its equipments.\n\nThe current year's estimates contain an item of $2,500 an additional grant to the Mount Elgin Institute for this purpose. Up to the present time the Shingwauk Home has received no such assistance.\n\nNovember 24th\u2014\u20141903.,\nDpt. of Ind. Affairs.\n\nAccountant.\nOTTAWA, November 30th\u20141908.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the representations that have been made to the Department regarding the strained financial condition of the Shingwauk Industrial Institution at Sault Ste. Marie, I beg to inform you that, in view of the fact that, on investigation, the affairs of the Institution appear to have been carefully managed and that the present deficit has not accrued through extravagant management, the Department has decided to assume the liabilities of the Institution as shown by the books and accounts on the 30th of September last less the amount of the Principal, Mr. G.L. King, $60 for travel to Ottawa and return, thus making itself liable for the sum of $1,492.98. There are not sufficient funds available, however, to admit the whole of this amount being paid at once, but a cheque for $700 will be sent you about the 1st of January, 1909, for payment to the creditors, proportionately, and for which you should furnish the Department with receipts from the several payees, showing how it has been distributed.

Gasoline Engine, costing with all necessary fixtures somewhere about $500 would do the pumping, run our circular saw and planing mill equally as well as a steam power and would consume less than half the fuel. He points out that a Gasoline engine develops full power immediately and as soon as the work is done can be shut down and all expense ceases\u2014a great advantage and saving of fuel where, as in our case, an engine is required for a short time two or three times a week.\n\nMr. Scott estimates the value of the old Boiler and engine at $50 for scrap iron. A sum therefore of about $450 would be required to install a Gasoline Engine and we are, as the Department is aware, totally unable to face such an expenditure and can only rely upon the Department's generosity to aid us in our dilemma.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ley King, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nShingwauk Home,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nTHE GASOLINE ENGINE COMPANY OF TORONTO JUNCTION, LIMITED.\n\nTORONTO JUNCTION. Feby, 11th, 1904.\n\nG. Ley King, Esq.,\nPrin. Indian Industrial School,\nSault Ste Marie, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have yours of the 9th inst., to hand re engine, and believe we are in a position to supply you with an engine that will meet your requirements in every particular. We have placed a great number of our engines for work similar to that which you wish to use it for, in fact we make a specialty of engines for this purpose. Only about 10 days ago we took an order from the Mount Elgin Industrial Indian School, which is situated at Muncey, for an 18 F.P. portable engine to use in connection with the Institute. They will use it much for the same purpose that you require, only they possibly require a little heavier power, as they want to use it to run some heavy machinery in connection with their laundry as well as to do work in connection with their farm.\n\nWe are enclosing you a description of our engine, and also a cut of same. We would ask you to note carefully in this description the many points of superiority which we have over engines of other makes. One point in particular to which we would call your attention to, is the question of the governor of our engine, in that we are able to change the speed of the engine by the governor while the engine is running and doing work; this is an important feature, especially in your case, as we note that you want to run a number of different pieces of machinery, and with other makes of engines when you change from one piece to the other, it would necessitate the change of the speed of your engine, as we have described in our description, this would occasion much fruitless labor in obtaining the right speed. While with our engine the speed can be changed at will while the engine is in motion, and when you attach it to a new piece of machinery, you simply have to screw either up or down on your governor button until you arrive at the right speed. This is a great improvement on a gasoline engine, and is in fact a deciding point with a great many purchasers in favor of our engine.\n\nWe guarantee our engines in every respect, in fact we have the largest plant in Canada devoted entirely to the manufacture of gas and gasoline engines, and as the result, we have to turn out a line of goods that will meet with the approval of the public, if it were otherwise, we would in a short time, not be able to find a market for our goods, nor manufacturing any other line, and would be compelled to go out of business.\n\nWhen we place an engine with a customer we have as much, if not more interest in seeing that it gives satisfaction, it is not a question of one sale or one order, but we hope that every engine that we place, especially at a central point, such as your School, that will lead to many more orders from the same District.\nOur new illustrated catalogue is in the hands of the printers, and as it will not be out for a few days, we regret we are not able to give you more complete information. We are, however, sending you a few testimonials, as we find a great many customers would rather have the opinion of some party who has used the engine as it gives possibly more correct ideas of what the engine will actually do.\n\nThe price of our 10 H.P. engine is $375 cash or $405 on time. The price of our 12 H.P. engine is $425 cash or $465 on time. In regard to the price, we do not claim that we sell at as low figures as possibly some other manufacturers do, but we do claim to give better value for the money than any other make that is in the market today. The question with the Mount Elgin Institution was not in price, but of purchasing an engine that would be thoroughly reliable in every respect, and while they could have purchased engines at a lower rate than ours, they decided in favor of our engine. This price includes all the necessary equipments for the engine, including batteries, gasoline and water tank, exhaust pipe and mufflers, and all the necessary connections ready to operate the engine. This price is F.O.B. Toronto Junction, and the freight would simply be a matter of so many hundred from here to Sault Ste Marie. The engine will weigh in the neighborhood of a ton and a half.\n\nWe believe, as you will note from the testimonials that our customers who have used our engines find that gasoline is much more economical than steam, in fact, if you had a gasoline engine say 10 H.P. capacity, when you are running it say on a pump and only require 2 or 3 H.P. to run it, you could operate it just as cheaply as you could a 2 H.P. engine, while with a steam engine there would be very little difference in the cost, whether you operate it at full capacity or at half. Further, with a gasoline engine, it does not require the services of a man to look after it as when once the engine is started, it does not require any attention, while with a steam engine, it is necessary to have some person giving constant attention to it.\n\nSpeaking generally of the cost of steam and gasoline, we find in anything up to a 25 H.P. that gasoline, under all circumstances, is more economical than steam. We have even placed gasoline engines in planing mills and saw mills, where the fuel for a steam engine practically amounts to nothing, but the parties have installed gasoline simply because it was much more convenient to get up power in a few seconds, and when they do not require the power, the engine can be stopped immediately. Also gasoline has a further advantage, as we have already mentioned, by not requiring the services of any person to look after it.\n\nIn regard to the safety of gasoline in comparison with steam, might say it is almost an impossibility to explode our gasoline engine. There is no fire in any way in connection with the engine, only a small electric spark on the inside which ignites the mixture of the gasoline. The engine is so arranged that only a certain amount of gasoline vapor can be exploded at any time, so there is no possibility of an explosion of the gasoline. In fact, at any time while the engine is running, there is not more than half a cup full of gasoline anywhere in the engine, unless the\ngasoline storage tank is in the base of the engine, where we place them sometimes, or we have them where the tank is placed outside the engine altogether.\n\nWe trust we have covered all the points that you required especial attention to in your letter, but we will be very pleased to hear from you if there is any further information we can give you. We would be pleased to receive your order, and are in a position to fill same very promptly.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of an early reply, we remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nDict. R.P.D.\nM.P.\nEnc.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Further, that the mere passing of the building, in which cases of small-pox are confined, does not create a practical danger to passers-by. The law in Ontario provides that contagious disease hospitals cannot be established nearer than one hundred and fifty yards to an occupied dwelling. If Mr. King finds that this building is nearer than one hundred and fifty yards to the Home, of course an injunction might be obtained, but as the effect of the hospital upon the value of the property is not a matter of concern to this Dep't I cannot advise action along the line suggested in Mr. King's letter.\n\nMarch 14th, 1905.\nOTTAWA, 15th March, 1908\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th instant with reference to the establishment of a post-house by the town of Sault Ste Marie on the public road leading to the Shingwauk Home, I beg to say that under the Ontario Law contagious disease hospitals cannot be established nearer than 150 yards to an occupied building. If it is within this distance, an injunction might be obtained. However, the Chief Medical Officer of this Department advises me that if the staff and pupils of your school have been vaccinated properly, they cannot take small-pox even though exposed, and that the mere passing the building in which cases small-pox are confined does not create a practical danger.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PELLEY\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nGeo.

Gisby recently sent ten samples of the water Steetton uses to Dr. Boyce, the provincial medical health officer at Toronto for analysis. Typhoid is very prevalent in the province and Dr. Gisby, who is the medical health officer there, determined to discover to what extent the water supply was responsible.\n\nSteetton is supplied by eight springs; the Sault's water main along Catawba street, while the town water is acquired from the steel plant system which has a separate intake from the Sault. The town water was tested from the tap at Mr. McLean's drug store at Tagona; from the tap at Kelly's grocery on Catawba street from which water for the Sault's own system is drawn, and from eight springs, one of which is cemented and carefully covered. All the samples were drawn in special bottles furnished by Dr. Boyce which were carefully filled and sealed by Dr. Gisby. The report of the bacteriologist of the department was rather surprising. Out of the ten samples, three were found to be free from colon bacilli (the germ of typhoid). These two were the water taken from Dr. McLean's Tagona drug store, the town water derived from the cemented spring. The town water taken from Mr. Kelly's tap was not free of the bacilli.\n\n\"What significance attaches to the report?\" the doctor was asked.\n\n\"Well, it shows why typhoid is so prevalent in Steetton. Typhoid is a water borne disease, and Steetton water just now is not being boiled. Of course the presence of colon bacilli in a given sample of water does not mean that the water is unfit to use all the time. It may happen that at that particular time there was an impurity present. It is quite possible that the water was not so semiclear. I believe the Sault water is in good condition in spite of the bad sample taken from Mr. Kelly's tap. When doubt exists, the water should be boiled.\"\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that we have seven boys and eight girls at present laid up with typhoid fever in the Shingwauk and new school houses.\n\nThe cause of the disease is immediately attributed to the present polluted state of the Allary's River from which our water supply is dependent, and the disobedience of our pupils in discarding from the common water taps, instead of using the water previously boiled and\n\n[Signature]\n\nSec.

Mr. King indicates a notice sent him by the Postmaster at Sault Ste. Marie informing him that he has been directed by the Post Office Inspector to advise him that so soon as the new post office building is occupied, the practice of having private mail bags must cease.\n\nMr. King points out that the Shingwauk Home being mainly dependent on voluntary contributions for its support, it is most essential that its mail should be handed to the messenger in a locked bag at the post office for safe transmission to his office. The school, although situated within the corporate limits of Sault Ste. Marie, is distant more than a mile and a half from the post office.\n\nThere are some eighty inmates of the school, and he claims that they are justly entitled to the continuance of the privilege hitherto granted them.

Green, Public School Inspector, on the Shingwauk Home, dated May 29th, 1913.\n\nThe school is being well managed, well disciplined and well taught. The only question to be considered is the necessity of adding a teacher. It would be a highly appreciated addition to the equipment of the school to have a library added suited to the capacity and intelligence of the children. I fancy the pupils have much leisure time in which they could use these books to advantage.\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nThe boys here have done some creditable work in wood carving that might be made use of in some way to demonstrate what ability they have in this particular. No doubt if some of them were sent to a manual training school they would excel. One boy is particularly good in drawing and colour work, and he should specialize in this, if possible. It would be a wise policy if those who excel in any branch in these schools could be taken up by some wealthy man, or by the Government and placed in those schools that would give them a chance to carry their special work much further.\n\n(Sgd.)

F. Fuller\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nIndian Industrial School\n\nOctober 4th, 1915\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter No. 152067, I beg to say that I am reasonable at a loss how to make my defense. But first, that by simply stating a few facts, the Department will understand the case.\n\nMiss Wesley wrote saying that she wished to visit her three children who came when some others came from Chapleau. We gave her a welcome, the freedom of the house and one of the best rooms for her own use while staying with us. She remained three weeks and went away seemingly satisfied.\n\nBut before she went she made a request that she be allowed to take Emily, a girl of 13 back with her. To this I was unable to assent in account of her treatment to a little girl whom she brought with her to attorn to a baby 10 months old, and also from the fact that she was not at her home in Chapleau, but living at Michipicoten siding, in a house where her husband, a son and some others were living and Emily would be able to work. I refused for these reasons.\n\nAs to the complaint that the children were neglected, it is utterly unfounded. But there is usually something to start a story on, so I will explain as I have received it from those who had the care of Emily.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 3)\nIndian Industrial School\n\nShe is one of those children who have acquired a certain habit\u2014and which at her age is hard to break off. It was the season when the black fly was bad and Emily would persist in weaving her fingers in her hair. She was told that her hairdo would be left down, but still she could not stop. The result was that she had some very bad sores. Then the nurse had her to come for treatment twice every day and applied something to soften the sores. That was what gave the mother all the cause she had for complaint.\n\nThe boys Tom and Bob are inspected every Wednesday afternoon, and their bodies and heads are shampooed. Their cut is mostly done this part myself\u2014three of the large boys do the hair-cutting. But Thomas, the headboy of one of our teachers, who has the care of the garden, flowers partly\u2014often attends to the boys for me. Every boy should have a real bath once a week, every Saturday, and the system is exactly the same for the girls. I will not deny that the boys do not get their clothes torn and Sat times ragged, and also I have seen their faces and hands dirty. These items are common to healthy boys.\n\nIn conclusion, may I say that it is quite a problem to know how to treat some of the parents whose children are taken into care by the Home and then when the children are getting to be of use. But I feel that there is the little we should hold them, that they may be of use to themselves in after life.\n\nI trust\u2014[signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

But first I must thank you for making me acquainted with the subject of the communication referred to. I think it best to acquaint you with the person Mary M. Gilvery when I first came to take charge of the Home. Mary was about fifteen or sixteen years of age and soon we found that she was giving us much trouble, getting out with persons at any time where she was not watched. Then Mrs. Clark (the same that she speaks of in her letter) came to ask that Mary be allowed to go home to the reserve for the summer holidays and we did so having obtained a promise from Mrs. Clark.\nthat she would be cared for and returned when school opened again. Mary came back and it was soon known that something was wrong. We cared for her. Mrs. Miller nursed her and we called the doctor for her. The baby was dead when the doctor came.\n\nDuring this time when we were much troubled some of Mary's people inquired about her and expressed a wish to have her visit them. They were in Michigan. We tried to find out if they could give her a good home and our answer came. That seemed satisfactory. We did hear some time after that Mary had gone to Duluth to visit a sister. We heard nothing more until last winter when we received a letter from Mr. Sandoval who said Mary McGilvery was his wife. That they wished to come to Canada. But as he was a Mexican the officers of the immigration would not let him pass. Several letters came, always asking for help to get to Canada. Because being a Mexican he was afraid to stay in the States.\nI happened to be in the Michigan Sand and met them. When Mr. Sandoval told me a long story, a part of which was that some doctors at the hospital in Duluth told him that Mary was not sane and that he should put her away somewhere. I answered and told him that if Mary was easily led and childish, he had no right to leave her because he knew her from his own account, long before they were married.\n\nHe did not seem suited, and some time after they came over once at a little visit came to the home. Mr. Sandoval never came into the home but sent Mary in. Mary was expecting to be sick soon and wished to stay with us. He said no, there were hospitals for that purpose, she should go there. They became again and tried to get one of our girls to go to live with them, this I refused, and I believe Mr. Sandoval was very angry because some of our girls said they saw him push Mary into the buggy very roughly when she went out to go Sunday.\nwe have not heard of them since\nand do not know where they are.\n\nBy firm belief has always been\nthat Mr. Sandovar is a bad man\nand a dangerous one. He wishes\nto rid himself of this poor girl\nand is not pleased because he\nwould not take her.\n\nI am sure that I need not\nexpress the fact that I am sorry such\na letter should reach you. It is most\nsurely the work of Mr. Sandovar and not\nMary his wife.\n\nYours very truly\n\nRev. J. Fuller\nPrincipal\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent-General\nOntario\nAfter writing you I thought it best to mention the fact that Mr. Sanderson states that I wrote suspicious letters.

I must say that I do not find Mr. Fuller's letter of the 18th October very pleasant reading. You will perceive that he in no way denies the charges made against him, and the letter is so confused that it is impossible to understand it.\n\nYou will notice the editor of the Ottawa Valley Journal had received a telegram from this woman dated October 23rd, and if she had written to a less reputable journal perhaps Mr. Fuller's name would have been brought before the public in a very undesirable way.\n\nBefore instituting a thorough investigation, I thought it wise to solicit the favour of your judgment in the matter. Please return the papers.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMost Rev. G. Thornloe, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Algoma,\nBishophurst,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 3)\nNorth Bay, O.\nNov 9th 1916\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have been away from home for the past two or three weeks, and your letter of the 25th October with its enclosures have only just reached me.\n\nI am much obliged to you for sending the correspondence to me before taking action; and trust that I am not too late to be of use.\n\nIt is impossible to do more, at the present moment, than express my opinion of Mary Sandoval's letters, and of Mr. Fuller's reply to you. The former I believe to be a tissue of falsehoods, to be accounted for only on the supposition that Sandoval's influence is behind it. The latter I do not find so unsatisfactory as you do. Mr. Fuller shows up the character of the girl, and by inference the untrustworthy character of her statements. The fact that he does not deny these statements is at once in keeping with the character of the man, and an evidence of his conscious integrity. To us who know him thoroughly the things charged against him by Mary Sandoval are simply unthinkable. They would seem unthinkable to him; and he would not deem it necessary to deny them. He would take it for granted that...\nno denial would be necessary. His letter therefore is not a defense but an explanation. That it is somewhat disconnected is quite typical of the man. That is his style especially when excited.\n\nIt remains for me to say what I think is the right course for you to pursue. You will pardon my doing so. Take it you have sent the correspondence home for that purpose.\n\nI think you can hardly pass it over without some action. The charges are too serious for that. For the sake of Mr. Fuller and the honor of some kind of enquiry should be made. What from that enquiry should assure you will have to decide; but I would strongly urge, in the interest your work, that, while as thorough a searching as possible, it should not be too public in its nature. It is easy to stain a character and to discredit a work.\n\nI return home tomorrow and will at once look into the matter.\n\nI write in great haste.\n\n[Signature]\nGeorge Agnew\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Fuller. I shall await the result of Your Grace's inquiries before taking any further action.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost. Rev. G. Thornloe, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Algoma,\nBishophurst,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSault Ste. Marie O\nNov. 14th, 1916\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nOn returning home I at once made inquiries respecting the matter to which the correspondence referred hereinafter refers.\n\nMr. Fuller tells me that my view of his letter was absolutely correct. He is ready to deny categorically the dreadful charges of Mr. Sandovalli's letters; but, when he wrote, it never crossed his mind that it was necessary so to deny them. He aimed a big letter to acquaint you with the loose and absolutely untrustworthy character of the girl.\n\nWhen Mr. Fuller came here he was Mr. Fuller accompanied him prepared to tell me, in detail, the story of the girl's irregularities in the Home, and of the dreadful influence she exerted upon the other girls. But I thought it best not to let her make any statement. If you send anyone to investigate matters she will be ready to tell the facts. So\nfar as we here are concerned no investigation seems necessary. The girl's doings are so well known, and Mr. Fuller is so trusted & respected, as one of the finest opposed women, that we are quite satisfied to let matters drop. But I can understand that you, or those associated with you, may wish share our feelings, not having the same measure of knowledge of these concerns, and having a sense of responsibility for seeing justice done to all. It may well be that you will deem it necessary to send some one to inquire into the facts. If so you may count upon our facilitating his enquiries to the utmost your power.\n\nThe Sandovals have disappeared. Mr. Goodwin, the Attorney, does not know anything of them, he tells me, but thinks they have gone back to the States. Mr. Fuller has had no communication with Mr. Goodwin respecting them, nor does he exert any influence against them. He simply requests them admission to the Home.\n\nBelieve me\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeorge Algoma\nShenigwack Home\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nOct 14th 1916\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI called yesterday to see the Archbishop about the matter of the letter written by Mary Sandovall, and although the Archbishop will write you I feel it my duty both to the Department of myself to write again.\n\nFrom your letter to the Archbishop I understand that I have not made my statement clear to you. Will you pardon me for trying to do so now.\n\nThe charges as set forth in the letter are false, and is an expression of the revengeful feelings of the man Sandovall because he wished to induce us to take his wife Mary into the Home. On two occasions he bought boxes of candy costing likely nearly two dollars and brought them, or rather sent them by Mary, as presents to Mr. Miller and the Superintendent firm and would not receive her, first because of her character and also because in her present condition expecting to be confined in a short time. And while your sympathy went out to the poor girl...\nwe could not entertain the idea for a moment.\n\nI wish to state a few facts not to injure the girl Mary. I would have no objection to this, but to explain to the department the situation as we have had to deal with it. Four years ago we had Mr. Thomas the husband of our present junior teacher and a young man a friend of his working petitioning on a new roof on the main building of the Home. And while speaking of Mary's conduct Mr. Thomas told me that Mary had watched her chance and handed a note to this young man who was helping with the work. I did not see the note but I believe Mr. Thomas did. But it was to say that she, Mary, would go out to be with the man that night. I talked to the man and he confessed that it was true. That Mary did go and watch for him. Then when I talked to Mary she said that she had done this and that she had been with one of the older boys in the school also that she did wrong with an Indian boy who she said after was the father of the baby that was born. I am sure you will understand the care and anxiety all this gave us. And had the baby been alive we\nwould have followed the Father. I learned since that he is dead. We decided to do something in connection with the school for while it seemed hard to send the girl away we could not keep Mary with the other girls. So we began to look about for a good home for her. Knowing through letters received by Mary that she had relatives not too far away I went to the Brebbilas for advice and we began to inquire and arrange for Mary to go. All seemed to be arranged nicely. I went with Mary to see her away on the train. She was quite well after being taken care of by Mr. Fuller and as we hoped all fitted just to begin life afresh. This hope was realized for a little through letters clipped to Mr. and Miss Fuller until for a year but so we heard no more. Then I met Mr. Sandovol and from him I learned about the fact that Mary was his wife and also that matters had been bad generally where Mary had been living with her sisters until Mr. Sandovol who had been boarding for some time took pity on her and married her. May I say in conclusion that this matter is a great injury to me. For fifteen years we I say we, because Mr. Fuller and our daughter have shared with me. Have worked altogether & etc.\nThe interest of the work. Our time night and day, and our own earnings have been put to the work of the school and in the special case of Mary McTuller and I have been as true to her need Mother to her as we could be to our own. She being the only case of the kind we have experienced.\n\nMr. McSandra have gone from the school I believe. But why they went and where I do not know. Their matters have not been mentioned to any one outside our own family until last evening when I talked about them with the Archbishops.\n\nMy sincere desire is to retain my present standing in the administration of the Department which is so ample grounds for our work in the school.\n\nBelieve me\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\n[Signature]\nMary McTuller\nPrincipal\nNovember 16th, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Fuller -\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 14th instant, which reached me this morning.\n\nYour statement with reference to the charges made against you by Mrs. Sandevel is quite satisfactory, and I wish to assure you of a continuance of the high regard which we have always entertained for you since you undertook the management of the Shingwauk Home.\n\nI would like to say that in taking the action I did I was wholly actuated by a desire to protect you.

In answer to this, the Department requested that a report of progress be sent to the Department occasionally.\n\nThis morning Louise handed us a letter she had written to her father, Mr. Louis Jackson, and knowing the letter had been written freely without violation of any kind, the thought occurs to me that it would answer very well as a report at this time, so I am taking the liberty of enclosing it and asking you to forward the same to Mr. Jackson after you have examined it. I think to add to this the fact that Louise is doing nicely in all her duties.

We have on hand good seed grain enough for thirty-five acres and will need more.\n\nI am certain it will be of interest to the Department to learn that we have shipped nice young pigs eight weeks old, and three sows to market young pigs by June 1st.\n\nOur little herd of sheep have done well. We have eight calves already, and more to come. Altogether we have forty heads.\n\nWe were very short of grain last year, but we have enough hay left over to do the young stock next winter, so if there is a crop at all this year our cattle are safe.\n\nThanking you,\n\nTrusting you,\n\nYour Humble Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Some time ago I wrote the Department and the answer came that you had none at that time, but that when occasion offered you would send one.\n\nWe are more in need than ever now of one than when I wrote first we have two girls who are attending High School and they often express a wish that they had a typewriter to use for their home work. I must speak also for my own use. I am compelled on account of the condition of things to work outside on the farm and find it letters writing a little harder to do especially if done after the days work. I find I cannot do as when I began the work here. So it is really necessary to have a typewriter. We could possibly buy one, but I thought it wise to write the Department first.\n\nYour obediently,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Coghlan has now to operate an L. C. Smith machine with a wide carriage for making statements, etc., and she wishes to have the same machine for her ordinary work so that she will not be changing.

Marie, Ont.,\n1st February 1919.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn response to the appeals made by the Primate of our Church, the Most Reverend Dr. Matheson, the Department a year or two ago very graciously increased the per capita grant to schools like our Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes to the extent of ten per cent. This increase was given in view of the excessive high cost of living. Subsequently I understand that the Primate made further representations in behalf of our schools, showing that the ten per cent. granted us, welcome as it was, did not really cover the case, since the increased cost of living represented 50 to 100 per cent.\n\nAll this we feel to be of the utmost importance, in view of the present condition of affairs. There is no immediate prospect of the cost of living being reduced. In the meantime our school, after a very painful struggle to make ends meet, has begun to fall behind. Unless the Department is disposed to listen favourably to the Primate's appeal, I do not see what can be done to avoid serious debt in the near future. My purpose in writing you is to ascertain whether anything has been done or is likely to be done in connection with the matter.\n\nTrusting you will forgive the trouble to which I have put you, I remain,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Will you kindly correspond with the agent and see that they are furnished with a suitable slate board.\n\nThe pupilage at present is 15 below the number provided for in the estimates next year. In order to aid in the financing of the school a determined effort should be made to increase the pupilage by recruiting from available territory, the preference to be given of course in accordance with our policy to destitute and neglected children.\n\nMr. Abraham also pointed out that there is at present only one teacher in the class-room, whereas there were formerly two. One teacher can hardly do efficient work, even with 55 pupils, and if the pupilage can be increased in the school, we should insist that a second teacher be provided.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nChatham, Ont., May 11th, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nIn accordance with your request I wish to submit the following report on the Shingwauk Home, Sault Ste. Marie Ont.\n\nFARMING CONDITIONS.\n\nTile drainage is badly needed on about 35 acres; most of this land is good soil but very little is produced from it because of the wet condition. To get any kind of results this land should be tiledrained. The cost of this would be approximately $400.00.\n\nBARN & OUTBUILDINGS.\n\nThe outbuildings, barns, stables, etc. are much below the standard found on the ordinary farm.\n\nThey are very badly arranged which makes the chores very difficult. The cattle barn, where the feed and bedding is kept, is 500 ft. from the horse barns and sheep stable; the feed and bedding consequently have to be carried this distance by hand. The stock have to be watered at the back door of the school.\n\nThere is no hog pen, the hogs are kept in corners of the barn, in empty stalls and in the chicken house. There is no decent place to keep sheep, only an old low shed without any windows. The main barn is a structure 30' X 50' with a basement under only part of it. This basement is too low and has only about one quarter enough window space to give the animals the proper amount of light (a cow requires 5 to 7 sq. ft. of window space and 600 cu. ft. air space). This basement is much too small, the cattle are literally packed in the barn.\n\nThere is no implement shed, the implements stand outside buried in snow. The chicken house is old and does not embody any of the modern ideas of a poultry house.\n\nThe buildings should be moved closer together, the barn should be raised 1\u00bd ft. and the basement continued the full length of the barn, the cattle should be stood in two rows lengthwise. Up-to-date staunchins, a concrete floor, a litter carrier and more windows should also be put in.\n\nA new implement shed, hog pen, chicken house, and a sheep barn are badly needed.\n\nSCHOOL.\n\nThe schoolroom is very badly lighted, having windows at both sides. It is extremely difficult to see the work on the blackboard, frosted glass should be put in in the north side windows.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 3)\nThe children are in attendance from 9 A.M. until 4 P.M.; when they are needed for work they are taken out of school and consequently miss a great many lessons. A system of vocational education should be introduced for the senior grades. One half day in school and one half day for work. It is important that each child, not only receives a complete course of study in the school, but that they get proper instructions along farming and industrial lines as well.\n\nFor the girls I think a course of sewing should be put on. At the Mohawk and Muncey Institutes a sewing instructor teaches the girls to make almost all of the clothes worn by the pupils in attendance. This is a splendid training and will be of great value to them in after life. The only training that they get at the present time is mending.\n\nIN GENERAL.\u2014\nThe environment of the Shingwauk Home is not conducive of the best results under present conditions. An industrial school which has conditions poorer than are found at many Indian homes must fail in its purpose of preparing the pupils for the work they will have to do in after life.\n\nThe buildings at the Shingwauk Home will be to a certain extent the ideal of the pupil. An industrial school should embody up-to-date farm buildings, equipment and management to which the graduates could look back as being the ideal which they must sometime attain.\n\nIn conclusion I must congratulate the Rev. Mr. Fuller, principal, on being able to obtain the splendid results in the past under such adverse conditions. I feel that the years of faithful service he has given at the Shingwauk Home should be recognized and rewarded, and that from some source the necessary funds might be obtained to give him the proper equipment for the educations of the pupils at his school.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C.

You will pardon this further intrusion on your time and consideration, but the danger of a deficit being created compels me to take this step.\n\nBelieve me\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJuly 16, 1919.\n\nDear Archbishop Thornlee -\n\nI have your letter of the 8th inst., in reference to the per capita grant. I am pleased to be able to inform your Grace that Parliament has voted us an increased per capita grant of $10.00 for the current fiscal year. The per capita grant to the Shingwauk Home will, therefore, be $120.00, and will be paid at this rate from the 1st of April, last. I hope that this will be a substantial help to Mr. Fuller in meeting his financial obligations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLennan\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

The trouble is of about two years duration. About a month ago the joint became acutely inflamed, due to additional infection, and ten days ago the abscess opened and is now discharging freely from several openings. It will improve slowly but the Shingwauk Home is not a suitable place for a case of this kind.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Louise Jackson,\n\nLouise's elbow has improved a great deal in the past two weeks. The acute inflammation has subsided and the discharge is diminishing in amount rapidly. She complains yet of a good deal of pain in the joint. She is doing better than I expected and I suppose is as contented at the Shingwauk as she would be anywhere. A hospital would be the only other place for her to go to. I think I would leave her at the Shingwauk Home for the present and I will advise you how she is again in a couple of weeks.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 3)\nDear Sir,\n\nOur pupil Louise Jackson is not doing well; her arm has healed up fairly well, but she is very thin, and her arm gives her considerable pain.\n\nDr McCaig came to see her several times, and we took Louise to him. Then he came to examine her arm, in order to report to the Department, and from that we expected to receive some instruction.\n\nIt will be expensive to take Louise to Toronto, but she was our best pupil, and had attended High School one year and passed in her examinations, so it seems too bad if she has to give it all up.\n\nIf the Department think it best that Louise should go to some Hospital, please instruct us.\n\nMiss Fuller has been working long and hard and we are getting another teacher to take her place while she has a little rest, and as it is most likely she will go to Ottawa for a few days, it would be a good chance for Louise to go with Miss Fuller.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nBenj.

(RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 3)\nOttawa, November 8, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the Principal of the Shingwauk Home regarding Louise Jackson. He states that this girl is not doing well; her arm has healed up fairly well, but gives her considerable pain. He suggests that she be sent to a hospital in Toronto.\n\nI have to request that you will again furnish a report concerning the present state of health of this girl and whether you would advise that she be placed in a hospital, or receive treatment at the school. In your letter of the 2nd of October, last, to Mr. MacKenzie of this Department, you stated that you were of the opinion that it would be well to leave her at the Shingwauk Home for the present, as she was as contented there as she would be any place.\n\nKindly report on this matter as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 8th inst., regarding Louise Jackson I would say that I saw her this morning and find that the suppuration in the elbow is still going on and it is ready to open up. She has not improved in her general health and although she has been taking good tonics and her appetite is good she has failed and is thin. As whooping cough has broken out in the Home I think it would be advisable to have her placed in a hospital. We could give her very good care and she would be well taken care of in the General Hospital here. If you wish her placed in the hospital here will you kindly advise me?\n\nWhooping cough has broken out in the home and I am vaccinating all the children with the whooping cough vaccine.\n\nI have taken care of the children in the Shingwauk Home for the past seventeen years and have never received anything for my services. I spoke to Mr. Benson about the matter when he was here on one of his visits about 5 years ago and he said he would bring the matter to your attention and suggested that $200 per year would be a reasonable fee for my work. I never heard anything further about the matter and concluded that he had either forgotten about the matter or it had not been favorably thought of by the Department. I think I should be paid $100 per year back pay and beginning with 1920 a yearly salary should be fixed. I cannot afford to work for nothing and I do not suppose the Department expects me to.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 3)\nMarch 4, 1920.\n\nDear Doctor McCaig,-\n\nLouis Jackson was in to see me yesterday, and stated that he had a letter from Louise, in which she was begging to be allowed to come home.\n\nI note that you made a report last month on her condition, and I shall be glad if you will let me have your opinion as to whether it would be wise to accede to the father's request, or whether it would be in the girl's interest to keep her for a time where she is.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. S. McCaig, Esq., M.D.,\nQueen Street,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 3)\nSir,\n\nI beg to say that I have just been notified by the Rev. B. P. Fuller Principal of the Shingwauk Home, that he has sent his resignation to the Arch Bishop.\n\nMr. Fuller informs me that he is resigning as Principal on account of interference on the part of Miss Bettrell in his duties.\n\nMiss Bettrell was sent to the home here by the Women's Auxiliary of the Church of England from Ottawa, she has undermined his authority and have turned the Children and other inmates of the home against him, and by his conversation I am led to believe that the Arch Bishop takes her part.\n\nIt will be a great calamity if Mr. Fuller is allowed to leave this Institution. He is a very capable man, a hard worker, doing every kind of work to advance the home and the Indian Children under his care. He works on the Farm just the same as the Farmer hard for that purpose. I have known him to do Farm work all week and preach three times on Sunday.\n\nI am informed by those who knew that for some time before Mr. Fuller took charge of the Shingwauk, that the church authorities were seriously thinking of closing up the place; it was so heavy in debt, they induced Mr. Fuller to take charge and he went at the work with all his might and in a short time had it running very smoothly and has the place nearly clear of debt, and is getting where he could devote more of his time to the inside management of the home. I venture to say that if Mr. Fuller leaves the Home now that in less than three years it will be back to the same position it was in when he took charge.\n\nMiss Bettrell has on several occasions I am told sent letters to the Arch Bishop complaining of Mr. Fuller and it seems that...\nArch Bishop believed her and censured Mr Fuller for her untruths.\n\nAs far as the Indian Children are concerned it will be a very great misfortune to them the day that Mr Fuller leaves the Home.\n\nHis whole heart is in his work for the Indians and Indian children.\n\nHe was beloved by them all until this woman got in her undermining work. I personally have had a great friend in Mr Fuller and he has often driven down to the Garden River Reserve to assist me and he has been of great assistance to me in many ways towards the betterment of the Indians.\n\nSeeing that the Department of Indian Affairs is paying so much towards this institution I am in hopes that you can do something to get Mr Fuller to remain, and I hope I am not asking too much when I ask you to bring some pressure to bear on the Arch Bishop whereby Mr Fuller will have a free hand in engaging what help he requires without interference from the English Church at Ottawa or elsewhere, or even from the Arch Bishop himself.\n\nI am sure that any of the Officials from the Department who have visited the Shingwauk Home in Mr Fuller's time will tell you that he is the right man in the right place.\n\nI hope that I am not overstepping my place when I write this letter but I cannot help but think that there is too much CHURCH interference with Indian Schools, both Catholic & English Church.\n\nKindly let me know if anything can be done in this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nDuncan G.

It is not necessary for me to recall to you the condition, financial and otherwise, of this school when he took charge, and the splendid improvements that he has effected. I would not be disposed to accept his resignation, unless for very good and urgent causes, and I trust, therefore, that Your Grace will make an effort, as I am sure you will, to restore the harmonious management of the institution.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from Your Grace at an early date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Rev.

Fuller, Principal of the Shingwauk Home, has informed you that it is his intention to resign, owing to friction between himself and a representative of the Women's Auxiliary of the Church of England.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is regretted very much, as it is considered by the Department that Mr. Fuller is a highly competent and practical man for work of this kind.\n\nHis Grace the Archbishop of Algoma has been written to in this matter and informed that the Department would not be disposed to accept Mr. Fuller's resignation, unless for very good and urgent reasons.

Fuller, the Principal of our Shingwank Home, has resigned. There was some friction between him and a representative of the Woman's Auxiliary of our Church, but I at once intervened and happily was successful in restoring in a large measure the harmony which had been disturbed. I did not deem it necessary to acquaint you with this little trouble, since we were thus able to tide it over. Yet it is only fair to add that the restored harmony may or may not prove lasting, and if it should not then I shall have to approach you on the subject again. However, you may rest assured that we will do our best to keep so good a man as Mr. Fuller with us as long as it is possible to do so. The strain upon him, however, has been great, and since the death of his wife he has felt it acutely. This has to be considered in all that has happened, and in looking forward to what may happen.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would trade the one\nwe have win pay the difference and get\na new one.\n\nMy object in writing you was not\nto ask you to buy a car but to loan\nme enough to repair the one we have\nor pay the difference for a new one.\nadd one to pay back this loan as I could\nsave or you desires it to be paid.\n\nI have one other recourse.

I paid five hundred for the car we have used this is the third season's use we have had, so that many parts must be removed. Tires, top, and other parts which will cost upwards of two hundred dollars.\n\nI have consulted with the dealers in cars and they say that as I have given our old car good care in service, they would allow him five hundred dollars for it on the price of a new car, which would leave a balance of five hundred to pay for the new one.\n\nMy experience with the advice of others tells me it would be wise to sell the old car as it is for five hundred, because all parts are apt to give out at any time, requiring constant upkeep.

This advance will be deducted in two quarterly payments of equal amount from the December and March quarter grants to your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Benj. P. Fuller,\nPrincipal, Shingwauk Home,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, January 17th, 1922.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the Shingwauk\n\nFarm Conditions.\n\nA large part of the farm is low and wet. This land is rendered almost useless on this account. The City Council are constructing a large outlet drain for the purpose of draining the Golf course. This drain will provide a splendid outlet for this low land and I would strongly recommend that a system of tile drainage be provided. Eighty per cent of the best farms of Ontario are provided with tile drainage. I would estimate the cost of the tile at between $500 and $600. The increase in yield from this would pay 100% on the investment, as it will make the difference between a good crop and a poor crop and in some years no crop at all.\n\nBarns and Outbuildings.\n\nImprovements.\n\n(1) A new sheep pen and drive shed combined has been erected since my last visit.\n(2) A new chicken house.\n(3) A new hog pen.\n\nThe above buildings fill a long felt need.\n\nThe barn is a structure 30' X 50', with a basement under only part of it. This basement is very low and extends under only part of the barn. It has only one-quarter enough window space, and no proper arrangements for feeding. Each cow requires about six square feet window space and 600 cubic feet air space to give best results. The stock kept in this basement are too crowded and could not be expected to give even average results. Feeding arrangements are very poor and out of date. Many Indian farmers have far better cattle barns than this one.\nThe buildings are too far apart to make the choring easy, and a great deal more time and labour is taken up because of this.\n\nI would recommend that a new basement barn 36' X 60' be built along modern lines closer to the school than the old building. The old barn could be utilized for other purposes, such as storing feed, implements, and etc.\n\nThere is no silo for storing feed in. I consider that in successful farming in this locality a silo is absolutely necessary for success. The supply of succulent food throughout the winter months makes up for the absence of green pasture and the flow of milk is in this way kept up. Silage is a much cheaper food than grain or hay and is much more palatable.\n\nI would recommend that a silo be built.\n\n(1) The school room is lighted on both sides and consequently the children often cannot see the work on the boards. The blackboard space is small and cut up badly. The windows on the north side should be closed up and more windows opened up on the southside. A blackboard could be put on the north side.\n\n(2) There is no root cellar and the perishable fruit and vegetables are stored in the boys' living room. This is not fair to the pupils or a good place to keep the potatoes, etc., as at times there is too much heat and they spoil, consequently. A root cellar should be built with a door opening to the kitchen.\n\n(3) The girls and boys dormitories are on the second floor. There are no lavatories closer than the main floor. This makes it very difficult in case of sickness, etc. A lavatory should be provided on the same flat as the dormitories for both the boys and girls.\n\nIn General.\n\nThe environment of the Shingwauk Home is such that the children placed there for training do not graduate with the correct ideas in respect to care of stock, arrangement of buildings, kind of buildings, etc.\nIf this school is to fulfil the purpose for which it is intended, the environment must be such that the pupils will graduate with correct ideas on methods of farming, feeds, feeding, buildings, breeds of stock, arrangements of buildings, land drainage, etc.\n\nSome of our Indian farmers are very much in advance (so far as up-to-date equipment is concerned) of this school.\n\nI submit that this is a condition that should be rectified in the near future.\n\nIn conclusion I can do nothing but congratulate the Reverend Mr. Fuller on the splendid showing he is making under such adverse conditions. He should be given a free hand to carry on the work of the farm and I sincerely hope that the necessary improvements are made in order that he may make a greater success from the standpoint of preparing the pupils for the work they will have to do in after life.\n\n(R.H.

It has never been done here; only once when we thought it would really be nice to teach the girls to milk we had a cow brought to where the girls could be allowed to milk the cow and take care of the milk.\n\nOur system has been that the boys do all the barn work and milk the cows, strain the milk and bring it to the house. The girls take care of the cream and make the butter.\n\nWe shall follow your instructions and have the cows made ready, then some member of the staff who is capable of doing so will supervise the process of milking.\n\nThis as you will understand will require some reorganizing and careful supervision, but it can be done, and there is no doubt it will be a benefit, and should be done.

B.P. Fuller.\n\nThese difficulties concerned, largely, the persistent refusal of Mr Fuller to co-operate with our Commission, and to observe such every-day business principles as the notification of supplies ordered, and the forwarding for payment of accounts received.\n\nWe have decided that the interests of the work cannot be further endangered through a continuance of apparently fruitless efforts to secure reasonable co-operation on the part of Mr Fuller; and have, in consequence, notified him that his engagement as Principal of the Shingwauk Home will terminate on the last day of September of this year.\n\nWe propose to transfer the Rev. Principal Hives from Lac la Ronge to succeed Mr Fuller at the Shingwauk Home. I am requesting Dr. Westgate to write you concerning the Rev.

Certain of the conditions mentioned in Canon Gould's letter were under discussion. Mr. Boyce was informed it would cost the Department several thousand dollars to place the materials of the wrecked buildings at the disposal of the Diocese and that a very much better price could be secured if the wreckers were allowed to dispose of the materials. Mr. Orr believes that the old material would be of very little value to the Diocese and none to the Department in connection with the reconstruction.\n\nThe other question under discussion was the proviso that a farm of not less than 150 acres of good arable land in a suitable position should be attached to the new school. Mr. Boyce was informed that the M.S.C.C. could leave this question quite safely with the Department without making reference to it in the transfer.\nMarch 31, 1930.\n\nDuncan C.

He adds that he has no doubt that they will agree to omit or alter these two clauses in accordance with my advice.\n\nThe Bishop adds the following: \"The reason these two clauses were added was that we understood from Canon Gould that they had been agreed to by the Department. I wish you would make this clear to Dr. Scott, with regard to the second one particularly. It seems presumptuous to lay down a condition that the farm land must be provided; but, as I have said, we were given to understand that the Department had agreed to this.\"\n\nAs regards taxes, the Bishop tells me that none have ever been paid on the Home up to the present time. He also says that whether the Home would be exempt from local improvement taxes if that part of the city were ever improved he does not know, but that it is so far out that the question is not likely to arise for many years.\n\nAs soon as I hear the decision of the Executive Committee, I will write you further.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nACB:GG\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wilson to the Right Reverend P. D. Faquier, Bishop of the Diocese of Algoma \"in trust for the use of the Indian Industrial Institution called and known as the Shingwauk Home\". Subsequently in January 1910 by quit claim deed the Reverend Edward F. Wilson quit claims in the usual form to the Incorporated Synod of the Diocese of Algoma. This deed was registered at Victoria, chapter 60, incorporating the Bishop of the Diocese of Algoma, and also recites \"6 Edward 7th, Chapter 141, Incorporating the Synod of the Diocese of Algoma. It also recites that some doubt has arisen as to the power of the Synod to mortgage or sell the lands comprising the Shingwauk Home, and the Reverend Edward Wilson gave the quit claim deed in full compliance to the compensation of the land to the Synod in fee simple and conveying same from all restrictions, trusts and conditions in the deed made by him to Bishop Faquier in 1875. The result of these conveyances is to vest the property comprising the Shingwauk Home in the Incorporated Synod of the Diocese of Algoma without same being subject to any trust.\n\nIn the letter from the Department of Indian Affairs to your Department, dated April 23rd, 1930, some suggestions are made in regard to the conditions to be inserted in the conveyance from the Diocese to the Department. I would like to be certain that these conditions are all that should be imposed.

Walkom visited the Shingwauk Home on April 21st, 1931, and his report will be found on File 13-0-6.\n\nHe reports rather unfavourably on the work of the teacher in the junior room, Miss Bena Fuller.\n\nMiss Fuller has no professional certificate. She attended High School for two years and has been teaching in the Shingwauk Home for several years.\nMR. PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF THE KIWANIS CLUB:\n\nYour Committee investigating the conditions of the Shingwauk Home Indian School, visited the Home Friday, May 8th, 1931, and wish to report to you as follows:\n\nRev. C. F. Hives, Supt., met us and we were shown every consideration and courtesy, and we wish to submit that a letter of thanks be forwarded immediately by the Secretary to Mr. Hives, extending our appreciation.\n\nTHE SHINGWAUK Home was built about sixty years ago. It is of stone outer wall construction, the interior being entirely of wood and plaster construction. The building is in very bad need of repairs throughout.\n\nDue to the heating plant consisting of three boilers being inadequate to heat the building, it is necessary, and they are using stoves in all class rooms and play rooms. Electric heaters are being used in staff quarters instead of stove. This condition we consider a most dangerous fire hazard, which should not exist in any public building. There are ninety-nine pupils in the building - sixty girls and thirty-nine boys.\n\nThe fire fighting equipment in the building is entirely inadequate and would be useless in case of fire, due to the locations in the building. The fire escapes from the boys' dormitories consists of one straight ladder outside of the window. This window must be raised and can only be lifted to give a thirty inch opening, to let the boys out on the platform from which they must go down a straight ladder one at a time. The landing platform has no guard rail on opposite end to ladder, which is a most dangerous condition, and if crowded with boys leaving this building, no doubt would be the cause of serious accidents.\n\nWe regret to advise that even a worse condition exists in the fire escape arrangement from the girls' dormitory. The exit is also through a window the same as the boys. The straight ladder lands on the peak of a pitch roof of a frame building. After landing on this roof the ladder must be thrown down the eave where another straight ladder is provided to reach the ground. A more deplorable condition exists at this point. The ladder is approximately eighteen inches below the eave of the roof, which necessitates the pupils hanging over the eave to reach the ladder. There are no guards above the eave and it would take extra care on the part of any man to reach this ladder, let alone these young girls such as there are found in this institution.\n\nWe cannot comment too strongly on the fact that the interior of this building is nothing less than a dangerous fire trap. The existence throughout the building of so many stoves greatly increases the possibilities of fire.\n\nWe also find that the roof of this building is in bad need of repair. There are many leaks in the dormitories as well as other parts of the building. It is necessary, on rainy days, to place pails and tubs in many places throughout the building to catch the water coming through the roof. These leaks have left the ceiling in a very bad condition, the plaster being off in many places throughout the boys' and girls' dormitories, sewing room and reading rooms.\n\nAll\nAll the class rooms are overcrowded. The junior class room with crowded accommodations for forty pupils. This class room is in very poor state of repairs. There are no toilet accommodations for this room and it is necessary for these children to go down stairs.\n\nThe girls' dormitory is like the rest of the building, of entirely wooden floors, and wooden partitions. There is only one toilet and one bath in connection with this dormitory. The junior girls' dormitory is practically in the same condition as the senior. These girls use the same toilet and bath as the senior girls which means there is only one toilet and one bath for all girls in connection with their dormitories.\n\nBoth the boys' and girls' play rooms are in very bad shape. In the girls' play room there is only one bench which, when crowded, will only accommodate eleven children. There are only three toilets in operation in connection with this play room.\n\nThe laundry department is entirely inadequate for the number of pupils attending this school.\n\nWe cannot bring to your attention too strongly the fact that all stairways throughout this building are wooden construction and the lack of suitable fire escapes makes this building a most dangerous fire trap, entirely unsuitable for a school. We are advised that this building was condemned by the Fire Chief a year or two ago and that this report is on file at the Department at Ottawa.\n\nWe also bring to your attention that, in view of the most unsatisfactory sanitary conditions, and fire hazard existing in the use of this building as a home and school, and after seeing the deplorable conditions that do exist brought to their attention, the late Government provided funds in the estimates of 1930 for the erection of a new Indian School here to replace the present Shingwauk Home.\n\nThe Grand Jury, at the last sitting of the Supreme Court here, visited the Shingwauk Home and recommended the immediate construction of a new Indian School.\n\nWe further wish to suggest to you that the construction of this new Indian Home could be done now cheaper than at any later date.\n\nIn view of the deplorable conditions of the Shingwauk Home, as shown above, we recommend that this Club pass a resolution, bringing to the attention of the Government, the unsatisfactory conditions existing in the Shingwauk Home here, and strongly urging them to proceed immediately with the construction of a new Indian school here, before the inevitable happens, and this building is burned with a heavy loss of human life, and that this resolution be forwarded to The Hon. Minister of Interior, and a copy of same forwarded to The Right Hon. Prime Minister and Mr. T. E. Simpson, M. P.\n\nRespectfully submitted;\nJune 4th, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter recently received by the Honourable Mr. Murphy.\n\nI desire you to make a very complete inspection of the Shingwauk Home in order that, on your return to Ottawa, you may be able to give me such information as will enable a decision to be made as to the best course to follow in regard to this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

CAMPBELL.\nCITY CLERK.\nJune 30, 1931.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nMr. Ferrier has recently visited the Shingwauk Home and we are now cooperating with the Reverend Principal in an effort to make the work possible and safe in the old building, until such time as funds can be provided to erect a new school. Some changes have been made in the fire escapes and a few improvements have been authorized. The Reverend Principal is being instructed to initiate the half-day system, so that there will be no crowding in the classrooms and so that there will be more training in the household and related duties.\n\nI write to inform you that the Department considers Miss Betterell, the matron, should now be retired. I realize that she has given splendid service for some years, but, unfortunately, as she is now quite blind, her usefulness at an Indian residential school is largely ended. Will you please take steps to see that she is replaced by a competent officer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, B.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. O.,\n39-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT\n\nPursuant to instructions in your letter of the 4th instant, I have to report that, when in Sault Ste. Marie early this month, I made a very careful inspection of the Shingwauk Home. While the particular criticisms in the resolution of the local Kiwanis Club were founded in fact, the general conditions at this school are not quite so serious as those who are pressing for a new building would have us believe.\n\nThe interior of the building is so constructed, that there is no doubt a serious fire hazard. This hazard is increased by the supplementary heating units - 7 stoves in classrooms, playrooms, laundry, Principal's office and Principal's residence and one-half dozen electric heaters in the staff bedrooms.\n\nTo put this old building, part of which was erected 57 years ago, in a safe condition, would be so expensive that it is out of the question. If school is to be conducted until a new building is provided, steps must be taken to minimize the risk of loss of life in the event of fire. Some months ago we authorized the engagement of a night watchman, who would constantly patrol the building. I find that the Rev. C. Hives, the Principal, has relied a little too much on this employee. He has not sufficiently emphasized the fire drill and the fire escapes themselves.\n\nWe have been allowing $50 per month for the night watchman and the school has been giving him his board. I asked Mr. Hives if he was one hundred per cent satisfied that the man was on the job every minute of the night. He hesitated before replying that he was \"reasonably sure\". I asked him if we made the remuneration $75 a month if he could get a man on whom we could absolutely rely. He replied he could not, as from the 15th instant, there has been on duty a night watchman who is thoroughly reliable.\n\nWith reference to the fire escapes themselves, I arranged for a guardrail on the boys' fire escape and instructed that a fire axe was to be always handy to the window opening thereof. The escape from the girls' dormitory was in good condition, as reported by the Kiwanis Club Committee, and, on the 9th instant, I\narranged for two carpenters to come out to the school and gave them instructions concerning a window outside the window and a platform to the fire escape\u2014all properly surrounded by guardrails. Further, the ladder fire escape was raised 5 ft., to be easily reached, and was properly protected. The Kiwanis Committee reports concerning a straight ladder which lands on the peak of a pitch roof; but this is not a fire escape, as it leads only to the roof of the building.\n\nTo lessen the general risk, I instructed the carpenters to punch a door through an interior wall which divides the building on the dormitory floor. In the event of fire at one end of the building, the boys or the girls, as the case may be, could be moved to the other side to descend the fire escape or the interior staircase there.\n\nThe roof of the building is in rather poor condition and I authorized the carpenters to re-shingle those patches where there was any leaking.\n\nThe building accommodates 95 or 100 pupils without any real crowding, and I instructed the Principal to see that the number did not run over the 100 at any time. The boys' dormitory has plenty of air space and the girls' is not seriously crowded. In the past, the classrooms have been overcrowded, but I have instructed the Principal to try the half-day system, which will remedy this situation forthwith. The toilet and bath facilities are inadequate, but remedial measures need not be considered as the Department intends to discontinue the use of this building in the early future. The playrooms and the dining room have not been used for several years and I gave the Principal instructions in this connection. The matron at the school, Miss Botterell, is now practically wholly blind, and I intend to write to Dr. Westgate with a view to having her retired.\n\nIt should be remembered that this building is not a high structure and that there are no pupils more than 2\u00bd stories from the ground. The dormitories are not locked at night and the windows to the fire escapes open easily. With your permission, I wish to instruct Mr. Indian Agent Sims to regularly inspect this school and to give particular attention to the safety of the children.\n\nWith your concurrence, I wish to authorize a few minor improvements, as follows:\n\n1. Electric lights over the fire escapes.\n2. Sheet iron and asbestos protection around the smoke pipes from stoves in kitchen and both playrooms.\n\n3. Calcimine and -\n3. Calcimine and brushes for decorating the dormitories and a little paint to complete the henhouse.\n\n4. Half screens for certain windows.\n\n5. $150 for repairs to the farmer's cottage. The farm instructor, who is a good officer, has recently been married, and Mr. Hives wishes to give him one of the old stone houses to himself.\n\n6. One horse to complete a second team for the school.\n\nI may say that I was quite critical concerning the lack of cleanliness of certain parts of the old building and on the school grounds. Mr. Hives assures me that conditions are now much better than when he took it over, but he is going to take full advantage of what may be done to have each child and each child's responsibilities daily for jobs that they can do. Mr. Hives now knows the Department's wishes and is not going to treat them lightly, as I told him that we would close the school if the church authorities and himself felt that the difficulties and dangers were too great.\n\nThere are five buildings that should remain after the new main building is erected - the chapel, the farmer's residence, two summer cottages on the river and the new henhouse. The old hospital across the main road and all the other buildings, including the barn, should eventually be removed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 30th, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nBy concurrent mail, Mr. Indian Agent Sims is receiving written authority for the improvements indicated by Mr. Ferrier upon the occasion of his visit to the Shingwauk Home. I write direct to you with reference to one or two changes that the Department believes to be in the best interests of the work. You should organize the pupils on the half-day basis - one half day in the classroom and the other half in one of the departments. This will give you groups of younger pupils both morning and afternoon for household and other duties. The Department would like to see all parts of the building and the grounds kept in an exceptionally clean condition. Mr. Ferrier reports that there is room for still further improvement in the playrooms, the dining room and in the grounds contiguous to the main building. The change will make no appreciable difference, if any, in the academic progress of the pupils and the extra training in the domestic and other duties will give them habits of industry.\n\nMr. Ferrier reports that every energy should be bent towards minimizing the risk of loss of life in the event of fire. As from the 15th instant, you are authorized to engage an exceptionally reliable night watchman and to pay for this service seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per month. The fire escapes are now usable, provided there is proper supervision, and the Department wishes you to hold drill regularly. This should be done when the children are in the dormitories and, occasionally, to show all the varied nature of the exits, you should have all pupils descend by the fire escape at one side or the other of the building.

I believe that, at no time, should there be more than one hundred (100) pupils in residence. In your old building, the toilet and bath facilities are inadequate and supervision is difficult. This suggests that only those pupils that can be easily accommodated should be considered. The Department is writing to Dr. Westgate today with reference to Miss Botterel, the matron, who should now be retired because of her physical disability.\n\nThe Department realizes that your duties as Principal are particularly trying and difficult as long as you remain in the old building. We urge you and the officers of the staff to make special efforts at this time. You may rest assured that it is our intention to arrange for a new building as soon as funds can be provided.

As Miss Botterel is an accepted missionary of our Woman's Auxiliary and has been in missionary service for many years, it will be necessary for our Commission to submit your request to the Dominion Board of that Auxiliary in order that suitable arrangements may be made for her maintenance after she retires from the service.\n\nA communication is going forward today to the Corresponding Secretary of the Board, and in due course, you will be advised of the action taken.

I am aware that the grant for the current year 1931 has been paid for the increased pupilage, but I am unable to locate in our records here any official communication from you sanctioning the increase noted.\n\nI wrote to the Principal of the Shingwauk Home, to ascertain if he had received any such communication and in his reply dated December 15th, he quotes an extract from your letter to Mr. Sims, your representative at Sault Ste. Marie, but omitted to give the date of that letter. From the extract he quotes, it is clear that the grant at this school would be provided for 100 pupils, but that number was not to be exceeded owing to the condition of the main school building. So far as I have been able to discover, no further official communication has been received by our Society, or our Society's representatives sanctioning the increase in question. In case the matter has been overlooked, I shall be obliged if you will furnish me with the date and number of any such letter which may have been written in order that steps may be taken to locate it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

During the summer of 1930, it was found necessary to place a number of children in a residential school and the Reverend Principal of the Shingwauk Home expressed a willingness to accept them. A considerable number of new pupils were placed in the school at that time and, consequently, the average attendance was increased, as follows:\n\n- September 1930 - 81.6\n- December 1930 - 100\n- March 1931 - 99\n\nIn view of the fact that the children were placed in the school at the express wish of the Department, grant was paid for the full average attendances as stated above and, when preparing the estimates for 1931-32, it was arranged to vote funds for a pupilage of 100. No official communication was addressed to your Society in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. T.H.R.

I also stated that our Commission had contemplated making a change in the Head Matronship at this school when the new school building which your Department had agreed to provide, was ready for occupation. When the erection of the new school was postponed, our Commission felt that, in view of the splendid services which Miss Botterel had rendered during a period of many years, she should be allowed to remain in her position until the mid-summer holidays of this year.\n\nAs stated above, the matter will be again considered by our Commission at the meeting I have mentioned, and in due course I will advise you of any decision they may make at that time.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nThe matter of the retirement of our Headmatron is being taken into consideration today by our Commission in Winnipeg. While Mr Ferrier, the Superintendent of Indian Education was here last June, we discussed this matter, and it was deemed advisable that her retirement should be effected. But after looking more thoroughly into the matter, I came to the conclusion that we would not gain very much by doing so. I found that one at least of the other members of the staff would go with her. This particular agent, who is our Senior teacher, is a valuable member of our staff. I cannot speak too highly of her work both in the classroom and out. We have had, and are having some very encouraging results, and at the present time we have ten pupils attending High School. I know from experience that it is not easy to get a teacher into our work, who is capable of getting the desired results that we have been able to achieve. I am therefore most anxious that she should remain. I may say the reason that our Senior teacher would leave is because she feels that Miss Botterel would require her. The main reason for Miss Botterel's retirement is on account of her affliction of Blindness, which, I may say she has sustained in the work here, and, according to medical authority, on account of the nervous strain to which she has been subjected in the work. Some twenty years ago, Miss Botterel gave up a good position in an office to take up work here in Shingwauk Home. In those days the work must have been extremely hard on account of the very small staff the school was allowed. Her blindness is a handicap, but since Mr Ferrier's visit here, on my recommendation, the Commission have given us another agent who has taken over a great deal of the work heretofore done by the head matron. Miss Botterel relieved of that work acts in the capacity of an advisory agent, and looks after the correspondence with the W.A. branches. I may say that this part of the work is very important, and as Miss Botterel is well acquainted with that part of the work, it is very well looked after.\nI may say that Miss Botterel is well liked by the children, and according to our records, we have very few changes in the personnel of the staff.\n\nAnother consideration which must be met, is Miss Botterel's future. Miss Botterel is 48 yrs of age. She has given nearly twenty years of her life to this work, but she is not an old woman. In fact she is very healthy excepting for her unfortunate affliction of blindness. One has to look at the matter from its humane side as well as the business and practical side, and it does not seem altogether right to lay aside a strong healthy woman in her prime of life. If she leaves the work here, with the very slender means she will have at her disposal, her life will be a very dull and hopeless one.\n\nMy feeling in the matter is that she should be allowed to stay on as she is until the new building is accomplished. She knows this building. She can get around it just as well as I can, and taking everything into consideration, I would sincerely recommend that the Department withdraw their decision, and allow the Commission to retain her services until the new school is built.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. R. Ferrier,\nSupt. Indian Schools.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI hope you will pardon the liberty I take in writing you, but the matter of which I write is a vital one.\n\nAs Miss Botterell's friend, Mr. Hives has told me that you have felt it advisable to have her removed from her position here, with no reason given, but naturally it is to be inferred on account of her sight. Miss Fuller wanted to write this letter but I felt under the circumstances, it would be better coming from some other member of the staff, as her father has placed her in one of the most trying positions a person could be in, also Miss Botterell.\n\nIf it is on account of Miss Botterell's sight, we cannot understand why she was not dismissed sooner. For eight years in exactly the same state she has carried on her work faithfully and successfully, often entirely on her own, while day after day Mr. Fuller was off in his car making a slave of himself for the public and his many friends who imposed too much on good nature.\n\nWhen I first came here in 1921 Miss Botterell worked better with Mr. Fuller than anyone else as she understood his violent unreasonable passions. After hearing last year that Miss Botterell was to be discharged, I could not but make a deduction knowing that Mr. Fuller had made a vow that he would get Miss Fuller, Miss Botterell, and myself out of here before he was through and I very much fear that he has impressed you falsely as he has done so many of the people about the Sault concerning Miss Botterell.\n\nPoor Mr. Fuller is a self deluded warped man with the most unreasonable jealous unfair mind, and cunning enough to appear one thing and deliberately act another, and yet a man of some very excellent qualities, though he would stand for nothing that did not fit in with his will. He trusted the place implicitly to Miss Botterell's judgment and management when it suited him. He said he never took a holiday. Sometimes it was one long holiday. Didn't want to say he did nothing so he did frivolously at times, in early spring, in spasmodic fits, in the management that all right on a dead level line.\n\nAs I have said before, Miss Botterell could work with him as no others could. Then came the horrible question of correspondence when those who could get no answer from him wrote Miss Botterell. She always showed him the letters and when he\ntold her to leave them to him, she did, but half were never answered. When the order came that matrons must answer all letters, she again got into disfavour. He told me she had the nice part while he had all the cheering and lugging. Then when the Commission asked Miss Fuller to assist her father, she too got into trouble. Mr. Fuller just confiscated the letters.\n\nWhen in desperation Dr. Westgate asked Miss Botterell to take full charge of requisitioning and supplies, and it was \"Bedlam\" let loose. How she continued to live in her usual manner was a marvel to us all, but she said she had become accustomed to him.\n\nWhen she had the requisitions complete and handed over to Mr. Fuller for signature, etc., they lay on his desk for days. The Commission sent a young man to assist Mr. Fuller. This he refused to allow him to do and again serious trouble arose. Mr. Fuller was furious with Miss Botterell for not keeping the young man out of the staff dining-room other than meal times. Then Mr. Fuller refused to have anything more to do with any of us and had his meals carried over to him by his sister. He repulsed every effort of Miss Botterell's, Miss Fuller's, and Mr. Dill's to come to some peaceful conclusion. The young man of course corresponded with the Commission but we knew nothing more till we heard that Mr. Fuller was to be given a Mission.\n\nThen Mr. Fuller appealed to the Primate. He asked us if we were willing that he should stay under altered conditions. We were indeed sorry for him as, in spite of all, we had a regard for Mr. Fuller and from Miss Botterell to the last member of the staff, we said decidedly yes, but it seemed that for years and years the Commission had been coaxing, threatening, and begging him to comply with some system. Dr. Westgate can testify to the fact that never by letter, word or deed did Miss Botterell make any complaint. Of course Mr. Fuller was angry because Miss Fuller would not go with him. He had to keep his sister and she could not afford to give up her position as neither he nor she had a cent. Again he blamed us. All his life her welfare was not at heart, but just his own personal feelings at that time, though I believe now he sees the wisdom of her staying here. Since last summer a reconciliation was made between Miss Fuller and her father brought about largely by Miss Botterell coaxing her to put her pride away and not wait to be asked to visit him.\n\nAt Miss Botterell's instigation, we started a subscription for Mr. Fuller. When I had collected three hundred dollars, I met with so many hints that we were putting him out that in disgust I passed it over to two other ladies. What possible influence could a mere staff or matron have, had he been able to fulfill his business obligations and satisfy the Commission? Dr. Westgate knoweth this.\n\nYou wonder what my object is. Well, Mr. Ferrier, it is this. I appeal to you as a gentleman and Christian to give Miss Botterell\ntime to adjust herself. Her life, her heart, her all has been here with her work which instinctively she knows like the alphabet. I tell you, the girls of this school would have had a different record if it had not been for her untiring watchfulness. Girls that refused to work or to try the entrance for me for fear they would have to go among the whites, she handled with her unusual ability. Mary Simons, now nursing in an Indian hospital, is one example. Would you not consider, Mr. Ferrier, allowing Miss Botterell to continue here. I promise you if needed, I am here and ready to help make up for any deficiencies her sight may cause.\n\nAt least could she stay till she sees Agnes through? She is as dear to Agnes as a real mother, and Agnes has her A.T.C.M., at Miss Botterell's expense. She will be ready for Normal the year after this. Agnes says you have promised to help her when the time comes. My plan is to try and get back on the Public School staff at Stratford. Then I could take Miss Botterell with me. Agnes could come to Stratford Normal if I get my position there back again. With anything you can do for her, I will try to make up the rest. She would then be in a position to help Miss Botterell who has in times past spent her small salary foolishly on things that Mr. Fuller just refused to get for the workers.\n\nAgain I must apologize for this letter as I know you are a busy man. It could be endorsed by Canon and Mrs. Colliton, workers who one after another could not stand the upsetting life, the Hayes' family who lived here, and on ad infinitum. I do not write maliciously, but that you might get a true inner view and can judge accordingly. I feel sure if you really knew the truth, you would sympathize with Miss Botterell, whose last vestige of sight went after one of Mr. Fuller's terrible rows. Miss Fuller will tell you that. I am writing in confidence for her sake, as she still loves her father for his many good qualities, but she never knew when she could be sure of peace\u2014until Mr. Hayes came here. I hope that you will pardon this letter which I hate, but which is of such vital importance to most of us here, that I have ventured it. Again I say that if you could see your way clear to change your judgements, you would never regret it.\n\nThe Commission, the W.A.S., and Mr. Hayes are all satisfied that it is for the good of the school to have Miss Botterell here. Since your visit here last summer the system has been changed as you advised and more time is put on the girls' household training. As Mr. Hayes has advised, only the very promising will get extra attention in the classroom which I generally give outside of school hours.\n\nHoping that you may see this in the light I have tried to write it,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nAlice Davies\nSenior Teacher, Shingwauk.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo, #15-0-1, and my reply to the same on the 7th inst., re the retirement of Miss Botterel from the Head Matronship of the Shingwauk Home, I beg to state that this important matter has received the most careful attention of our Commission, and in view of the following communications received from the school management, I have been instructed to request your Department to kindly agree to permit Miss Botterel to continue in her present office, at any rate, until the new main school building has been provided:\n\n(1) The Rev. Principal Hives telegraphed to our Commission on April 11th, stating that he very much regretted the action of your Department with regard to Miss Botterel, and added that he did not consider the showing of the school with regard to the health of pupils, the general progress made, and the results obtained under her Head Matronship warranted such action.\n\n(2) On April 16th, a letter was received from one of the leading staff agents, who refers to Miss Botterel as follows:\n\n\"Her work, her heart, her life, her brain, her all are being given for this school. She knows it as she knows the letters of the alphabet .......... Miss Botterel has faithfully, watchfully, loyally served in this work for eighteen years, giving up a good position as stenographer in the Department of Agriculture in Ottawa for the love and urge of missionary work. She has always smoothed over troubles whenever they arose. It is true she has\nbeen deprived of her eyesight, but with her own trained girls, in addition to the Head Matron's work she has done endless substituting, even in the kitchen at times, and never was the work so well done. She directed the girls in this work, and an excellent training it was ..........\n\nHad it not been for Miss Botterel, the story of the girls at this school would have been a very different one. When Mary Simons, now a fully qualified Nurse, was in the Entrance class, and refused to take the examination because she would have to mingle with White girls, Miss Botterel dealt with her as she did with Louise Jackson and Barbara Michael, and it was not long until all the brighter girls looked forward to higher education ......... To take her work from her, the only work she can ever know now and which she just naturally does so well, would be cruel.\n\nA healthy, vigorous person, living the rest of her life, with no sight, and nothing to do, would be slow torture. If you can use your influence with the Department to alter their decision in this matter, I will vouch for Miss Botterel, and make up for any drawback to the work which her lack of sight may mean, although no such drawback has as yet existed.\"\n\nIn the light of the above communications, our Commission feel justified in asking your Department not to press for Miss Botterel's retirement at the present time. Some years ago when Mr. Fuller was filling the position of Principal of this school, and he failed hopelessly in the matter of answering communications from the Commission, and in submitting the reports they required, Miss Botterel was asked to undertake these duties with the assistance of another member of the staff, and they were well and promptly done. Although she is deprived of the priceless gift of sight, her sane judgment, sympathetic understanding, neverfailing patience, and otherwise generally good and helpful influence, combine to make her one of the most efficient staff agents our Commission\nhave ever had in the Indian Residential School service, and the members sincerely trust that you may be able to accede to their earnest request, that she be allowed to continue in her present position.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, April 26, 1932.\n\nDear Miss Davies:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to Miss Betterel, matron at the Shingwauk Home.

The buildings are old and dilapidated looking and nothing very much can be done to improve them. The grounds have been very much improved this last year. The interior has been cleaned and painted. The dormitories are spotlessly clean and tidy. The whole interior shows a vast improvement since last year and reflects great credit upon the Rev. Principal for his efforts. All the pupils remaining in residence looked happy and well cared for. Some of the bigger boys were out on the land ploughing and cultivating, others were working in the garden. The boys and girls are getting a good experience and training here, which will be valuable to them in later life.\n\nThos.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal Rev. A. E. Kinchin, B.A., B.Th.\n\nDated January 24, 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sault Ste. Marie this January 24, 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1947.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

Hutchison, B.A., L.Th.\n\nDated May 19, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Shingwauk this 22nd May, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SNIIGWAUK School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30 1947.\n\nPrincipal REV. E. Hinchin, B.A., M.Th.\n\nDated JULY 24 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 25th July 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SHINGWAUK School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30 1947.\n\nPrincipal REV. A. Minchin, B.A., L.Th.\n\nDated October 31 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Sainte-Marie this 4TH NOVEMBER 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

during Quarter:** 0\n\n**Amount of per capita grant due for Quarter:** $\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. A. Mutchin, B.A., B.Th.\n\nDated April 22, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nthis April 27th, 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whom grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SHERRNAUK School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30th 1948.\n\nPrincipal H.M.S. Minchin, B.A., L.Th.\n\nDated June 30 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sault Ste. Marie this June 30th 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupil during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SHINGWAUK INDIAN SCHOOL School for the Quarter SAULT STE.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SHINGWAUK INDIAN SCHOOL SAULT STE.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SHINGWANK INDIAN RESERVATION School for the Quarter ended 30th September 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19th October 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19th October 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SHINGWAKI INDIAN SCHOOL SAULT STE. MARIE, ONTARIO School for the Quarter ended 30th June 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 15th Oct. 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SHINGWAULK INDIAN SCHOOL SAULT STE. MARIE, ONTARIO School for the Quarter ended 30th Sept., 1905.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19th Oct., 1905\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of quarterly per capita for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated January 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which any pupil has entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. D.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: D.C. Wickenden\n\nDated: April 11, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403 R. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Sault Ste.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal D.C. W. Richardson\n\nDated April 11, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date April 11, 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: D.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils named on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nBy D.C. Wickenden Principal\n\nDated April 11, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this April 11, 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. A.E. MacLean, B.A., L.Th.\n\nDated: August 15, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Sault Ste Marie this 17th August 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal Rev. A.E. Kinchin, B.A., L.Th.\n\nDated April 30, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this April 30, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk Scult Ste.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. All Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. A. E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: V. E.

capita grant due for Quarter:** $\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. A. Kinchin, B.A., L.Th.\n\nDated: December 31, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: January 4, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Minchin, B.A., L.Th.\n\nDated October 31, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 3rd November, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Arthur E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 27, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nthis 29th April, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils mentioned in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal Rev. A.E. Minchin B.A., L.Th.\n\nDated July 31, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated this August 3, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReg.

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. E. Hinchin, B.A., L.Th.\n\nDated April 10, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nthis April 22nd, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. A. E. Minchin, B.A., L.Th.\n\nDated January 28, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this February 29, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. A. E. Macdonald, B.A., L.Th.\n\nDated October 27, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this October 30th, 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal Rev. A.E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

I am aware that to place the Homes on a par with the Government Schools in point of equipment will have to be done by degrees; but as a first step in this direction I would suggest, subject to your approval, that fifty of the wooden bedsteads which have been in use for over fifteen years be discarded and iron bedsteads similar to those used in the Northwest Schools be substituted. These bedsteads can be purchased for $9.50 each.\n\nAnother matter I would wish to lay before the Department for their favourable consideration is the necessity and importance of adopting some more satisfactory and economical method of heating the Institution. The consumption of fuel under the present system of using stoves is enormous and out of all proportion to our means, our expenditures on fuel last year amounting as it did to $792.59. The introduction of a more modern heating system would not only prove a great boon to the pupils in the Institution but it would be the means whereby a large saving might be made in our expenditure.\n\nI have not submitted any estimate of cost of erecting...\na separate building for the accommodation of the girls because I understand from the Department that there will be no funds available this year for this purpose; but I trust that the Department will give this very necessary and most important matter their favourable consideration next year.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir\n\nYour most obedient servant\n\nDeputy Supt General\n\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nPrincipal.\nHaving made a thorough inspection of the home as requested, I have concluded that the only proper method of heating the building is by a \"Steam Plant\" and this of a modern construction\u2014to erect and establish a plant with sufficient radiating surface to heat it comfortably would cost about $1200.00\u2014in making my estimate I have based my calculation for a good supply of surface\u2014there are changes that could be made which would lessen the cost but for the present it would make it so little that it would scarcely be worth considering\u2014a \"Hot Air Plant\" could be placed in the home at a less cost\u2014I should not recommend it\u2014the situation and peculiar conditions of the building would necessitate considerable attention to design a \"Hot Air Plant\"\u2014which added to the cost of the plant would nearly amount to as much as for steam\u2014with the possibility of the air becoming unwholesome and under certain conditions of the wind\u2014it will be understood that in submitting the Estimate for the Steam\u2014there will not include any Carpentry or mason work that may be necessary.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nPlummer & Young\n\nIndian Affairs.

The amount spent on fuel for last year was $800.\n\nThe pupils attending this school are drafted chiefly from the Indian Reserves in Central Ontario, and the undersigned submits herewith a statement showing the Capital at the credit of the different bands to which these pupils belong, also the number of pupils from each of the said Bands and the proportion of the total cost of the proposed repairs, namely $2,500 in round numbers, which it is proposed shall be borne by each of the bands interested.\n\nThe undersigned would therefore, respectfully recommend that the deduction as specified opposite the name of each Band in the statement above referred to be made from the Capital at the credit of the Band under the provisions of Section 70 of the Indian Act, and that authority be given to have the proposed repairs made in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted.\n\nProvision is made by the Department for 100 pupils at $60. per capita per annum at this school and until the proposed improvements are made, that number cannot be accommodated.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nHayter Reid\n\nDeputy Superintendent\n\nGenl. of Indian Affairs\nStatement showing the amount of Capital at the credit of the respective Bands in Ontario who have sent children to the Shingwauk Home from 1890 to 1895 inclusive, the average number of children sent by each Band and the proposed expenditure of $2500 that could be charged against each Band.\n\n| BAND                        | Amount of Capital | Average Number of Children | Per Capita Cost | Proposed Expenditure per Band |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|\n| Ojibeways of Sarnia         | $206,778.80       | 9 1/5                      | $25.10          | $230.92                      |\n| Ojibeways of Walpole Island | 69,753.69         | 32 3/5                     |                 | 818.26                       |\n| Ojibeways of Nawash        | 391,523.80        | 3 3/5                      |                 | 90.36                        |\n| Ojibeways of Muncey        | 66,322.31         | 7 1/5                      |                 | 180.75                       |\n| Ojibeways of Manitoulin Island | 144,126.12     | 4 4/5                      |                 | 120.48                       |\n| Ottawas of Manitoulin Island | 4 1/5             |                            |                 | 105.40                       |\n| Moravians of the Thames    | 157,970.44        | 21 4/5                     |                 | 547.18                       |\n| Munceys of the Thames      | 2,632.74          | 3 3/5                      |                 | 90.36                        |\n| Oneidas of the Thames      | 568.10            | 2/5                        |                 | 10.04                        |\n| Mohawks of Tyendinaga      | 111,932.22        | 6 2/5                      |                 | 160.65                       |\n| Batchewana Indians         | 11,019.88         | 1 4/5                      |                 | 45.20                        |\n| Pottawatomies of Walpole Is.| 6,207.52         | 4                          |                 | 100.40                       |\n\n$2,500.00\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTO THE\n\nCLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 19 June 1895\n\nYou are requested to furnish a Copy or Extract of the Order-in-Council P.C.

The Department would therefore like some explanation of the charges referred to in the Vouchers; and it would be well for you to talk the matter over with the Principal, and see whether these accounts could not be materially curtailed by the elimination of the charges to which exception is taken.\n\nIt will readily be understood that the further the grant can be made to go in improving the buildings the better for the interests of the Institution, and it\n\nWm.

Fiddes & Hogarth of this City, who have taken our specification of materials required and system of piping necessary, and figured thereon, and we have to report to you that the material supplied, Radiators, Boilers, etc., are as little as we could recommend for the work. We have endeavored in making this specification to keep well in view the economy in first cost of the apparatus, so far as that is consistent with subsequent satisfaction to you, both as to economy in fuel and efficiency in heating. You will of course appreciate that a slight saving in the original cost of the apparatus would prove unsatisfactory if it were followed by an unsatisfactory working apparatus. We are sure that anything less than we have herein specified, will be followed by a greater or less disappointment.\n\nIn explanation of the fact that we have not given you figures direct, we have to say that for some years past we have not done contracting directly. We understand that a number of other concerns throughout the Country have made specification for you, and we trust that in selecting your Boilers & Radiators for the job (whoever may be the Contractors) you will give us the preference, as our interests in the matter is confined to the supplying of these goods.\n\nIn introducing to your notice Messrs.

Beck of the same place at $2,950 should not be entertained, as the price in each case is too high and no details are given, especially as regards the quantity of surface radiation.\n\nThat of Keith & Fitzsimmons of Toronto at $1,700 should also be counted out as the size of the Boiler (No 7) is too small and less costly than No 8. The heating surface 2245 square feet is not sufficient. The Tender does not include building of Chimneys, converting of Lamp room into furnace room nor carpentering work necessary for the fitting of pipes &c. They estimate this work at $150 or $175; but it is believed that it would cost at least $300. That would bring the price up to at least $2,000 for a No 7 Boiler and radiators with 2245 square feet of surface, or about 90 cents per square foot.\n\nThat of Fiddes & Hogarth for the Gurney Foundry Company, at $2,280 does not include the building of Chimneys which would cost about $175, nor Brick foundation for Boiler say $20. These items would bring the Tender up to...\nto $2,475 for a No 8 Twin Oxford Boiler with 41 Oxford radiators and all necessary apparatus and a radiation of 2744 square feet, equal to 90 cents per square foot.\n\nThat of the Bennett & Wright, Ltd at $2768 is for a No 8 Daisy Boiler and Safford Patent Radiators with a surface of 2900 square feet and all necessary pipes, fittings and work ready to fire up, equal to 96 cents per square foot.\n\nThat of W.H. Plummer & Co., at $2450 with $175 additional for Chimneys in all $2,625 does not specify the description of Boiler, but guarantees to put in a Hot Water Heating apparatus of approved make, which will give satisfaction; the Radiation being 2900 square feet, which is equal to 84 1/2 cents per square foot for the apparatus without chimneys or 90 cents including the chimneys. This Tender and that of Fiddes & Hogarth are about equal as to price and are lower than the others. As Plummer & Co. is a local firm well and favourably known to the Department, I would recommend that they be offered the contract on condition that they bind themselves to put in a No 8 Twin Daisy Furnace with at least 40 Radiators, having a radiation of 2900 square feet and all other necessary apparatus equal in every respect to that particularly specified in the Tender of Fiddes & Hogarth.\n\nPlummer & Co., also quote prices for apparatus of a greater\ngreater heating capacity; but I am advised by Mr Cowan the Engineer of the Langevin Block who is in every way competent to give a reliable opinion in such matters that a surface radiation of 2900 square feet would be quite sufficient. He is also of opinion that the Daisy Boiler would be preferable (though the Oxford is also an excellent one) because in the event of one of the Sections being broken in the Daisy the broken part can be shut off from the other parts and the use of the Boiler continued, while in the Oxford the fire would have to be let out until repairs, which might take a long time, could be effected.\n\nIt might be stipulated in the Contract that Plummer & Co shall give to the Institution all carpentry and other work which can be done by the Artificers of such work, which could be arranged between the Contractors and the Principal, deducted from the amount of the Contract.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is further agreed that at any time during the progress of the works the party of the first part may direct in writing such alterations and deviations from the specifications as he may desire and for such alterations and deviations such time shall be added to or deducted from the time for the completion of this Contract; and such time shall be added to or deducted from the consideration herein agreed to be paid as the parties hereto shall agree upon at the time and in writing; and the party of the second part shall have no claim for extra work or works done, or alleged to have been done at the order of any person or persons unless he produces such written agreement.\n\n10. It is further agreed that all materials and fittings so and when delivered on the building or in the vicinity thereof for the purpose of carrying out of said contract are the property of the party of the first part, but the party of the second part shall have the right to remove all surplus materials and fittings after the full and perfect completion of the whole of the works.\n\n11. The parties of the second part further agree that in the event of the radiation of 2900 square feet expressed in the specification being insufficient to thoroughly heat and warm the building, they will supply, fit up and place in position such further radiators similar to those described in the specification as may be required by the party of the first part at a cost not exceeding $2.5 cents per square foot which is to include all pipes, valves, blow-off cocks, coverings and other fittings.\nsittings necessary to connect such additional Radiators with the Heating apparatus.\n\n12.

Plummer & Co. of Sault Ste Marie, have been carefully examined with the following result:\n\nThose of Plummer & Young and Co. Reak are too high and they are also unsatisfactory in that the quantity of radiation is not stated in the tenders. That of Keith and Fitzsimmons does not cover all the work and the size of the boiler is too small. That of the Bennett and Wright Company is too high being at the rate of 90 cents per square foot of radiation.\n\nThat of Fiddes & Houghton is in all respects satisfactory except that it does not include the building of chimneys nor brick foundation for boiler. Adding the estimated cost of these to the amount of the tender would make the price about 90 cents per square foot of radiation.\n\nThat of W.H. Plummer & Co., for Heating apparatus\n\nGeorge L. King Esq.,\nPrincipal of the Shingwask Home,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.,\nat $2450 equal to 84 1/2 cents per square foot of radiation and $175 additional for chimneys, in all $2625, which is equal to 90 cents per foot. Radiation appears to be the most satisfactory and you may accept the same on the conditions mentioned in the form of contract and Specification sent herewith for execution by them and yourself.\n\nIt is believed that a surface radiation of 2,900 square feet will be quite sufficient to heat the building. This will require at least 40 Radiators. I have left a blank space in the Specifications for you to describe the size of the Radiators and the room in which they are to be placed. If after the apparatus is properly set up it is found that the radiation is not sufficient Plummer & Co., will be expected to put in additional radiators at the rate of cents per square foot which is to cover all cost in connection therewith.\n\nYou will observe in the form of Contract that the Daisy Boiler is called for. This is I believe preferable to the Oxford Boiler which Findes & Hogarth offer to supply, because in the event of one of the sections being broken in the Daisy, the broken part can be shut off from the other parts and the use of the apparatus continued, while in the Oxford the fire would have to be let out until repairs, which might take a considerable time, could be effected.\n\nYou will also observe that the Contract stipulates that as much of the work as possible shall be given to the craftsmen and pupils of the Home.\n\nYou\nYou are at liberty to make any changes in, or additions to the Specifications that you may consider advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nIndian Affairs.

Therefore, I must ask you not to insist on Clause No. 5, which imposes employing the Indian boys to do such work as they may be considered competent to do in connection with the works. In this matter, permit me to say that in order to secure good work, I must employ...\nSkilled mechanics, to carry out the work effectively, and promptly. In order to make the heating apparatus available during present winter, if bound to employ inefficient mechanics, it would mean serious delay, & much increased cost.\n\nClause Eleven:\n\nYou state any additional radiations to be placed at a cost not to exceed $8 per square foot. This cost to include all extra piping, valves, blow off cocks, etc.\n\nNow this cannot be done for the cost quoted above; but I am willing to put in any extra radiation you think you require, at net cost of material, and labor, forgiving any claim for such extra radiation by way of profit.\n\nI anticipate your agreeing to any reasonable suggestion as above. Have ordered all material from the factory. The work will be finished along with all\nW.H. Murray\n\n3 possible dispatches,\n\nJames Sw.\n\nYours faithfully,\nW.H.

As regards clause II, which provides for additional radiation if required, I beg to say that the Department will agree to Mr. Plummer's offer to put in any extra radiation required at net cost of material and labor (foregoing any claim for such extra radiation by way of profit) and you are hereby authorized to alter the clauses above referred to to conform to this arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo.

The petition states that His Lordship, the Bishop of Algoma, has conditionally secured the sum of $2300, provided the building is completed and habitable by the 31st December 1899.\n\nThe Shingwauk home was started twenty-five years ago as a boys' school. In 1880 a home for girls called the Wawanosh, was put up about five miles from the Shingwauk and although it was under the same management an additional staff was required to look after the girl pupils. This arrangement, although very inconvenient, was carried on for about twelve years when the girls were transferred to the Shingwauk home on the score of economy.\n\nWhen I visited this school about five years ago, I pointed out to His Lordship, the late Bishop Sullivan, how unsatisfactory the above arrangement was, and shortly after my leaving there, a new\nPrincipal having been appointed, the girls were returned to their homes pending the erection of a school for their accommodation.\n\nThe Shingwauk Home under Mr King is giving good satisfaction and if the Department could see its way to assist in the erection of a building for girls in connection therewith, better results would yet be obtained as it would entail little, if any, expense in management and there is an unused per capita grant for 35 pupils.\n\nIt is well known that better results are obtained from educating a number of girls than in confining such efforts to boys alone, as when girls are educated and return to their Reserves and marry they exercise a beneficial influence upon their homes and surroundings, which is not so noticeable in the case of boys returning from school.\n\nThere are a large number of Indians who belong to the Church of England and who would be glad to avail themselves of an opportunity of sending their girls to this school.\n\nThe Shingwauk home building has lately been thoroughly over-hauled and repaired as well as equipped and there is plenty of school-room accommodation for the extra pupils desired. The situation is most charming and healthy and is now readily accessible.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This work was satisfactorily carried out and a heating apparatus was also put in at a cost of $2625, which amount was voted by Parliament, $1600 in the main estimates for 1896-7 and $1025 in the Supplementary. The work having been authorized was done before the money was voted.\n\nSince then the school has been supplied with a Prowse Steel Range and 30 modern school desks, the cost of which was paid out of the school appropriation, this being looked upon as equipment.\n\nIn my memorandum of the 22nd instant addressed to the Acting Secretary, forwarded herewith, I pointed out why the old Wawanosh home was closed and why they wished to make provision at the Shingwauk for pupils that were formerly accommodated there.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Trustees for Marquette Farms England \u00a350, was quite\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nMEMO\n\nwas given conditionally, that is to say provided the building was erected and habitable by the 31st January 1900, and that unless these conditions were fulfilled the grant would revert again to the English location and become irrecoverably lost to the work.\n\nThe matter was fully discussed, and an offer from a resident in Sault Ste. Marie to purchase the old Nannawish property for the sum of eight hundred dollars, was submitted.\n\nAfter due consideration the Committee decided that while this offer was some four hundred dollars less than they had hoped to have realized from this source, yet in order to save the earliest grants, they felt that they had...\nMEMO\n\nTo recuse, but to accept the offer and immediately at once the girls' bedding; which was due.\n\nIt is the Committee's hope that the Department will at least see its way late on to assist in the way of heating and equipment.\n\nShan the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. D. Leyting\nPrincipal\nSince our old school became exhausted at Shingwauk, some four years ago, we have found increasing difficulties to obtain the two to three hundred cords of wood needed each year for fire for our dilapidated buildings viz: Senior School, Laundry, Factory including steam engine, Farmers Cottage, Hospital, Chapel, and Cooking ranges.\n\nThe main building is heated with coal, the purchase of which is a heavy tax on our finances.\n\nLast year, and the year before, we assisted to clear some land for a neighbour who permits us to take what wood he requires. This place has also become exhausted, and the only place now likely to obtain a similar privilege is on the Hauley location\u2014three miles distant. The distance is a great drawback, and much time will be lost in taking the boys to and from, and my little work will be ruined if we bring them back at all.\n\nI am desirous therefore of the Department sanctioning the following arrangement viz: To call 12 boys.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nTo talk 12 boys, 6 from the junior school and 6 from the junior hall big boys, and work the two gangs consecutively\u2014on whole day at work, one whole day at school in lieu of the half a day system, for a few weeks hence to obtain the much needed fuel.\n\nThe arrangement will not retard the progress of these boys nor interfere with in any way with the classes generally.\n\nGeo. Heywood Principal\nOTTAWA, 24th November, 1899\n\nSir,\n\nI have acknowledged the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant relative to the procuring of a supply of wood for the Shingwauk Home; and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your suggestion to take 15 boys, in two squads of 6 each, to do this work, the two gangs working each one whole day at school and one whole day in the bush, instead of the usual half day system, until the work is done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Marie. I think he asked for about $1,000 for this purpose. In order that he may not be depending upon getting this money, I think it would be advisable to say to him that it is quite impossible for the Department to authorize this expenditure at present.\n\nDeputy Supt.

As to Tuberculosis.\n\nIt appears to us that the building occupied by the scholars lacks sufficient light, ventilation and recreation space. The ceilings are too low, but this would not be serious if they and the walls were bright in color and easily cleansed. The high wooden wainscoting and walls should be replaced by hard plaster, tile, or at least painted or calgonized in light color; the floors also are open and need renewing. What plaster there is is rough and thus favors the accumulation of dust in which tubercular bacilli thrive.\n\nThere is practically no recreation space provided and that used by the boys, we think positively injurious, as it is used as their wash and scrub room, is largely underground and lighted by only two half windows. The walls are dark and the whole apartment dingy.\n\nThe girls' recreation room has not the same faults, but as it is used also as a dining room, it is hardly a place in which they can romp and take necessary exercise.\n\nThe place allotted for sleeping room would probably be sufficient under ordinary conditions, but owing to the susceptibility of the inmates to tuberculosis, it is questionable if it would not be better to provide more space, or better still a means of changing the air in the rooms frequently.\n\nWe also find that there are a few children suffering from tuberculosis attending the school in whom the signs of disease are quite evident in the lungs, glands or bones. Such cases should never be admitted, and in cases where the disease develops in the school, should\nbe isolated and sent home or to some Sanitarium for the treatment of tuberculosis. This implies a more thorough examination of applicants for admission and if we may, we would suggest, that in addition to the examination now required, you inquire into the previous illnesses and family history of each applicant, and have the school physician make a thorough examination before such applicant is finally admitted. If cases with a marked pre-disposition to tuberculosis of incipient cases are not admitted, the health of the school will be safeguarded.\n\nTo sum up, we would advise the removal of all tuberculosis cases now present and as much as possible prevent the admission of other cases. Also a thorough renovation of the buildings; this to include disinfection by fumigation, also, as far as practicable, changes that would provide more recreation space, light and ventilation.\n\n2nd. As to Typhoid Fever.\n\nThis disease has been very prevalent in the school, owing probably to its drainage contaminating its water supply. The sewerage and drainage from the building and outbuildings empties into a small bay or basin of the river in front of the school. A few yards lower down the river, the intake pipe is situated and thus in the current that drains the basin referred to. Besides this, there is the possibility of contamination of the water supply by the town sewerage entering the river at a higher level. The drains from the buildings are open.\n\nWe would suggest a thorough system of house drainage with closets, urinals and bath-rooms, a water supply independent of the river, say from a deep well pumped by a windmill or other power.\n\nWe find that as much as possible typhoid Fever is being prevented by boiling the water used by the inmates, but it is almost impossible to have instructions carried out by the scholars.\n\nWe have to thank Mr. King for the kindly way in which he facilitated our inspection of the premises, and we wish to add that the school is as\ncleanly and as wholesome as its construction and inherent conditions will permit.\n\nSigned,\n\nS.

R. Fleming, M.D.,\nJ. Douglas McLean, M.D.,\nR. J. Gibson, M.D.,\nMarch 31st, 1906\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nA condition of things admitting of no delay compels me to write you regarding the Indian Homes in this place: (the Shingwauk or Wawaunee).\n\nThe health of the pupils has for some time past been a cause for much anxiety to the Committee of Management.\n\nThis anxiety was increased by eleven of our children contracting typhoid fever in November last.\n\nDuring the past year four deaths occurred in the Homes; one from Typhoid fever and three from Tuberculosis; and several children were sent back to their Reserves, on medical advice, afflicted with various Tubercular ailments, chiefly pulmonary.\n\nSince January of the present year three deaths have occurred in the Homes from Tuberculosis; and two boys and one girl have been sent home on medical advice.\n\nAppalled by these occurrences, the Committee of Management in February last nominated a Board\nof medical officers to investigate as to the causes leading to so phenomenal a condition of affairs. The results of this investigation are embodied in the appended report.\n\nSince receiving the report, a committee of practical business men, after careful personal inspection of the main building and premises, concur with the medical Board's views as to the necessity of, (1) a better and more up-to-date system of house drainage, (2) a safer water supply for domestic purposes, (3) increased recreation space for the pupils, better ventilation, and a general renovation of the main building.\n\nWith these facts before us we have no resource but to approach the Department. Our own means are more than exhausted for the purpose of maintenance. We are therefore petitioning solely upon the improvements and renovations necessary to justify the continued operation of the School.\n\nWe earnestly solicit the Department's counsel and assistance in surmounting the well nigh overwhelming difficulties with which we are confronted.\n\nWe are personally convinced that the renovations and improvements suggested are\nimperatively demanded for the proper conduct of the work and as a safeguard for the good health of the 52 children now within our doors. We therefore confidently appeal to you to make such inquiries and to take such steps as may be necessary under the circumstances. In the meantime we anxiously await your reply.\n\nHave the honor to remain\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\nChairman of the Committee\nManagement of the Orphanage at Wawandah Home\nOttawa, April 7, 1906.\n\nRight Rev. Sir,-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 31st ult., forwarding a copy of a report of a committee of medical men appointed by the Board of Management of the Shingwauk Home to examine into the sanitary condition of the premises; and in reply I beg to say that the matters dealt with in Your Lordship's letter and this report will be duly considered by the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Right Reverend George Thornley, D.D.L.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, April 7, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe Bishop of Algoma has written the Department forwarding a copy of the report of a committee of medical men appointed by the Board of Management of the Shingwauk Home to examine into the sanitary condition of the premises.\n\nThe Bishop refers to an outbreak of typhoid fever which took place in November, last. This epidemic was brought to the Department's attention by the Principal at that time, and a newspaper cutting was inclosed, which showed that the water-supply of Sault Ste. Marie was impregnated with typhoid germs. The whole of the sewage of Sault Ste. Marie is carried down past the Home, which is only one and a-half miles from the town, while their own sewage is disposed of in the river by means of an open drain, which empties a short distance above the intake pipe for the school's water-supply. There is scarcely any current on the north bank of the river, and the accompanying plan of the Shingwauk grounds will show you the situation.\n\nThe committee recommend a thorough system of drainage, with closets, urinals and bath-rooms and a water-supply independent of the river from a deep well, pumped up by a wind-mill or other power. The bulk of the water used for drinking purposes is boiled, but the committee state that it is impossible to have instructions carried out by the scholars. Naturally they will use the water from the pipes when they have an opportunity.\nand need it.\n\nTuberculosis is also prevalent in the school, and the committee have reported on the unsanitary condition of the building, and go fully into the changes and improvements in the building which should be made to remedy the existing state of affairs.\n\nFrom this report it would appear that some radical changes and improvements should be made in the buildings and water-supply, but as the Bishop has furnished no estimate of the probable cost of these improvements, it would be necessary, before the Department could arrive at a definite understanding, to have a detailed estimate of the cost of putting this institution in a thoroughly sanitary condition, that is if the Department is willing to come to their assistance.\n\nThe Shingwauk Home is not the property of the Department, and, if it has to assume the cost of all the improvements suggested, it would be well that some definite understanding should be arrived at as to how the Department stands with regard to the ownership of the property. I think that they should either make it over to the Government or enter into an agreement to recoup the Department for the outlay that we have already gone to and the amount that the report will entail, in case they should at any time cease to carry on a school.\nOttawa, April 11, 1906.\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nIn further reference to Your Lordship's letter of the 31st ult. in regard to the sanitary condition and water-supply of the Chingwauk Home, I beg to say that, before the Department can decide to what extent it would be prepared to assist in making the changes and improvements called for by the report of the committee of medical men appointed by the Board of Management of this school, it will be necessary to have a detailed estimate of the cost of putting this institution into a thoroughly sanitary condition. Such estimate should be accompanied by drawings showing where the changes are to be made, both inside and outside the buildings.\n\nWith regard to that portion of the report which calls attention to the presence of tubercular pupils in the school, the Department concurs in the opinion of the committee that such cases should never have been admitted, and that it would appear to be advisable that those now in the school so affected should be removed as soon as\n\nThe Right Reverend George Thorneloe, D.C.L.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nSainte-Marie, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The visit of the deputation was the outcome of certain correspondence which had taken place between the school authorities and the Department.\n\nTyphoid fever has been very prevalent at the school and also tuberculosis, and the Board of Management deemed it important to have an examination of the buildings, the drainage and water supply, by competent men. Three physicians of standing went thoroughly over the ground and prepared a report. The recommendations included the provision of a supply of pure water, uncontaminated by the sewage from the town of Sault Ste. Marie and the Institution, which was thrown into Garden River above the intake pipe which supplies the Institution with water for all purposes.\n\nThe physicians also recommend a thorough system of drainage with usual modern conveniences. The Department, thoroughly alive to the needs of the case, requested the preparation of detailed plans and the estimate of the cost of making the required changes and improvements. The deputation presented such plans accompanied by the estimate. The changes appear to have been carefully planned and should, when carried out, provide the school with a proper system of drainage, necessary improvements in residential features and sanitation. It is proposed to provide water from an Artesian well for drinking purposes. The estimate for the work, excluding the well, is $7,955. The estimate appears to be a liberal one and the work can possibly be done for less. Detailed specifications have not yet been prepared, and a public competition may doubtless reduce the general cost. If the recommendation which I propose to make is approved of, it will be...\n\nOTTAWA, May 8th\u20141906,\n\nDep. of Indian Affairs.\nwill be necessary to make these detailed specifications and to ask for tenders.\n\nThe most important question to be decided is how to provide funds. The estimates contain no special appropriation for the work except the item for \"Unforeseen and miscellaneous\" expenditure, but there is frequently an unexpended balance from the general appropriation for schools in Ontario and Quebec which might be utilized for such purpose. I think it quite feasible to provide the necessary amount from the existing appropriations and funds to be voted in the future, without increasing the general vote just mentioned, if it will be possible for the management of the school to arrange for carrying the cost or financing the outlay until April 1907.\n\nWe should be able to make an advance from the current appropriation. We will have a certain sum available from the 9 months' appropriation ended 31st March 1907, and the balance may be paid from our general vote for 1907-08. I am led to take this favorable view of the requests of the school management on account of the verbal acceptance by Bishop Thorntoe of the suggestion that he should acknowledge the contribution of the Department in such a binding manner that, if the school were closed or if its use as an Indian industrial school should ever cease, this Department will have a right to expect that there will be a proportionate refund for the present contributions. I would also say that the Boarding and Industrial schools in Ontario are in a different position from those in the West, and whatever doubt may be expressed with reference to the degree of usefulness in the latter, there is no doubt that these schools in Ontario have been for many years a large factor in civilizing the Indians. The Indians of Ontario and Quebec had arrived, some forty or fifty years ago, at a degree of civilization which rendered a system of education, including boarding schools, productive of the best results. These schools are now educating boys and girls to take their places in the white community, and it is the policy of these two (i.e., the Mohawk and the Shingwauk) to endeavour to place their pupils away from the reserves, where they can maintain themselves as do ordinary white citizens.\n\nIn the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nIn the ultimate complete civilization of the Indians of Ontario and Quebec, these schools will be found to have played a most important part. The financial aid becomes essential as the annual cost of conducting the Shingwauk Home is not by any means met by the grant of $60.00 per capita which the Department pays. The last printed financial report of this school shows that the total revenue was $10,332.56, of which the Department contributed $3,534.00 in per capita grants, $607.59 for repairs and the balance, viz: $6,190.97, was received from other sources in England and Canada. We are aware that the school is economically conducted, and there is no waste or extravagance. In view of all these facts, I think a favorable consideration should be extended to the project.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAccountant\n\nOTTAWA, May 8th\u20141908.\nOttawa, June 7th, 1906\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nFind out what has been done since the memorandum went to the accountant with reference to the application of the Bishop of Algonquin for a grant to the Shingwauk Home, as indicated by himself and the Principal, Mr. King, when here a short time ago.\n\nPlease have letter prepared to the Bishop of Ontario.\n\nH.O.D.\nOttawa, June 8, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nBefore writing to the Bishop of Ottawa with reference to putting the Shingwauk Home into a thoroughly sanitary condition and making the additions and alterations called for by the estimate submitted by the Principal, I think it would be well to have a more definite understanding as to how funds are to be provided to meet the cost of these improvements, which will amount to $7,995 according to the estimate furnished.\n\nMr. Scott in his memorandum considers it quite feasible to provide the necessary amount from the existing appropriation and funds to be voted in the future without increasing the general vote, if it is possible for the management of the school to arrange for carrying the cost or financing the outlay till April, 1907. Mr. Scott also says that there will be a certain sum available from the nine months' appropriation ending March 31, 1907, and that the balance might be paid from the general vote of 1907-08. I think we should be able to tell the Bishop about how much we can advance during the nine months ending March 31, 1907, so that the Church authorities would know what amount they would have to finance before the next year's appropriation is available, and I think the Accountant might be asked to state as near as possible how much could be spared before March, 1907.\n\nThe proposed arrangement would not be at variance with the policy of the Department, if it can be carried out.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Marie, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\u2014\n\nReferring to our conversation of a few days ago in regard to water supply for the Shingwauk Home which you desire to obtain from our system, and to your suggestion of laying a two inch galvanized iron pipe from this Company's main at the intersection of Queen and Pine Streets, through Pine Street to the waters edge of St. Mary's River and thence under water to a point outside the limits of the water lots and from that point on the bed of St. Mary's River to the river bank opposite the Shingwauk Home and thence in a trench to your buildings, I would say that the scheme which you suggest is entirely practicable and is probably the cheapest method by which you can obtain water from our mains for your ordinary requirements. The scheme presents no difficulties which an experienced and reputable contractor should not easily be able to overcome.\n\nSuch a pipe should be able to supply about twenty Imperial gallons per minute at a reasonably good domestic pressure at your buildings, an amount which should be ample for all ordinary use. It would, however, be of practically no value for fire protection if fire plugs or hose lines were attached directly to the supply pipe. If connected to your fire tanks it would keep the tanks full so that...\nit would be ready for service in case of fire, but it would not be of sufficient size to supply water to the tanks in the event of fire as rapidly as you would draw water therefrom.\n\nIn order for you to obtain adequate fire protection by direct pressure from our system, it would be necessary to lay a much larger pipe and such a pipe should properly be laid in Queen Street from the end of the present main to the Shingwauk Home. Such a main would be about a mile long and as there are no houses along the route which would provide a return upon the investment, the Company could not at the present time consider the laying of such a main unless it could be guaranteed an annual revenue of about $1000.00.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nTAGONA WATER & LIGHT COMPANY.\n\nBy\n\nChief Engineer.\nDear Mr. Johnson,\n\nThis letter enclosed speaks for itself. Will you please attach it to any previous letter covering the same question.\n\nI am sorry there has been so much delay in getting this letter to you but it was not my fault.\n\nAs to fire protection, we would still have our present tanks (2) or roof of main building having a combined capacity of 1925 gallons.\nkept fire and present system of preserving derricks from the River retained as protection in event of fire in addition to proposed supply from the 2\" gal iron pipe connected to city mains.\n\nThese latter would certainly be of some protection and is additional to our present protection.\n\nSincerely,\n\nG. Keyling\n\n[Signature]\n\nM. Benson En\nOttawa.\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nIn connection with the alterations and additions which are now in progress at the Shingwauk Home, I beg to say that in the tenders received no provision was made for a water supply, to which particular attention was called in the report of the medical men appointed by the Board of Management of the Home to examine the sanitary condition of the premises, as the Principal was negotiating with the City water works with a view to obtaining an offer from them to connect the school with the city mains.\n\nOn the 9th inst., the Principal submitted an estimate furnished him by Mr. Sculland, who has the contract for the alterations and repairs to the buildings, to connect a private main with the city main, the total cost of which, including material, 7,500 ft. of 2\" galvanized iron piping, labour, excavating, laying the pipes, etc., and the necessary plumbing and connections inside the building, would amount to $1,750. A sketch plan showing the direction the proposed pipe line would follow accompanied Mr. King's letter. Mr. Sculland's idea was to connect with the eastern end of the city main with a 3\" pipe and carry the same at frost-proof depth submerged along the bottom of the St. Mary river to a point directly in front of the Shingwauk Home and then excavate and bring the pipe up to the buildings. To continue the main along the road would cost at least four times as much as to follow the proposed plan.\n\nTo-day Mr. King has sent me a letter addressed\nto him by Mr. L. H. Davis, Chief Engineer of the Tagona Light Co., of Sault Ste. Marie, in regard to this proposition, from which you will see that he considers the scheme entirely practicable and the cheapest method by which water could be obtained from the city mains. He says that the scheme presents no difficulties which an experienced and reputable contractor should not easily be able to overcome, and that a 2\" pipe should be able to supply about 30 imperial gallons per minute at a reasonably good domestic pressure at the school, an amount which would be ample for all ordinary uses.\n\nAs I before stated the water supply at the school is contaminated owing to the sewage and drainage from the buildings, which empties into a small bay or basin of the river in front of the school, and also by the town sewage entering the river at a higher level. Typhoid fever has been very prevalent in this school, caused by the use of this impure water, and the surest means of overcoming the difficulty would be to have connection with the city mains, which draw their supply from above the falls west of the city.\n\nThe only other alternative would be to sink wells, but it is questionable whether a sufficient supply of water could be obtained and there would be great uncertainty as to its quality, if found. In addition to this a pumping plant would be required to distribute the water throughout the buildings, and the expense would be fully equal to Mr. Soulland's estimate, and the results would be very doubtful.\n\nYou will see from Mr. King's letter, of the 25th inst., that, as to fire protection, they would still have\nthe two tanks in the roof of the main building, which have a capacity of 1,005 gallons and which can be filled by their present pumping plant at the river; and the 2\" pipe would furnish an auxiliary supply in case of need.\n\nThe annual rate for the amount of water they would draw from the city would be about $100 to $135, while the cost of pumping up the impure water last year was $129.06.\n\nIf you approve of this plan, the school would be assured of a pure and permanent supply of water, and money the amount of XXXXX the Department is prepared to spend on this school to put it in a thoroughly sanitary condition will admit of this proposition being carried out.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is, however, to be understood that the said interest shall be reduced by the amounts of the rates collected along the route as property owners from time to time may require to connect with the main for water.

The matter will then be considered finally by the Department and you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nMemo.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 10th August, 1906.\n\nThe Acting Deputy Sect. General,\n\nWith reference to the telegram hereunder and previous correspondence relating to the proposition to furnish city water to the Shingwauk Home, Sault Ste. Marie, I have to say that the scheme recommended by the Principal of the Home, and endorsed by the Chief Engineer of the Tagona Water & Light Company, and on which the Contractor now engaged at work at the Home has submitted an estimate of $1,750, as the total cost thereof, to lay a two inch galvanized iron pipe down and in the bed of the river from the present end of the said company's main to the Home, a total length of pipe of about 7,500 feet.\n\nThe friction through such a great length of pipe (7,500 feet) of only two inches in diameter would consist of a mere trickle of water. I have not been in the locality, but judging from the plan and from information, the pipe lying on the bed of the river runs the greatest risk of being displaced, made leaky or broken at any time by the anchors of boats. The anchor of a small yacht would drag a pipe of this size and make it temporarily useless, and all breakages and repairs will have to be made good and paid for by the Department.\n\nI beg to recommend for the favourable consideration of the Department that the Tagona Water & Light Company, which it appears serves the Town of Sault Ste. Marie, be asked to lay a main of suitable size along the highway in the usual manner to the Shingwauk Home, and that the Department will guarantee six per cent on the outlay, with the proviso that as water is supplied from time to time to property owners along the route, the said interest shall...\nshall be reduced by the amounts of the rates collected. Before any decisive action is taken, the Company should furnish an estimate of the cost of laying the said main.\n\nPlease see draft of letters hereunder to Mr. L.H. Davis, Chief Engineer, Tagona Water & Light Company, and to Mr. King.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nI should be glad to learn as soon as possible the Dept's decision regarding the system submitted for the provision of good coals for this Institution.\n\nGood coals is now the heart of the sanitary improvements being effected and an absolute necessity.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Dept's collector, Mr. J.R. \nSmeaton is about to close \nin his (unreadable) \nexcavation from the shore \nline to remain buried \na distance of some \ntwo hundred sixty-five \nyards and unless this \nexcavation can be utilized \nas in plans submitted \nthe work cannot be \ndone for future (unreadable) \nsubmitted \nthe necessity for feeling \nin the excavation is \nthe reason \nthat labour is now\navailable and for certain reasons may not be later.\n\nJemelton and Mr. Eugene Davis of the Social Works is still too ill to attend personally to business.

Marie, Ont., August 30th 1906.\n\nSUBJECT: re Water Supply for Shingwauk Home.\n\nI. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\u2014\n\nYour letter of the 10th inst in regard to water supply for the Shingwauk Home at this place, was duly received and I regret that through illness I have been obliged to delay replying to your letter until the present.\n\nIn reply to your proposition, namely, that this Company lay a main of suitable size along the highway from the end of its present main to the Shingwauk Home on the condition that the Indian Department guarantees 6% on the outlay, would say that the amount which you propose to guarantee, which I take to be a gross revenue of 6% on the cost of constructing the extension, would not be sufficient to warrant the Company in making the proposed extension, for the reason that when the expenses of operation and maintenance of pumping station and distributing system are taken into consideration, the Company would be operating the main to the Shingwauk Home at a very heavy loss under the condition you propose.\n\nThe mains which it would be necessary for us to lay in order to provide adequate fire protection in addition to domestic supply would be about 500 feet of 8\" pipe and about 5000 feet of 6\" pipe together with the requisite valves, hydrants and other...\nThe cost of construction would be approximately $7250.00, and the best proposition that we can make for laying such a main would be a guarantee from you of a gross revenue of $1000.00 per year. We would, of course, under such a guarantee from you, credit you with whatever charges were paid by other parties having services connected to this main, but when such charges equalled or more than made up the difference between our regular charges against the Department for water supply to the Shingwauk Home, the Department would pay the Company's regular charges for water.\n\nIf you desire to accept this proposition, you should, I think, be able to prevail upon the Town Council of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, to have placed one or two hydrants at the Shingwauk Home for which our rate to the Town is $50.00 a hydrant per year, and which would help to reduce your liability upon your guarantee. If the Town could be prevailed upon to take other hydrants along the main in anticipation of future requirements, it would make the situation still easier for you.\n\nIt is of course far preferable to lay a main of proper size in the street instead of laying a small pipe on the bed of the river, as in the former case you would obtain ample fire protection which should give you better insurance rates. There would also be less liability to interruption to the service and the expense of maintaining the pipe line as far as your service connection, would be undertaken by the Company instead of by you.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nTAGONA WATER & LIGHT COMPANY.\n\nBy [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 1)\nOttawa, September 1, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nRe water supply for Shingwauk Home.\n\nWhile the alterations and improvements at the Shingwauk Home are nearly completed, the introduction of a supply of pure water is still unprovided for. The only sure means of obtaining this supply is by connection with the water works system of Sault Ste. Marie, and as the amount of money available for this purpose is limited, we will have to make such connection as the funds at the Department's disposal will permit.\n\nAn offer was made by Mr. Souland to connect with the city main by means of a 2\" galvanized iron pipe for $1,750. Mr. Bray, who reported on this proposition, gave it as his opinion that 3,500 ft. of 2\" pipe would make the delivery consist of a mere trickle of water, and that the laying of a pipe on the bed of the river would run great risk of displacement by anchors of boats, and for that reason he recommended that the water works company be asked to lay a main of suitable size along the highway in the usual manner to the Shingwauk Home. Acting on Mr. Bray's suggestion, the chief engineer of the Tayona Water and Light Co. was asked whether they would extend their main to the Shingwauk Home on a guarantee of 6% on the outlay.\n\nA letter has just reached the Department from the chief engineer of this company, in which he states that the Department's offer would not be sufficient to warrant them in making the proposed extension. He estimates the cost of construction would be approximately $7,250, and that\nthe best proposition the Company could make for laying a main would be a guarantee from the Dept. of a gross revenue of $1,000 per year. The cost of this proposition kills it so far as the Dept. is concerned, as the total grant to this school is only $6,000, little more than half of which is ever earned by the school; therefore, the school could not pay $1,000 a year, and it would be establishing a bad precedent for the Dept. to guarantee any such sum.\n\nThe connection along the highway being impossible for the above reasons, there only remains the scheme to connect with the main by means of a pipe extended to the river and thence along the river bed to the front of the Shingwauk Home and from that point to the school by a trench below the frost line, which Mr. Sculland offers to do for $1,750, as before stated.\n\nIn order to satisfy myself as to the correctness of Mr. Bray's statement that a mere trickle of water would only be delivered at the school out of a 2\" pipe, I wrote to Mr. King, the Principal, on my own account to find out what power was at the back of the main. He informs me that the Sault water works system maintains a pressure of 95 pounds by direct pumping, and that the main it is proposed to tap is 8\" in diameter and that the pressure at that point is 95 pounds. I also asked him as to the danger of floating ice displacing the pipe, and he informs me that Mr. Davis, the water works engineer, is of opinion that there is no such danger. He says that there are no landing places along this particular shore line to induce vessels to come in and that the pipe would be carried to deep water below the ice formation. After writing Mr. King I went to the pump-house here and got the opinion of the engineer in charge as to the supply of water that a 2\" pipe should give and the danger of its being affected by frost or being displaced by moving ice or small boats. He told me that, while\na 3\" pipe would furnish a fair supply of water for drinking purposes, for an institution the size of the Shingwauk Home he would recommend that a 3\" pipe be substituted, so as to avoid any danger of shortage. With regard to the practicability of laying such a length of pipe, nearly 7000 ft., under water, I have the opinion of Mr. McKinley, the leading plumber of this city, who says that the scheme is quite feasible. The cost of a 2\" pipe, as quoted by Mr. Soulland, is 16 cents a foot, while the cost here is 15 cents. A 3\" pipe here costs 33 cents, which is a fraction over double the price of a 2\" pipe. The difference in price of installing a 3\" pipe and a 2\" pipe would be about $1,400. This would make the total cost of connection by means of a 3\" pipe come to about $6,200 at the outside, which is $4,050 less than the continuation of the main along the highway would cost. As regards the question of fire protection, the school would not be dependent on the city water works, as they have a pumping plant of their own at the mill on the river bank, which is already connected with the tanks in the building.\n\nIf funds can be furnished for laying a 3\" pipe along the river bed, as suggested by Mr. Soulland, I do not see that the Dept. could do better than adopt this plan.\nSept. 4, 1906.\n\nMemorandum\n\nfor Deputy Minister,\n\nThere is no doubt that we should connect with the water works system of Sault Ste Marie and install a three inch pipe. Referring to the last part of the scheme I beg to draw attention to the fact that my memorandum of the 8th of May, last, was written with the understanding that it would be possible for the management of the school to carry the cost of the changes and improvements until April, 1907. We should have an immediate estimate of what the three inch pipe would cost and an estimate to cover as well the whole of the proposed expenditure for the water supply. If this item will bring the proposed cost higher than was contemplated when I wrote on the 8th of May, we might find it necessary to have an appropriation in next year's estimate to help us out.\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nG. Loy King, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nThe Shingwauk Home,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nCorporation of the\nTown of Sault Ste. Marie\nTown Clerk's Office\n\nSault Ste. Marie, Oct. 18th, 1906\n\nGeo. Leg King Esq.,\nShingwauk Home,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find copy of a resolution passed by the Council of the Town of Sault Ste. Marie at a meeting held on the 17th Sept. 1906:\n\nMoved by P. J. Rowland.\nSeconded by J. Baringthwaite.\n\nThat permission be granted for the laying of a three inch water main to the Shingwauk Home\u2014the same to be subject to any orders of Council hereafter, and the Shingwauk Corporation to indemnify the Town against any damage in the laying of said main or the maintenance of same afterwards.\n\nCarried.\n\nC. J. Rim\nTown Clerk.\nSir:\n\nRe water supply for Shingwauk Home.\n\nI regret the necessity of reopening this question, but in view of a further proposition Mr. Sculland has just made to me I feel bound to do so.\n\nMr. Sculland now advocates bringing the 3 inch water pipe from the town mains along the main road entirely to the Shingwauk Home, and abandoning the river bed altogether. He anticipates, I believe, difficulties in cofferdamming and working in the water which the lateness of the season and weather generally are likely to entail, and realizing his responsibility would prefer, though more costly, to excavate along the main road entirely and thus permanently safeguard all risks.\n\nTo enable him to do this he asks the Department to allow him an additional $500. to assist in additional cost for excavation.\n\nI do not think the request unreasonable and would strongly urge a favorable consideration.\n\nAnticipating the Department's acceptance of this latter proposition I immediately sought the consent of the Sault Ste Marie Town council to the laying of the pipe along the main road. The corporation's assent is embodied in the attached memorandum. The work of laying the pipe at frost proof depth not less than five feet would be subject to the town engineer's inspection and approval. As time means much just now may I ask the Department to wire me its decision.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDep't Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 1)\nSagana Water and Light Company,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont., Sept. 12th, 1906\n\nRe: Water Supply\nfor Shingwauk Home.\n\nG. L. King, Esq.,\nPrincipal, Shingwauk Home,\nSault Ste Marie, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to the question of the amount of water which your three inch pipe will have the capacity of delivering to you at the Shingwauk Home, which you were inquiring about yesterday, would say that the three inch pipe should be able to deliver to you about fifty to fifty-five Imperial gallons per minute at an effective pressure of about forty pounds per square inch at the ground level at the Shingwauk Home. This amount in my judgement should be ample to supply all your needs for domestic purposes.\n\nI also send you under separate cover a blue print of the East end of the town, as requested by you orally yesterday.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nL. H. Davis,\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, September 20, 1906.\n\nThe Acting Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nOn September 6th, a tender, by wire, was received from Mr. J. T. Sculland, of Sault Ste. Marie, through the Principal of the Shingwauk Home, offering to connect the Sault Ste. Marie water mains with the Shingwauk Home by means of a three inch pipe, to be laid along the river bed, for the sum of $3,025, including material, labour, plumbing, etc. On the 7th inst., this offer was accepted on certain conditions, embodied in a letter of that date, the acceptance of which terms and conditions was to be made in writing by Mr. Sculland.\n\nThere is nothing on file to show that Mr. Sculland accepted the contract on the terms mentioned, but on the 11th inst., Mr. King advised the Department that he would forward Mr. Sculland's written agreement, as well as a certificate as to the sufficiency of water that would be conveyed by a three inch pipe.\n\nMaterial was purchased and the work started, and Mr. King, in a letter dated the 11th inst., asked for an advance of $600 on account of the contract, which was granted.\n\nA letter has been received today from Mr. King, stating that Mr. Sculland now advocates bringing the pipe from the town mains along the main road and abandoning the river bed altogether, owing to trouble he anticipates in cofferdamming and working in the water on account of the lateness of the season. He offers to lay the pipe at frost-proof depth, not less than five feet, subject to the inspection and approval of the town engineer, along the highway to the Home for an additional $200, or $3,225 in all, and the\npermission of the town council to lay the pipe along the road has been obtained.\n\nIn the early part of the negotiations the Chief Engineer of the Tagona Water and Light Co. submitted an estimate of the cost of extending the city main to the Home by the road, which amounted to $7,250. This was, however, for 500 ft. of 6\" pipe and 8000 ft. of 6\" pipe, together with necessary valves, hydrants and fittings to supply sufficient water for domestic purposes and also for adequate fire-protection. The best proposition they could make for laying this main was a guarantee from the Department of a gross revenue of $1,000 per annum, to which the Department could not consent.\n\nIn comparison with the above Mr. Scullands offer appears to be remarkably fair, and it is for the Department to decide whether it shall be accepted or not.\n\nA.J. MacKenzie\nWith reference to the letter from Mr. King of the 18th instant, and the water supply for the Shingwauk, I beg to state that the Department is apparently committed to have a pipe-line laid from the town of Sainte-Marie by Mr. J.T. Soulliere at the cost of $3,000. The said pipe-line to be laid in the river. The contractor now finds that the difficulty of coffer-damming is very great. I may say that the expense of coffer-damming from the shore to a depth of five feet of water in any locality where the bed of the river recedes gradually is very great.\n\nOn the part of the Department, I beg to state, as in a previous memorandum, that the laying of the pipe in the bed of the river is very objectionable, as it liable to disturbance at any time. The laying of a pipe on land is incomparably preferable. As the contractor asks the trifling extra sum of $200, I think the Department should agree to pay the extra sum of $200, without hesitation.\n\nI desire to place on record, although too late for action, that I think the whole of this business has been pushed forward without proper investigation. It appears from the correspondence and memoranda that it is held that there is no other way of furnishing pure water to the Home but by connecting with the Water Works system of the Town. I do not know the locality, but it appears to me that inquiry should have been made as to whether there is any other source of supply, especially in the direction of a good well properly protected, or an artesian...\nwell, either of which could be sunk and fitted with a wind-\nor hot-air engine\nmill for possibly about one-third of the cost of bringing\nwater from the town.\n\nThe contract and the specifications are not\non file, I think Mr. King should be asked to forward them.\n\nChief Surveyor.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, 23rd September, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to confirm telegram of even date with reference to the water supply for the Shingwauk Home.\n\nIt has been thought advisable to agree to the additional expenditure of $800.00 and to abandon the original intention of bringing the pipe under water. It is, of course, necessary that the correspondence should show a complete contract and I must, therefore, place upon you the responsibility of having Mr. Sculland accept in such terms as will bind him to install a thoroughly satisfactory water system.\n\nDepartmental letter of the 7th instant gave the conditions on which the Department accepted Mr. Sculland's offer and these should only be varied to the extent of providing for the land connection and the addition to the cost of $800.00.\n\nMr. Sculland's acceptance should, of course, be obtained at once and before the work is allowed to proceed.\n\nJ.

Marie, Ont.\n\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, May 1, 1911\n\nMemorandum\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nI beg to inform you that as instructed by your official letter, dated December 5, last, I made an inspection of Shingwauk and Wawanoosh Homes, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., on March 6, last, and to report as follows:\n\nThe school, a stone building of good architectural design, thoroughly English in type, erected on the north side of the main street of the city with a pleasing suburban view of the river and landscape and surrounded by well kept grounds of considerable extent, is in appearance, at least, an ideal home school. That it is so, is apparent, as the principal and his family are making the personal welfare of each pupil their especial interest, and, I firmly believe, that under the direction of the Rev. Principal that this school is again destined to achieve good results.\n\nThe building, from the exterior, is almost unique in its rustic beauty, being erected of native field or boulder stone, hammer dressed, roughly and flushed up with lime mortar to even face.\n\nThe main building, 36' by 134', with extension on either end, the left being 25' by 35' and Principal's residence on the right, 27' by 40' and also extension at rear, 26' by 36', contains on ground floor\u2014entrance hall, dining-room, pupils and staff, kitchen for pupils and staff, recreation room, each for boys and girls, lavatories, each for boys and girls, staff laboratory, shoemaker's shop, office, clothing room, corridor and three boiler rooms as well as Principal's residence. On first floor are\u2014the school rooms Nos. 1 and 2 boys and girls recrea-\ntion-rooms, sewing-rooms staff sitting-room 7 bedrooms, clothing-room and Principal's residence.\n\nThe upper floor contains 3 dormitories for girls, 4 for boys, 2 clothing rooms and 2 bed or monitor's rooms, adjoining boys' and girls' dormitories.\n\nInterior arrangement\u2014\n\nThe arrangement of the interior, while roomy and probably convenient, is not of modern school type and appears to have been erected in sections, more care having been exercised in the preserving of the outside architectural appearance than in producing an ideal interior for the purpose for which it is used. For this reason considerable floor space is not fully utilized. The ceiling also being low requires a considerable excess of wall and floor space to provide the required cubical air area. This in connection with the irregular exterior providing an unduly large proportion of wall space and floor surface over cubical area makes the building an expensive one to heat and ventilate satisfactorily.\n\nClass-rooms\u2014\n\nThe class-rooms are 33' by 38' by 9\u00bd' and has a floor area of 1254 and a cubical area of 12226, accommodates on floor 72 pupils; but air space for 50 only. A smaller class-room, boys, 23' by 34' by 9\u00bd' has a floor area 7827 and a cubical area of 7627 accommodates on floor 48 and air space for 30'.\n\nThe outside school class-room has a floor space available 29' by 56' with floor area and air space to accommodate 90-95 pupils.\n\nDormitories, Girls\u2014\n\nGirls' dormitories No. 1, has a floor space 31'6\" by 18'9\" by 9'9\" equals air space for 11 pupils.\n\nNo. 2, has a floor area of 662\u00bd sq. ft. and cu. area of 8400 accommodation for 17 pupils.\n\nNo. 3, has a floor space of 14' by 22', has a cubical area of 2028 ft. accommodates 4 pupils or a total of 32 girls.\nBoys dormitories-\n\nBoys dormitories are 4 in number, the first being 51' by 21' by 9'3\", contains 9907 cu. ft., equals accommodation for 20.\n\nNo. 2, 19\u00bd' by 22' by 9'3\" has a cubical area of 3968 ft. accommodation for 8 pupils.\n\nNo. 3, 18' by 21\u00bd' has a cubical area of 3580, equals accommodation for 7 pupils.\n\nNo. 4, 12' by 27' has a cubical area of 2897 and will accommodate 6 pupils or a total dormitory accommodation (boys and girls) for 73 pupils.\n\nAll of the dormitories are fairly well lighted and airy and owing to the low ceilings have a floor and wall space greatly in excess of actual requirements.\n\nRecreation rooms-\n\nThe girls' recreation room on ground floor 22' by 22' is well lighted, airy and convenient and has lavatory adjoining. In addition the girls have a sewing room on floor above which is used for recreation purposes and is also conveniently situated, airy and well lighted.\n\nThe boys' recreation room on ground floor 23' by 27' is in the north east corner of the building, and while convenient is not as well lighted as the girls'. The large hall (separate building) 60' by 30' however, is both well lighted, airy and fitted up as a gymnasium, some of the boys being very proficient in these exercises and all thoroughly enjoy their recreation there.\n\nLavatories-\n\nThe lavatory for girls 9' by 22' adjoins girls' recreation room, has 4 W.C.'s and basins.\n\nBoys lavatory 12' by 22' adjoins boys' recreation room, has 4 W.C.'s and trough type urinal, 5 basins and boiler for heating hot water for bathing purposes.\n\nPrivate lavatory-\n\nThere is also a lavatory for staff as well as a private bathroom in residence of Principal.\nSick room-\n\nThere is no sick or infirmary room in the school, other than private bedrooms, which are used for temporary illness.\n\nHospital-\n\nThere is an isolation hospital within a short distance of the school on opposite side of street, containing 4 rooms, with attendants' residence attached. There are no sanitary fixtures installed.\n\nDrains-\n\nThe drainage system is sanitary and apparently in good condition.\n\nVentilation-\n\nThe building is ventilated by overhead or ceiling ventilation, these can be cut off from ceiling, carried down on face of walls to floors and will partly ventilate rooms where located. Additional ventilation will be required for class-rooms and dormitories to enable the building to fully comply with Department's requirements.\n\nHeating-\n\nThe building is heated by hot water system three hot water boilers being located in separate positions in the building; and those while answering their purpose are not as effective for heating purposes as they would have been, if differently installed. The most effective system of heating for an irregular building, of this extent, is undoubtedly low pressure steam.\n\nBedrooms-\n\nThere are 4 staff bedrooms (excluding Principal's residence) on first floor in addition to a large staff sitting room on first flat and 2 monitor's bedrooms on dormitory flat, all being of good size, airy and well lighted.\n\nClothes room-\n\nThere are 2 clothes rooms for the storing of wardrobes, etc.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\none each for boys and girls with other rooms available should more room be required at any time.\n\nPrincipal's residence\u2014\n\nThe Principal's residence is attached to and partly surrounds one corner of the school building, contains on first floor, hall, parlour, dining-room, kitchens, three bedrooms, bath-room, corridor and shed; and on ground floor, Principal's office, store-room, boiler-room, coal-room, shed and passage.\n\nGeneral\u2014\n\nAll of the buildings enumerated herein are substantial and in fairly good condition some minor repairs being necessary, only such, however, as are usually looked for in any building which has been in constant use for a prolonged period.\n\nIt will be necessary to install a good system of ventilation in the building, particularly in the dormitories and classrooms as owing to the building being erected of stone, with thick walls and wide reveals, less sunlight is diffused in the interior; and also owing to the stone walls, especially in the very warm weather, condensation is rapid and general throughout the building, except where fires are constantly kept going.\n\nIt will also be necessary to install 3 shower baths, each for boys and girls, in their bathrooms and seven basins for boys' and five for girls' lavatories to fully complete their sanitary equipment. In every other way the school will comply with Department's requirements.\n\nRecommendation\u2014\n\nI would recommend that providing six shower baths and twelve basins are installed and a system of ventilation put in dormitories, class-rooms, etc., and isolation hospital put in good condition and sanitary conveniences installed, so as to fully comply with Department's requirements, that the building be ranked as in the first class.\n\nArchitect.\nSpecification of sanitary fixtures and ventilation for the Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes, Sault Ste.

Generally commending the school and the work done there; but states that the building, while substantial, is not of a modern school type having apparently been erected in sections, with very low ceilings, thus wasting floor space and making the school a difficult one to heat and ventilate satisfactorily.\n\nIt is noted that while the building is sufficiently roomy and provides ample accommodation for 73 pupils and staff, in addition to a convenient Principal's residence, that the arrangement of rooms is not as advantageous for boarding school purposes as the Department advises for the newer schools. However, as this is principally a matter of convenience for those in authority there and as a rearrangement of rooms cannot readily be made, without a very considerable expenditure, the building must suffice as at present arranged.\n\nIt is also stated that the sanitary arrangements and ventilation are deficient and that it will be necessary\n\nRev. H. P. Fuller, Esq.,\nPrincipal, Algoma Indian Homes,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOntario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 2)\nto install additional washing and bathing facilities for the pupils in the school and hospital building and it is suggested that the installation of three shower baths, each for boys and girls, also seven lavatory basins for boys and five for girls be put in the school building and that one bath, one sink and two lavatory basins and one W.C. be installed in isolation hospital to complete the sanitary equipment necessary to comply with the Department's regulations.\n\nThe ventilating system will require considerable changes, the ceiling ventilation now in to be cut off at wall line of ceiling and carried down to floor line of class-room and dining-room as marked on plan accompanying this letter; also to provide three additional ventilating ducts for the principal class-room and dormitory with ventilating tops, the size and capacity of which will be determined when Mr. Ogilvie again visits the school which will probably be within a few days after the receipt of this letter when additional specifications, scale drawings and written directions will be given for the carrying out of the work necessary to enable the school to rank in the first class.\n\nPlans and specifications in duplicate for the work noted herein are being sent you under separate cover by concurrent mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nW. Selkirk Man, July 8, 1911\n\nSecretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs Ottawa.\n\nSir\n\nI beg to inform you that on Wednesday June the 20th last I made an inspection of the Algoma Indian Schools at Sault St Marie and prepared plans for the ventilation of the school handing copies of the same to the Principal Rev. Mr Fuller.\n\nThe specification previously prepared for the work and sent together with the plans before leaving Ottawa were sufficiently definite for the carrying out of the work without additions thereto for the school buildings, I am of the opinion however that dry earth commodes will be more satisfactory for the Isolation Hospital as this building is seldom used and being some distance away from the main building and on the opposite side of the street and heated with stoves only when required for use it will be impossible to keep a sanitary water closet in condition I have therefore instructed the Principal that providing that in all other ways the specifications are fully complied with that the Department will in this instance authorize the using Sanitary Commodes in the Isolation Hospital. I have also instructed the Principal that you will officially confirm these instructions from Headquarters.\n\nYours etc,\n\nArchitect\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nMr. Ogilvie, who again inspected your school last month, reports that dry earth commodes would be more satisfactory for the Isolation Hospital in connection with the Shingwauk Home than a sanitary water closet and states that he has authorized you to use commodes there.\n\nThe Department approves of Mr. Ogilvie's recommendation and you will be good enough to see that his suggestions are carried out when the alterations called for in official letter of the 10th ultimo are being made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

And as a matter of fact they are all made excepting only a slight change in the washing basin in which the plumbers are delayed. There has been no disposition to put off this work what I referred to in my former letters was the time required to collect the money to pay for it.\n\nWe are honestly and loyally living up to our agreement.

This work too would have been completed but for the fact that we have to re-shingle the roof, and as this is a large building it has taken some time to prepare. We now have the shingles and only remains to lay them on. The ventilation is changed from the ceilings to floors and the outlet is as yet out through the bell tower. The specifications say that this must be changed too and the outlet made through small separate towers or caps.

It is considered that these should be provided and I have to ask you to be good enough to make this provision as soon as you possibly can. In the meantime also fire drill should be given regularly to the pupils.\n\nA blackboard and an easel are being ordered for use in the class-room.\n\nIn connection with the class-room work it is considered that Mrs. Thomas, whose work is reported to be satisfactory, factory, has more pupils than she can reasonably be expected to give proper attention to. It is, hoped, however, that you\n\nRev. B. P. Fuller,\nPrincipal,\nThe Shingwauk Home,\nSault Ste.

The Home at present has about one hundred inmates; the present washing facilities are old and inadequate; the barn accommodation needs to be thoroughly renovated and made clean and sanitary, as all the milk for the children comes from these buildings, and it is needless to emphasize the necessity of keeping the premises clean and sanitary.

MARIE.\n\nI proceeded to Sault Ste. Marie on the 29th ultimo, and on Wednesday the 30th ultimo, Mr. McNabb and I visited Garden River Reserve and the Chingwauk Home. While at the Garden River Reserve we visited Mr. Hardyman at the Protestant school, and I wish to draw attention to the needs at this school. Their supply of water is not satisfactory, and a new well should be sunk outside of the building, the present one being in the basement. This simply involves the driving of a pipe and water will presumably be found at no great depth. A new pump should also be provided.\n\nThe school building is in need of painting and the interior of the building should be halosanized. A hard-wood floor should also be laid in the class-room.\nThe surrounding grounds are, as usual, in excellent condition and a splendid object lesson for the Indians. Mr. Hardyman has quite a large lawn, and I think he should be furnished with a lawn mower, and I would recommend that the Agent be authorized to purchase one for him and to have the work above mentioned done.\n\nI visited nearly all the locations on the reserve to see the farming operations which the Agent has been conducting this summer on a somewhat large scale. In connection with each house there is a garden plot planted and some of the Indians have a considerable area in crop. Mr. McNabb is very enthusiastic about this work, and if they should be fortunate enough to obtain good results this year, I am sure that he will have very little difficulty in increasing the scope of the work another season. The surveyors were at work subdividing the eastern portion of the reserve which the Agent hopes will be located for farming purposes by a number of the younger people of the band.\n\nAt the Shingwauk Home I found that the lighting system had been installed and was working\nsatisfactorily. They were at work on the addition, which is to be used as a laundry. The walls which were of masonry work were very nearly completed. They hope to have the building ready for occupation early in August. The laundry machinery is on hand.\n\nWith regard to the lighting system, the estimated cost was $540.00, but Mr. Fuller purchased some of the fixtures, etc., from a merchant in the Soo, who was retiring from business and in calling for prices had his quotations made subject to the use of this material, by so doing he made a considerable reduction in the cost, which was only $331.00, an approximate saving of $209.00. Mr. Fuller asks that he be allowed to spend a sum not exceeding this amount in the purchase of a motor for use in the laundry. They had contemplated using their gasoline engine, and of course the motor would be a great convenience to them.\n\nIn view of the excellent work that Mr. Fuller is doing at this institution, I think the Department would be justified in allowing him to make this purchase, and I would recommend it. There is quite an improvement on the buildings, surrounding grounds and the farm since I last was\nat the institution, and considering the difficulties with which Mr. Fuller has had to contend ever since taking charge of this institution, I think he is to be highly commended.\n\nA.F. MacGregor\nOttawa, August 4, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. MacKenzie of this Department, who visited your school last month, reports that in connection with the installation of the lighting system you effected an approximate saving of $209.00 out of the appropriation of $540.00 which was made for that purpose and he recommends that you be allowed to expend a sum not exceeding the amount saved in the purchase of a motor for use in the laundry.\n\nIn view of the satisfactory report made by Mr. MacKenzie, the Department will allow you to expend a sum not exceeding $209.00 in the purchase of a motor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I visited most of the agencies from here to Sault Ste. Marie, but as travelling accommodations and the heat were getting more than were agreeable I discontinued my journey to Kenora and Fort William. However, your agents used me right royally and any request I made was complied with and carried out. They visited the agencies with me.\n\nWhen I was in Sault Ste. Marie I visited the Rev. Mr. Fuller and his school and I would strongly recommended that the Government aid him in procuring screens for the windows as the ventilation, not only in the school room but the dormitories, is not what it should be and the matron informed me that she was afraid to open the windows as the children might fall out and injure themselves.

Marie. This building is not the property of the Department and we are not at all responsible for its upkeep. The Church of England owns this school building, and should attend to matters such as you mention. In view of all the circumstances, I would be disposed to give Mr. Fuller some assistance to enable him to put on these screens which are very necessary.\n\nI shall communicate with Mr. Fuller.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

We shall pay for the wire and lumber necessary, if you will undertake to make the screens for these windows.\n\nI was surprised to learn that the windows were being kept shut, especially in the dormitories and class-rooms during the summer season.

The first of these is, the building contains a Tablet which states that the building was erected in memory of \"Chief Shingwask\".\n\nThe second is that in view of the fact that we are to organize Boy Scouts and Cadets, the upper floor would be very useful and would be a fine room for any entertainment when we would have visitors.\n\nWith this suggestion, I have made a careful and close estimate of the material and cost of same and attached please find same.\n\nAll of which is humbly submitted,\nYours truly,\n\"Benj.

Canon Gould, the General Secretary of our Society, and I visited the Shingwauk House at Sault Ste. Marie last April, we found the Drill Hall which stands on the School grounds rapidly going to ruin on account of the old and weather-worn condition of the roof. It was obvious to both of us at the time that a building so valuable to the School, in many ways, could be thoroughly renovated at a moderate expenditure, and requested the Principal to furnish me with an estimate of the cost. I enclose a copy of the statements he has forwarded to me in this connection and pray you to give the same your earliest and most sympathetic consideration. With regard to the amount fixed by the Principal, my own opinion is that it is not sufficient and that at least $500 will be required, as our staff will be quite unable to do all the work without the assistance of some additional labour.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Mr. Fuller, the Principal, is being informed that he may arrange to have the repairs required made to this building, and that the total cost of the material and labour must not exceed approximately $450.00. The Principal's estimate of the material required is $335.65, and the sum granted for the carrying out of these repairs will allow for the payment of a reasonable amount of labour in having the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The estimate made by you as to the cost of the material required has also been received.\n\nYou are hereby authorized to have the repairs required to this building carried out, and the total cost of the material and labour required should not exceed approximately $450.00.\n\nIt will be necessary, in the purchase of all material, to obtain competitive prices from a number of firms handling the material required, and the purchase should, in each case, be made from the firm quoting you the lowest price.\n\nProperly certified accounts, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost of the material, to which should be attached a memorandum showing the names of the firms asked to quote a price and the prices quoted.\n\nAn account of the labour employed should also be kept. If the men are paid by the hour, the number of hours each is employed should be kept, or, if they are paid by the day, the number of days should be kept. These time sheets should be forwarded, in duplicate, properly certified, to the Department.\n\nIt is noted that you state in your communication to Dr. Westgate that the staff and pupils will do the greater part of the work.\n\nThis work should be undertaken and completed as soon as it is possible for you to arrange to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

I inform the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, steers. We have managed the school very well, but in reply the Secretary informed me that I should refer this matter to you and ask the Indian Department to settle the account.\n\nHe also states that the Department had never refused to pay any such claim when at all reasonable.\n\nWe have never made a practice of asking the Department to pay Bills of this nature and so did not ask in this case. But the Missionary Society seems to be sure that the Department will pay it.\n\nWe get no per capita now, it goes direct to the Society, so we do as they direct.\n\nThanking you\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

The Deputy Superintendent General agreed that the balance of the sum of $1,000.00 appropriated for repairs to this Institution, and not already assigned for the repairs of the Drill Hall, might be used for the provision of one or both of the above needs, as the Commission of the M.S.C.C. may determine.

I respectfully ask for your authority to pay the account.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nShingwauk Home,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario,\nJanuary 13th, 1923.\n\nTo The Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI count it a privilege to write you at the suggestion of our Indian Agent, Mr. A. D. McNabb, regarding what seems to be, and was to a degree a mistake on my part in regard to the improvements and repairs at the Shingwauk Home.\n\nAll through our term of office, thirteen years, we have felt the great need of toilets connected with the dormitories located on the third story of the main building. These in use were all on the ground floor, and in case of sickness, or when we had, as is always the case, pupils who required watching in regard to the condition of their beds, it was no small responsibility lacking the necessary conveniences in or near the dormitory.\n\nWhen in 1910 or 1911, the Department required sanitary improvement in the matter of bath tubs and wash basins, the work was paid for from the Per. Cap. and we could not possibly afford the extra toilets then. We were beginning to feel the strain of the work when war time and high prices began to effect, and the matter of improvements and even repairs had to be dismissed for the time.\n\nThen came the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, and in them we saw a possible chance to get the really necessary repairs made, and the improvements installed. Again the Society informed us in a letter dated Winnipeg, Sept. 27th, signed Dr. T. B. R. Westgate Field Secretary for the M.S.C.C., that one thousand dollars ($1000.00) was...\nappropriated by the Indian Department; four hundred and fifty dollars to be spent in repairs to the building called the Drill Hall, and the balance five hundred and fifty, to be expended in either one or both of the urgent needs explained by the Principal, i.e., installation of toilets and repairs to furnace.\n\nWe then began and went as far as possible with the repairs to the Hall. Then the installation of the toilets, and then the repairs to the furnace. This furnace has never been in use since we have been in charge. First\u2014Because by some accident the system became filled with water when not in use and froze so badly we could not think of repairs. Second\u2014We, for several years, procured our own fuel by cutting wood, and as the part of damaged system used to heat the Principal's residence we could by installing small stoves do without the heat from this third furnace, thus delaying the cost of repairs and saving on fuel. Then when we were informed that the Department would be willing to assist us and $1000.00 set apart for that purpose we began the repairs, doing all we could to help in the unskilled work, opening drains and sewers etc.\n\nBut there being no possible means of obtaining an estimate of the extent of breaks in pipes we were forced to proceed and to repair and test until we obtained a complete repair. I have to confess we were in a very anxious condition of mind as to the cost considering the uncertain manner in which we had to do the work and I went to explain to our Indian Agent, also expressing my willingness to have the overdraft in the cost of repairs deducted from my salary, if the Department would settle the account.\n\nI wish to express my lasting gratitude to the Indian Department, and to the kind consideration of Mr. McNabb for the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 2)\nthe comfort we enjoy both myself personally and also for the pupils.\n\nObediently Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo the\n\nSuperintendent General\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nJanuary 15th, 1923\n\nInclosed please find a letter from Rev B. P. Fuller, Principal of the Shingwauk Industrial School, explaining about the extra expenditure in connection with the Plumbing and the heating a/c of Dunseath & Mc Clarey.\n\nThose improvements were well underway at the time I received Circular 1-1-5 dated Oct 20th, 1922, as soon as I received the same I got in communication with Mr Fuller and I went down and inspected the work and I found that the work performed was necessary and useful. Mr Fuller explained to me and showed me where they had to put in new pipes and parts of Furnace, and I saw a number of broken Radiators which were broken by the Frost, I am personally satisfied that the Firm gave good value for the amount of their account.\n\nHoping that our explanation is necessary so that Mr Fuller will not have to make good out of his small Salary,\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.

I am convinced, however, that the work was urgently needed at the Shingwauk Home, and the permission of the Superintendent General was secured to pay the account. A cheque was directed to Messrs. Dunseath & McClarey on the 18th instant.\n\nI wish to assure you that this Department will do everything in its power to assist you and other school principals in the work; but it is extremely desirable that expenditure be undertaken only after authority has been given.

We have also visited the interior arrangement and facilities and have the opinion however that the vacant land near the Gaol, property on the west and cultivated by the prisoners as a garden, should be enclosed and the whole property suitably fenced. We recommend the erection of a separate building for the use of the Gaol, to house temporarily the prisoners and be provided as soon as possible.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Everything here was found clean and sanitary and reflected great credit on the capable management of this useful Institution. The third flat should be at once completed and equipped and all the floors should be oiled and an elevator installed.\n\nAt the Children's Shelter Home everything was also found in excellent condition, reflecting the utmost credit on Mr. and Mrs. Cornell who were in charge, the discipline and care of the helpless children finding a temporary home there, leaving nothing to be desired.\n\nThe Algoma Home for Indian Children commonly known as the Shingwauk Home contained eighty two children of both sexes. Considering the length of time since this building was erected, everything was found in good shape but there should be a new roof to the main building and numerous minor interior repairs thereto to place same in the best condition for the purposes for which it was erected. The barn is in poor condition and should be raised and placed on a new foundation and have cement floors constructed, a new roof and proper inside equipment installed, as these matters have a great influence on the boys attending this Institution. We cannot too highly praise the work of Rev. Mr. Fuller, the able Superintendent of this Home.\n\nAt the Plummer Memorial Hospital there were fifteen patients all of whom were receiving the best attention possible, the equipment here being very modern in every respect.\n\nAt the General Hospital there were thirty patients and every detail here was found to be in excellent shape and up to date. We found there an Indian Child two years of age which was sub-normal and born out of wedlock and has since birth remained at the Hospital but should be sent to the Sick Children's Hospital at Toronto for proper treatment.\nWe desire to congratulate the District on the very complete accommodation provided by the Province in the New Court House in respect to which we can suggest no improvement.\n\nIn conclusion we desire to thank Your Honour for the very instructive address given us in connection with our duties as Grand Jurors, and the various Court Officials for their assistance to us in respect to the various matters with which we have had to deal.\n\nSigned on behalf of the members of the Grand Jury\n\n\"G.H.

Principal have drawn his attention to certain repairs and replacements to buildings, that should be undertaken without delay. 28,000 shingles are required for the roof of the main building; 65 bbls. of cement are required to replace the old wooden floor in the barn; a metal sheeted roof is also needed for the barn. Our officer made an arrangement with the Rev. Principal that, if the materials were supplied and two carpenters were employed, the school staff and larger boys would give their help and that gravel, stone and rough lumber would be supplied by the school.\n\nThe cost of the materials and the wages for two carpenters would be in the neighborhood of $950. I should be pleased to have your authority to authorize the repairs. This school has received very little assistance from Parliamentary Appropriation, other than the per capita grant.

Try to make it as comfortable as possible and with as little expense as actually necessary.\n\nIf you think we could put in the simple fixtures for a bathroom, and a little sink in the kitchen, a new top floor in the kitchen, we, with the help the farmer can give, will fit the house to quite satisfy them for the present.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind about the fact that we ought to do it for them, and if the management was the same as in the past, I would go at it and do it, but we cannot do that under the present system.\n\nThere is also the fact to be considered, that Mr. Hayes is now an experienced help to us, understands the detail of the school, and also the members of the staff, all of which goes to make an efficient worker.\n\nWe have finished all the re-roofing, and more than we laid out to do, this we were able to do, by having some shingles left over, and by carefully taking off the old shingles, and using them in another place. We still have the barn floor to do, and as soon as the man McNabb is ready and we can haul the gravel and sand, we start at that.\n\nPlease advise me regarding the house repairs. How to proceed.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

Competitive prices should be obtained and the purchase of these supplies made from the firm quoting the lowest price. It is not intended that any undue expenditure be incurred, as only the most simple fittings should be supplied. If the school authorities are not able to do the work of installing these fixtures, you may engage the services of a competent plumber for the purpose, at the prevailing rate of wages.\n\nA new top floor is needed in the kitchen. You may purchase and have delivered at the school the necessary material for the purpose. The work of laying the floor is to be carried out by the farmer, with the assistance of the older pupils.\n\nPlease forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the fixtures for the bathroom and kitchen, as well as for the labour and material for the top floor in the kitchen. These purchases should receive your early attention and the work completed as soon as possible, so that this house may be placed in a comfortable condition for the farmer and his wife.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Marie for Labor & Material for Farmers House Shingwauk.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 13-0-5 dated October 6th, 1923.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inclose this letter explaining the Account from Dunseath & Mc Clary. You will notice that I deducted $16.00 from the A/c rendered by them, my reason for doing so is as follows. When I received your letter No 13-0-5 Dated Oct 6th/23 I went down to the Shingwauk to consult with Mr Fuller and I saw Dunseath & Mc Clary's men at work at the Farmers House, I asked Mr Fuller if he had started those men and he told me he had not, but that he had been talking to Mr Dunseath about the work and when he saw them at work he thought I had started them. They had some material on the ground and I told Mr Fuller to stop them as I had to have competitive prices on the material. I tried several plumbers to get them to do the work, they were too busy so I asked Dunseath what he would charge me per hour for Eddie Pim and he said he would give me Pim but that he must have a helper. He agreed for 90\u00a2 per hour for Pim and 50\u00a2 per hour for Helper. I could not do any better so I told him to go ahead. Dunseath claims that it was one Dollar per hour for Pim. As I made no written agreement with him considering his word as good as mine I am allowing him what he says.\n\nYou will notice in the Account where I marked with a Cross that those amounts are for the 3rd man Mr Dunseath himself, it seems he drove the men to work every morning and went after them at night. I made no arrangement that the Department would have to pay for their transportation. I called up Mr Dunseath and told him we would have to take off his wages as only 2 men were hired. No doubt he will write you in reference to this matter, and those are the facts as above stated.\n\nThis Firm have done a lot of work at the Shingwauk and there was no check on them whether the a/c was right or wrong and I suppose they thought it was still the same.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It really seems a lot\nfor them to both pay the (per cap) and then pay all our repair bills\nwe ourselves have not become accustomed to the new order of things,\nand we would assure the Dept that the very best care will be\nexercised to keep in good repair the improvements that they have\nmade\n\nYours thankfully.\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOffice of the Sault Ste.

M. Nicholson's account for labor at the Shingwauk Home.\n\nWhen Mr. Ferrier was here he made arrangements with Mr. Mc Nabb, a carpenter to do the work. Mc Nabb was away at Blind River at the time we wanted to cement the Barn. I tried several masons to get them to do the job, they were all too busy. I got this man Nicholson to do the work; his price was just the same as was to be paid to Mc Nabb & helper. This man is a practical man at laying cement he used his own tools and he made a first class job as Mr. Fuller can verify. He worked 8 hours per day when in the City @ $1.25 per hour and he asked that price from me. I explained the situation to him and told him we expected 10 hours per day, and that I would allow him what Mc Nabb was getting $1.00 per hour for himself and 70\u00a2 for his assistant. That arrangement was the very best I could do and Mr. Fuller was well satisfied with the work done. I have done my best to get all work entrusted to me done as cheaply and economically as I possibly could.\n\nHoping this explanation is satisfactory and that you will send Mr. Nicholson his Cheque as soon as possible, as I told him he would get his Cheque within 10 days after he got through with the work.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

Marie, Ont.\n\nTo Mr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nFor some time we have known that our Fire Hose was of very little use, having been here for years, and while we exercise the utmost care in avoiding fires, still we can never feel safe with the hose we have. Fires have occurred, which by quick action have always been controlled.\n\nI am enclosing a sample of the hose now in use, the sample will be more accurate than the measurement that we could send. We require three pieces, each 30 feet in length, and with no fittings, as we have the unions and the nozzles.\n\nAll the fires that we have had occurred from sparks falling on to the roof from the chimneys, and thirty feet length enables us to reach such places where these may occur.\n\nMay we ask for our general guidance, what repairs, and improvements The Dept. are prepared to give to our School, when done in proper order, and at the proper time. We have now an account for plumbing that was necessary to have done at once, and our Society Commission say that we should try to get the Dept to pay it. The idea of trying to get them to pay it does not appeal to us. We would rather know the attitude as a rule in this matter. No matter how careful we may be there is always some unseen thing that may happen. We shall be thankful for a consideration of the matters referred to in this letter.\n\nObediently Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, requesting that 90' of fire hose be supplied for the use of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are requesting Mr. Agent McNabb, Sault Ste. Marie, to obtain prices from a number of dealers for 3 pieces of fire hose, each 30' in length, of the dimensions required, and of a good quality. The Agent has been requested to submit the prices which he receives for the consideration of the Department. Please give Mr. McNabb full particulars as to the fire hose required. The sample of the hose now in use at the school which you forwarded has been received.\n\nRegarding the plumbing which you state it was necessary to have attended to, please forward an itemized account, in duplicate, covering the cost to Mr. Agent McNabb, who is being requested to certify the same and send it to the Department when consideration will be given to the payment of same. Regarding the repairs and improvements required at church owned Indian residential schools, I beg to say that when funds can be found for the purpose the Department gives favourable consideration to the payment of same. However, authority should first be obtained before the expenditure is incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. B. P. Fuller,\nPrincipal, Shingwauk Indian Res. School,\nSault Ste.

No fittings are required, as the Principal states they have unions and nozzles on hand.\n\nI have to request that you will obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers for the above quantity of fire hose of the dimensions required and of a good quality. You should submit the prices received to the Department, when consideration will be given to authorizing the purchase, and you will be advised as to the firm with whom to place the order. Your early attention to this matter is requested.\n\nThe Principal states that he has an account for plumbing that it was necessary to have done, and requests that this Department pay the same. He is being instructed to hand this account to you, which you should certify and send to the Department when consideration will be given to the payment of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I have made no request for it, but would rather be sure that the Dept is willing to do so before asking for it. We have had seven attending High School this year.\n\nThere is also the matter of painting and general repairs, and I would like to be sure how we are to pay for the material for doing the same work when we begin the work. The question I wish to ask is will the Indian Department give us a grant for this work, will they pay for the material, or must we get it out of the Per Cap grant. I am sure you know that we will be as careful as possible in the matter of cost. The buildings do need paint very badly.\n\nThen there is another item. Will the Department of Indian Affairs consider providing this School with fence wire, we have a lot of fencing to put up and it must be done this year. You will agree with me that it is best to have it done now, and what they consider is just and right in these matters. I am not quite clear on this matter of getting help for this work, if it is special, or whether such has been agreed upon, and I should like to think that it is a special grant.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ferrier,\nSup't Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am only too willing in the report you have asked for. I regret very much that I have defaulted so long. But to tell the facts of the case, I can give a very good idea or knowledge of what funds our school is receiving from the Indian department, but have no knowledge of other grants from other sources, all these go straight to the Missionary Society, as do also the Per Cap from the Department at Ottawa. So that when you receive the report, you will understand why I have not given any account of small grants, such as Sunday Schools and the grants for the support of pupils, which is undertaken by many of our Church congregations and others.\n\nAll our requirements are requisitioned for to the Missionary Society, and all bills are paid by them, so that we have no deficits such as we used to have. The Society take all monies, and are responsible for all debts. The salaries are all paid by them, but the Women's Auxiliary of the church supply all money to pay female workers in the Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nTwo years ago we had a new roof put on the large Class-room and drill Hall, and that is the only repairs we have done since the Missionary Society took over the management of the Indian Schools, and our buildings are in sore need of repairs and paint.\n\nWe are often afraid that we may be asked why we are neglecting these things, and here we would like to state our reasons.\n\n1st.) We wish to do certain repairs, and paint certain buildings, and we requisition the Missionary Society for these materials needed, and the reply we get is to apply to the Government for them.\n\n2nd.) If we are correct, the Indian Department have said that they will do all major repairs and improvements. We are not able to distinguish where the minor expenditure would end, or where the major expenditures would begin. That we did think was the meaning of the Departments letter. That they would become responsible for any important improvements, but other minor repairs, we would be responsible for. We would like to have this matter made more plain to us.\n\n3rd.) We have buildings to repair, and improve. All the buildings should be painted. We need new floors in our Hall, and our farmers house. If we could make an estimate of these, they would total more than one thousand dollars. Our fences are needing new wire, and this we are requested to ask the Department for, and so we have gone along doing without, until now we must attend to these repairs.\n\nWe are stating these matters here, but not asking for them, until we know where we may ask them from.\n\nWe are always willing, and do try to do with as little as possible, but the buildings and grounds should appear a credit to the work we are trying to do.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6212, file 460-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 23, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing the annual report on the Shingwauk Home. I note that the buildings at the school are in need of repairs and paint. If the Missionary Society or the school management find that the expense in this connection cannot be met from their own funds, you should ask the Field Secretary to bring the matter to the attention of the Department. The general policy is to ask the school management to care for minor repairs, etc., from per capita grant. The Department endeavours to undertake more expensive improvements whenever funds are available for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

It is considered that the extra tuition grant at the rate of $50 per pupil should cover all expenses in connection with their attending collegiate. The accounts which you submitted are returned herewith.\n\nWe will, however, allow payment of the account covering the cost of the X-Ray services to Ada Esquimaux by Dr. Duncan. A cheque will be sent in due course.\n\nIt does not appear that the extra tuition grant for the pupils from Shingwauk Home who attend collegiate has been paid for the year ending June 30th, last. Please have the Principal prepare a list giving the names of these pupils, the form they are in and the progress made by each during the year.

Jan. 18th, 1927.\n\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit to the Shingwauk Home which lasted from Jan. 8th to 7th, I was able to go carefully into the matter of the requirements of this School for the current year. You will have before you the list of requirements forwarded to your Department through our General Secretary for all of our Society's Indian Residential Schools, the Shingwauk Home included. The total amount requested was $1,800.00 made up as follows:\n\n1. Root house $600.00\n2. Half mile fencing 200.00\n3. General repairs 1,000.00\n\nDuring my recent visit the Principal mentioned the following as the most urgent requirements of this school:\n\n1. One mile fencing\n2. Poultry run\n3. Painting of all our buildings (white and red)\n4. The renewal of all chimneys.\n\nWith regard to the fencing, painting and poultry run, if the materials are supplied the school management will do the work. They could not, however, undertake to rebuild the chimneys, but will help in every way possible with this work and the building of a root house.\n\nOne of the most urgent needs of this school, and it was referred to your Department some time ago, is the need of additional land. The School has at present only 49 acres set apart for its use. In addition to this, 90 acres are rented every year and for which our Society pays an annual rental of $250.00. The rented land is situated about two miles from the school, and can only be worked at considerable inconvenience to the school management.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSide by side with the School property there is a piece of land of approximately 49 acres belonging to one, Mr. W. H. Laird, of 261 - 5th Ave., New York. This land is now available I understand at the rate of $100.00 an acre. As it is never likely to be cheaper, I beg to strongly recommend that this land be purchased by your Department and set apart for the use of this School.\n\nI commend the above requirements and items of business to your sympathetic consideration and will be obliged if you will let me know in due course what action you are taking with regard to the same.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTERW/JF\nOttawa, January 24, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letters of the 18th instant, enumerating further repairs and replacements that are necessary at the Chapleau and Shingwauk Indian Residential Schools. Notes in this connection have been taken for the Estimates for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

S. C. C., and the Superintendent of Indian Education, I have to request that you will let me know what you consider the most urgent needs at the Shingwauk Indian Residential School this year. An estimate in connection with each item should be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Benj. N. Fuller,\nPrincipal,\nShingwauk Home,\nSault Ste.

McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of July 4th was received, and as we were expecting Dr. Westgate of the M.S.O.C. to call as he was on his way back, we waited but as he has not called, and may have returned, we will answer in our own behalf.\n\nYou ask for our most urgent needs. We need Paint, Roofing, Fencing, and material for plaster and chimney repairs.\n\nWe could not give any exact figure as to amount of paint required, but would say that two half barrels of barn paint costing about $37.00 per Half Barl. $74.00\n\nThe Roofing would probably cost about---$xx\n\nFencing would cost possibly----$100.00\n\nAnd the material for inside repairs would perhaps amount to $50.00\n\nThis would total------$254.00\n\nThere are other things we would like to have done before the cold weather comes, such as repairs, and improvements to the furnaces, etc., but do not know to what extent the Indian Department would consider these things.\n\nWe have a building termed the Drill Hall, and it should be repaired, and I believe a certain amount $700.00 was to be assigned for this building, but we did not go on with the matter. We would like to put this building into good repair, but this is not one of our most urgent needs.\n\nWe have been given to understand that major repairs or improvements will be taken care of by the Indian Department, and minor matters are to be taken care of by the missionary society. This is not at all clear to us, because we do not know where the line is, which are major and which are minor matters. We do not care for a system which says we may have what we earn, and then try to get all we can after that. This same trying to get system has put our buildings into bad shape, and everything is in bad repair.\n\nYour kind consideration and some information regarding this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

When the business has been awarded, you should forward properly certified accounts, in duplicate. It is understood that the school management will be responsible for the labour in connection with the above.\n\nI understand that there is also some plastering to be attended to, that the furnaces require repairs and that the chimneys of the main building need attention.

And I am of the opinion that in regard to the tender submitted by Mr. Wray for the plumbing repairs at the Shingwauk, the tender is altogether too high.\n\nWe are most thankful that the Dept have consented to consider doing the repairs the heating of the school, but we are most anxious that the school should get the benefit of such consideration. Therefore I am offering this suggestion that Mr. Wray's tender be not accepted until I can get another good mechanic to look the work over, and then with the help that we can give him, most likely, surely, I believe do the work for less than half the amount of the tender submitted by Mr. Wray. There is no doubt that too much money goes to the contractor when such work is given, and not enough benefit to the school.\n\nWe know just where the mistake has been made in the heating system regarding the two extreme ends of the buildings, or rather the two additions, and there are good practical men who can help us and see that a job is done that will pass the inspection.\n\nI will ask the Agent Mr. Sims to hold up any acceptance of tenders until we hear from you.\n\nPardon this liberty.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Acting asst., Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Because both Mr Fuller and his farmer have had years of experience with this heating plant and with a practical Plumber much more can be done for money expended, and our choice is Mr Wray, for both Mr Fuller and myself know Mr Wray to be a practical and honest man.\n\nThere are three small boilers in the heating system, the centre boiler has always been satisfactory, but the two end boilers have always given trouble, and the trouble has been caused by the returns passing under the ground floor, the return water having cooled, becomes frozen. The suggestion by Mr Wray is to raise all the radiators so that all the returns may come above the floors, all feeds and boilers to be covered to retain heat, and then assurance made of good circulation.\n\nWe are sincerely grateful for your kind consideration in this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nActing Agent.\n\nJ.D.

You have sent us quite a number of good things lately, all of which we are thankful for.\n\nThe Department have been doing a lot for us during this year, our heating system repaired, and it is working better than it has done for many years. Then we have done considerable painting, and the main building looks much better for it. We have re-roofed some of the small buildings, and have some repairs done to chimneys. There is much to be done still, but we feel that it is good to have made a start, for we did no repairs for years.\n\nI would also take this opportunity to thank you for the generous supply of school material, and also of drugs, in past years the school bought and paid for these, and it was at times quite an item. We thank the Department for all these things, which means much to us.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n| DATE | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------|\n| 1928 |        |\n\nAuthorized by Dept. letter No. 130-6 dated July 27/27\n\nFeb 23 Goods supplied to Shingwauk Home $180.00\n\nI hereby certify that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 100\n\nIndian Affairs.

We used the gasoline tractor for a few weeks but this was not satisfactory as it required an opening for the belt to connect it up with the laundry, making the room cold for the workers, so we decided to have the Motor repaired. We did not know what repairs would be needed, until the local man said that they could not repair the Motor here, that it would have to be sent to the factory. We knew this would cost considerable but there was no other way.\n\nThe Motor has given good service for many years and no fault can be attached to motor or any one, and although we regret the cost of repairs, we are greatly appreciating the use of the Motor after being without it for some time.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Benj.

Prominent amongst these, mention was made of the following:\n\n(1) Laundry\n(a) Repairs to the cylindrical washer or a complete new washer.\n(b) Installation of shaft and pulley so that the mangle could be used.\n(c) New belts for the washer and mangle.\n(d) The conversion of the window between the main building and the up-stairs of the laundry into a doorway.\n(e) Installation of proper ironing tables in the laundry upstairs.\n\n(2) Children's Dining Room\nNew tables and benches, the tables to be covered with heavy linoleum, bound on with brass or wooden strips.\n\n(3) Farm\n(a) Additional land.\n(b) Threshing machine.\n\n(4) General Repairs to the main building.\n\nUp to the present I have not heard that any of these improvements have been effected, and I shall be\ngrateful if you will give special attention to the items mentioned under\n\n(1) Laundry\n(2) Children's Dining Room and\n(3) General Repairs to Main building.\n\nOf these, precedence should, in my opinion, be given to the Laundry items, but the others should also be supplied.\n\nThanking you in advance for your help in these matters,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find a copy of a letter which I am forwarding today to your representative at Sault Ste.

The Department will await a report from Mr. Agent Sims, who will, no doubt, furnish an estimate of the cost. This matter will be referred to the Superintendent of Indian Education on his return from the West, which will probably be early in August, next.\n\nMr. Ferrier's itinerary includes a visit to Winnipeg on or about the 30th ultimo, and it is his intention to call upon you, when you could discuss the various matters which have formed the basis of your recent correspondence with the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\nMr. Russell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen Dr. Eastgate, Field Secretary of the M.S.C.O., visited our School some time ago, we talked over some repairs and improvements that we would like to make as soon as we were able or prepared to do so. Now we are in receipt of a communication, copy of a letter sent to The Indian Agent Mr. Sims referring to these matters.\n\nMr. Sims called me and we talked the matter over, with the result we decided to write you and explain that as you are aware repairs must be made from year to year to keep the buildings and equipment in order, so we must have the supplies to do them.\n\nWe say then that if the Department regard these requests in order, we would very sincerely approve of them. But there are certain articles that can be repaired and used for some time yet.\n\nI would call to mind the fact that last year the Dept gave our school considerable assistance in making repairs, supplying paint. But as we said these things must be done from year to year, and we generally get very little in this item. We would like to ask, that if you don't approve, we would like to have new belts for our Bandola. Either a new washing machine, or the old one repaired, and we think that if we were to have a new one, we could get the old one repaired and install it with the new one and so speed up the work on wash days.\n\nWe have an ironer, but have never installed it on account of the danger of girls being left alone to work with it, and as the rollers are heated by gasoline we counted it rather a risk to let the girls use it. If belts are available, we will have it in use if we can obtain a promise that some of the staff will always supervise.\n\nWe would like to be frank in saying that there are many things we would have, many improvements we would like, but our school is not owned by the Indian Dept., as we often wish it was, and therefore we are receiving favors when we receive these considerations.\n\nWe thank you, sir, for all past favors, and are grateful in the trust that there is nothing that is practical and reasonable we could ask for, that you would refuse.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. - Tables and Benches\nLumber for new Tops would make them as good as new.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, M.S.C.C., addressed to Mr. Agent Sims.\n\nYour requests will be placed before the Superintendent of Indian Education upon his return to the Department, which will probably be early in August, next. It will be necessary, before giving consideration, to have an approximate estimate of the cost involved, and you might consult Mr. Agent Sims with a view to arriving at the cost of the various requirements as mentioned in Dr. Westgate's letter to him, and inform the Department of the cost in each case. You should also state as to how it is proposed to have the work in connection with the repairs carried out, and what portion of same the staff and pupils of the school would be prepared to perform. If this information is furnished by either Agent Sims or yourself before the 8th of August, next, it will assist the Superintendent of Indian Education to arrive at a decision immediately upon his return as to the equipment, renewals and general repairs that can be authorized.\n\nYour request that the school be provided with a threshing machine, which it is noted you estimate will cost about $400, will receive consideration at the same time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

INSPECTOR WALKOM,\ndated September 25th, 1926, on his\ninspection of the Shingwauk Home.\n\nOriginal on File 13-0-6.\n\nThe smallest desks in the school are\nsize 3 non-adjustable. About eight or ten little\nones are seated in entirely unsuitable seats.\nOne row of five adjustable #3 with an extra rear\nand extra front would make an enormous improvement.\nOttawa, October 6th, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, states as follows regarding the desks:\n\n\"The smallest desks in the school are size 3 non-adjustable. About eight or ten little ones are seated in entirely unsuitable seats. One row of five adjustable #3 with an extra rear and extra front would make an enormous improvement.\"\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will state the name of the manufacturer of the desks at present in the school, also whether they are single or double desks. I may say that we do not supply adjustable desks. It is noted that the desks which the Inspector recommends are for the smaller pupils, but it is considered that any extra desks should be of the single type to accommodate pupils between 7 and 9 years. Please give full information as to the size and type of the extra desks required, when consideration will be given to supplying same.\n\nThe Department does not appear to have received any reply to its communication to you of July 23rd, last, relative to the laundry equipment, renewals and general repairs required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Perrier,\nSup't of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn looking over some files I found the enclosed which I believe should have been sent in to your Office. The account may have been paid because I have not heard from the party who did the repairs on the Motor, and I would expect some notice if it was still unpaid.\n\nThe motor had been in use in our Laundry for nearly ten years and given good service, serving the Laundry work, grinding all the cattle feed, and sawing all our wood. And now since it has been rebuilt it is as good as new. We are perfectly satisfied, in fact it is better than we expected it could be made.\n\nThe matter of a small Threshing machine has been mentioned in a letter to the Department some time ago. (You were away at the time) and I would like your advice in the matter. This year our grain crop will be light, owing to the bad harvesting weather. But it is very unsatisfactory having a big machine from outside come in to thresh. And on the other hand there is a lot of pleasure in doing our own threshing and teaching the boys what will be useful to them some time.\n\nWe have used the Garden River Machine last year, but it is a lot of work to fix it so that it will do proper work, after the people there use it for a season.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. B. P. Fuller\nprincipal.\nOttawa, October 16, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing an account in favour of O. C. Carney, Sault Ste. Marie, covering the cost of repairs to the motor which operates the laundry at the Shingwauk Home. In this connection I would refer you to official letter of March 21st, 1928. The Department is not aware as to whether this account has been paid by the authorities of the M.S.C.C. or not. You should make enquiry from Mr. Carney, and if the account has not been paid, you should certify same, in duplicate, and return it to the Department, when consideration will then be given to its payment. The account, together with the receipt for freight charges, is returned herewith to be certified as requested.\n\nWith reference to the threshing machine, I have to request that you will give full information as to the type and cost of a machine which you consider would be satisfactory. If you have any literature descriptive of the machine, I shall be pleased if you will forward same. When we have full information as to the cost involved, consideration will then be given as to whether funds for the supplying of same can be provided or not.\n\nPlease give the contents of this letter your prompt consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The washing machine needs a new cylinder, and as we have to send to Toronto for prices, will report as to cost of that at a later date.\n\nIt is the intention of the Reverend Principal to have this work done by the boys at the school, which will be a great saving.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOctober 22, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR.

Mr. Fuller, the Principal, is not a very good correspondent, and it is only now that I have learned, through the office of Mr. Indian Agent Sims, how the funds should be expended. If the Department would supply the following materials, the Rev. Principal will be responsible for all labour:\n\n- Paint, Calcimine, etc., - $345.00\n- Flooring, Roofing, Doors, - 164.57\n- Repair parts for laundry equipment - 88.00\n\nTotal - $597.57\n\nI should be glad to have your authority for the expenditure. Dr. Westgate, upon the occasion of his visit last week, strongly urged that these repairs be allowed.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, October 22, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nPursuant to your conversation with Mr. Ferrier last week, I have now to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Sims has reported concerning the repairs necessary at the Shingwauk Home.

MARIE,\nONTARIO\n\nOctober 25th, 1928.\n\nMR. G.H. SIMS,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste Marie,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur School, the Shingwauk Home, is built with the main floor close to the ground, and the three furnaces are placed three feet below the ground. No basement, and always we have much trouble with water in the pits where the furnaces are located. During the past wet season these pits have been full of water, and no drain to carry it off. Other years we have bailed the water out, often having to do so every day.\n\nLately we decided to open a drain from where the land drops down to the river to the house. In doing this we discovered an old wood box drain rotted and filled in. We have opened this drain, and wish to lay it with tile drain pipe. This must be done at once as the excavating is done, and to assure you that this will be effectual in taking off the water, I can tell you that as soon as we had the drain open the water went out in a short time. The drain that we have opened will pass through our vegetable garden and will be beneficial in a double way.\n\nThe length of the drain is Five Hundred and Twenty Five Feet,\n\n525 Feet of Drain Tile @ 77c per Ft. = $38.75.\n\nWill you please ask the Indian Department if they would consider giving us this grant as it would mean much comfort to us in our work, and also make the building more healthy.\n\nWe shall ever be thankful.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nG.H. Sims\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste Marie,\nOntario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 460-5, part 3)\nOttawa, October 29th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of Shingwauk Home in which he requests that 525 feet of drain tile be supplied in order to drain the water from the pits where the furnaces are located to the river.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the expenditure required in the supplying of the quantity of drain pipe required. We note the Principal estimates the cost to be approximately $36.75. It is expected that the school authorities will be responsible for the laying of this tile and any filling in that may be required.\n\nAfter this tile has been obtained, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Marie on Wednesday last, the 24th inst., I found that, owing to the abnormally heavy rainfall which had prevailed in that part, the water had been seeping into the basement and furnace-room, and as the drain was choked, the Principal and the Farm Instructor with the aid of some of the bigger boys had undertaken the laborious task of digging out the drain to remove the obstruction. When I reached the school, they had actually dug a trench 259 yards long and at no spot less than 2 feet deep, while in other places nearer the school it was actually 5 feet in depth. They found that the box drain which had been installed was so badly rotted that it had caved in, and this caused the water to back up into the furnace-room.\n\nI suggested to Mr. Fuller, the Principal, that no attempt should be made to repair the box drain, but that he should confer with the Indian Agent and agree with him to request your Department to provide 6 inch tile instead. I understood from Mr. Fuller that Mr. Indian Agent Sims agreed with the suggestion that the tile should replace the wooden drain, and I trust that any request which you may receive from him in this connection may receive your sympathetic consideration. I was unable to get a close estimate of the cost of the tile during my short stay in Sault Ste. Marie, but Mr. Fuller was of the opinion that it would not exceed $60, or $70.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Agent Mr. Eddy will notify the makers to ship at once the machine so that we will expect to have the use of it in a short time. We thank you indeed. The exact price to be $460.00.\n\nRegarding the matter of repairs, the funds for which you have granted for the school. We are just beginning to carry out. We have opened up doors on the second floor to connect our laundry with the main building making it possible to transfer the finished laundry from the laundry room to the clothing rooms without going down stairs and through the kitchen. This is done and will be an improvement and saving of labor and time.\n\nThe material for the stairs and floor will be delivered today, and then we will proceed to do that work. After that is done we will go on with the reconditioning and painting. We can do all this work, and it will be advantageous to the boys, for they like the work. It will be much slower in doing than if we hire the work done, but there will be the saving and the training of the boys.\n\nThe matter of repairs to our Washing Machine we have taken up with a firm in Toronto. The same that we bought the machine from, and they have written for us to send up the washer to them, but this would necessitate being without a washing machine several weeks. Also, that would not be advisable, so we are sending them the measurements and have marked in their catalogue the machine we have, and we do not expect any trouble in replacing the new part.\n\nYours thankfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Marie, for material for repairs to Shingwauk Home.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 12-0-5 dated Oct. 22/28.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nYou have been most kind and considerate in assisting us in the expenditure of the special grant from the Indian Department. The six hundred dollars has given us the opportunity to make certain repairs that will add to both the comfort and the appearance of the interior of the building. The School has never looked so well as it does since it has been cleaned, kiln-dried and painted, all in colors tending to reflect the light, and brighten the rooms.\n\nWe would extend, through your Office, to the Indian Department at Ottawa our sincere appreciation of all that has been given to our School.\n\nYou might say from the following that \"much wants more\". But it is not that, our pupils dining room looks beautiful and bright causing the table tops to look very shabby. If we could take off the old oil cloth covers and put on what is called Battleship linoleum, bound on the edges with metal, and cover with a filling of varnish our dining room would be complete.\n\nThere are seven tables requiring for tops 22\u00bd yards of linoleum at $1.75 per yard, amounting to $45.00. The metal binding and varnish would bring the amount to not more than $50.00.\n\nAlthough the Department has done so much for us, still I am so well satisfied with the result that I have no fear in making, through you, this request.\n\nI trust that when we get further on with the work, and you can get down with pff your car, you will come and inspect our work.\n\nSincerely thanking you. I am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev. E.P. Fuller)\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Gordon Sims,\nThe Indian Agent,\nSault Ste.

Principal's request.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 16, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Shingwauk Home in which he requests that a grant of $50 be allowed to purchase linoleum for the tops of the tables in the dining-room.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the above amount in the purchase of the linoleum required, and you may inform the Principal accordingly. An account, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. H.

And I would not ask the Department to consider this account if I could get the means to pay it. When it happened I wrote you and explained how it happened, and I was indeed sorry.

(RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\nWinnipeg, Man., May 1, 1929\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been instructed by our Commission to direct your attention to the heavy expenditure which they are obliged to make from year to year for bread at the Shingwauk Home, and to ask you to kindly give very careful consideration to the question of providing this School with facilities for baking bread. In support of this request I beg to state that the bills which were paid by our Commission for bread at this School during the year 1928, amounted to $2,117.10. Had the Commission purchased the flour required to meet the needs of the staff and pupils at their schedule rate of allowance which is 75 lbs. per head per quarter, the total cost of this flour would have amounted to $1,035.00 f.o.b. S.S. Ste. Marie, and they would thereby have effected a saving of $1,082.10.\n\nAs the average per capita cost of food at a number of our Society's other Schools where bread-baking facilities are provided, is only approximately $45.00 a year, while the average per capita cost of this same item at the Shingwauk Home is $62.00 a year, it is obvious that the lack of baking facilities is very largely responsible for the difference.\n\nOn various occasions during my visit to your Department, I have made known the wish of our Commission to have the baking facilities provided, not only in order that the operating expenses of the institution might be reduced, but that the pupils might benefit by this branch of education as well. On each occasion, a note was made of my request and sympathetic consideration of the situation promised. So far, however, no action has been taken, and our Commission has lost\nheavily in consequence. They feel that the situation should not be allowed to continue as it is at present, and for this reason I shall be very grateful if you will go into the matter carefully, and provide this institution with the necessary baking facilities at the earliest date possible.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, May 7th, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, requesting that baking facilities be provided at the Shingwauk Home.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that there are no funds provided for this purpose. I would point out that the requests made by the M.S.C.C. for our Estimates, which were forwarded under cover of a communication from Canon Gould dated September 25th, 1928, do not contain an item covering the supplying of equipment for baking purposes. There is available in our Estimates for the current fiscal year the sum of $600 for the erection of a root house. You might correspond with Rev. Mr. Fuller in order to determine which is the more urgent - the supplying of a bake oven or the erection of a root house.\n\nI may add that the type of oven we supply to residential schools is a wood burning oven, costing from $300 to $425, depending on the size. If the oven is supplied, you might state if the school has accommodation to install and operate same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAas't. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

I discussed this matter fully with the Superintendent of Indian Education during his recent visit to Winnipeg, and as he knows the Shingwauk Home buildings very well, he agreed that any attempt to install a large bake-oven either in the Kitchen or in one end of the laundry, would not only prove unsatisfactory, but would seriously interfere with the work of those two departments. A small bake-house to serve until the new School is provided could be built on skids at a moderate cost, and I beg to recommend that this action be taken at an early date, and a suitable bake-oven, and mechanical dough-mixer installed. The dough-mixer could be operated by electric motor, as the Shingwauk Home derives its light and power from the light and power plant of the City of Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nCommending this important matter to your favourable consideration, I have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is ready to supply a wood-burning oven at an approximate cost of $350 and allow a grant of $250 towards the cost of erecting a small bake house, provided the school authorities will be responsible for the other expenditure. If a power driven dough mixer is to be supplied, this will have to wait until next year, so that a vote can be secured for the purpose. If you decide to proceed with this improvement, please let the Department know, and arrangements will be made to order the bake oven from Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

We have basketball and volley ball, but the boys seem to need more. If we had more games for the boys we could keep their attention on the sport, and they would have less time to wander away and get into mischief, as they do sometimes.\n\nRe-material for training in painting, woodwork, and cement work.\nWe find it very satisfactory both to the pupil and to ourselves, to have the larger boys doing some work that will teach them something that will be useful for them to know when they must earn their own living. And also very profitable to have the boys keep the buildings painted, and needful work done while at the same time they are learning. I may say that we are able to teach the boys how to do such work, and although we cannot afford to have a real mechanic, still it would be well in a double sense to have material to employ the boys and improve the buildings.\n\nI am sure you will give this your kind consideration, and advice.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nprincipal\nOttawa, June 15, 1929.\n\nRev.

An estimate of the cost involved as submitted by the Principal is $100.00, and I shall be glad to know if there is any possibility of your Department undertaking to meet this expenditure.\n\nIn making this request I am not unmindful of the information set forth in your letter of May 7th last, #12-0-5, and wherein you state, in part, that the sum of $600.00 is available for the erection of a root house at this school this year. A certain amount of this sum will already have been absorbed in providing the baking facilities requested in my letter to you on May 25th, but I have not yet received any information from the Principal as to whether the whole amount has been absorbed in this way or not. The need is undoubtedly urgent and as our Commission have agreed to provide the range, I sincerely trust that your Department may find some way to meet the cost of the necessary wiring system up to the amount of the Principal's estimate.\n\nA prompt reply will oblige.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our kitchen range is in a very bad state. Evidently it is very ancient, and badly broken, and also I believe it is quite out of date, so that repairs could not be obtained for it.\n\nAn electric stove has been partly installed.

Hives, who has recently arrived at the Shingwauk Home to take charge of that institution, has written to our Commission with regard to the need of a new kitchen range, and I enclose herewith for your information, a copy of his letter. I was well aware that this range would have to be replaced before very long, and as Mr. Hives has reported it to be badly in need, there will certainly be a danger of setting fire to the institution, and I am strongly of the opinion that the sooner it is replaced by a new one, the better.

The boys' bath tubs have never been connected to the sewer and where they are now placed is very unsatisfactory. The Principal's quarters, which have not been occupied for some time, are uninhabitable. The roof leaks, the floors in the lower flat are rotten, the walls are cracked, the plaster is falling off and the whole place is in a generally dilapidated state. It requires a thorough renovating before it will be fit to live in.\n\nI examined the children and found them free from any contagious disease. There are eight children who have enlarged and infected tonsils which should be removed.\n\nOn account of the recent presence of two cases of active tuberculosis in the school I think it would be advisable to have all the children tuberculin tested. If the Department wishes this done I will be glad to do it at any time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Marie, Ont.\nOct. 21, 1929\n\nDear Sir:\n\nJust recently I have taken over the Principalship of the Shingwauk Residential School, and looking over the building, I find it in a very bad state, both from the standpoint of repair as well as being unsanitary and unsafe by reason of the heating system used, and the poor protection installed.\n\nI have my wife and two children here, and am anxious to get settled down before the cold weather starts. But am unable to do so on account of the Principal's apartments being uninhabitable.\n\nI understand that these apartments have not been used for some years. The walls are badly cracked, the doors and windows are illfitting, and the floors in places are decaying and have large holes in. On account of there being no basement in either the school building or the Principal's apartments, the underjoists are decaying, and on the whole conditions are undesirable. Also there is no toilet or bathroom in the Principal's apartments.\n\nI would appreciate it very much indeed if you would come and see things for yourself, and also to kindly recommend the Department to help us to make the place habitable.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nGordon Sims Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose two letters which I have received, one from the Rev. Principal Hives of the Shingwauk Home, and one from Dr. A.H. MacCabe reporting on conditions existing at the Shingwauk Residential School.\n\nUpon receipt of the Rev. Principal's letter I investigated conditions myself, and found the Principal's apartments in very bad state of repair, so much so that I hesitate to make any further recommendations as to what should be done. In my humble opinion the whole building should be scrapped. It seems to me that any further money spent on these buildings is a waste of money as it can never be used on school buildings. Every doctor who has visited the place during the past ten years have condemned the buildings.\n\nI concur with Dr. MacCabe in what he says as to the unsanitary condition of the school, and believe it dangerous for the children who are predisposed to tuberculosis trouble.\n\nI would strongly recommend that the Department send a representative up to go into the matter thoroughly at the earliest possible date, as Mr. Hives and his wife and family are occupying rooms belonging to the staff, which is causing no little inconvenience.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

The Department understood, from your communication of August 8th, last, that this was being replaced by an electric oven. Mr. Phelan, of the Schools Branch, will be in Sault Ste.

Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nNovember 13th, 1929.\n\nI beg to report as follows in connection with certain other matters at the Shingwauk Home:\n\n(1) Re:- Boys' bath tube not being connected with sewer. I found that there were three bath tubs in a small room off the boys' playroom but these are not connected with the sewer nor can water be run into them. The Principal told me that there is a jacket heater at the Lac La Ronge School which has not been used and he has applied to the Secretary of the M.S.C.C. to have it transferred to Shingwauk Home. If this is accepted, Mr. Hives stated that he would install two or three bath tubes in a small room off the boys' dormitory and the only expense occasioned would be the cost of the plumbing to attach the bath tubes to the sewer.\n\n(2) Re:- Bake House. Previous to leaving the school, Mr. Fuller erected a bake house. This is a small frame building with a cement floor. Mr. Hives does not consider it at all suitable for the purpose and, to use it for the purpose for which it is intended, it would be necessary to supply a coal burning bake oven - 100 loaf capacity.\n\nI found that the school has previously purchased their bread from a bakery in the Soo at a cost of 11 cents a loaf and, as the expenditure for bread has appeared high to the M.S.C.C., Mr. Hives was advised that the M.S.C.C. considered that the bread should be baked at the school. I arranged with Mr. Hives to secure new prices for the supplying of the bread. Before leaving the Soo he informed me that he had an offer of bread at 8 cents a loaf and I immediately wrote the Secretary of the M.S.C.C. in connection with this offer and it will therefore not be necessary to make any arrangements for a bake oven until the Principal communicates further with the Department.\n\n(3) Mr. Hives is not at all satisfied with the washing machinery. During the past summer, the Department supplied, at a cost of $75.00, a new wooden cylinder for the tumbler but the Principal claims that this machine leaks considerably. The extractor is also old. Mr. Hives also stated that a mangle and an ironer are necessary.\n\n(4) In connection with the new root house about which there has been considerable correspondence, the Principal did not appear to consider that it would be necessary to take any action in this regard this Fall.\nS'ingwauk Home\n\n1. Principal's quarters.\n   (a) roof repaired.\n   (b) 5 rooms plastered, woodwork painted and papered, flooring scrubbed and oiled.\n   (c) 1 hall treated same as above rooms.\n   (d) Small hall turned into bathroom, erect temporary partition, also plaster part of walls and paper. There will be required some expenditure for a plumber but bath, toilet and likely sufficient pipes for the connections are on hand.\n\n2.

McCaig\n\nCity,\n\nDear sir,\n\nI have made an inspection of the Shingwauk Home on Queen St East and I find the Building in a very dilapidated condition and almost falling down and a Fire trap to keep Children in this Building the Roof is leaking something terrible all over.\n\nI would recommend the following be put in at once to help to protect the Children for the meantime:\n\n100 Feet of Hose on each outlet on stand pipe\n2 Soda and Acid Fire Extinguishers on each Floor also One in the Principals Quarters\n3 Fire Escapes with Doors opening out from Boys, Junior & Senior Girls Dormitories Escapes to be a Stairway leading to ground,\nAll the Electric wiring in Building to be gone over as at present it is in a terrible condition liable to set Fire to the Building at any moment,\nAll stove pipe holes in Chimneys not in use to be bricked up.\n\nYour very truly,\n\nWJP\nChief of Fire Dept.\nMEMORANDUM: -\n\nRE: SHINGWAUK HOME.\n\nIn addition to the repairs embodied in official letter of the 12th instant, Rev. Mr. Hives, Principal of the Shingwauk Home, requested that the Department supply the following:\n\n(1) New kitchen range. - The range at present in the school is practically useless and the electric stove, which, it was suggested in previous correspondence, might replace the range, was given to the school and I found that it was only the ordinary house size and, therefore, not large enough to meet requirements. The Principal suggested a McClary Famous Hotel Range - No. 59 - with double fire box. Mr. Sims and Mr. Hives were authorized to secure a suitable range.\n\n(2) For Principal's Quarters:\n(a) 9 storm windows\n(b) 12 blinds\n(c) 1 electric light fixture for living room in Principal's quarters.\n(d) Linoleum for room to be used as kitchen.\n(e) Stove for kitchen in Principal's quarters.\n\n(3) Two sewing machines - If possible, Principal would prefer one of these to be an electric. As the Department is aware, such a machine could be operated at this school as they secure their electric current from the city.\n\n(4) 32-foot extension ladder.\n\n(5) Fire Equipment:\n(a) 12 - 2\u00bd gal. extinguishers\n(b) 2\u00bd - 1 gal. extinguishers\n(c) Approximately 200 feet of fire hose.\nYou will note from this memorandum that the only authority given so far is for the purchase of a new kitchen range. I recommend that the other articles requested be supplied with the following possible exceptions:\n\n(a) Stove for Principal's quarters. - Would recommend that the electric stove at present in the kitchen and which has not proved sufficiently large be transferred to the Principal's quarters.\n\n(b) I informed the Principal that the number of fire extinguishers requested seems rather large but he pointed out that, owing to the number of different rooms in the building and the manner in which the building is laid out, it makes it advisable to have a plentiful supply.\n\n(c) I doubt if it is necessary to supply the fire hose and the Principal did not appear to be very insistent about it but simply mentioned it as the fire chief from Sault Ste. Marie, on his recent visit to the building, thought that it should be supplied.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Marie, Ont.\nNov. 15, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn conversation with Mr. Indian Agent Sims this morning, he informed me of the wishes of your Department in regard to the fixing up of the Principal's apartments at the Shingwauk Home. No doubt, since the visit of your representative, Mr. Thelen, you are well informed of the conditions that prevail there.\n\nI beg to assure you sir, that all and any help received from the Department is deeply appreciated by us, and, speaking for myself, it has always been my aim to economise wherever it is possible to do so, when a sanction of expenditure has been given. For the same reason any request I have made of your Department has come after very careful consideration.\n\nYour representative, Mr. Thelen, took back with him, after his visit to us, a note of many of our real needs. Amongst these was necessary repairs for the Principal's apartments. In relation to the lighting I note that one electric light fixture is allowed for the six rooms. May I here say that it is over thirty years since these rooms were last decorated. The papering and decorating was done by the man who is about to work on them now, so that he knows how long ago it is since the last work was done on them. There is nothing enticing or comfortable about them. There are just the bare cord drop light, one for each room. The wiring is faulty and unsafe. There is not one wall switch for any of the rooms, and no wall plugs for power or heat.\n\nI had the electrician in yesterday to look over the place, and he informed me that it would cost \u00a375.00 to put in proper decent fixtures and insure fair convenience and safety. I would be very grateful if the Department would kindly authorize Mr. Sims by wire that this work should be done.\n\nIn regard to your wishes relative to kitchen range, and the transferring of electrical range from\nThe main building to the Principal's apartments.\n\nI may say that this range was a personal gift from a former lady worker of this school to the school, and therefore I have no right to transfer it. I may say however, that the coal burning range would cost $75.00, and that it would be almost necessary to have such a range in order to heat water for the bathroom. I sincerely hope therefore, that this may be forthcoming, and would appreciate it very much if you would kindly authorize the purchase of this range.\n\nI recognize the fact that this building belongs to the Church, but even under the very best of conditions, we cannot do without your help, and certainly under the present deplorable conditions of decay and unsafety as exists here, your kindly help and consideration, of which I am familiar, is very vital to our existence. And moreover, the children we are trying to look after do really belong to the Department, and we, as workers are trying to give to them the very best we have.\n\nEven after your Department has done all that I tried to point out to your representative should be done, things are still going to be very far behind. To speak frankly, this school, although in civilization, is fifty years behind, in many respects, the school at Lac la Ronge, which is two hundred miles away from the nearest town. I, and I can safely speak for my staff can endure hardship in the work if necessary, but I for one cannot live surrounded by carelessness and neglect that I see on every hand, and it is beyond the power that we have to improve matters very much. To me such living is a veritable waste of time and precious energy. Moreover, your children cannot possibly receive the care and attention they should have under such conditions.\n\nAt present the Staff are \"doubling up\" in order to give the Principal and family room. The cold weather is naturally nearby, and I would like to get settled down before Winter really sets in. It would therefore be a great relief to me if the Department would wire there sanction for attention to light and range as herein dealt with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department telegraphed Mr. Indian Agent Sims today as follows:-\n\n\"You may expend $75 for cook stove, principal's kitchen, Shingwauk Home. Inform Mr. Hives Department cannot authorize any further expenditure for electric wiring or fixtures, as building too old to warrant permanent improvements.\"\n\nI note that you are attacking the problems that confront you with vigour. The Department relies on you to do your best under the circumstances. I regret that costly improvements cannot be undertaken to the old building, as it is very uncertain how long it will really be used for the purposes of a training centre for Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Charles F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nShingwauk Home,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nNovember 21, 1929.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nPursuant to our conversation this morning, I have to inform you that the Department Architect and other officers have reported that the Shingwauk Home is no longer suitable for the purposes of an Indian residential school. Recently, Dr. A. S. McCaig, of Sault Ste. Marie, has written in part as follows: \"I made an examination of the Shingwauk Indian Home yesterday and find the sanitary conditions there rather unsatisfactory. . . . The Principal's quarters are uninhabitable. . . . It requires a thorough renovating before it will be fit to live in.\" The Chief of the Fire Department of Sault Ste. Marie has written, recommending certain equipment. His letter reads in part as follows: \"I have made an inspection of the Shingwauk Home on Queen St. East and find the building in a very dilapidated condition, almost falling down and a fire trap. . . . All the electric wiring in building should be gone over, as at present it is in a terrible condition, liable to set fire to the building at any moment.\"\n\nAs you were informed, the Department has made certain improvements, so that the work can be carried on for the time being, and the services of a night watchman have been authorized. In view of the general condition of the main building, I believe that its removal and a new site should receive early consideration, and I propose, with your concurrence, to regard it as the most urgent item in the Church of England Indian residential school work. Parliament will be asked to provide funds for the re-establishment of this school next year. It is probable that a site on the Garden River Reserve will be considered.\n\nI am enclosing an extra copy of this letter, with the suggestion that you send one to Dr. Westgate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.D., B.C.L.,\nGeneral Secretary, M. S. C. G.,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto 5, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 21, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn view of the rather serious fire hazard at the Shingwauk Home, the Department believes it advisable to arrange for the services of a night watchman. Will you please make immediate arrangements to engage some responsible man, who will patrol the building continuously from 10 o'clock in the evening to 7 o'clock in the morning. The Department authorizes you to offer $50 a month for this service to a suitable man. I consider that the school should provide him with his meals. I am satisfied that you can get someone on these terms. I may add, for your information, that the Department and the M. S. C. G. are seriously considering the advisability of asking Parliament for funds for a new main building.\n\nYou may forward, from time to time, to Mr. Indian Agent Sims, who is receiving a copy of this letter, vouchers in duplicate in favour of the night watchman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Principal of the Shingwauk Home. You will note that the night watchman's duties are to be taken seriously and that there is to be a continuous patrol. Mr. Hives will be responsible for the securing of an employee for this purpose.\n\nThe Department would be pleased if you would immediately arrange for a practical electrician to look at the wiring, not with a view to renewal but to repair those points that are especially dangerous. When this has been done, let me have a report with estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. H.

This furnace, which is supposed to heat the children's diningroom, staff rooms, Sr. classroom, boys' dormitory, was cracked last winter. So badly was one of the boiler sections fractured that water had to be added continually in order to give the required amount to the radiators. All through the summer it lay, although the late Principal knew of its condition all last winter. When I came this fall, I had to find it out for myself after trying to make a fire in the furnace. All through the winter so far, we have had to do without it, and I may say that this has been considered an exceptionally cold winter. The furnaces are of such ancient build, that they are obsolete, and we had to send the section away as a pattern to have one cast. Today it has arrived and so I hope that in the near future it will be rebuilt.\n\nIn regard to the Principal's apartments, I may say that the workmen are still at it, although they expect to be through next week. It has been a longer job than I had anticipated. The rooms were in a very filthy condition, and the paper had to be taken off, and in doing this, much of the plaster came along with it. It is, however, going to be very nice and I am very grateful to the Department for this improvement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. F. Hewes,\nPrincipal.\nINFORMATION\n\nDATE\n\nAMOUNT\n\nAuthorized by Dept. letter No.13-2-5 dated Nov. 10/29\n\nDec. 20 Storm Windows for Shingweuk Home $76.30\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 109\n\nAgent:\n\nIndian Affairs.

I note that $150 is required to do some rewiring, etc., at the Shingwauk Home. The Department hopes to replace this building in a few months. Would you have Mr. Carney revise his tender to include only that work which is absolutely necessary for the next few months. It is not proposed to change brass sockets for proper fixtures, etc. It is only special points of danger that must be repaired at the present time. If Mr. Carney offers you a satisfactory price, you may proceed with the work immediately. I am returning the papers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I would suggest that the advertisement be inserted in \"The Sault Daily Star,\" Sault Ste. Marie, \"The Sault News,\" Sault Ste. Marie, \"Bruce Mines Spectator\" Bruce Mines, and \"St. Joe Herald,\" Richards Landing.\n\nMr. Orr had an interview with Mr. T. R. Wilks, architect, who I think would be the proper man to be selected as Building Inspector during the construction of the proposed school. Being an architect he is familiar with the reading of plans and interpreting specifications, and I would recommend that he be given the appointment to this position.\n\nI am particular anxious that the work on this building should be commenced at as early a date as possible in order to assist in some measure in taking care of the unemployment problem which we have here.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

R. Wilks, architect, of Sault Ste. Marie. The Inspector of Construction, however, will be appointed by the Civil Service Commission after advertisement. I have requested them to issue the posters and to call for applications from Sault Ste. Marie only. When the poster issues, I shall be pleased to send you a copy which will give full information regarding the competition. I shall also send a copy together with application form to Mr. Wilks so that he may make application at the proper time. Your recommendation in his favour will be given every consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. E. Simpson, Esq.,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Armstrong, Sault Ste. Marie. This list was created as a result of the advertisement of a position Inspector of Construction by the Department of Public Works. The work they intended doing, however, was cancelled.\n\nMr. Armstrong is reported as being 64 years of age, but well qualified for appointment. The Commission asked whether we would be agreeable to appointing this man as Inspector of Construction, Shingwauk Home.\nThe Competition for this position as Inst. of Construction Shingwauk's Home is being deferred as a satisfactory tender not received - See File 13-0-54\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMinister's Office\n\nJanuary 9, 1931.\n\nDR.

If so, will the installation of the heating plants form a part of the general contracts?\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJan. 12, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the attached memorandum I beg to say that as far as I know the only school contemplated during the coming summer is the new Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste Marie. The heating system designed for this building will be a low pressure system and the building will be erected by contract after being publicly advertised. The heating system is included in the general contract.\n\nARCHITECT.\nJanuary 12th, 1931.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Buskard -\n\nIf Parliament gives us the money we contemplate erecting only one new school in Ontario this summer that is the Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste. Marie. The heating system is included in the general contract. It would be difficult for the Spencer Heater Company and the Dominion Stove Foundry Company to know who would be contracting on this work and I knew of no way in which we could help them. We might make a note of these firms and send them slips when the advertisement is being issued.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This account represents cost of installing electric kitchen range in the Shingwauk Home, and for which the Department kindly sanctioned an expenditure of $100.00.\n\nAs I was not here when the work was begun, I do not know what arrangements were made in regard to the contracting of this work. The electrician assures me however that his charges are the very lowest possible, and that on account of the City Light Department charging the main wire, the cost ran higher than was at first anticipated. I have therefore asked him to enclose a copy of the City Light Department bill, which he has also included in his account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have been occupying a small building on the Shingwauk Home property for the past 16 years, paying a small rent to James Scott. Mr. Scott and myself enjoy far better health down there than we do in the city. I was talking to the new principal at the home and he advised me to write to you as the property belongs to you now. In view of the faithful service I gave while Indian agent here, I respectfully ask if you would consider giving me a 10 year lease of this building. It needs a good deal of repair and I would undertake to make it comfortable providing the repairs would be considered as rent. The Shingwauk People does not use it for any purpose and the Principal informed me he would not have any objection to me occupying it for the summer months. He generally occupy it for the months of June, July, August and September which helps us both to...\nImprove also health. I would undertake to be of no trouble to the Home folk.\n\nI am thankful to tell you that I have been having very good health as I spent the past 3 winters in the lumber woods dealing, and I find outdoor life is what I require.\n\nYou may wonder at my age 80 next month that I ask for so long a lease but I am living in hopes of living a number of years yet.\n\nIn view of the pleasant relations between us in the past, I hope you will pay regard your very favorable consideration.\n\nThanking you for an early reply,\n\nHave the honor to be Sir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.

Marie, the following:\n\n12 #4000 beds, 2'6\" x 6'0\".\n\n12 Mattresses to fit, Yellow Label grade, covered in S.M. blue and white stripe ticking.\n\nWe appreciate very much your having sent us this order, which will have our prompt and careful attention.\n\nShipment will be made in the course of the next day or two, and invoices in duplicate forwarded to the Rev. Charles F. Hives, as you request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSIMMONS LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nVice-President.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRev. Mr. Hives, Principal of the Shingwauk Home, visited the Department today and requested that the school be supplied with a new tumbler (washer). Mr. Hives pointed out that the tumbler at present in the school has been there for some considerable time and, while it was repaired about a year and a half ago, it has never been satisfactory. As you are aware, the room used for the laundry at the Shingwauk Home is a very unsuitable one and Mr. Hives states that it will be practically impossible for them to get through this winter without a new tumbler. In the event of a new tumbler being supplied now, Mr. Hives agrees that it could be transferred to the new building when erected. If at all possible to allow funds for this purpose, I would recommend that the Principal's request be granted.\nTHE HORN BROS WOOLLEN CO., LIMITED\n\nManufacturers of Woollen Goods\n\nLindsay, Ont.

No. 13-0-5 relative to washer, I may say that the laundry equipment in the Shingwauk Home is a disgrace to any institution. The laundry in the Winter time is so cold, that really girls should never be allowed to work there; and added to this is the broken down machinery, I feel I should be guilty of an offence to say that we can get along for another Winter. If the Department cannot give us the required help, we shall have to \"muddle\" along with what we have. I would, however, request that the Department sanction the expenditure of putting the present washer in as good repair as is possible.

(RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you kindly take up a matter with the Department in connection with the heating of our school. Of course, it is recognised by the Department that our heating system is very poor, and that the only real remedy is an entirely new system, but the Winter is coming on, and the present means of heating has to be patched up as well as we can do it. The two classrooms are heated by stove heaters. That is, they have the hot water radiators installed in them, but these insufficient to give the proper heat. The stove heater heretofore used are old, and in a dangerous condition, and require new ones. These will cost in the neighbourhood of not more than $70.00. The furnaces need new grates, and I estimate the cost of these installed would be $30.00.\n\nI have been trying to fix up a room for a boy's readingroom. Some of our boys have to do study work in the evening, and they cannot do this in the playroom, and the classrooms are not convenient. We have quite a good room off the boy's playroom, and if it had proper heating installed, it would make a very good room for the boys. I can have a radiator taken from another part of the building where it is not really required. To do this would cost approximately $15.00.\n\nWould you kindly take this matter up, so that if possible the work may be done as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nGordon Sims Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing letter received from Rev. Principal Hives of the Shingwauk Home, in which he is asking for new stove Heaters, new furance grates, and removing radiator to boy's reading room, all at a cost of approximately $115.00.\n\nIn view of the fact that the old Heaters are unsafe, I would recommend recommend the purchase of new Heaters which I consider an absolute necessity, also new grates for the furance.\n\nI would also recommend the removal of the radiator to the boy's reading room, as requested by Mr. Hives.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F.

It is noted that you estimate the entire cost to be approximately $115, and, if possible, this amount should not be exceeded.

One of the chimneys from the furnace blew down, and on examining it I found that the metal was so badly corroded, a new one would have to be made. It being the month of December, and the chimney being urgently required, I had the matter attended to.\n\nThe account from Cochrane Dunlop Hardware Limited is for 4 rolls of rubberoid roofing amounting to \u00a310.40. After the snow came, I found the roof of the laundry in a very bad state of repair. The water came in streams through the roof, and down into the place where the girls had to work. I therefore got the rubberoid and repaired the roof.\n\nWill you kindly forward the enclosed accounts to Ottawa, and ask them if they will kindly settle them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nGordon Sims Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

These gentlemen pay a quarterly visit of inspection, and generally they write their criticisms in the visitors' book, and we let it go at that. As they have given their report more publicity this time, I think it only right that I should comment on their statements.\n\nThe building is just about the same as it has always been, and compares very unfavorably alongside of other institutional buildings of the present day. Sanitary conditions are bad, and many other things about the place are bad. The roof is in a deplorable condition, and the rain leaks through in many parts of it on to the boys' beds. Paint is required, and the whole of the interior needs kalsomining. I have not made any request in this matter because our hopes of a new building seemed to be about to be realized. But if the actual building is to be postponed for any length of time, some improvements must be done.\n\nIn regard to sanitary conditions, I may say it is disgustingly bad. The Girls' toilets are directly off their playroom, and the smell is very often abominable. The boys' is worse as the closets are in very poor shape and are actually in the playroom.\n\nI quite appreciate the fact that every effort is being made to curtail expenses, and I assure you sir, that we are willing to put up with anything within reason, providing the conditions do not drag along too far in the future.\n\nI would be glad if you could give me a little encouragement in this respect. The work is prospering, and well worth all the efforts that are being made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Marie, dealing with the general condition of the building known as the Shingwauk House, one of the Residential Schools for Indians conducted by this Department.\n\nI have given careful consideration to the contents of these communications. The condition of this building has been a matter of concern to the Department, and it is only owing to the necessity for rigid economy that the Department was not able to provide in its Estimates for the current year an amount sufficient to erect a new building. It will, I fear, be some time before it will be possible to make the much needed improvement. I have to assure you, however, that the matter will be kept to the forefront of our building programme. I have pleasure in informing you that the Department being aware of the fire risk has taken the precautionary measure of employing a night watchman at this school. The Superintendent of Indian Education will be at Sault Ste. Marie in a few days, and my Deputy for Indian Affairs has given him definite instructions to make a most careful survey of the building, and to suggest any possible means of diminishing the fire risk and providing more serviceable fire-escapes. Owing to the general condition of the building, it would not appear to be economical to incur any large expenditure, but it may be possible to make some minor improvements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\nJune 30, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDE. SHORT\n\nPursuant to instructions in your letter of the 4th instant, I have to report that, when in Sault Ste. Marie early this month, I made a very careful inspection of the Shingwauk Home. While the particular criticisms in the resolution of the local Kiwanis Club were founded in fact, the general conditions at this school are not quite so serious as those who are pressing for a new building would have us believe.\n\nThe interior of the building is so constructed, that there is no doubt a serious fire hazard. This hazard is increased by the inadequate heating units - 7 stoves in classrooms, playrooms, laundry, Principal's office, and Principal's residence and one-half dozen electric heaters in the staff bedrooms.\n\nTo put this old building, part of which was erected 57 years ago, in a safe condition, would be so expensive that it is not even a question. If school is to be conducted until a new building is provided, steps must be taken to minimize the risk of loss of life in the event of fire. Some months ago, we authorized the engagement of a night watchman who would constantly patrol the building. I find that the Rev. C. Hives, the Principal, has relied little too much on this employee. He has not sufficiently emphasized the fire drill and the fire escapes themselves.\n\nWe have been allowing $20 per month for the night watchman and the school has been giving him his board. I asked Mr. Hives if he was one hundred per cent satisfied that the man was on the job every minute of the night. He hesitated before replying that he was \"reasonably sure\". I asked him if we made the remuneration $75 a month if we could get a man on whom we could absolutely rely. He replied he could, and from the 16th instant, there has been on duty a night watchman who is thoroughly reliable.\n\nWith reference to the fire escapes themselves, I arranged for a guardrail on the boys' fire escape and instructed that a fire axe was to be always kept by the window opening thereon. The escape from the girls' dormitory was in bad condition, as reported by the Kiwanis Club Committee, and, on the 9th instant, I\narranged for two carpenters to come out to the school and I gave them instructions concerning a platform outside the window and a platform to the fire escape all properly surrounded by guardrails. Further, the ladder fire escape was raised so as to be easily reached, and was properly protected. The Kiwanis Committee reports concerning a straight ladder which lands on the peak of a pitch roof; but this is not a fire escape, as it leads only to the roof of the building.\n\nTo lessen the general risk, I instructed the carpenters to punch a door through an interior wall which divides the building on the dormitory floor. In the event of fire at one end of the building, the boys or the girls, as the case may be, could be moved to the other side to descend the fire escape or the interior staircase there.\n\nThe roof of the building is in rather poor condition and I authorized the carpenters to re-shingle those patches where there was any leaking.\n\nThe building accommodates 95 or 100 pupils without any real crowding, and I instructed the Principal to see that the number did not run over the 100 at any time. The boys' dormitory has plenty of air space and the girls' is not seriously crowded. In the past, the classrooms have been overcrowded; but I have instructed the Principal to adhere to the half-hour system, which will remedy this situation forthwith. The facilities and bath facilities are inadequate, but remedial measures need not be considered as the Department intends to discontinue the use of this building in the early future. The playrooms and the dining room have not been cared for as well as is desired, and I gave the Principal instructions regarding the ammunition. The matron at the school, Miss Battersby, is now practically wholly ill, and I intend to write to Dr. Westgate with a view to having her retired.\n\nIt should be remembered that this building is not a high structure and that there are no pupils more than 2\u00bd feet from the ground. The dormitories are not locked at night and the windows to the fire escapes open easily. With your permission, I wish to instruct Mr. Indian Agent Sims to regularly inspect this school and to give particular attention to the safety of the children.\n\nWith your concurrence, I wish to authorize a few minor improvements, as follows:\n\n1. Electric lights over the fire escapes.\n2. Sheet iron and asbestos protection around the smoke pipes from stoves in kitchen and both playrooms.\n\n- 3. Calomine and -\n3. Calcimine and brushes for decorating the dormitories and a little paint to complete the henhouse.\n\n4. Half screens for certain windows.\n\n5. $150 for repairs to the farmer's cottage. The farm instructor, who is a good officer, has recently been married, and Mr. Hives wishes to give him one of the old stone houses to himself.\n\n6. One horse to complete a second team for the school.\n\nI may say that I was quite critical concerning the lack of cleanliness of certain parts of the old building and on the school grounds. Mr. Hives assures me that conditions are now much better than when he took it over, but he is going to take full advantage of the half-day system and have gangs of the younger children responsible daily for jobs that they can do. Mr. Hives does not know the department's wishes and is not going to treat them lightly, as I told him that we would close the school if the church authorities and himself felt that the difficulties and dangers were too great.\n\nThere are five buildings that should remain after the new main building is erected - the chapel, the farmer's residence, two summer cottages on the river and the new henhouse. The old hospital across the main road and all the other buildings, including the barn, should eventually be removed.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 30, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to confirm authority for certain improvements that were authorized at the Shingwauk Home by Mr. Ferrier upon his recent visit. You may engage two carpenters to fix the fire escapes, as directed by our officer; to patch the roof of the main building and to put a door in an interior wall on the dormitory floor. You may also arrange for the installation of electric lights over the fire escapes.\n\nYou should also provide protection near the smoke pipes from the stoves in the kitchen and in both playrooms. You may also provide salicinum and brushes for decorating the dormitories and a little paint to complete the henhouse. You may expend approximately $25 in providing half screens for certain windows in the school. You may also expend $150 for repairs to the farmer's cottage.\n\nI note that the account for the horse, authorized by Mr. Ferrier, has already been presented and paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

New shingles replace old ones wherever required, and valleys and ridges have been renewed with flashing. It was also necessary to put up some eaves thoughing. The fire escape from the girl's dormitory has been properly built, and is now safe for use. The boys' fire escape has been repaired. Lights have been installed over each exit. A doorway from the girls' dormitory through the stone wall has been effected, and so giving access between the east and west parts of the building on the dormitory floor. Plumbing has been repaired wherever necessary, and enclosed is an account of same along with an account of plumbing done previous to Mr Ferrier's visit, but which he inspected and approved of.\n\nAll smoke pipes have been overhauled, and wherever necessary repaired. Also asbestos covered sheeting placed above smoke pipes.

Marie.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are trying to carry out the instructions of the Department of Indian Affairs in respect to the half day system. In many respects it has been very difficult to do this. We have had to increase our staff, which has meant establishing a new department. Up to the present time the girls have done their sewing in the dining-room. This has been very inconvenient and unsatisfactory. Our new worker is taking up sewing classes with the girls, and must have an equipped sewing-room. The only room available for this department is a room on the top floor which is used as a clothing-room. This can be used if we can dispose of the clothing in a proper way, and I may say that this can be done, if we have clothing cupboards built. One hundred dollars will give us the necessary clothes cupboards. There are many empty spaces in the corridors and other places where cupboards can be built and used conveniently.\n\nThis is a very important matter, as I would like to work out the half-day system with success, and I feel sure it can be done if we have the room for accommodating the sewing classes.\n\nWill you kindly place this matter before the Department at your earliest convenience, asking them to consider this matter, and if possible to allow us the necessary funds to build the cupboards.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nGordon Sims Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

Would it not be possible for the Principal to make other arrangements for the fitting up of a sewing room and storing of the clothing? Please have the Principal give this matter further consideration, with a view to carrying out the arrangements necessary to provide accommodation for the sewing classes. You might advise the Department if arrangements could not be made without it being necessary to incur the expenditure asked for by the Principal in building cupboards.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to place before you a request for the sanction of the Department to effect certain repairs that are urgently needed at our school.\n\nOur Laundry machinery requires overhauling, and repaired. Last year, about this time, it was done, with the idea of making it last out until new equipment should come with the new building, which was to have been built last year. I estimate that if $30.00 is spent again on it this year, we can go through another year with it.\n\nThe chimney leading from the stove which heats the girls' playroom is in bad shape. On account of the chimney being so low, the smoke blows back into the girls' playroom anytime the wind blows. At one time there was an extension on the top of the chimney, but this blew off some years ago. The cost of renewing this would be $20.00.\n\nThe Department bought us a kitchen range two years ago. This now requires new grates, relining, and some new parts to the top. On account of having no proper heater for the Laundry irons, the kitchen range has to be used. Consequently the range is somewhat abused. It will cost approximately $25.00 to put the range in proper repair.\n\nWe have been having a great deal of trouble lately with our lights. Our building is very poorly lighted, and yet we have really more than the fuses can carry. Consequently the fuses are constantly blowing out, and of late the main fuse has been blowing, thereby throwing the whole building into darkness. You can well imagine the inconvenience as well as the possible danger it causes with so many children around. I have had an expert down, and of course he condemns the system as unsafe, as other have done before, but it could be made tolerably safe by dividing some of the circuits,\nand lightening the load on the fuses. It would cost approximately $90.00 to do this.\n\nWould you kindly place these matters before the Department for their best consideration. These repairs are not only necessary to maintain the proper standard in our administration, but also as a safeguard against possible danger.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nChas. F. [signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nGordon Sims Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie.\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nNovember 13 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose a letter which I have received from Rev. Principal Hives of the Shingwauk Home.\n\nWith reference to the repairs etc which Mr. Hives is asking for, I may say that I have investigated the various items spoken of in the letter and can verify Mr. Hives statements as to the necessity of the repairs being made.\n\nI would strongly recommend that Mr. Hives request be granted.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 17, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Shingwauk Home requesting authority to incur the expenditure required in carrying out the repairs mentioned by him, which he states are urgently needed.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the repairs required being made to the laundry machinery; chimney leading from the stove which heats the girls' playroom; new grates, relining and other parts required to the kitchen range; also the repairs required to the lighting system. It is noted that the Principal estimates the total cost of the repairs to be approximately $165.00. You may arrange to have the materials purchased and repairs carried out by indicated firms.\n\nAfter these repairs have been completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

C. F. Hiver, Principal\n\nSault Ste. Marie, Feb. 8, 1932\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to your circular of the 5th inst., would the Department kindly supply us with two reliable punch clocks, one to be placed at each end of the building. This will insure a proper system of patrol by the night-watch, and would allow me to see that regular hourly patrols are made during the night. I have thought about this matter for some time, and believe it to be of great importance.\n\nAlso would the Department order for us refills for fire extinguishers, 6 doz. for the 1 qt. size Pyrene Extinguisher, and two doz. for the larger size, Thermone, made by the Pyrene Manufacturing Co., Toronto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 11, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, requesting that two punch clocks be supplied for the use of the night watchman at the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, and also that a number of refills for the fire extinguishers be supplied.\n\nIn connection with the punch clocks, I have to request that you will take this matter up with Mr. Agent Sims and have him forward to the Department an estimate of the cost of supplying this equipment.\n\nRegarding the refills for the fire extinguishers, it is noted that you request that 6 dozen refills for the 1/4 quart size and 2 dozen refills for the 1/2 gallon Thermose extinguishers be supplied. This number of refills is considered excessive, and I shall be pleased if you will state the number of extinguishers of different sizes on hand at the school, when refills for that number would be ordered. You might give definite information to Mr. Agent Sims and he could forward the request for the number required, when giving an estimate of the cost of supplying the punch clocks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal, Shingwauk Home,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, February 12, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nFor your information, I enclose herewith copy of a communication to Mr. Agent Sims regarding payment of the grant provided by this Department towards the salary of the night watchman at the Shingwauk Indian Residential School. The Agent and yourself should be guided by the requirements of the Department regarding payment of the grant allowed for the night watchman's salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. F. Hives,\nPrincipal, Shingwauk Home,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nOttawa, February 12, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nIn connection with the vouchers which you submit at the end of each month for the grant allowed towards the salary of the night watchman at the Shingwauk Home, I have to request that, in future, you will make these vouchers in favour of the Rev. C. F. Hives, the Principal, and submit them only for the grant due at the end of each quarter. Mr. Hives can arrange for payment of the night watchman from the cheque which he receives. The Auditor General would likely take exception to payment of salary direct to the night watchman, as by so doing it appears that he is an appointee of this Department. He is a member of the school staff, and cheque in payment of the grant allowed towards his salary should, therefore, be in favour of the Principal, who should settle with the night watchman for the salary due him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sorry to have to inform you that our hot water heating system in the boys' department has played out. It consists of a large cauldren or feed boiler. I tried to get it repaired, but it is too far gone. We must have another to take its place, as it is the only means we have of heating water for bathing the boys, and for scrubbing the boys' rooms.\n\nWould you kindly place this matter before the Department and ask them if they would kindly supply us with another. The cost would be not over sixty dollars.\n\nI may also say that the main water pipe into the Shingwauk Home has no shut-off. Some of the pipes are in very poor shape and liable to cause trouble, as they are leaking. I think it is very necessary that there should be a valve near the entrance of the water supply so that the water can be controlled if necessary. At the present time, it would have to be done in the city, over a mile away. The cost of installing this shut-off would be forty dollars.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nFebruary 13 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose a letter received from Rev. Principal Hives of the Shingwauk Home asking for a new hot water boiler for the boys' department. The old boiler is beyond repair and the only solution is to install a new one which will cost approximately $65.00.\n\nRegarding the request for a new valve to control the water supply, I would recommend that Mr. Hives' request be granted.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F.

You should arrange for the purchase from indicated sources of supply, and when same has been delivered, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.

There has been very little done in that respect for over two years, and for sanitary reasons as well as for looks there should be painting and tinting done this year. I may say that Shingwauk Home appears to be one of the sight listed on the Tourist's Guide, and a great many people passing through the locks come to see the Home during the Summer.\n\nThe building is old, and ready to be replaced, but until our hopes of a new building can be realized, we should keep this one in repair. There is a certain amount of plumbing to be done, and some of the floors are in bad shape. Windows and practically all wood work requires painting and all walls of main building require redecoration. The roof of the main building also requires repairing in places, and the roof of the laundry needs renewing.\n\nAfter making a careful estimate, including expert labour required, I find it will cost approximately $575.00.\n\nWill you please place this matter before the Department at your earliest convenience, so that we may get this work done before the Summer.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nGordon Sims Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith a letter received from Rev. Principal Hives of the Shingwauk Home asking for some necessary repairs to the school. I might say that the interior walls and ceilings are very dirty and should be tinted and the woodwork given a coat of paint. Other repairs should be made to the building all of which would cost approximately $575.00 for material and labour.\n\nIn order to make the old building sanitary, I would recommend that these renovations and repairs be made as soon as possible.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.M.

You should arrange for the purchase of the material and for the engagement of any expert labour required from indicated sources. It is expected that the school authorities will perform the greater part of the labour required without expense to the Department. You should consult the Principal as to the materials required and arrange for the purchase, obtaining itemized accounts, in duplicate. These accounts you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment. Accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should also be forwarded covering payment for any expert labour employed.\n\nIt is hoped that the grant allowed, as mentioned above, will be sufficient to carry out the more urgent work at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Marie, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to place before you, for your consideration, a matter relating to repairs on Junior classroom which urgently requires attention. The recent heavy rains having shown up some leaky spots in the roof, and the plaster has fallen from the ceiling in consequence. Also in looking over the chimney which discharges from a stove in the classroom, I find that it is unsafe, and should be rebuilt. It is made of cement, and must have been in the first place, a very poor job. I may say that we have brick enough to build a proper one, but would require expert labour to do the work. After carefully estimating the cost of these necessary repairs, I think it can be done for not more than one hundred dollars. And I beg to assure you, that if the Department can sanction this work being done, I will see that the cost is brought as low as possible.\n\nWill you kindly place this matter before the Department at an early date, so that the work may be done while the pupils are out of the classroom.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nGordon Sims Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose a communication from the Principal of Shingwauk Home asking for certain repairs to the Junior classroom.\n\nI might say that in looking over this part of the building I find the roof in need of repairs, and a new chimney should be built as I consider the old one is not safe.\n\nI would recommend that these repairs be made to the school at an early date.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\nOttawa, August 11, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Shingwauk Home, in which he requests a grant to carry out certain repairs to the junior classroom.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $100 in repairing the roof and rebuilding the chimney. This is to cover the cost of materials and any expert labour required. You should arrange for the purchase of the materials and the engagement of the labour from indicated sources. The school authorities should arrange to carry out as much of the labour as possible, without expense to the Department.\n\nI may add that the above amount, together with the sum of $400 which was authorized for repairs in official letter dated April 26th, last, is the full amount that can be provided during the current fiscal year for repairs to this school. You should obtain accounts, in triplicate, for the materials. These, you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment. Accounts in triplicate, properly certified, should also be forwarded covering payment for any expert labour. Please have the repairs to the junior classroom completed at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

It is a very unsatisfactory system anyway, but to put it into proper order would cost a great deal of money. Every two or three days we get a blockage in the main sewer, and generally it means digging down to it, which is no easy task, especially during the Winter. If we had a clean-out rod, this would be greatly simplified. A clean-out rod would cost $65.00.

Sir:\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, Field Secretary, N.S.C.C., in forwarding the requirements of the Shingwauk Home for consideration when our Estimates are being prepared for the next fiscal year, states that 80 new beds and mattresses, complete, are required, also a cylindrical washer for the laundry, at an estimated cost of approximately $600.\n\nWe will have certain funds available in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year, ending March 31st, next, and it is thought it might be possible to supply either the beds and mattresses or the laundry washer, whichever you consider the more urgent. If you desire the beds and mattresses, I would request that you state the size and number of each size of bed required. The mattresses supplied would be the same size as the beds. I may say that new beds are usually supplied in 5\u00bd', 6' and 6\u00bd' lengths. If you have any information as to the type of washer required - if you prefer this type of equipment rather than the beds - I would request that you forward same. Your early reply giving full information is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal, Shingwauk Home,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nWould the Department kindly sanction the expenditure of $30.00 for repairs on the motor which drives the laundry machinery. This has been giving a great deal of trouble lately, and I am informed that certain repairs will have to be effected.\n\nAlso one of the iron extensions on the chimney has given out, and blown down. This will have to be replaced by a new one at a cost of $15.00. At the present time, on account of the extension not functioning, the furnace draws very badly, and the discharge from the chimney is too near the roof of the building to be safe.\n\nWould you kindly give this matter your earliest consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 18, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, and in reply have to say that you may incur an expenditure not exceeding approximately $30 in carrying out the repairs required to the motor which drives the laundry machinery at the Shingwauk Home. You may also incur an expenditure of approximately $15 in having the iron extension on the chimney replaced by a new one.\n\nAfter the above authorized work has been completed, please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. These accounts please hand to Mr. G. H. Sims, Indian Agent, in order that he can certify and send same to the Department for payment. Mr. Sims is being informed that authority has been granted you to incur the above expenditures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. C. F.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 12th inst., No. 13-0-5, I may say that 80 new beds would, I think, be more urgently needed than a new washer for the laundry, although I may say our laundry equipment is in very bad shape. I think, however, that the health and comfort of the pupils should be our first consideration.\n\nI would recommend, in regard to size, 12 beds and mattresses 6' and 6' 5\". I would also recommend having them supplied with either the ball castors or the hard rubber feet. The wheel castors so quickly get broken, and then the floors are ruined by the rough bottom of the leg. I assure you that the beds will be very greatly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 18, 1933.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nIt is intended to supply eighty beds and mattresses for use at the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, Sault Ste.

I may say that we can do the work ourselves, if the Department will kindly pay for the material required. I am sure the Department are aware of the general condition of our school building, and will see the necessity of our keeping it looking decent and in a sanitary condition.\n\nWe require paint and Kalsomine for the interior and paint for the exterior. The roof will again require some patching, and some of the floors are getting into very bad repair, and will needing attention. I estimate that the material for this will cost approximately $175.00.\n\nThe furnaces need certain repairs, and the smoke pipes require renewing.

Further, you should state in detail the cost of the material and labour in placing the roof of the main building in good condition or to install a new roof. Please state how you would recommend that all the above work be carried out and the amount of labour that could be performed by your staff and paid as such. Upon your estimate of the cost of the above work is received, consideration will be given as to whether same can be authorized or not.\n\nWith reference to the paint and kalsomine for the interior, paint for the exterior and repairs to certain of the floors, these matters will have to stand over until your reply is received regarding the expenditure required for the sewage system and the installing of a new roof.

This price also includes division wall in tank, all plumbing fittings for tank, and 6\" sewer from building to tank of vitrified pipe, also 4\" vitrified pipe outlet, and approximately 400 lineal feet of 4\" field tile for drainage field.\n\nHoping to be favoured with this work and assuring you of a first class workmanlike job, we are,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMcLarty Bros.\n\nPer: [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nRegarding the matter of new roof for our main building, and construction of septic tank, I beg to place before you certain recommendations after very carefully going into matters.\n\nA new roof would cost approximately $600.00. Much as I would like to see a new roof, I would like to point out to you that, on account of the deplorable conditions that exist inside the building, in the way of worn out floors, sanitation and inconvenience, my opinion is that the building is not worthy of a new roof. I may also say that the walls of the building are in a bad state of repair, and look very unsafe in places. I would like to recommend that one hundred dollars be spent on repairing the roof, and that will be sufficient to take care of it for two years if necessary.\n\nSeptic tank. I am enclosing a letter from McLarty Bros., Builders and Contractors, in which they estimate the building of a septic tank at $620.20. The Shingwauk Home is situated below the city of Sault Ste. Marie. The city disposes of all its sewage into the river without any treatment. We are, therefore, justified in doing the same with our sewage. At present the sewage from our school discharges about two hundred feet from the river, and causes a great nuisance and danger. I would recommend that two hundred dollars be spent on carrying the sewage pipes right into the river. I have very carefully gone into this matter, and strongly recommend it strongly, both on account of its economical advantage, and also I consider it to be quite safe.\n\nI have already asked for a small grant to clean up inside the building, and hope that the Department may see fit to favourably consider this request.\nThere is one other matter which I feel should be placed before the Department. I have tried, in considering the matters of roof and septic tank, to be practical and economical, and it may possible be that by economizing in one place, help may be given to another. We have absolutely no cold storage. We are not allowed to put up ice from the river, on account of the city disposing of their sewage into the river above us. The lack of cold storage equipment is not only a great inconvenience, but causes a lot of loss of food stuffs. Moreover, no matter how careful we may be in the matter of cleanliness, there is an unsanitary odor that attracts a host of flies, causing thereby a very unsanitary state. I have also gone into this matter carefully, and would like to submit an estimate of the cost of a refrigerating plant, which could be installed in such a way as to be of use in a new building. The vault or chamber could be built for one hundred dollars. The compressor and rest of the equipment would cost eight hundred dollars.\n\nWill you kindly place these matters before the Department, and I sincerely hope they will receive favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nGordon Sims esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No.13-0-5 of the 9th instant regarding repairs to the Shingwauk Home, I am enclosing letter received from Rev. Principal Hives recommending an expenditure of $100.00 for repairs to roof of building which, in my opinion should take care of it for at least two years.\n\nMr. Hives also suggests that the sewer to river be enlarged to take care of the sewage from the School at a cost of $200.00. In my opinion this would overcome the difficulties they are having at present with sewage disposal.\n\nRegarding Mr. Hives request for refrigerating plant, his statement regarding same is self-explanatory, which I believe is urgently needed for the Home.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Hives request for the above improvements be granted.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.A.

Two items of expenditure were sanctioned by the Department, and a request from them for an estimate of what a roof for the main building would cost, and also a properly constructed septic tank. I went into these matters carefully, and wrote you on May 19th, recommending that if there was a shortage of funds, the sum of $100.00 would take care of the roof for two years. I also gave an estimate of what a septic tank would cost. Since that time we have built a fence around the area where the sewage discharges, and have made it fairly safe, so that we do not require any funds for that this year.\n\nWe do, however, require something for repairing the roof of the main building, and for general repairs throughout the building. I have no doubt if the Shingwauk Home was even fairly new, the matter of general repairs could stand over, but it is one of the oldest schools, and for the sake of sanitation and safety, certain repairs should be effected at once. While Inspector McGookin was here, he went into the matter, in case his advice should be required, and he took with him figures of the amount we should require. In the meantime, every storm that comes along, leaves its pools of water inside the building, on account of leaky roofs.\n\nOne hundred and seventy five dollars would attend to the roof, and also cover the cost of the other repairs, such as K\u00e4\u00e4somining, repairing floors, toilets etc.\n\nWill you place this matter before the Department at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\nOctober 21, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nAn item of $50,000.00 was placed in the Estimates for 1930-1931 to commence the construction of a new building for the Shingwauk Home, Sault Ste Marie, Ontario. Owing to the necessity for rigid economy at the time, this item was afterwards disallowed.\n\nThe main building of this school was erected in 1874 by the Anglican Church authorities and, at the time of placing the item in the Estimates, was in a very unsatisfactory condition. Temporary repairs had been made from time to time, but inspections showed that there was a very serious fire hazard and that the pupils and staff were living under very unsanitary conditions.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education inspected the school at that time and reported that owing to the age and condition of the building, repairs which would render it safe and satisfactory for occupation would be very costly, and for this reason only minor repairs, which were absolutely necessary, were made until such time as funds would be available for the erection of a new building.\n\nIt is my intention to visit the Shingwauk Home at the end of this month in company with Mr. Orr, after which I expect to be able to make a definite recommendation.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6212, file 469-5, part 3)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMemorandum\n\nDoctor McGill,\n\nI beg to submit a report on an inspection of the Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste Marie, made on the afternoon of November 1.\n\nThe north half of the Shingwauk Home was erected in 1874 as a school for boys. In 1880 a home for girls, called the Wawmash School was built about five miles south of the Shingwauk Home. The two schools were operated for about twelve years, when the Shingwauk Home was enlarged and the girls transferred there.\n\nThe outside walls of the building are constructed of local stone. The interior is entirely of frame construction and all of the floors are not on the same level, which necessitates going up and down steps while travelling from one room to another on the different floors. Originally the building was heated by stoves, but later a hot water heating system was installed, which consists of two hot water boilers. The heating boilers are installed in pits approximately five feet below the level of the basement floor. In the spring these pits are partly filled with water, as they are below the drainage system of the building.\n\nThe present building has outlived its usefulness and it would not be practical to remodel same. The interior layout was poorly planned, and in most cases access to one room is obtained by going through another. In fact it is very difficult to find one's way through the building without a guide.\n\nThe outside stone walls are in fair condition, but many cracks are developing, with a serious one in the laundry wing. All of the window sills are of wood, and they have deteriorated to such an extent that practically all the windows are out of plumb. The building itself is poorly located being on low ground at the bottom of a slope which leads to the rear of the building. In the spring the basement is necessarily badly flooded.\n\nThe fire escapes are so located that in case of fire it would be necessary for the children to pass from their dormitories through a hall at the top of the stair landing to reach them. In case of\nfire the corridors and stair wells would rapidly fill with smoke, and under the present arrangement, it would be exceedingly difficult for the children to reach the fire escapes. I would recommend that a partition be erected at the head of the stairs on the dormitory floors, and a door provided to the stairs. This would be of some assistance in overcoming the above mentioned danger. The cost would be approximately $200.00.\n\nIn the laundry equipment there is an extractor. This extractor is being operated without a cover, and exposes those working in the laundry to unnecessary danger. This machine was manufactured by a firm that is no longer in existence, but I believe that arrangements could be made with the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. of Toronto to provide and install a suitable cover. The cover on these extractors is so arranged that when the lid is opened the power is automatically shut off.\n\nThe general location of the Shingwauk Home has many advantages. It is within the boundaries of the City of Sault Ste Marie, and therefore has the benefits of an adequate water supply, electric power and other advantages that the City enjoys. It is located one mile from the end of the street car line on a good road. This is of great benefit to the School as each year they have pupils attending the High School in Sault Ste Marie. At the present time there are ten.\n\nI would recommend that when funds are available a new building be erected for the Shingwauk Home. It would be located approximately 300 feet to the rear of the present building on high ground, and the present building be demolished.\n\nThe Shingwauk Home and the land occupied are owned by the Diocese of Algoma. In 1930 plans were under way for the transfer of the property to the Department, but they were not completed. Before a new building can be erected it will be necessary to complete this transfer. The new School should have accommodation for 135 pupils. I may say that the Reverend Principal advises that approximately 70% of the pupils in attendance at this school are either orphans or children who have no homes.\nI would like to refer to the very efficient way in which the Reverend Mr. Hives is carrying on his duties as Principal of this Institution. Everything in and outside the building presented a clean and neat appearance, and considering the many difficulties he has in operating a school in an old, poorly planned and dilapidated building such as the present Shingwauk Home, I think he deserves great credit. I saw many improvements since my last visit to the Shingwauk Home two years ago.\n\nARCHITECT.\nNovember 17th, 1938.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General -\n\nIn transmitting memorandum from Mr. Orr regarding the Shingwauk Home, I would subscribe myself as in agreement with his opinions in the particulars discussed, i.e., the present state of the building; the inadvisability of spending any money in attempting to renovate it; and also in regard to his praise of the excellent manner in which the school has been conducted by Reverend Mr. Hives in adverse circumstances.\n\nIn my opinion this school should be replaced by a modern building at the earliest possible date, and if circumstances of a financial character warrant, I would recommend that an item be placed in the Estimates for the coming year, in order that a beginning may be made on this project.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General -\n\nIn transmitting memorandum from Mr. Orr regarding the Shingwauk Home, I would subscribe myself as in agreement with his opinions in the particulars discussed, i.e., the present state of the building; the inadvisability of spending any money in attempting to renovate it; and also in regard to his praise of the excellent manner in which the school has been conducted by Reverend Mr. Hives in adverse circumstances.\n\nIn my opinion this school should be replaced by a modern building at the earliest possible date, and if circumstances of a financial character warrant, I would recommend that an item be placed in the Estimates for the coming year, in order that a beginning may be made on this project.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n**INFORMATION**\n\n| DATE | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------|\n| Dec. 5 | $285.00 |\n\n**DESCRIPTION**\n\nGrant towards salary for night watchman, Shingwauk Home for December quarter at $75.00 a month.\n\n**AUDITED FOR PAYMENT**\n\n**I HEREBY CERTIFY** that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n---\n\n**FORM No. 109**\n\nAgent\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6212, file 460-5, part 3)\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nWe have just come through one of the coldest snaps I have, so far, experience in Algoma, and I assure you I have no wish to have the experience repeated. At least not under existing conditions. It really seems impossible to keep any heat in this old building when the temperature gets as low as we have just recently had it.\n\nWith all the persistent and constant firing, until I was afraid of boilers bursting, we were unable to keep out the frost. On the night after Christmas day, a thirty foot two inch hot water pipe burst, we had to empty the system that heats up the girls' part of the building, and the plumbers were here until after midnight the next night repairing the damage, and cleaning up the mess. The next day two radiators in the classroom burst, and we had another system to empty, and repair.\n\nSince Dec. 14th., we have burnt over twenty two tons of coal besides cords of wood and still we were cold. The heating system is quite inadequate to properly heat this building, and yet no other would be any better because there are innumerable cracks in the old walls, and the pipes seem to lie in such curious and dangerous places.\n\nMy hope is that the time is not far off when the good news of a new building is assured. May I wish you a very happy New Year, and success in your great work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHarold W.

Having seen your school building I can understand the existing conditions thoroughly and fully sympathize with you.\n\nIn reference to the prospect of having a new building, I may say that Mr. Orr and I are quite convinced of this necessity and the Honourable the Superintendent General agrees with us in our opinion. The only question is one of money and, of course, that is a very serious one. I have still hope that before the coming session reaches an end the financial horizon will have cleared sufficiently to warrant us putting a sum in the Supplementary Estimates to make at least a start upon a new building during the coming summer.\n\nMany thanks for your good wishes for the coming year which I heartily reciprocate.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nReverend C.

I have estimated the cost to be approximately $35.00. Will you kindly place this matter before the Department at your earliest convenience. We also need very much repairing done on the building, but in view of the possibility of a new building in the not-too-distant future, I would recommend that only really necessary repairs be made. These consist of tinting or walls in some of the dormitories, play-room etc., These should be done in order to make them, or keep them sanitary. Floors in playrooms require patching, and some of the roof requires repairing. I estimate the cost would be approximately $100.00. I would be very much obliged if you would place this matter before the Department, asking them to make us this grant, so that the work may be done before the heavier outside work comes on.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nGordon Sims Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

Orr,\nStaff Architect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Slate Blackboards\n\nUntil about a year ago practically all the slate blackboards put into Canadian schools came from Pennsylvania, and were uniformly good in quality. The high rate of exchange, sales tax and excise tax increased the cost of American slate to such an extent that slate blackboards from other sources entered this market, and to meet this competition considerable Pennsylvania slate of an inferior quality was supplied.\n\nFor the past twenty-five years we have supplied Canadian schools with \"selected stock\" slate blackboards under the name \"Tunnel Brand\". In order to maintain the high quality of this \"Tunnel Brand\" slate we recently secured Canadian distributional rights for blackboard slate from a certain European quarry, the quality and character of whose slate is recognized the world over. This slate combines those essential qualities of even texture, dark color, absence of all faults and a low calcium carbonate content insuring against fading and deterioration during years of use.\n\nWe are bringing these slate blackboards to the attention of the leading architects, some of whom have already had an opportunity of using them. One firm of architects who build a great many schools, and into one of whose schools these blackboards were installed this summer writes as follows:\n\n\"We will have no hesitancy in specifying these boards again and will be pleased to have an outline from you as to just what quality and manufacture of slate this is, so that we can incorporate it in our specifications in the future\".\n\nShould you care to examine a sample of this slate we will be glad to send same, and also to have you suggest to your contractors that they ask us for prices.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.G.McK/S\n\nIndian Affairs.

G. Orr,\nStaff Architect.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIn connection with the new Residential Indian School at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, which is to be built under the supervision of your Department, and tenders for which close on August 31st, we note on referring to the plans and specifications for this building that there is a certain make of Ash Hoist specified without any mention being made in regard to substitution of other suitable equipment.\n\nProbably your specification was drawn up covering the particular make of Hoist specified due to the fact that you are unaware that such equipment is made in Canada.\n\nIn this connection we are sending you under separate cover a copy of our General Catalogue No. 30 and would refer you to Section K, dealing with Ash Handling Equipment, and a perusal of this section will show you the various standard types of both Hand-operated and Electrically-operated Ash Hoists which are manufactured by us at Niagara Falls, Ontario, from Canadian materials and by Canadian labour.\n\nThese Ash Hoists have been adopted as standard equipment by many leading Canadian Architects and we have furnished these Hoists for a great many Federal and Provincial Buildings throughout the Dominion.\n\nThe Hoist as called for in your specification covering the new Indian School at Sault Ste. Marie is our Model 2A as shown in the lower right-hand illustration on page 4 of Section K of our Book 30, and this Hoist is provided with a door opening and closing device which automatically opens and closes the sidewalk doors when the main car is lowered. In addition the frame of the sidewalk doors is built up of structural steel channels and is provided with a condensation gutter which ensures these doors being as water-tight as it is possible to make them.\nThe lifting unit is our Triple Gear type of Chain Block which is built into the hoisting head and this block is provided with an automatic brake which sustains the load at any point.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith a copy of our quotation for this particular Hoist which quotation is being sent to the various Contractors tendering on the job, and we are wondering whether, in view of the fact that we are Canadian Manufacturers of twenty years' standing, you will not agree to our Hoist being adopted in this instance subject, of course, to price and other considerations being equal.\n\nWe should appreciate hearing from you in regard to this matter at your convenience, and in the meantime hold ourselves at your disposal for any further information you may require in regard to the various products we manufacture.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE HERBERT MORRIS CRANE & HOIST COMPANY, LIMITED,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.W.R.\nEncl.-Copy of quotation.\n\nORDER DEPARTMENT.\nTHE HERBERT MORRIS CRANE & HOIST COMPANY\nLIMITED\nNIAGARA FALLS, CANADA\n\nDATE August 24/34.\nPROPOSAL No. 116.\n\nWe propose to furnish you, constructed in accordance with the following specification, and subject to our usual conditions:\n\nONE 1/4-TON MORRIS MODEL 2A DISAPPEARING TYPE ASH HOIST as illustrated in the lower right-hand corner of page 4 of Book 170, and arranged for lifting a load car approximately 1'6\" above the top of the areaway or approximately 4'6\" above the grade level.

I have had a varied experience as construction and survey engineer, doing all the survey work for the buildings of the above Company, also watching the contractors to see that they lived up to specifications and made surveys of coal and ore piles. Lately I have been with the engineering staff of the Trans-Canada-Highway as locating engineer.\n\nFor several years I was member of the American Federation of Heating and Ventilating Engineers Society and still have my papers in that connection and have done considerable inspecting work in this connection for private individuals.\n\nI feel that I have every qualification to handle the inspection of this new building in all departments, my home is here and I can devote all my time to the work.\n\nI trust that you will consider my application favorable and that I will hear from you.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nWilliam S. Wilson.\n\n210 McGregor Ave.\nThis Trade Mark guarantees genuine White Pine (Pinus Strobus). Insist that every piece you buy be stamped with this trade mark.\nAugust 29th,\n1934.\n\nR. Garnet Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect for the Department,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nThanks for your letter of the 28th in which you say you will consider the matter of using White Pine in the proposed new Shingwauk Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have also received a copy of your reply to the Crane Lumber Company of Thessalon in which you state that the interior finish is to be of Douglas Fir.\n\nFor strength, such as timbers, Douglas Fir is without doubt the strongest Canadian wood but, for panelling or decorative purposes, Canadian White Pine (Pinus Strobua) is, we believe supreme. In the first place, it does not shrink, swell or warp as much as other woods do and, when it is put up, it stays put. Also, it does not have to be veneered but the panelling can be erected right on the job.\n\nUnder separate cover, we are mailing you a book we recently published and, on pages 14, 15, 16 and 17, you will find some rather good photographic reproductions of White Pine panelling and interior work.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

Marie. The sample which we are expressing to you shows a planer finish on one side, a carbondium saw finish on one edge, rough planer finish on the other side, rock face on the two ends and diamond saw cut on the back. You will note that this is a very close grained hard Limestone.\n\nWe have used this in portion of the new Armouries Building at Toronto, for School for the Board of Education, Doulews store front, and has been specified for the first two storeys of the new Fair Office Bldg. We have also used it for the Ontario Savings Bank, which was erected recently in Ottawa.\n\nWe have submitted a quotation for supplying this material on the Indian School above mentioned, to the general contractors, and if our quotation should show a saving in cost over other stones specified, we would appreciate very much having you consider seriously the use of this material.\nMr. W.G.
