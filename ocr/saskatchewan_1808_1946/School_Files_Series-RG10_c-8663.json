I will be left with two men to do all this work, and one of them is to have three weeks holidays in July. The other one is on his holidays now. We have around forty tons of hay to put up also. It is absolutely impossible to hire a man for farm work in this district, on account of the air ports etc., so that you can see that I am in rather of a predicament if these boys are allowed to go home at this time.\n\nWe have the prospects of a wonderful crop. The wheat is heading out already, and is a wonderful stand of grain.\n\nHoping to hear from you as soon as possible,\n\nI am,\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nP/S. I would have written about this matter sooner, but it was not until two or three days ago, that I knew this situation was arising.\n\nIf you should decide that these boys are to be allowed to go home for July and August, I would ask you to advise me what to do for help, as I have no solution for the problem myself.\n\nPlease wire reply.\n\n[Signature]\nMr. Hoey,\nDep. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014\n\nWe have had a very fine year at the school in Portage la Prairie, and the children are going home in good health and well clothed.\n\nWe have had no truancy cases this year and the children on the whole have been quite contented and happy.\n\nIt has been the custom in this school for the Principal to keep five of the senior boys through the holidays, to carry on the work of the farm. Last year I paid the boys forty dollars apiece, and took them to the Brandon fair for a day, also the Portage fair for a day, and they go to town Wed. and Sat. evenings to the picture show etc.\n\nThis year we plan the same program, except that I am paying them fifty dollars instead of forty, as wages are higher.\n\nWe are milking twenty cows now and have more to freshen. All pure bred Jerseys, and the children have been drinking all this milk. During the holidays we take the cream to the creamery and build up a credit for butter.\n\nLast year we threshed around 5000 bushels of grain, filled two silos approx. 100 tons. 1200 bushels of potatoes, and had wagon loads of other vegetables for our own use. We did this work all by ourselves without extra help. We have two men on the staff, and myself. I worked with them as I have had considerable experience on the farm.\n\nThis year the Fathers of two of the boys whom I wish to keep, insist that I let them go home, as they need them, and have had a lawyer write to me to that effect, and threatened further procedure.\n\nOne Father Thomas Myerson has fifteen acres in crop, and Wallace Petters the other has around seventy-five acres. He believes he has three smaller boys in the school. His boy is sixteen this month.\n\nI have no trouble with the boys staying if the parents would keep out of it. In fact some of them would sooner stay. I have been here almost two years, and have not had a case of smoking or swearing on the premises since I came, so they are pretty fine boys. I do not employ any staff member who smokes. Not that I am bigoted about smoking, but just as policy, to set an example to the children.\n\nI feel that after these boys have been here ten years, they owe something to the school, and that it is not asking too much that they remain for the summer months. Those who were coming back for another year, I gave a months holiday in the fall, after the other children came back.\n\nI have taken this matter up with Mr Waite and also Mr Hamilton. They think the boys should stay, but are not sure of what the law actually is, and advised me to get a ruling from Ottawa on the matter.\n\nIf one boy is allowed to go, of course the parents will all want them,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Affairs\nMines and Resources\nOttawa, June 26, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. McNeill:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 24th instant, in which you seek information with respect to the employment of a number of boys, five in all, at the school during the holiday season.\n\nIt is noted that the fathers of two of these boys are insisting on the discharge of their sons.\n\nThe Minister has power to compel an Indian pupil to attend an Indian day or residential school between the ages of 7 and 16 years. He can, where a pupil displays evidences of waywardness or delinquency, compel such pupil to remain an additional two years. I am convinced, however, that the Minister would not be justified in asking either of these two pupils to remain for an additional two-year period.\n\nIt is my hope that you may be able to persuade these boys to remain. The boy who is 16 might be formally discharged and re-employed as a farm hand at the school. Inspector Hamilton, if he has the time at his disposal, might assist you in working out a solution to the problem. I am sending forward a copy of this letter to him.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

The girls are numbered\u20140288, Georgina Chaski; 0309 Doreen Chaski; the boy, George Clifford, 252. Aged 13 years, 11 years and 13 years respectively.\n\nThe man claimed that the children were poorly fed, that they were abused by the matron\u2014Mrs. McNeill wife of the Principal\u2014and other complaints of a minor nature. I had the Chaski family and the Principal in the office, found that the eldest girl had been working at a cafe in town during the holidays and that most of the complaints were unfounded. I called at the school on several occasions at meal times, and consider the children well-fed. It is my opinion that Chaski and his wife expect the children to work, both the boy and the eldest girl can obtain work without difficulty. The woman especially is against the children attending school and it would appear that the girl and boy would rather work than attend school.\n\nThere is no doubt that difficulty will be experienced in having these children return to school. I have interviewed the man on several occasions and he refuses to send them. Before obtaining the services of the R.C.M.P. Police I would be pleased to receive Department advice in this matter.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The girl is 16 years of age.\n\nThis girl's father is Sam Cameron and he is a soldier overseas. Her mother has been dead for some years. Her grandfather is resident on the Swan Lake Reserve, but I would not recommend her staying with him.\n\nIt was the request of the father, Sam Cameron, that his children remain at school until his return, or until they reach the age of 18 years.\n\nI would recommend that Isobel be allowed to remain at school.\n\nJ.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nHepon Chaski of the Sioux Village refuses to allow his two girls and one boy to return to the Portage la Prairie Residential School. The girls are numbered 0288, Georgina Chaski; 0309, Doreen Chaski; the boy, George Clifford, 252. Aged 13 years, 11 years and 13 years respectively.\n\nThe man claimed that the children were poorly fed, that they were abused by the matron, Mrs. McNeill, wife of the Principal, and other complaints of a minor nature. I had the Chaski family and the Principal in the office, found that the eldest girl had been working at a cafe in town during the holidays and that most of the complaints were unfounded. I called at the school on several occasions at meal times, and consider the children well fed. It is my opinion that Chaski and his wife expect the children to work, both the boy and the eldest girl can obtain work without difficulty. The woman especially is against the children attending school and it would appear that the girl and boy would rather work than attend school.\n\nThere is no doubt that difficulty will be experienced in having these children return to school. I have interviewed the man on several occasions and he refuses to send them. Before obtaining the services of the R.C.M. Police I would be pleased to receive Department advice in this matter.\n\n(Sgd.) J. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 27, 1944.\n\nMr. J.

Before the Magistrate will give judgment in this matter he wishes to be advised on the following points -\n\n1. How does the Department bring the Sioux Indian as an Indian under the meaning of the Indian Act, Section 2, subsection (a)?\n\n2. A statement relative to the Long Plain Sioux Reserve; who holds title to this land or the reserve. In other words how are the Sioux a particular band?\n\nI understand that the Sioux band of Indians, of which Chaski is a member, occupy their own reserve, these lands being purchased by appropriation from the Cree band of Indians upon surrender. In order that these lands can be termed a reserve within the meaning of Section 2 (j) of the Indian Act the lands in question would have to be set apart by treaty or otherwise for the use or benefit of or granted to a particular band of Indians of which the legal title is in the Crown.... If the wording of the vote states that these lands were purchased for the Sioux Indians then in my opinion this land is a reserve within this said subsection and it follows that Chaski is a member of a band of Indians as defined in the Indian Act and, therefore, an Indian.\n\nI do not presume to interpret the law for the Magistrate but would suggest the statements as requested by Indian Agent Waite be sent forward so that he can place them before the Magistrate.\n\nSolicitor.\n#6 - Henry Plains \u2014 Oct. 2876\n1913\n\n#8A - Lot 14\nPortage la Prairie \u2014 Oct.

I refer in this regard to the following:\n\nNo. 6 - Long Plain, set aside as a reserve by Order-in-Council 2876 in the year 1913;\n\nNo. 8 A - Lot 14, Portage la Prairie Parish, set aside as a reserve by Order-in-Council of October 15, 1936.\n\nIf Chaski belongs to either of the above, it is our opinion that this land is a reserve within the meaning of Section 2 - Subsection (j) of the Indian Act, and it follows that Chaski is a member of a Band of Indians as defined in the Indian Act and is therefore an Indian.\n\nActing Director.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept.

Quarterly Return\" for the above school for the quarter ending September the thirtieth I must explain why certain pupils from the Roseau Reserve in the Selkirk agency are shown to have been absent from school during September. I must also add that four children from the same reserve still have not been returned. Three of these come from the Laroque family and are all under twelve years of age. The fourth is Joe Tom a boy of fourteen.\n\nClasses on\n\nThe above school opened the Tuesday of the fourth, the day following Labor Day. The whole staff was here to assume the regular duties the last day of August. Everything was in readiness.\n\nThe truck that took the Roseau children home at the end of June had been hired to go after them. However Mr. Brad the farm Instructor thought it might be better if he obtained a truck or cars near the Reserve. That I could pay them the amount I had originally planned to pay a man with truck from Portage La Prairie. This was agreed upon. Mr. Brad was able to round up about half the number of children and had them back to school without delay. His intentions were to bring the remainder without delay.\n\nDays passed and I waited expecting each day that the children would arrive. On the twentieth I wrote to him and in his immediate reply he stated- \"That reason these children are not back to school is on account of weather conditions. The roads around here have been impossible and these children are over in the states. They cannot get back here and I cannot go for them. As soon as conditions are better I will go after them.\"\n\nOn receipt of the letter part of which I have just copied I phoned Mr. McPherson the agent. In a couple of days another group of children were returned. However there are still the four mentioned above who are still not back.\n\nIt is extremely difficult these days to finance the average Indian school and for this reason among others we are\nanxious to have our full quota on hand from the beginning. I do not hesitate to say that the failure of the children from Roseau to return to school at the opening date is something that should result in financial loss to the school. All was in readiness for their reception and a way had been provided for their transportation. A principal can do no more.\n\nTrusting that you may consider sympathetically the position of the school in the above matter. Likewise I hope you will urge the return of the four children whose names I have already mentioned from Roseau. I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

These boys had spent the night in a culvert and RHEAULT had taken them in. It was believed that they had run away from a home. I requested the operator to contact Mr. RHEAULT to detain them and proceeded to Elie per Police car 8230.\n\nOn arrival at Elie I found that the two boys had escaped from Mr. RHEAULT and were heading East on the C.N.R. tracks. We took pursuit but as soon as the boys saw us, they went North West through the fields. In the meantime, having reported this matter to Station VIGE, I learned from the radio station that the two above named boys had run away from the Indian Residential School, Portage, the previous afternoon. Pursuit continued but we lost the boys. We then picked up their trail South and East of Elie, but again lost the boys. It was again picked up near the cemetery, South and West of Elie and by 12 noon, we again caught sight of the boys running across an open field where we thought we had them cornered against the LaSalle River. They promptly waded through the river up to their waists about one hundred yards ahead of me. I followed them through the river and as they started running from the opposite bank, two local citizens assisting in the search came out of the bush and headed them off. Both boys were captured at 12:15. By this time, Cst. Bailey arrived with police dog Lennie and we conveyed the boys to Portage la Prairie where I handed them over to A.G. Huston Esq., Principal of the Indian Residential School, obtaining a receipt.\n\nThe boys stated that they were trying to reach Dominion City as their mother was ill, but this story was later changed and they stated that their mother was in the U.S.A.\n\nExpenses: $2.50, Period Oct. 16th - 31st. .50\u00a2\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is quite a surprise to me as I had not been aware that any negotiations to that end had been in progress. I understand that it is part of the ethical code in such matters to consult the principal from which the children are to be moved.\n\nThe three children referred to are excellent children and have been in attendance at the Portage La Prairie Indian school for some time. I have been at a loss to know who asked for their discharge and the reason why they should be taken away from the school where they have been in attendance.\n\nLast year about this time the same trouble arose but was righted in time to avoid any problem.

Mr. Jones, Principal of the Portage Residential School phoned my home last night and requested permission to bring by plane to Winnipeg six children from Island Lake. I told him it would be necessary to obtain the Department's authority because of two reasons:\n\n1. Transportation costs.\n2. Children have not been medically examined.\n\nMr. Jones stated there were many children on the Reserve without opportunity for education and he felt that those applying should be granted the privilege. Some of the children concerned are related to the late Ewart Monias who taught school at Nelson House.\n\nThe cost I am advised by Central Northern Airlines, who service the district, will be as follows: Children, half fare up to 12 years of age. This amounts to $35.15 from Island Lake to Winnipeg. The children could be sent from Winnipeg to the Portage School by special taxi for a total sum of $12.00. Grand total for the six pupils will be $222.90, plus meals and unforeseen expenses.\n\nThe plane will be going to Island Lake September 16th or 17th and if permission is granted to bring these children in, I should know at once in order that I may advise Mr. Stevenson, Assistant Agent at Island Lake.\n\nA.

I wish to confirm the following Army Signal sent today:\n\n\"Department not prepared to authorize children being brought from Island Lake to Portage la Prairie. Letter follows.\"\n\nAt the present time we have not received any nomination from the United Church of Canada for a teacher for the Island Lake U. C. School, but we are communicating with them again and it is hoped that a teacher will be secured.\n\nAs you intimate in your letter, it is doubtful if we should bring children such a long distance without previous medical examination.\n\nIn any case, the approval of the Indian Agent should first be obtained before children are sent such a distance to a residential school. Evidently, that has not been done. It is possible that there may be children at Island Lake who require institutional care, but certainly the Indian Agent is the best man to give us that information. It might be well for you to communicate with Mr. Goodman and ascertain from him if there are any children at Island Lake who actually need institutional care. In the meantime, if the school is re-opened there is no reason why the children at Island Lake should not attend it, if their parents are able to look after them.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSept. 12th, 1947\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Fortage la Prairie Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child ..................................................

Mr. Jones made little comment and appeared to accept the decision. To-day I received a 'phone call from the Central Northern Airways that the children were arriving and the company were instructed by 'phone to send them to Portage. The company thought the message came from this office and later 'phoned back for further information.\n\nOn learning I had not 'phoned they contacted the Portage School and were advised that a wire had been received from Island Lake, stating the Indian parents were paying for the transportation.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nOn my recent visit to Norway House, Indian Agent Goodman asked me if I could find employment for Mrs. Stanley Settee in Portage la Prairie, and also suggested that I take into our School her three children. This I have done. The reason for this request was the disruption in the home. Stanley, her husband, has been drinking and when under the influence of liquor threatens his wife with bodily harm. He also requested that his children be placed in my care and stated that he would pay the transportation cost. There may be some difficulty in collecting this money. I am forwarding the account for the transportation of these three children and their mother who had charge of them, for your consideration please. Mr. Goodman will endeavour to collect this sum from Stanley if he remains in constant employment, but if he should be dismissed for his conduct there will be no way of collecting the money.\n\nMrs. Settee's conduct has been above reproach. She is a good woman, and I have been fortunate in securing a good position near here where she can see her children every Sunday.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\n\n(Rev.)

Doreen Settee was attending the Brandon Residential School and has now been transferred to the Portage la Prairie Residential School. The father Stanley Settee is responsible for the fares of his wife and Doreen. Fares of Stanford and Frank are payable by the Department and Mr Goodman requested Mr Jones to have the Selkirk Navigation Co submit invoice to this office in triplicate and we would voucher for same.\n\nI do not understand Mr Jones writing the Department with regard to this matter as Mr Goodman guaranteed payment of these fares and Mr Jones should have forwarded the bill to this office as was his understanding with us. Stanley Settee the father has already deposited $30.00 in this office against payment of fares for Doreen & his wife and is quite willing to pay the balance as soon as he knows amount of same.\nIf the Department will forward account received from Mr Jones we will have the Selkirk Navigation Co submit invoices as described above and will forward by Postal Money Order the fares of Mrs and Doreen Settee.\n\nI trust this clears this matter up to the satisfaction of the Department and also Mr Jones.\n\nQ.P.

Your Dept. is then advised of the admission to the Residential School of this child and the allowance is suspended. During the month of October this child runs away from school and returns to her home on the Reserve where she starts attending the Day School regularly.\n\nThe problem now, is this child entitled to be re-instated for Family Allowances while she is still considered a pupil of the Residential School. We feel that the Allowance should not be paid until her discharge from the Residential School has been approved by Ottawa and she attends the Day School regularly.\n\nAt your earliest convenience would you kindly advise regarding this important procedure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) D. E. Boyle\nfor A. G. Hamilton,\nSuperintendent.\nYour letter of December 21st, 1948, file F.A. 3, to the Regional Director of Family Allowances in Winnipeg was referred by Mr. Howden to the National Director of Family Allowances, who in turn referred it to this office for attention.\n\nIt is not understood why this matter was referred to Mr. Howden, in view of the fact that Indian Affairs Branch are responsible for the administration of Family Allowances for the Indian population of Canada. If any points arise concerning this administration, they should be referred to Mr. Davis, Regional Supervisor, at Winnipeg, or to this office.\n\nI am enclosing copy of a letter to Mr. Howden, which is self-explanatory, which I hope covers the point raised. Your action in future cases should be to immediately report the circumstances to Indian Affairs Branch Head Office for the attention of the Superintendent of Education, who will then decide whether the child in question should be formally discharged from Residential School or not.\n\nIf this explanation is not clear, please do not hesitate to write me further.\n\nEnc.\n\nH.

It should be referred to our Regional Supervisor in Winnipeg or to this office.\n\nThe question raised is one that has occurred quite often since the inception of the Family Allowances Act. If a child is admitted to Residential School with the approval of the Superintendent of Education at Ottawa, the child is considered to be in Residential School until properly discharged. If the child runs away from Residential School, he becomes truant, and the fact that he attends a Day School does not make him eligible for Family Allowances until such time as the case has been dealt with by the Superintendent of Education and the child is properly discharged from Residential School.\n\nEach case has to be dealt with on its own merits and an Indian Superintendent should immediately report the whole circumstances to our\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hamilton,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nOn Saturday evening, the 26th of January, 1949, four of our senior girls left the school without permission about 7:15 in the evening. Their absence was discovered about 9:15 when the senior girls were going to the dormitory. I immediately phoned to the C.N. Railway to check on the tickets issued to the station at Edwin which is the nearest to the Long Plain Reserve. I also informed the R.C.M.P. and asked them to be on the lookout and the area pulled out and to keep watch on the highways and roads. I also phoned Mr. Russell, your assistant, informing him of the incident and what measures had been taken to find the girls. Then I phoned to Mr. Clarke, the farm instructor at Long Plain, asking him to keep a lookout for the girls. I also phoned to Mr. Grant Lambe of Edwin, who owns a bombardier and had been in Portage that evening, asking if he had seen the girls on the road. He had not seen them but suggested they would travel on the tracks made by his bombardier or on the highway. Mr. Clarke was of the opinion that some of the Indians who had been in Portage that night would pick them up. All these suggestions were very far out. The girls for some unknown reason decided to travel by the river. This was disastrous as the river is subject to overflows and the girls got their feet wet and of course their feet would soon freeze.\n\nOn Sunday morning at 10:45 a.m., Mr. Clarke phoned to say that the girls were at Widow Wescoup's place and that their feet were badly frozen. I asked that the girls should be brought in to the hospital right away and I also informed the R.C.M.P. and Mr. Russell. The police went out and found only two of the girls. The other two the others had taken them home. This was a great mistake as it delayed their admission to the hospital. I phoned to Dr. Kettlewell and I believe Mr. Clarke and Mr. Russell did so. I was at the hospital at 2:30 p.m. on Sunday the 30th, when Dr. Kettlewell arrived to attend to the girls. I will leave the Doctor to give you a report of the condition of the girls. The names, ages and numbers of the girls are:\n\n- 0306 Rowena Smoke, 14 years.\n- 0307 Pearl Woods, 13 years.\n- 0310 Annie Assiniboine, 14 years.\n- 0329 Lillian Daniels, 15 years.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Joseph Jones.\nEverything possible was done to locate the girls and as soon as located they were rushed to the hospital. It was necessary to hire a bombardier to get two. I attach a report submitted by Mr. Jones.\n\nThe children stated they were well fed and had no complaints against Mr. Jones or other members of the staff, but they did not like Mrs. Ross.\n\nA.Y. Hamilton,\nSuperintendent.\n\nMrs. Atkin:\n\nRe the girls' complaints:\n\n1. Periodically we should remind all who have contact with Indian children, in anger or affection, just how their contacts may be exaggerated, distorted or perverted.\n\n2. If not for minutes, how long?\n\n3. One of these days we'll have to inaugurate a record of punishments for pupils.\n\n4. Sometimes interfere with music appreciation\n\n5. Dad!\n\n6. How much repression is advisable?\n\n7. Properly fitted, properly laundered night-gowns shouldn't tear easily unless the Reds are raising a rumpus in the dormitory.\n\n8. This is a rule that indicates that the school probably leans to the repressive side.\n\nMr. Jones has his mind upon the children, and can neither see nor hear them. Maybe an article \"Behavior at Meals\" or a circular letter is indicated.\n\nC.A.R.C. 4/19/49\nFebruary 1st, 1949\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nTruancy, Portage School, January 29th, 1949.\n\nI have investigated the truancy of four senior girls from the Portage Indian Residential School which took place Saturday evening, January 29th, 1949. The four girls were Rowena Smoke, 14 years, Pearl Wood, 13 years, Annie Assiniboine, 14 years and Lillian Daniels, 15 years.\n\nI interviewed the girls today in the General Hospital where they are being treated.\n\nAnnie Assiniboine gave only one reason. She stated they had planned to run away some days ago because they did not like the matron, Mrs. Ross. On the Saturday afternoon in question, the girls wanted to stay inside and listen to a special program of cowboy music. They said Mrs. Ross refused permission and made them go outside to play and skate. Apparently the girls were cross because they could not have their way and so decided to go home. I would just add here, - Mrs. Ross was sick on Saturday although she may have issued the instructions, she was not on duty.\n\nThe complaints from the others for their dislike of Mrs. Ross could be listed as follows:\n\n1. She strikes us on the head with her fist.\n2. If we take more than five minutes to do our hair at night she makes us sit on the floor in the corner of the dormitory for one or two hours.\n3. She neglects us when she comes on duty and if any are missing she strips us.\n4. We are locked outdoors and made to play outside from four to six p.m.\n5. If our shoes are worn out we get boys running shoes and sometimes they do not fit.\n6. We are not allowed to talk to the boys in school - not even our brothers.\n7. If we tear our night-gowns, we are made to sleep in boys clothes - shirt and shorts.\n8. We are not allowed to talk at mealtime.\n\nIn connection with the complaints, they are explained as follows by Mr. Jones:\n\n1. At times Mrs. Ross rapped on their heads using her knuckles as when rapping on a door.\n2. Some girls waste time and play around at night so a stricter time is given. Mr. Jones says five minutes is incorrect.\n3. Checking clothes is routine work and apparently some punishment is necessary to check waste.\n4. Mr. Jones claims he insists that the children get outside for fresh air. If the weather is nice then they must remain out. The children look well and none had serious colds.\n5. Shoes are a big problem and an expensive item. Naturally a half worn out shoe cannot be discarded. The girls do not like running shoes - they want oxfords.\n6. Certainly boys and girls cannot wander about the building to visit as they wish. Meetings can be arranged and they skate together on the same rink.\n7. Children are often careless and waste cannot be allowed.\n8. This is a rule authorized by the Principal.\n\nThe route taken to get home was not anticipated by anyone and the parents do not know why they chose the river. It is presumed they figured there was less chance of meeting anyone.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Truancy, Portage Indian Residential School.\n\nRelative to my report, I now enclose a report by Dr. J.W. Kettlewell, the medical supervisor. The girls are progressing but at present the ultimate damage cannot be determined. No doubt all four girls will experience considerable pain and suffering during their period of recovery.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nSuperintendent.\n\nc.c. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor.\nFebruary 3, 1948.\n\nMr. Hamilton,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Lilian Daniel\nRowena Smoke\nPearl Woods\nAnnie Assiniboine\n\nThese four girls were admitted to Portage General Hospital on Sunday, January 30, after having been out all night in cold weather. All four girls suffer from frozen feet and mild degrees of frost bite on the hands.\n\nLilian Daniel has both feet badly frozen. The feet are badly blistered from the toes half way to the heels. The toes are cyanosed. Although the toes are at present in very poor shape, I feel there is good possibility that she shall have a complete recovery. There is, however, a possibility that she may lose one or more toes due to gangrene.\n\nRowena Smoke also has both feet badly frozen. Her condition is the least favourable of all four girls. She is more likely to lose one or more of her toes.\n\nPearl Woods has her left foot severely frozen. The circulation in her toes seems to be improving. There is a good chance that she will have a complete recovery.\n\nAnnie Assiniboine froze only a portion of her left foot. Only the outer side of the foot is affected. The only toe involved is the little toe of the left foot. There are signs of early gangrene of this toe. There is only slight possibility that she may lose this toe.\n\nThe injuries of all these girls make it impossible to estimate length hospitalization which will be necessary or the possible outcome. I doubt very much if any of these girls will be out of the hospital in less than two weeks. Some of the girls may be there much longer.\n\nYour sincerely,\n\nJK/AP\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6275, file 583-10, part 2)\nAt approximately 9:15 P.M. on this date a phone call was received from Mr. JONES, Superintendent of the Indian School stating that the following four girls were missing: (1) Rowena SMITH, 15 years, (2) Lillian DAVIS, 15 years, (3) Annie ASSINIBOINE, 14 years, (4) Pearl WOODS, 12 years.\n\nThese four girls are all from the Long Plain Indian Reserve in the Red River District and as there was a C.M.R. train leaving for Regina in a few minutes a patrol was made to the C.M.R. station where the train and the station were thoroughly checked without result.\n\nMr. JONES was advised of this and was told that the patrols in Portage would be on the watch for these girls during the night.\n\nAt 10:00 A.M. on this date a phone call was received from Mr. JONES stating that the four girls were at the Widow WESTWOOD's farm which is on the Hood Bridge road near Hood Bridge and that they had frozen feet and should be taken to the hospital as soon as possible.\n\nA patrol was made to the WESTWOOD farm where Rowena SMITH and Pearl WOODS were located and brought back to the Portage General Hospital. Both of these girls were suffering from frozen feet.\n\nInformation was received from the Indians at the WESTWOOD farm that the other two girls had left for Fred CLARK's home, the Indian Farm Instructor, seeking a ride into Portage la Prairie. These two girls were brought into the Portage General Hospital at approximately 4:00 P.M. by Fred CLARK.\n\nDr. KETTLEWELL, the attending doctor, was contacted and he stated that three of the girls might lose some of their toes but that he would not know for a day or two. Annie ASSINIBOINE was not considered badly frozen.\n\nAs no further action will be taken by this Detachment the file is being concluded.\n\nN.B.I.\n\nCONCLUDED HERE.\n\n( A.A.Stupich) Reg.No.16182,\nPortage la Prairie Detachment.\nRe: Rowena SMOKE (15 yrs) et al (Juveniles)\nRunaway Indian girls from United Church Mission, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nThe O.C., \"D\" Division,\nR.C.M.Police, Winnipeg.\n\nFORWARDED, 3-2-49.

The complaints against Mr. Jones have been noted, and it is felt that the repression of these Indian children is, in several instances, undesirable.\n\nThe Department has never approved of corporal punishment for Indian pupils except in the event of complete insubordination. Would you please inform the Reverend Mr. Jones immediately of the following instructions:\n\n1. That corporal punishment will be used only where all other methods of disciplining a pupil have failed.\n\n2. That corporal punishment will be administered only on the hands with a proper school strap (regulation 15\" rubber).\n\n3. That the maximum number of strokes on each hand in no instance exceed four in number for male pupils of over fourteen years of age and in proportion for boys under that age.\n\n4. That all such corporal punishment be administered in the presence of the principal or by the principal.\n5. That a Corporal Punishment Register be maintained at the school containing the following headings:\n\n(a) Date,\n(b) Reason for Punishment,\n(c) By whom administered,\n(d) Witness,\n(e) Signature of pupil punished.\n\n6. That this Register be made available for inspection by all Indian Affairs Branch officials visiting the above.\"\n\nIf such a strap is not available at this school, you may purchase one either locally or through Christie School Supplies in Brandon. We would also like to have an indication from the Reverend Principal as to the rule preventing children from talking at mealtimes. It is understood that the Reverend Principal has his meals apart from the children and can neither see nor hear them; therefore, an explanation of this rule would be appreciated.\n\n[Signature]\nBayard F.

George Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nRe: Portage la Prairie Residential School\n\nFurther to my letter of February 12, please find attached a letter sent to Mr. Indian Superintendent Hamilton today concerning the situation at this school.\n\nThe instructions with regard to corporal punishment are the standard ones issued to such principals as might require guidance in this regard. You will recall that similar instructions were sent to the Reverend Mr. Inglis of the Morley Residential School on February 6, 1947.\n\nI would appreciate any further information which you or the Secretary of the Woman's Missionary Society might receive from the Indians about the treatment which their children are receiving at this school. Dr. Kettlewell has advised Mr. Hamilton that the four girls who ran away are progressing but that the ultimate damage can not be determined at the present time. Lillian Daniels had both feet badly frozen, and there is a possibility that she may lose one or more toes due to gangrene. Rowena Smoke also had both feet badly frozen, and her condition is the least favourable of all the girls. Pearl Woods had her left foot severely frozen. Annie Assiniboine froze only a portion of her left foot, but there are signs of early gangrene in the little toe of the left foot.\nIt may be necessary for the Department to take further action with regard to conditions at this school; in which event, you will be further advised.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nBy Department letter 127-1-10 (E.1) dated October 19th, 1948, approval was given for Rodger Meechas to become a pupil of the Portage Indian Residential School. This boy is the son of Toby and Marie Meechas of the Long Plain Band. He was brought to the school on September 20th, 1948, and remained there for four days when his parents called to take him and their other children to town. Rodger was not brought back. As he is only five years of age, the principal makes request that the boy remain with his parents until school opens next September. I would recommend that this suggestion be approved.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nSuperintendent.\n\nc.c. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor.\n22nd February, 1949.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 10th instant, the Department approves Rodger Meecha's remaining home until 1st September, 1949, on which date he should return to the Portage la Prairie Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe four girls mentioned above are the ones who ran away from school and had their feet badly frozen. Three are back at school, but are determined to run away again. The parents wish to take them home.\n\nMr. Jones claims these pupils are now real heroes in the eyes of the other pupils. Annie Assiniboine ran away in December 1948 and was not punished. The parents came to me and requested I ask Mr. Jones not to cut Annie's hair. I saw Mr. Jones and told him about the request. I also added that this type of punishment was not looked on with favor at Ottawa. He said he was going to write and find out if this was correct but when I last saw him, no letter had been sent. Mr. Jones now claims that all this trouble rests on the fact that Annie Assiniboine was not punished by cutting her hair.\n\nThe four girls mentioned above nearly lost their lives and even yet are determined not to remain in school. The parents also, are determined to take them home. In case a more serious accident happens I request instructions in regard to:- (1) Are the girls to remain in school? If so please give definite instructions. (2) Would the Department approve a transfer to Brandon if parents agree? (3) Does the Department approve cutting girls hair as a punishment and if so will it be in order for Mr. Jones to use this type of punishment on the four girls concerned?\nI feel we assume grave responsibility to keep pupils except under strict guard when they are so determined to leave school. They are not learning anything\u2014they are defiant\u2014and trouble makers. Surely their places could be filled by pupils wanting education.

I have noted the comments of the Reverend Mr. Jones with regard to the cutting of the hair of Annie Assiniboine.\n\nThe Department has always felt that punishment should vary according to the gravity of the fault, its frequency, the effort to resist it and the temperament of the pupil. The punishment should not be degrading and in effect should not dishonour the child in his own eyes. A degrading punishment which diminishes the child's self-respect or which causes the child to lose the respect which he owes his teacher has no place in Christian education. It is felt that the cutting of a pupil's hair definitely falls in this category and should not be resorted to.\n\nWe have always expected that principals and teachers should practice such discipline as may be exercised by a kind, firm and judicious parent in his family. The underlying reason for the corporal punishment regulations outlined in our previous official letter is that in this way teachers can avoid the appearance of indiscreet haste in the discipline of their pupils.\nWe have never received a letter from Mr. Jones with regard to the disciplining of Annie Assiniboine. I am writing to Dr. Dorey today concerning the parents' request that these children be not sent back to the Portage la Prairie School. We have noted their ages and are prepared to approve their transfer to the Brandon Residential School for the remainder of the term.\n\nBernard F.

They desire their child or children who have been pupils in a Roman Catholic dominated residential school, to be admitted into a residential school in charge of personnel of a Protestant Church.\n\nThe claim is made that the latter school is not permitted to accept such children. Can you tell me why?\n\nIn this country of supposed religious freedom, have these parents no right to decide the school to which they will send their children?\n\nOn what conditions can any change be effected?

She is a good girl and a fair student in grade VII. She is happy enough as long as her parents and the two older daughters who are at home stay away, but each visit means a crying spell for them all.\n\nI have always understood that a pupil who returns in September remains for all the school year till June 30, whether they become 16 or not. This girl will benefit by being here and if possible I want to keep her.\n\nIf I let her go I feel it will create a precedent of which the Indian parents will be quick to take advantage.

The reason for the delay in submission of these applications is that the father's signature was required and his whereabouts was unknown. We have just received the signed applications in this office today.\n\nThis is a broken home, Mrs. Abraham having deserted her husband and John being unable to keep up a home Mr. R.S. Davis, Regional Supervisor, Winnipeg, recommended the admission of these children to the school.\n\nB.E. Olson,\nSuperintendent,\nClandeboyes Agency.\nNovember 14, 1949.\n\nMr. B.E. Olson,\nSupt.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated.\n\nVoucher No.: T.1200\n\nDATE: November 2nd, 1949\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 16, 1949, file No. 576-10 (EL) in which you enclosed a copy of Rev. O. B. Strapp's letter regarding two Indian boys - Victor Bruce and Job White.\n\nLast week I received a telephone call from the Winnipeg Police stating that they had the two above mentioned boys in their custody. On receipt of this advice I telephoned Mr. Strapp to have these boys taken back to the Brandon Residential School. Mr. Strapp stated that he would not come for the boys without a police escort. As the boys were not taken from the detention home I telephoned Mr. McLean, Principal, Portage la Prairie Residential School to come in for the boys. The boys only stayed one night at the Portage School when they returned to the Brandon School. They stayed there one night and were away again in the morning. Up to the present time I have not heard of their whereabouts.\n\nIn my opinion these boys are going to continue to roam. One of them does not appear to be any too bright and should never have been sent to a school. I also feel that if these boys had had different treatment when they first entered the Brandon School they would not have started to run away.\n\nI have instructed the police to have these boys picked up again and placed in a detention home at Portage la Prairie until I am able to go north at which time I will return the boys to their reserves.\n\nR.

All the implement firms are turning out the ideal outfits for our work here. At all our schools the most important part of our crop is the row crop. Potatoes, field and tabacco, turnips, carrots, parsnips, sugar beets, mangels and peas. This involves a tremendous amount of hoeing and if we do not have the proper equipment it is a never ending task. The heaviest and most important part comes while the children are on holidays.\n\nI have reported the condition of the tractor that we have here, and I will now give you an extract of a letter to the department written by my predecessor Rev. W.R. Wood in June 1935.\n\n\"In the matter of farm equipment there is a tractor\u2014a very ancient Rumely Oil-Pull which is still conscripted each Fall and made to furnish power for the threshing. It has, I believe, been used for anything else for some time. The Oil-pull is out of date and requires constant tinkering, and in my judgement should be replaced by an up to date tractor which could be used not only for threshing but for ploughing and other field work and for running a grain crusher.\"\n\nDuring the last three four years I have spent a lot money for repairs and oil to keep this worn out tractor running, it cannot be used for field work. May I therefore ask for a grant for tractor and attachmenti row crop drill and cultivator. The cost for tractor, drill and cultivator will be about $1,500.00\n\nThere is no Manure Spreader on the farm and this next Summer we shall have over 200 tons of manure to spread on the fields, the cost of Spreader will be about $200.00\n\nMay I ask for your best consideration of this urgent need.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\nOttawa, February 17, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Jones:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 18th instant, in which you send forward, for departmental consideration, a request for a tractor and row crop drill and cultivator, for use at your school farm.\n\nI must state frankly that there is not even a remote possibility of securing this equipment at any time in the immediate future. Owing to the limited funds at our disposal, we are at this date unable to pay in full the per capita grants to our Indian residential schools and yesterday we notified Dr. Cochrane to this effect. Just what action will be taken in the immediate future to reduce costs at Indian residential schools, I am not in a position to state, but I do feel confident that it will be impossible to secure the money necessary for the purchase of farm equipment. If the time at my disposal will enable me to do so, it is my intention to visit Toronto in the course of a week or so and carefully review the whole matter with the church authorities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend Joseph Jones,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am advised by Rev. Jones, Principal of the Portage la Prairie Residential School, that he required the following poultry wire immediately:\n\n5 rolls of \"Layflat Poultry Netting\" 72 inches\n5 rolls of \" \" 24 inches\n10 lbs. of wire fence staples\n10 lbs. of soft galv. wire for lacing above rolls\n\nI understand this has been ordered from Marshall-Wells Company, and will cost approximately $94.50.\n\nMr. Jones is the one principal making a success of chickens. He has about 450 hens. The children help care for them, and there are no locks on the doors. Apparently the boys like the work and can be trusted. I believe this is a worthwhile work. The fence is required to enlarge feeding grounds and is a permanent improvement. Would the Department allow me to forward a voucher in payment of the wire?\n\nMr. Jones explained the necessity of purchasing certain farming equipment and consequently is finding it difficult to finance. If funds can be made available I would recommend payment of this account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to an expenditure of $94.50 incurred by the Principal of the Portage la Prairie Residential School for the purchase of poultry wire.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation it was found necessary to provide an amount of $2000.00 for necessary improvements to the sewage system at this school. Under these circumstances no other amount was included for repairs and improvements. Besides, the Principal of the Portage la Prairie Residential School should realize that owing to the present purchase regulations he should have submitted a request before making any purchase.\n\nHowever, in view of your recommendation we will endeavour to have the account approved by the Purchasing Branch and, if so, it will be paid. You may, therefore, submit the voucher for our consideration. It should be definitely understood with the Principal of the Portage la Prairie School that no further expenditure this year can be considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.G.

Andrews, where Pete MARIN was interviewed. He stated that he had purchased a set of old harness from Ed. PACIAS, a halfbreed of Portage, on the 6-6-41. He produced this old set of harness which in no way resembled the set lost by the complainant and further stated that the harness which he had stored in the farm instructor's barn for a couple of years. PACIAS had one other set of harness which was also examined but it did not bear the description of the set stolen.\n\nMr. SAWYER, farm instructor of the Long Plains Indian Reserve, was next interviewed and stated that Ed. PACIAS had had an old set of harness stored in his barn for two or three years, and on the 6-6-41, Pete MARIN had made a deal by purchasing this set of harness from PACIAS for $150 and the deal was made between the two in his presence and MARIN removed this old set of harness from his barn. It was ascertained through local enquiries that MARIN had purchased this harness from Ed. PACIAS and not from DANIELS as reported by the complainant and this purchase was made sometime before the harness referred to was alleged to have been stolen.\n\nMr. SAWYER, farm instructor of the Long Plains Indian Reserve, is going to co-operate with this detachment in making enquiries in the reserve from time to time and should he receive any information of value, this office will be notified. A large number of the Indians in the reserve were interviewed and enquiries made by the patrol, but no further information could be obtained.\n\nThis matter has been kept in mind by members of the detachment while on patrol in the rural districts and thoroughness of farms working in the fields have been checked but no harness which resembles that lost by the complainant have been observed. The second land stores at Portage have been checked periodically but without result. The Portage la Prairie City Police advise that they have nothing further in this matter.\n\nP. P. O.\n6.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: September 30th, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie, October 4th, 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the grant per capita. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1941.\n\nPrincipal: O.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31st 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated January 5th 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Manitoba** Agency  \nREPORT of the **Indian Residential** School at **Sandy Bay** on **Sandy Bay Reserve** for Quarter ended **December 31st 1941**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| 0198            | M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1941.\n\nPrincipal: O. Chagnon\n\nDated: Dec. 31st 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due the quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1942.\n\nPrincipal: O.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Agency:** Sandy Bay  \n**School at:** Sandy Bay  \n**Reserve for Quarter ended:** September 30th, 1942\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 1675            | Johnny G.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SANDY BAY INDIAN SCHOOL MARUS P.O., MANITOBA School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian School, Manitoba, School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated April 14, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SANDY RAY INDIAN SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended: June 30th, 1943\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: July 1st, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated July 1st, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at this date, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance at the Sandy Bay Indian School, Manitoba, School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 10, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie, October 4, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated January 1st, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie, this January 3rd, 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian School School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 10, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

entered at the foot of column.**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended ......................................................... 19 ..........\n\nPrincipal ................................................................................\n\nDated ................................................................. 19 ...........\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ...........................................................................\n\nDated at ................................................................. this ................................................................. 19 ..........\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarter's per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Principal Dated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 9-10-44\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Jean Lambeau\n\nDated: 1st of January 1945\n\nActing Principal:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Long Bay Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal: J. Laucke\n\nDated: March 31st 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nMarch 31st 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...Lady Bay Residential...School for the Quarter ended...March 31st...1945...\n\nPrincipal...J.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Sept. 30, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School (Name of School) for the Quarter ended Dated 31st 19__.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 31st 19__\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19__\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nRegn.

and entered at the foot of column.**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residences of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Jean Lambert\n\nDated Dec. 31, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 19[year].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated Dec. 31, 19[year]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Location]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30 1945.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: September 30, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this: ___________________________ 19____\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 31, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 19 .\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Poveshell Bay Residential School] School for the Quarter ended [March 31, 1947].\n\nPrincipal [Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Residential School School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated June 30, 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this day.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils shown on Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which each pupil appears on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: September 30, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie, this 30th September, 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated March 31st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFond No. I.A. 463\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1914.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th 1914\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 463\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Roll, which is obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay School for the Quarter ended 31st Dec. 1948.\n\nPrincipal J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31st, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6275, file 584-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated June 30th 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6275, file 584-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days the pupils were all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, see another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils in residence during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 3rd, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian School for the Quarter ended Dec 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated Dec 31st 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 31st 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 31st 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for any quarter may be calculated by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 31st 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 317             | Douglas Desjarlais | 13  | 1   |      | Sandy Bay       | 22 6 2 6 7 12 4 18 19 10 1 | Shopwork & Farm.        | 8-11-49                  | 92         | 2732                                                                                             |\n| 322             | Joseph Alvin Beaulieu | 12  | 1   |      |                 |                    |                        | 3-1-49                   | 92         | Gone to Brandon Jan.                                                                             |\n| 323             | Stanley Houle      | 12  | 1   |      |                 |                    |                        | 10-1-49                  | 92         | 57                                                                                               |\n| 324             | Horvey Marc Beaulieu | 12  | 1   |      |                 |                    |                        | 11-2-49                  | 73         | Returned 10/10/49                                                                                |\n| 325             | Frank Desjarlais   | 12  | 1   |      |                 |                    |                        | 16-5-49                  | 92         | 57                                                                                               |\n| 326             | Alvin Paul         | 7   | 1   |      | Dog Creek       |                    |                        | 1-8-49                   | 92         | 57                                                                                               |\n| 327             | Orville Maytweasing | 9   | 1   |      |                 |                    |                        | 1-8-49                   | 92         | 57                                                                                               |\n| 328             | Bill Missabib      | 10  | 1   |      |                 |                    |                        | 1-8-49                   | 92         | 57                                                                                               |\n| 329             | Edward Burns       | 11  | 1   |      | Elphinstone     |                    |                        | 1-9-49                   | 92         | Accepted on Oct. 7th, 1949                                                                       |\n| 330             | Aylmor McIvor      | 11  | 1   |      | Sandy Bay       |                    |                        | 1-9-49                   | 92         | Oct. 17, 1949                                                                                    |\n| 331             | Alvin Andrew McIvor | 7   | 1   |      |                 |                    |                        | 1-9-49                   | 92         | Oct. 17, 1949                                                                                    |\n| 332             | Arthur Louis Roulette | 9   | 1   |      |                 |                    |                        | 12-9-49                  | 92         | Oct. 3, 1949                                                                                     |\n| 333             | Roger Houlette     | 6   | 1   |      |                 |                    |                        | 12-9-49                  | 92         | Oct. 3, 1949                                                                                     |\n| 334             | John And.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian School for the Quarter ended Dec 31st 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Dec 31st 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included, on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupil during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SANDY BAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31st 1950.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated MARCH 31st 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent [Signature]\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residences of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31st, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31st 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nthis: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

(RG 10, Volume 6275, file 584-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended... June 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30th 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nthis... 21st July 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1957.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1957\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pacing it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included, on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SANDY BAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31st, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: Jean Lambert, O.M.I.\n\nDated: October 1, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [signature]\n\nthis 30 Oct., 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Res School for the Quarter ended September 30 1951.\n\nPrincipal Jean Lambert O.M.I.\n\nDated October 1 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 30 Oct

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\nThe amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils named on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Res School for the Quarter ended September 30 1951.\n\nPrincipal: Jean Lambert O.M.I.\n\nDated October 1 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated this 30 Oct 1951.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: Jean Lambert, O.M.C.\n\nDated June 30, 1952.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis .................................................. 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\nThe amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDated.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entering the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay School for the Quarter ended 31.12.1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated ........................................... 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ........................................... this ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. IA. 408\n\nAUDITED FOR PAYMENT JAN 20 1953 Treasury Office I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

I am in a critical position; I will have to pay interest on past due accounts and I am having difficulty on every purchase.\n\nLast fall, my September quarter grant has been lost for a while and the Department has given me an advance of $1,000.00 on the December quarter grant. Letter No. 282946-3 of November 18, 1921. I would be much obliged to you if you could do me the same favor this year.\n\nThanking you in advance, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nB.

(RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 13, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe December quarter return of the Sandy Bay Residential school has just been received and shows an average attendance of 70 pupils.\n\nAs you are aware, grant is allowed at the rate of $140.00 per capita. The total amount, therefore, for the December quarter is (70 x $140.00) is $9800.00.\n\nThe manner in which the December quarter return has been computed is as follows:\n\nPrincipal (70 pupils @ $140.00 each) ........................................... $9800.00\nLess overpayment September qr. .................................................. -427.50\nBalance due ...................................................................................... $9372.50\n\nRev. Peres Oblates (70 pupils @ $5. each) ........................................... $350.00\nLess overpayment September qr. .................................................... -10.00\nBalance due ....................................................................................... $340.00\n\nThe reason for the above deductions is that when the September quarter return was received it showed an average attendance of 70 pupils, but, through error the grant was paid at the rate of $165.00 per capita instead of $140.00 per capita. The detailed statement of the manner in which the September quarter grant was paid is as follows:\n\nPrincipal .......................................................................................... $2527.50\nRev. Peres Oblates ............................................................................. $360.00\n\nThe same amount should have been paid for the September quarter as for the December quarter but, through the mistake mentioned, an overpayment of $427.50 was made to you and also an overpayment of $10.00 to the Revs. Peres Oblates. These overpayments are being deducted from the December quarter grant and cheques for the balances due will be forwarded under separate cover.\n\nThe Department regrets the error made in computing the September quarter grant but I trust that this letter will fully explain the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. O. Chagnon, C.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Residential School,\nMarius, M.A.N.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI submit herewith my report of an examination of the books of the above school which I visited for that purpose October 15th.\n\nThe Principal Rev. Father Chagnon produced all the books and records which I asked for including Bank Pass Book, cancelled cheques, and invoices etc. He informed me that an audit of the books had never been made before he accepted that he had not closed up his books since the close of the fiscal year March 31st. It would have taken some considerable time to complete the entries for the past six and a half months so all I could do was to examine the previous fiscal period, April 1928 to March 1929.\n\nA synoptic cash book is used, supplied by the Department and all entries were neatly entered and totalled, the particulars being quite clear and understandable. The Bank Pass Book supplied by the Banque Canadienne Nationale had not been written up since June, so I could not verify the bank balance, but according to the cheques issued since that date and the quarterly grant received in July, the balance at present is $176.49.\n\nThe cheque for the last quarter is expected about the 20th October, and Father Chagnon assured me that all bills for goods and salaries had been paid up to date and that practically no indebtedness existed. According to the invoices on file and the statements rendered by wholesalers in Winnipeg for groceries, shoes, and clothing materials etc., and by the cheque stubs, this appeared to be correct.\n\nWhen examining the cancelled cheques I noticed one for $380.00 in favour of Rev. J.P. Magnon O.M.I. Winnipeg, and later several others for the same amount, and after looking back to the 1927 and 1928 cancelled cheques found others for $395.00. These appeared to have been paid at regular intervals soon after the quarterly grant was received from the Government.\n\nI asked the Principal who Rev. Fr. Magnon was and he informed me that he was the Treasurer of the Oblate Fathers Order in Winnipeg.\n\nI looked through the Synoptic Cash Book, but could find no trace of these cheques having been entered, and asked the Principal how it was, and after I told him that I could not make the totals of the various columns agree with the cheques issued, he stated that the cheques in question were not shown and were an assessment or tax made by the Order, on the number of children in attendance, or in other words a tax on the grant every quarter in order to create a fund to pay deficits of this school or any other school in the jurisdiction of the Order.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThis works out at about $21.75 per pupil per annum, or $5.45 per quarter, or 14% of the grant, a rather considerable item of $1,920.00 per annum.\n\nThe totals of the different classifications of the Synoptic did however, agree with his figures in the annual statement as submitted to Ottawa, yet I was at first puzzled about the various receipts not appearing in the cash book, so after a little prequestioning I was told that the revenue from Farm & Garden was only estimated at $75.00 per month making the $900.00 in statement for the year, but that it might be more. Then this together with other sources of revenue not shown would make up approximately the above mentioned sum subscribed to the Order.\n\nThis other revenue apparently consists of the sale of candies, pork raised on farm, flour purchased wholesale and sold at a profit to Indians in the neighbourhood, and the sale of rabbitkins and other animals etc.\n\nA detailed audit was not made as it would have taken considerable time, and many of the expenditures are bulked and cheques shown in total, then items purchased for staff and neighbouring Indians, from T. Eaton & Co. and other places would have to be recorded, deducted from their salaries, and separated in the Bank a/c and cancelled cheques.\n\nIt was some satisfaction however to obtain the above information as it explains to some extent why I have been unable to reconcile the book figures at other schools, with the figures shown in the various annual statements submitted to Ottawa, and then again I have not always been given access to the cancelled cheques and Bank Pass Book, as at Alexander School.\n\nAttached is a copy of the Receipts & Expenditures for the last fiscal year, as the book figures show, but I think you will agree that in view of the above facts it hardly represents a true accounting.\n\nThe item for clothing is low, most of it being made at the school by the Sisters, it works out to only $14.74 per pupil a year, and compares very favorably over other schools.\n\nThe food cost is high $58.36 per pupil, but Father Chagnon states that in the winter time many outside Indians are fed who appear in bad circumstances and he finds it hard to turn them down when they beg for food, this accounts for the high expenditure to some extent.\n\nThe deficit of $331.98 shown as re-imbursed by the Order can be practically discounted as it is less than one quarters contribution to the Order.\n\nThe statement of cost of operation attached shows that based on 70 pupils as an average attendance for the year, the average cost per pupil per day is 49.8 cents compared with the amount allowed by per capita grant of 42.4 cents. When given a copy of the cost of operation the Principal appeared very much interested and said he was going to keep it before him and see if he could not reduce the costs for the current year.\n\nIn summing up and allowing for the questionable matter of the assessment to the Order, addall revenue not being shown on books, it would appear that the school is ably managed insofar as it concerns\nas it concerns close buying, discounts taken from wholesalers, making additional revenue and various other economies etc.\n\nThe Principal volunteered the information that there were 65 cattle, 21 horses, 150 poultry, 65 pigs. Wheat 375 bushels, Oats 1100 bushels, compared with 2500 of Barley and 2500 of Oats last year, the wheat and oats will be used for feed, and with 500 bushels of potatoes and other root vegetables he will have sufficient for another year.\n\nThe decrease in feed grains is accounted for by hail and dry weather and in view of this feed shortage the Principal will have to buy feed, and as a consequence he intends informing the Order that he will be unable to make the usual contribution or assessment for this year, that is from the last quarter.\n\nThe following statements in duplicate accompany this report:\n\nReceipts & Expenditures for last Fiscal Year.\nList of Staff-Occupations-Salaries.\nCost of Operation for last Fiscal Year.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.B.

You will note that the books had not been written up since the end of the fiscal year, March 31st.\n\nI should be glad if the officer in charge of this branch of the work would read this report carefully.

O. Chagnon, O.M.I., produced the cash book, cancelled cheques, Bank Pass Book, and a number of invoices and vouchers for goods purchased, which I proceeded to examine, and if possible verify with the book record.\n\nThe period which I examined was from October 15th, 1929, to May 31st, 1930, the book not being written up after that date. The Bank Pass Book had not been sent to the Bank since April 17th, and the cancelled cheques available were to the same date.\n\nAccording to the Synoptic Cash Book, the balance on hand as at May 31st., was $560.70, and according to Pass Book to April 17th., the balance in Bank Canadian Nationale, Winnipeg, was $3,779.02.\n\nWhen I was here last year I prepared a statement covering the fiscal year ending March 31st., 1929, as the books were written up to that date, so I have prepared another statement for the fiscal year ending March 31st, 1930.\n\nI also mentioned in my report of last year the nature of certain entries in the cash book, the payment of cheques to religious institutions, also the manner in which the records were kept, and the inability of anyone to make a detailed audit. I regret to report that the same conditions exist, and the cash book cannot be checked with cancelled cheques, deposits or invoices, nor any other supporting voucher or record which was available. It appeared to me that another book or record must be kept in order to keep track of certain items for which cancelled cheques had been returned from the Bank, but which did not appear in the cash book.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAnother matter which was puzzling included the entries of employees' and staff salaries each month in the cash book, but for which the cancelled cheques did not appear, nor the corresponding entries in the Pass Book.\n\nThe Principal was questioned about these and other matters, and after a somewhat lengthy yet amiable conversation, the following information was obtained:\n\nThe staff are paid, or at least entries are made, each month in the cash book, according to the rates shown on attached list of salaries. In some cases no cheque is issued, and the money lies in the Trust Account, although entered as paid in the cash book. In other cases a cheque is drawn for half or a portion of an employee's salary, or if several months have gone by, two months' salary will be drawn, but as the entries for each month have been made previously at the monthly rate, the amount of cheque paid is not shown.\n\nThis same employee may have ordered personal goods from a mail order house, and the Principal pays the C.O.D. amount from the Trust Account by a cheque. He then records this in a private book, deducts the amount from the employee's salary, and shows the sum as received in \"Revenue from other sources\", which items (on financial statement) give an inflated idea of miscellaneous revenue for the school.\n\nIn another instance, and there are many such, voluntary contributions are made by the staff, including the Principal and Sisters, to their Church institutions and organizations. If they have some credit in the Trust Account, consisting of salaries not drawn, the total of these contributions is computed, and a cheque drawn in favour of the Institution or the official handling the finances. This sum will, of course, appear in the pass book, the cancelled cheque will be returned from the Bank, but no entry made in the cash book.\n\nThese and many other items were drawn to the attention of the Principal, and I gathered 15 or 20 such cancelled cheques, totalling about $1500.00 which could not be traced to the cash book. Some were for religious services, payable to the Church officials concerned, others to Rev. P. Magnon, O.M.I., executive of the Oblate Fathers, Winnipeg, Rev. Monmandin, O.M.I., Rev. Prachet, O.M.I., The Brother Director of the College of Sacred Heart, The Oblates Missionaries S.C., St. Boniface Hospital, Winnipeg, and the Sisters of St. Joseph.\n\nIn some cases the Principal had forgotten the details concerning the expenditure of these items, and this is natural, as considerable time had elapsed. However, the following explanation will be sufficient to show that although upon first examining the records the procedure appears irregular, the explanation is reasonable, but leaves the whole matter, from an accounting point of view, open to criticism.\nAuditor Rayner's Report on Sandy Bay Residential School\n\nI explained this to Father Chagnon, and pointed out the difficulty and embarrassment that would be experienced if questions were asked after a lapse of time, regarding certain items appearing on the books, as well as those omitted.\n\nHe admitted that he had been careless unintentionally, and had no experience in keeping books and had followed what to him was the natural thing to do, also that he was kept very busy and could not devote much time to the books.\n\nI understand the school is situated on land belonging to the Church, and that as the stock and some of the farming implements were supplied by the same body, it is expected that some assessment or revenue be obtained from the school to go toward a central fund.\n\nThese matters were discussed with Father Chagnon, and I suggested to him a few changes in his book-keeping methods which I thought would be easier for him to follow, as well as anyone who might wish to check or examine the books. These included numbering all cheques and records; the exact amounts in the cash book; that members of staff be paid in full each month; and a cheque drawn for the exact amount of salary, if private purchases of goods from outside be made by the staff, to have them arrange such matters themselves and eliminate showing the payments as revenue to the school, and having to keep track of salary deductions, and when contributions were made to Church Institutions by the staff, such items should not go through the Trust Account, but be remitted direct from the staff themselves.\n\nI also drew up a specimen Bank Adjustment to enable a reconciliation between cash book and pass book, and left it with the Principal. I told the Principal that the Department was not concerned as to the disposition of the staff salaries after they were paid, but that where expenditure appeared as going through the Trust Account from the Government Grant in favour of various institutions, not concerned with the buying of goods, clothing, food, or material for the school or pupils, then such items were open to question and appeared irregular. Father Chagnon appeared impressed with this when it was pointed out to him, and stated that he would arrange things differently and hoped to have the books in better shape in the future.\n\nAlthough I do not consider the attached statements as correct, they will give an approximate idea as to the business of the school for the last fiscal year.\nAuditor Reyner's Report on Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nThe item $1,025.00 - \"Proceeds from Farm & Garden\" under \"Receipts\" is misleading, as practically nothing was sold excepting a little meat, from this source. It consists chiefly of profit derived from miscellaneous goods, such as groceries, flour, candles, tobacco, etc., purchased wholesale and sold to Indians on the adjoining reserves at a profit.\n\nAs pointed out above, the item \"Proceeds from other sources\" $815.00 is really payments by the staff for the purchase of their personal needs. The $100.00 is the allowance received for the use of the school as a post office.\n\nFrom the book figures, at the close of March 31st, last there was a deficit of $678.41, which the Principal assured me would be met by the Church authorities.\n\nCompared with the previous fiscal period, the cost of operation shows a slight increase, for instance, cost of operation per pupil per day was 52.7 cents, compared with 49.5 cents. Clothing was $16.82, and previously $14.74. Cost of food was lower being $46.77 per pupil for the year, compared with $58.36.\n\nSalaries as per list total $4,515.00 as at Sept. 25th., 1930.\n\nA plentiful crop of vegetables and potatoes is on hand also plenty of grain feed and fodder, and although the grain crop has been good this past season, prices do not encourage sales.\n\nThe following statements, in duplicate, accompany this report.\n\nReceipts & Expenditures for fiscal year ending Mar. 31/30.\nList of staff - occupations & salaries\nCost of Operation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Rayner\nAuditor.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an audit made at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, and I regret to inform you that there has been no change in the manner in which these books are kept, although the Auditor took a great deal of trouble to show the Principal how the work should be done, and I have also had correspondence with the Department on the subject.\n\nYou will note what the Auditor says regarding the salaries of the Sisters and the staff which are entered in the cash book monthly, but for which the cancelled cheques do not appear, nor the corresponding entries in the pass book, for the simple reason that the salaries are not drawn, but are left in the Trust Account and eventually cheques are issued through the Account in favour of Church institutions and organizations, or for personal goods, etc. As the Auditor points out, the Department is not concerned with the disposition of the staff salaries after they are paid, and therefore they should not be passed through the Trust Account at all, as it is most confusing, and if the staff wish to make voluntary contributions from their salaries to their Church organizations, these transactions should be carried on independently and recorded in a separate book, as should also the purchase of personal goods for members of staff.\n\n-I may add-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI may add that if payments are being made to Church organizations from this school, other than those which are covered by the voluntary contributions of the staff from their salaries, it is entirely wrong. The grant-earning power of the school is not sufficient to enable them to contribute any money to institutions which have no claim whatever on them.\n\nI think I am right in again drawing this matter to your attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL GRANT OR SALARY | AMOUNT DUE | ADDRESS TO WHICH CHEQUE IS TO BE SENT |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Rev.

Please inform the Rev.

It is understood that a window will be cut in the wall, so that he can supervise the room. The Department expects the school management to provide the three extra beds that can be accommodated. This will give a total of 77 beds in the two dormitories, which will permit of an average attendance of approximately 75 pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Rayner, Auditor.\nPortage La Prairie Agency,\nManitoba,\nAugust 26th, 1931.\n\nW.M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith a report of an examination of the records at the above Indian School which I visited August 25th, while at this Agency.\n\nYou will recall that last year I made a somewhat lengthy and detailed report (under date of September 30th.) on the condition of the books and the manner in which the school's business transactions were recorded, and I believe you wrote the Dept., concerning the matter.\n\nInsofar as the conditions found upon this visit, my report of last year could be duplicated, as the same situation exists, so my remarks in the report apply just the same at present.\n\nThe Principal produced all the records in use, cash book, cancelled cheques, Bank Pass Book, and a number of invoices and vouchers for goods purchased, which I examined and attempted to verify with the books.\n\nThe period examined was the last fiscal year ending March 31st., as the book was written only to that date. The Pass Book had been written up to Aug. 11th. and the cancelled cheques returned to July 31st.\n\nThe statements attached cover the above period, but I would not care to vouch for their accuracy, as revenue appears in the cash book which is not recorded in the Pass Book; cheques or expenses appear on the Pass Book which have not been entered in the cash book and vice versa.\n\nTo make a detailed audit was of course impossible as no Bank Adjustment or reconciliation of cash book and pass book could be made.\n\nThe Principal, Rev. O. Chagnon, O.M.I., admits that he does not know how to keep books properly, and does considerable 'estimating' when making entries for certain items, for instance the item shown under \"Receipt\" as 'refunds for goods from salaries' is just an estimate of what he buys for or sells to the staff or the Indians, and what he deducts from salaries or for which he makes collections.\nThe statement enclosed is one compiled from the cash book by computing all the totals of the various headings for each of the twelve months, and agrees with statement which was sent the Dept., at the fiscal year end, but very few cheques could be verified with the expenses shown, and there was nothing to show where the revenue other than the grants had been accounted for. Many payments are made in cash as the distance to a banking town is considerable.\n\nThe balance for the year ending March 31st., shows a deficit of $455.20 but the Bank Pass Book shows a credit balance of $1,361.32 at same date, but the difference is not accounted for by unpresented cheques.\n\nI think this can be explained the same as last year, as the Principal confirmed it; cheques for salaries are not issued for certain members of the staff, but they are charged up and appear in the cash book.\n\nTo offset the surplus thus created, quarterly cheques are made in favour of Rev. P.P. Magon, O.M.I. of St. Boniface, amounting to $350.00 per quarter totalling $1,400.00 which absorbs the salaries of the Principal's and Vice Principal's within $100.00 per annum.\n\nThe same thing occurs with the salaries of the Sisters as some cheques were noticed for Rev. Soeurs Notre Dame des Missions, Quebec.\n\nAll these matters were again taken up with the Principal and a similar conversation, as outlined in my previous report took place.\n\nAmong several suggestions made to him, was that he pay all salaries in full - deposit the ones referred to above in another Bank account, and then draw cheques for the St. Boniface institution from that account, thus eliminating their appearance in the school records, and through the Trust Account, in which the per capita grant is kept.\n\nSpecimen Bank Adjustments were left with him showing how the cash book could be balanced with pass book, whether there was a deficit or a surplus, as he did not know how to proceed when an adverse balance occurred at a month end.\n\nThe statements attached are self explanatory and contain a comparison with the previous fiscal year in regard to the cost of operation; Receipts & Expenditures and Staff and salaries are also enclosed.\n\nThe methods practiced as outlined are I think the result of lack of accounting knowledge, rather than intentional, or an attempt to show misleading information on the books.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.B. Rayner, Auditor.\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an audit made at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School by Mr. Rayner on the 25th instant, and I regret to say that matters in connection with the keeping of the books and giving an account for the disposition of monies have not improved in the least at this institution. Personally, I think this is a very serious matter. If these funds are intended to be spent for the benefit of the children in the school there should be a proper record kept. I would ask the Department to take steps to see that something is done. It is absurd for the Principal to excuse this state of things by saying that he knows nothing about keeping books. Surely he has some member of his staff who could attend to the work if he cannot do so himself.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 8, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Rayner, departmental Auditor, has reported on the financial management of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, and it appears he found it difficult to make a thorough audit because of the present lack of system in keeping the school's financial records. If you, yourself, are not competent in this type of work, surely there is someone on the staff to whom it can be entrusted, and the Department would appreciate it very much if you could arrange to have your records in good form in future.\n\nI understand that Mr. Rayner suggested that you pay all salaries of those in Holy Orders, including the Sisters, into a special bank account and then draw cheques in favour of the Oblate Order or the Sisters of Notre Dame from it. As I have informed Mr. Rayner, this is not necessary, as it is with the Department's knowledge that certain salaries are not paid to the individuals but to the Order from which they come. This is quite proper if the school's finances can stand the charge, and there is no reason why such payments should not appear in your school records. You might have them read \"Principal's salary for such and such a period, paid to the Order\", etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. O. Chagnon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Residential School,\nMarius, Man.\nOttawa, September 8, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 208-11 of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the financial management of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School and Mr. Rayner's report in this connection. The Department is writing to Father Chagnon, in an effort to have better records kept at this school. I wish to refer to one of the suggestions Mr. Rayner made to the Reverend Principal, viz.: \"That he pay all salaries in full - deposit the ones referred to above in another bank account and then draw cheques -- from that account, thus eliminating their appearance in the school records.\" The Department does not concur in this proposal. It is a known fact and is accepted by the Department that at some Indian residential schools which are managed by religious Orders the salaries of members of the Order are paid, at least in part, to the Order itself. Such payments should, quite properly, appear in the school records and they might be entered as \"Principal's salary, paid to the Society\", or \"Sisters' salaries, paid to the Society\". If the Department insisted on all salaries being paid in full to these religious workers, deficits would then occur more frequently than in the past. At the present time, if the school's finances are not in good condition, certain members of Orders on the staff are not paid in full. Please inform Mr. Rayner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M.

(RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith a report of an examination of the books at the above Indian School, which I visited Oct. 3rd, in accordance with letters from the Department dated June 29th and July 8th. - File No. 125/1/3.\n\nThe period under review covered the past fiscal year, and also the first five months - April to August - of the current fiscal year, continuing from the period examined when I last visited the School in August, 1931.\n\nThe Principal produced all the records available, including cash book, cancelled cheques, Bank Pass Book, and a few invoices and vouchers for goods purchased, but which by no means covered all purchases, as invoices are not always obtained, I was told, and much is paid by cash instead of cheque.\n\nTo a considerable extent, my two previous reports still apply as to the practices followed, and to the condition of the books at this school. It is quite impossible to reconcile the Cash Book with the Bank Pass Book, or make a detailed audit, owing to the \"estimated\" sums of cash receipts and expenses which are entered as cash items; also expenses entered twice; cash loans to employees shown as salary expense in addition to regular salary amounts of loans due and not paid, shown as cash receipts for one month, and then in the following month after a payment has been made and the loan reduced, the balance due is again shown as a cash receipt.\n\nIn this way receipts become inflated and do not represent an accurate accounting. In some cases cheques, varying in size from $100 to $40, will be drawn and cashed, and shown under miscellaneous expense, then some of those expenses paid in cash will be reclassified and shown as expenses again under the respective expense headings, thus expenditures are inflated, and discrepancies occur with Pass Book.\n\nAnother practice followed is to make an advance (in cash) to an employee on account of salary before the month end; this is not shown at the time, but when salaries are paid by cheque, the amount previously advanced is deducted and the balance paid, but the full amount of salary is entered in the cash book. The result is that part of that employee's salary\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nhas been paid in cash and charged under \"Miscellaneous\" and yet the full amount of salary is shown under \"Salary expense, and the actual cheque issued does not correspond with the book entries.\n\nIt is such methods as outlined above which cause endless adjusting and correcting entries for anyone who has to audit or attempt to reconcile the cash book with bank book. Also to obtain the above information it entails much questioning of the Principal who has to rely on memory of what happened, and one feels that although some actions can be traced, there may be others which the books do not disclose.\n\nFor instance, after further questioning and observation I found that considerable bartering is done by the School with the Indians, and which contributes to the muddled condition of the records. An Indian will bring a load of wood for fuel purposes; the Principal will exchange for that some beer, flour or groceries, etc., then make an entry in the cash book under \"Fuel\" expense for the market value of the commodity, yet no cash transaction has taken place - thus, as cattle beefed for food consumption are not shown as revenue, another form of discrepancy is created in the cash book.\n\nI have reason to believe that the same applies to game, such as moose meat, deer, wild fowl and fish, in order to vary the menu at the school.\n\nThe isolated location of the school lends itself to such action, coupled with a spirit of helpfulness on the part of the Principal for the Indians.\n\nThe Principal admits he is a poor bookkeeper, and dislikes the task of recording details of the school's business, and always gets confused when making entries in the books which are not straightforward transactions, and thus gets involved.\n\nAlthough specimen Bank adjustments and examples of entries have been left with the Principal together with written instructions, both on this visit and previously, he seems unable to adapt himself to them or follow them out correctly, and I feel after four annual visits to the school, that it certainly requires the services of someone who has a working knowledge of accounting, if the records are ever going to be kept accurately.\n\nThe attached statements are submitted for what they are worth. They can be only considered approximate, as the balances shown differ greatly from those appearing on the books, after many errors were found and adjusted. Also in view of the foregoing inaccuracies. It will be noted that the balances on hand are for each period less than what appears in the Trust Account by the Bank Pass Book, yet these differences are not accounted for by unpresented cheques.\nIt would appear as if expenses had been curtailed considerably the past year, compared to previous years, as the cost of operation shows that actual expenses are practically the same as the amount of Government grant. One factor which has helped the Principal in his financing is the increased per capita grant, which was $155.00 prior to April, 1931, and which was increased the last quarter from $160.00 to $165.00.\n\nThe Principal informed me that cheques drawn during September would about absorb the balance shown in Bank as at August 31st. - $799.52, so, as he had no accounts payable to amount to anything, he was awaiting the July-Sept. grant to pay for the ensuing quarter's expenses, which is a fair position compared to some schools, who find themselves in the position of paying the quarter's expenses for which the grant is paid. In other words, the grant is spent before it is received.\n\nI was informed the grain crops had been fair,- 200 bushels of wheat, 1500 of oats, and 150 barley, which will take care of the requirements of livestock. There were also ample root vegetables for the school's requirements, but the potato crop had been poor, owing to insects and lack of rain; only 200 bushels were gathered, so purchases will have to be made later.\n\nThe livestock consists of 60 cattle, many of which will be beefed for consumption; 50 hogs, 100 poultry and 18 horses.\n\nFrom casual observation on the 75 pupils in attendance at present appeared healthy and well nourished, and the school both inside and out appeared clean and tidy.\n\nAlthough throughout the period examined, the records were found in poor shape and hard to follow, I feel the cause is inconsiderate book-keeping on the part of the Principal, rather than any intention to misrepresent the transactions of the school's business, as all questions asked were willingly answered, and much information freely given.\n\nThe following statements accompany this report, a copy of which has been forwarded to Inspector Hamilton,-\n\nReceipts & Expenditures for fiscal year ending 31/3/32\nReceipts & Expenditures for five months ending 31/8/32\nBank Adjustment as at 31/8/32\nCosts of Operation for last fiscal year\nList of Staff, occupations and salaries.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.B.

(RG 10, Volume 6276, file S84-3, part 1)\nOttawa, October 21, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Rayner, departmental auditor, has reported on the financial management of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIt appears that he again found it difficult to make a thorough audit because of the present lack of system in keeping the school's financial records. The Department considers that it is quite important to have complete records of the financial business conducted at all residential schools. If you have not the time to devote to this detail, it is believed that there must be someone on the staff to whom the work could be entrusted. This matter was brought to your attention by official letter of September 8, 1931, but, apparently, no improvement has yet been effected. The Department would appreciate if you would make immediate arrangements to have your financial records kept in good form in future.\n\nMr. Rayner advises that specimen bank adjustments and examples of entries have been left with you, together with written instructions. If you communicate with him, I am certain that Mr. Rayner will be pleased to give you any other assistance that you require.\n\nThe Department will be interested to hear from you that the arrangements requested in this letter have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

School\n(R.C. Manitoba)\n\nDear Mr. Allen:\n\nI submit herewith a report of my examination of the books at the above Indian School, which I visited August 28th, while at the Portage La Prairie Agency.\n\nThe distance from Portage to Sandy Bay is about 70 miles, but I completed the work late in the evening, in order to return to the Agency the same day.\n\nThe period under review covered eleven months, ending July 31st., continuing from the time of my previous visit, when I examined the books to August 31st, 1932.\n\nThe Principal, Rev. Father Chagnon, O.M.I., always makes me quite welcome, and he furnished me with all the records, including Cash Book Synopsis, cancelled cheques, Bank Pass Book, and some invoices for goods purchased which by no means covered all purchases, as invoices are not always obtained, I was told, and much is paid by cash, instead of cheque.\n\nThe Principal admits that he is no bookkeeper. He dislikes working on the books, and has experienced considerable difficulty in recording transactions, which has made it hard to follow when examining the books, and if the figures shown in the books were taken at their face value it would not reflect what has actually taken place.\n\nI have mentioned these matters in previous reports, and the practices followed still apply, although examples and written instructions have been given to the Principal from time to time.\n\n\"Estimated\" sums of cash receipts and expenses, including garden and dairy produce consumed by the school, have been included as cash items, whereas they are only approximate market price valuations of what the farm and garden produced.\n\nI have informed the Principal that only cash transactions should be shown through the Cash Book, and the Department are well aware that the farm products are consumed, and help in the operation of the school.\n\nAnother way in which inflated receipts and expenses occur is by the showing of salaries to employees in total at each month end, and also entering as expenses, advances on their salary before the same month end, although the net amount of salary only is paid. Then, it appears to be the practice for certain of the married employees to take meat, groceries, and farm and garden produce in lieu of salary. Sometimes he shows such a transaction by writing an amount of the salary paid, less the value of the goods, which is also shown as a receipt. In order to make a true accounting of such transactions I suggested that he show such employees' salaries.\n\nN. C. Allen, Esq.,\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-3, part 1)\nsalaries by making two entries, one of which would be the actual balance of cash paid, and the other the amount or the goods purchased, the total of which would be the equivalent of the man's salary. Then, by a cross entry show the amount of goods purchased under the heading of \"Receipts\", but not as cash.\n\nThe Principal has with him Mr. G. Schmidt (son of C.P. Schmidt, Agent, Duck Lake), and as he is acting as Disciplinarian at the school in the Boys' Department, and is anxious to learn a little elementary book-keeping, he will, in future, keep these records, and I hope they will be more satisfactory.\n\nMany adjustments and corrections were made throughout the period, insofar as it affected transactions as described above, and a statement of Receipts and Expenditures was prepared and reconciled with the Bank Account, as shown on Statement No. 1.\n\nTotal receipts appear as $9,482.67, although the period of eleven months includes only per capita grant for three quarter periods. The per capita grant cheque for the June quarter was received from the Department the first week in August, amounting to $2629.69. The item of $552.07 consists of the previously mentioned goods sold in lieu of salaries to employees, and the goods sold for actual cash amounted to only $31.00.\n\nExpenses show a considerable reduction from previous years. Reductions have been effected in salaries, clothing and shoes, house equipment, farm and garden expense, and although a deficit of $20.50 is shown as at July 31st, it is accounted for by outstanding cheques of $706.64, which would not be charged to the Bank Account for some considerable time after the per capita grant cheque was deposited.\n\nThe Principal informed me that no accounts payable, of any consequence, were due at July 31st., so it appears as if his financial position is fairly good, in that he is now financing on the June quarter grant, and so is practically a quarter period ahead.\n\nThe cost of operation does not indicate a very fair comparison to previous periods, as the average cost per pupil per day had to be estimated for eleven months, (334 days), whereas the grant was received for 273 days only, according to the figures shown on the financial statement, but substantial reductions are apparent when taking into consideration the difference of one month between this statement and the previous one.\n\nThe average number of pupils in attendance throughout last year was 75. 68 were in attendance when I visited the school, and about eight or nine had not returned from holidays.\n\nThe list\nThe list of staff occupations and salaries as at August 28th, amounted to $4,923.50, whereas it will be noted that the actual salaries paid for the eleven months period amounted to only $2,334.00.\n\nThe Principal and Asst. Principal hardly ever draw their salaries, but I noticed from the cancelled cheques and entries which are included in the miscellaneous item, that $1141.00 was remitted to the Oblate Order at St. Boniface. This, I understand, represents part of the salaries of the two Oblate Fathers.\n\nThe Principal informed me that the live stock on hand at present includes 60 head of cattle, 15 horses, 50 hogs, and about 75 poultry.\n\nThe Farm and Garden crops matured early, and harvesting was completed when I visited the school. The crop returns are as follows - 1500 bushels oats; 1500 bushels barley, 100 tons of hay and green feed, and there are ample potatoes and root vegetables for the requirements of the school.\n\nTo give you an idea of how involved the bookkeeping appears at this school, after some questioning I found that considerable bartering is done by the Principal with the Indians, which contributes to the muddled condition of the records. An Indian will bring a load of furs for rations etc., the Principal will exchange for that some beef, flour or groceries, etc. Then, he will attempt to make an entry in the Cash Book under \"fuel expense\" for the market value of the commodity given in exchange, when no cash transaction has taken place. Thus, as cattle beefed for food consumption are not shown as revenue another form of discrepancy is created in the Cash Book. I have reason to believe that the same applies to game, such as moose meat, deer, wild fowl and fish, in order to vary the menu at the school. The isolated location of the school lends itself to such action, together with a spirit of helpfulness on the part of the Principal for the Indians on the adjacent reserve, as they have had a somewhat lean time during the past few years.\n\nFrom casual observation, the sixty odd pupils in attendance at present appeared healthy and well nourished, and the school, both inside and out, was clean and tidy.\n\nThe following statements accompany this report, a copy of which is being forwarded to Mr. Hamilton,-\n\nReceipts & Expenditures for the 11 months ending July 31/33.\nBank Adjustment as at July 31.\nCost of Operation\nList of Staff, Occupations and Salaries.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.

Young\nAuditor\nDear Mr. Allen:\n\nI submit herewith, in duplicate, a report of an examination of the books at the above Indian school, which I visited on November 7th and 8th. The period examined covered one year dating from August 1st, 1933 to July 31st, 1934.\n\nThe cash received entries were compared to the deposits in the Bank Pass Book, and the cancelled cheques to the expense entries in the cash book. A bank reconciliation statement was then prepared, from which it will be noticed that the school had a financial deficit of $238.69 as at July 31st, 1934.\n\nDuring the past year or more the books have been neatly kept by Mr. G. Schmidt, a member of the staff, but since his leaving the school at the end of June, the Principal has attempted to do this work. I found a vast difference in the appearance of July and August entries - in fact, I re-wrote the transactions for those months and offered the Principal suggestions which might show improvement in his recordings.\n\nInvoices were compared by test to various entries, and the additions and extensions were proven also by test.\n\nThe revenue for the period was analysed and is set forth on Statement No. 2. It consists principally of the Government per capita grants, amounting to $10,518.76. Although the quarterly grant for June this year was not received until August, the revenue for the period examined contains four quarterly grants.\n\nThe expenditures totalled $11,400.31, the larger items of expense being salaries of $3,315.98, food $1,964.86, and miscellaneous items of $2,242.19. The Principal's attention was drawn to the miscellaneous expenses and to the need of a more definite classification of the same under the proper columns in the cash book.\n\nThe statement of \"Costs of Operation\" is self-explanatory, the figures being based upon an expenditure of $11,400.31 and an average attendance of 76 pupils.\n\nThe salaries of the staff total $6,233.50, which is a slight increase over salaries a year ago. A few changes have taken place in the personnel of the staff, Brother S. Heytens being taken on as a fireman, while\n\nN. C. Allen, Esq.,\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. G. Schmidt, a former teacher, has transferred to another school.\n\nThe livestock, I was informed, consists of 14 horses, 60 cattle, 50 pigs, and about 80 poultry.\n\nCrops this year include 350 bus. wheat, 300 bus. oats, and 200 bus. barley. With a quantity of feed left over from last year, the principal expects to have sufficient to feed the stock.\n\nAbout 400 bus. of potatoes were raised, but the school will have to purchase more, which, with quantities of cabbages, turnips and other vegetables grown at the school, will supply their needs.\n\nNo large outstanding accounts are owing, the debts of the school being those of local merchants for monthly purchases.\n\nFrom casual observations, the pupils appear to be well clothed and fed. The school building was comfortably warm, clean and tidy.\n\nThe following statements accompany this report, which is in duplicate:\n\nBank Adjustment Statement\nRevenue and Expenditures\nCosts of Operations, Staff & Salaries\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nH.

Staunton,\nSupt., Indian Agency,\nDauphin, Man.,\n\nThe Auditor-General's Office has checked previous quarterly returns for the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School and brought certain errors to our attention:\n\n(a) The Principal has claimed 62 days grant for pupil 323 and has shown in the Remarks Column \"attending day school\". As this pupil was not attending the Sandy Bay school during the previous month of June, 62 days grant can not be allowed. This means that the school was overpaid 62 days for this pupil.\n\n(b) The Principal has claimed 92 days grant for pupils 342, 0322 and 0341; however, it is noted that these children were not in residence during the previous June and the first two had returned to the school in September after a lengthy absence. In view of this information the school was overpaid 186 days for the three pupils.\n\nFrom the information contained in the previous two paragraphs it will be noted that this school was overpaid 248 pupil days or based on the per capita rate at that time $183.87.\nAs the Auditor-General's Office has instructed that this adjustment be made on the June 1952 per capita grant payments, you are advised that the June earnings at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School were $12,616.44 less overpayment of $183.87, less part payment forwarded July 4, $6,000., net cheque $5,832.57.\n\nIt is presumed that this cheque will reach the school shortly.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nProvince of MANITOBA\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPer Capita Allowances\u2014Residential Schools\n\nFor Quarter ended September 30, 1952.\n\n| PRINCIPAL | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL PER CAPITA ALLOWANCE | AMOUNT DUE |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|------------|\n|           | Averi          | $139.47                    |            |\n| Sandy Bay Indian Res.

The sisters will put the paint on if it is given them. This paint would brighten up these rooms as they are in the basement and I would recommend that Agent Ogletree, at the town of Portage la Prairie, be authorized to send the paint to the address of Father Chagnon, which is Amaranth, Manitoba.\n\nS. J. Jackson,\nInsp. Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, December 9, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Jackson, in his report on his recent inspection of the Sandy Bay Boarding School, requests that authority be granted to purchase ten gallons of slate coloured paint for use in painting the dining room and kitchen. He states that the Sisters will do the work of painting if the paint is supplied.\n\nThe Department will approve of the purchase of the above quantity of paint and you should consult the school authorities as to the colour required and you may then arrange for the purchase and forwarding of the above quantity. Before making the purchase, however, you should obtain competitive prices and purchase from the firm quoting you the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred, to which should be attached a memorandum showing the firms asked for prices, as well as the prices quoted by them. Kindly give this matter your early attention. It is to be understood that there will be no cost involved to the Department for the labour performed in having the painting done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

Ltd., Wholesale Hardware, of Winnipeg Manitoba, for the sum of $79.63.\n\nThis account is for a pair of hinges for the new door for the Boys playroom, and for 150 feet of boiler tubes.\n\nThe necessity for the purchase of these tubes is shown by the following extract from Father Chagnon's letter to me of the 8th of December, 1920.\n\n\"These two last winters, we have had no trouble at all with our big boiler, but Saturday the 4th, we had to put in 6 new tubes out of the 10 the Department supplied us a year ago, and 4 in the small boiler last summer, so we had no more on hand, therefore I am ordering 15 tubes today, so that in case of emergency we could keep on firing.\"\n\nAs these boilers get old it is always necessary to have some spare tubes on hand, and I would recommend that this account be paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.

Fr Chagnon of Marius, Man., wishes me to enclose copy of account for $81.25 with the following explanations.\n\nThe different items mentioned on this invoice were bought without authority from the Inspector, Mr. Jackson, but it being a case of absolute emergency Rev Fr Chagnon gave the order for boiler flues and hinges and wrote to Inspector S. J. Jackson as follows, on December 6th and later on December 29th:\n\n\"These two last winters we have had no trouble at all with our big boiler, but Saturday night we had to put in six new tubes out of the ten the Department had supplied us with a year ago and four in the small boiler during this last summer, so that we have no more on hand just now. I am ordering 15 tubes today so that in case of emergency we could keep on firing\".\n\nHerewith also our bill invoice in triplicate for one pair of double acting hinges for the inside door in the boys' playing room and fifteen boiler flues, these have been promptly ordered when three weeks ago we had to put in our last spare tube\".\nSince he has not heard from Mr. Jackson and was even under the impression that he was superannuated and therefore can not give attention to this matter, he has requested me to take up this question with the Department.\n\nAs this affair has been going on for over 5 months, I think that the Department will find in order to have this statement presented by me for payment and I hope that the latter will be made to Fr Chagnon, as requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Guy\nOttawa, May 19, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing an account from the principal of the Sandy Bay Boarding School to the amount of $61.25, covering the cost of new boiler tubes and one pair of hinges.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque for $60.45 is being sent to Rev. G. Chagnon, O.M.I., in payment of this account.\n\nThe sales tax of 80 cents was not allowed as the Government does not pay a sales tax on the purchase of supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D.

A number of the tubes in the boiler are leaking and the balance do not seem to be in very good shape.\n\nThe \"Father\" in charge of the school complains about the north class-room being slow in heating.\n\nThe sink trap under the kitchen sink is in very poor condition.\n\nOur recommendation to remedy the above defects are as follows:\n\n1. Replace or reline fire box and the combustion chamber of the boiler with new fire brick.\n\n2. Take out all the old tubes in the boiler and put in a complete set of new ones.\n\n3. Change the connections of all the horizontal returns vent and drop each separately before connecting together to enter the boiler.\n\n4.

Father O. Chagnon, principal of the Sandy Bay Boarding School, and enclosing a voucher and cancelled cheque for material supplied years ago in connection with the erection of an implement shed. The Reverend Principal is asking for a grant covering this expense.\n\nI am directed to reply, whereas this building was erected in 1917, and that the appropriation for that fiscal year has been spent, and that no authority was granted from the Department at that time, that the Department believes this old account is not a charge on the financial resources for the current fiscal year.\n\nThe Department regrets that the Reverend Principal did not, before erecting the outbuilding in connection with the property which is Government-owned at Sandy Bay, secure authorization for the expenditure. It is the Government policy to repair our own buildings from time to time, and to erect any necessary outbuildings where the property is our own.\n\nIf any further information can be offered regarding the necessity for this expenditure and if any authority was given by the Department, at any time, we should be glad to hear further from the Rev.

Ogletree, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie,\nMan.\n\nRe: Indian Industrial School, Sandy Bay.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached herewith you will find an Invoice in Triplicate, amounting to $144.03, for repairs we made when completing the following mentioned work.\n\nWhen re-tubing and testing the Boiler, we found the Water column connections defective and repaired same, as the Brick-work was to be rebuilt. The Return Pipe connections at Boiler in Laundry required renewing, and some Radiators were leaking which we repaired. The Sink trap which was included in our Contract was required at Kitchen Sink, and when same was put on we found the Waste Pipe defective, so we renewed same, also repaired all W.C. Flush tanks, Taps in Laundry, cleaned Waste pipe from Wash Basins, took up Closets, cleaned same, and tried to clean connections to Stack and Main Stack but found it impossible to do so.\n\nThe attached Invoice includes all Labor and Material for the above work, and trust same will be satisfactory.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nTHE STANDARD PLUMBING & HEATING CO., LTD.\nper: Joseph Turner\nSir,\n\nEnclosed find Voucher No. 8963 amounting to $144.03 in favour of the Standard Plumbing and Heating Co., Limited of Winnipeg, Man., for repairs in connection with the Sandy Bay Indian Boarding School, heating and water system.\n\nI might say that was unable to get an estimate on this work, on account of not being able to estimate what would be required for this extra work until after the Heating Plant was repaired.\n\nAttached please find letter from the Standard Plumbing and Heating Co., Limited., re-these repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Asst.

Whilst it did not take so much Material on account of using some of the Pipes we took out. We cleaned same and re-used them for the Boy's section yet it took considerable extra Time, which accounts for the increased amount above our Estimate of October 5th, 1921.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory to you, we are,\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nTHE STANDARD PLUMBING & HEATING CO., LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Chagnon O.M.I., has requested me to apply to the Department in his name for the following articles:\n\n2 teacher's desks;\n3 hand washing machines.\n\nI take pleasure in asking for those articles and would point out in the case of the washing machines that they are still using at the school machines bought over seven years ago. Moreover I would suggest that although competitive prices have to be asked that the Principal be consulted when the tenders are awarded in order that he may be satisfied with the type of machine used. I may state that of late this way of proceeding by competitive prices has been a source of dissatisfaction about the quality of different machines or implements supplied to schools. The Department is not to be blamed but it seems that the Purchasing Commission should have in mind when selecting articles not only the lowest price (which generally carries with it inferior quality) but the advantage of those for whom said articles are intended.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Reverend Father bought them after considering the prices of different firms and chosen the most modern and best quality pumps combined with lowest prices. In his name, I respectfully request the Department to cover this expense and reimburse Rev. Fr Chagnon for the outlay.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Competitive prices were secured by the Rev. Principal, and the type of equipment desired was ordered by him. You will note that the amount is less than $500. I respectfully ask for a minute number authorizing the payment of these accounts.\n\nF. H.

Indian Affairs,\n\nSUBJECT: Gasoline Pump - Sandy Bay Indian Boarding School.\n\nAttention of: Mr. Ferret.\n\nReferring to your letter of September 23rd, 126-9-5, relative to the above subject.\n\nIt is noted that a pump of foreign manufacture was purchased for this school, and that the requisition was not submitted to this Commission before purchase was made.\n\nWould you be good enough to instruct the principals of the different schools, that it is necessary for all requisitions to be submitted to you before the business is awarded, so as a proper list of names may be secured from us to ask tenders from.\n\nWould you also emphasize the importance of purchasing, as far as possible, goods that are manufactured in Canada.\n\nAssistant Director.\n\"A\" Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Guy, on behalf of the Principal of the Sandy Bay Boarding School - a government-owned institution - has submitted to the Department accounts for:\n\n1. a wagon .................. $151.95.\n2. a cultivator ............ 96.30.\n3. a water reservoir ...... 97.14.\n\nThere has been no correspondence regarding the above items, but I wish to recommend that the account for the reservoir be paid. The Principal should be directed to the necessity of securing authority from the Department before making future purchases. I believe that Father Guy, upon my suggestion, is circularizing the R.C. Principals in this connection.\n\nIt is also urged that the Department supply the Sandy Bay Boarding School with two teachers' desks and three hand washing machines. I would urge that this request be granted.\n\nFather Guy encloses also an account for a gasoline tank and pump with accessories, for $429.09. In this connection there has been some correspondence and an amount of $250 was provided in the main estimates for the current fiscal year. I am of the opinion that competitive prices have been secured in this connection, but, if it is your wish to settle the account, I would direct a memo to the Purchasing Commission over Mr. Paget's signature, that might secure the necessary minute number.\n\nRussell T. Perrier\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Sept. 23, 1922.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letters of the 10th and 12 instant, concerning equipment needed at the Sandy Bay Indian Boarding School.\n\nThe request of the Rev. Principal for two teacher's desks and three hand washing machines is granted, and our agent will be instructed to make the purchases after consultation with the Rev. Father.\n\nI have directed that the account for the water tank be paid and a cheque will be forwarded to the Marshall Wells Company of Winnipeg.\n\nAs you are aware, some provision was made in the estimates for a garage at the Sandy Bay School, and I am requesting that a minute number be secured from the Purchasing Commission, so that we can pay the account for the gasoline and oil pumps and accessories and for the installation of the same.\n\nI regret that I am unable to authorize the payment of the accounts for the farm machinery. The policy of the Department is to equip a school at the time of its opening, and the renewals of farm machinery and similar equipment must be met from the sale of surplus produce.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Principal concerning the nature of the washing machines to be furnished.\n\nProperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded by you to the Department, for payment. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred, as the Vote for Indian Education is completely assigned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA.

However I must say that the Principal should be willing to do his share by trying to have some of the older boys do the rough part of the work provided a painter do the finishing part. We would also suggest that the paint, oil, etc., be bought by tender and the work be done by day labor. I understand that the Principal is most willing to do his best in order to have the job done at the lowest possible figure.\n\n2o-CUPBOARDS:- A necessity in the sewing-room. I took note of that myself upon my recent visit. The expense entailed would not be very high.\n\n3o-MANURE CARRIER:- The Principal is presently investigating for prices but I think that the whole installation would not be over $300.00.\n\n4o-OVEN:- The Principal has been asked $175.00 for an oven of the size he requires.\n\n5o-GRAIN BINS:- A couple of them on the fields would be welcome as I have noticed by myself during the threshing season.

K.S.T.\nSir:\n\nUnder cover of three letters dated the first instant, you forwarded to the Department vouchers, supported by receipts and accounts, in favour of the Rev. Principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Boarding School and others. These accounts have reference to certain repairs and building activities that have been undertaken at this institution.\n\nThe account in connection with lining the well and providing a cement cover for the same is being kept by the Department, as, if ordered, will be paid. This account was authorized under cover of official communication of this file number, dated October 9th, last. The other accounts, which are returned, cover the building of a garage and refer to other operations concerning which the Department has very little information. Under date of September 7th, last, authority was given for the erection of a garage. Consideration was promised certain other activities; but, as far as I can learn from the files, no authority was granted.\n\nThe accounts and correspondence which I enclose should be returned to the Rev. Principal and should be presented with definite information regarding where the materials were used and the labour performed. Further, the authority for the work and expenditure should be indicated.\n\nThe Principal should submit to your office an account for each repair or building activity and indicate, in a covering letter, the exact nature of this and the authority from the Department. Proper voucher forms should be prepared by you for each account, if you are satisfied they are in order, and, in addition, you should direct a covering letter, indicating whether or not you are informed regarding the work performed, and stating the source of the authority from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

L.\nPrincipal, Indian Boarding School,\nMARIUS, P O., Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to recent correspondence in connection with the above matter and your visit to this office on December 28th, would advise that we have given this matter further consideration and would state although the Telephone Department are not anxious to undertake this work, would however arrange to construct the line complete during the coming season for the amount of $950.00, providing conditions are found in every way favorable and that the work could be so arranged as to fit in with our 1923 construction program.\n\nIf you will arrange to haul the poles from the Railway Station and furnish the necessary labor to dig the holes and assist in erecting the poles, this would reduce the cost by the amount of $500.00, making the total amount $450.00. In either case telephone Department would supply free of charges, the material for the portion of line between the Ridge Road and the Indian Reserve (approximately) \u00bd of a mile and the ownership of same. All poles, wires etc. erected on the Reserve, with the exception of the telephone instruments, would become the property of Indian Reserve or the Dominion Government as the case might be.\n\nWe trust this information will enable you to complete arrangements regarding this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCommercial Superintendent.\nINDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL.\nMARIUS P. O. MAN. Feb. 9th, 1925.\n\nMR. A. Ogletree.\nIndian Agent.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHoping you will extend your favor to my request and kindly recommend it to the Department of Indian Affairs, I give a statement of some improvements needed at Sandy Bay School; these improvements, of which you have seen by yourself the necessity, would be a great benefit for the institution.\n\n1. Painting of the school, soldering of leaky save troughs, white washing of surrounding buildings. It is to be noted that the school has been painted last in 1913, so to delay this repair would mean much depreciation on the value of the building.\n\n2. Increasing of pupilage from 60 to 70.\n\n3. Repairs to granary near the school; joints floor shingle roof required. The building is 30' x 14'.\n\n4. House for hired men. According experienced managers of Indian Boarding Schools, unmarried hired men working for these institutions are in many occasions a cause of trouble and worry for those in charge. At Sandy Bay School we have three hired men working by the year, two unmarried ones boarding in the school, the other with his family is living in a little log house near by. A house 30' x 20' according my opinion, would accommodate two small families and would answer the purpose. If this house is not built this year the little shanty will need a new looking and a shingle roof.\n\n5. One oven (4 spinning wheels, wood stoves). We have still the small oven used at the opening of the school when pupils only were attending; now pupils being twice that number, a bigger oven would be needed. The J. J. Daout from St. Boniface would sell us the required size oven for $175.00.\nI have just made an experiment in spinning yarn at home; it is a pastime for the girls now, and might be a benefit for them after their departure from school. 4 spinning wheels and 4 wool carders would cost at the T. Eaton Co. $53.50\n\n6c Installation of telephone into school: This last improvement has been wanted for a long time. Often we had to go to Amaranth to send messages to call a doctor or send orders for repairs; it would save us many trips from the school to the station. The Manitoba Telephone System would do the job for $950.09; if we help them, their price would be $650.00.\n\nIf the Department is willing to go to the expense of the installation I believe the School could do the whole job for about $450.00 provided the Manitoba Telephone System do not change the price of poles: $2.50 at the nearest station.\n\n| Item                        | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 28 poles to 1 mile          | 2\u00bd miles| $2.50      | $17.50  |\n| Galv.

Iron Wire    | $6.80 per mile |\n| Glass Insulators      | 6.00 per 100 |\n| Painted Brackets      | 5.80 per 100 |\n\nThe wire we quote you on is just the ordinary Galvanized Wire that is used for guying purposes or for fence work, and we do not know if it would pass inspection by the Manitoba Government Telephone for telephone work, providing they have jurisdiction over your telephone system.\n\nHowever, in case they have jurisdiction over your telephone system, it will be necessary for you to use their standard type of wire which is 12 Ga EBF No. Four Immersion test of Galvanized Iron and it would cost you $14.95 per mile. To all intents and purposes the ordinary galvanized wire would be suitable for this short run unless, as stated before, the Government has supervision over your system.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMarshall Wells Company Limited.\n\nL. S. Conrad.\nElectrical Dept.\nSir\u2014\n\nEnclosed find letter from the Rev. Father Chagnon Principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Boarding School, also copies of correspondence from Marshall-Wells Co. Ltd., and the Commercial Superintendent of The Manitoba Telephone System.\n\nIn regard to the painting and repairs to the buildings, I would recommend that this work be done this summer. I would also recommend that a new oven, 4 spinning wheels, and 4 wool carders be purchased.\n\nIn regard to the Telephone System being put into the school, I would be very pleased to have Telephone communication at the school, but I am not prepared to say it would be worth $950.00. I consider the cost too high.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Feb. 26, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing correspondence from the Rev. Father Chagnon, relative to the needs at the Sandy Bay Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that some provision has been made for painting at the school, and in the spring, you should requisition for definite authority to purchase paint and other materials and to engage any labour that is necessary. It is understood that as much of the work as possible will be done by the school employees and older boys. I have to inform you that a new bake oven will be purchased by this Department, after competitive prices have been received and a minute number secured from the Purchasing Commission.\n\nI regret to state that it will not be possible to provide new residence facilities for some of the employees at the Sandy Bay Indian Boarding School. A note has been made in this connection, however, and it may be possible to provide funds at the time of our next estimates. I have also to inform you that the Department cannot consider the installation of a telephone line, because of the expense involved. Further, this Department does not supply spinning wheels and wool carders.\n\nIn the principal's communication, one of the requests is for an increase in the pupilage at the school, and I have to inform you that provision has been made for an enrolment of 70, as from April first, 1923. Kindly intimate to the principal the nature of this communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nOttawa, Feb. 28, 1923.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nThe Purchasing Commission of Canada:\n\nWe require, for the use of the Sandy Bay Boarding School, a portable bake oven having a capacity of approximately 100 - 1\u00bd lb. loaves each baking. The last oven we purchased was in June, for the Lytton Industrial School, and was known as the No. 3 \"Special Economy\" portable oven, manufactured by Jean J. Daoust Limited, St. Boniface, Man.\n\nIn the past, we have obtained ovens for a number of our schools, after securing competitive prices, and the above firm have invariably received the order, as the oven manufactured by them is of much lighter material than that of the other manufacturers, and consequently, they can quote a lower price.\n\nThe oven needed for the Sandy Bay school is of the above type and is the same as was supplied to the Portage la Prairie, Mackay, Qu'Appelle, Fort Frances, Gordon's and Lytton schools during the past two years. The principals and staff of these schools have been quite satisfied with the work performed by this oven. The price of the No. 3 \"Special Economy\" oven, as manufactured by Jean J. Daoust Limited, will be approximately $260, delivered at Sandy Bay. I would be pleased to have your approval for making the purchase from this firm, without the necessity of obtaining prices from other manufacturers making a much heavier oven at a higher price.\n\nF.

Father Chagnon, Principal of the School.\n\nThis tender is by R.L. Bouveron, 662 Agness Street, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nI might say that expect several more tenders on this work, but it is quite a distance from here to Sandy Bay and the trip could not be made under $20.00, but several of the painters in this City said they were going to overlook the work that was to be done on these buildings, and would put in a tender.\n\nThe Asst.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nAs suggested in our last conversation I take the liberty of enclosing a list of articles requested by Rev. Fr O. Chagnon, O.M.I., Principal of Sandy Bay Indian Boarding School when I made my visit at the institution. The Reverend Principal would have followed the usual way of asking through the agent, Mr Ogletree, but the latter is incapacitated by sickness and cannot attend to his work. I must add that according to my judgment all the articles or repairs asked for are necessary and in the case of the Spinning Wheels and Wool Carders of very great utility.\n\n- 4 Clothes Wringers for tubs, the price according to Marshall Wells Catalogue (art No 1857-B10) is $72.90.\n- 24 Steam Boiler tubes, 3\" diameter, 6'10\" \u2014 $96.00\n- 2 Spinning Wheels (Eaton Catalogue) $23.00\n- 2 Pairs of Wool Carders \" \" $3.90\n- 2 Outside Doors 3'x7' \" \" $27.80\n- 1 Singer Sewing Machine about $41.00\n- 1000 feet good quality 1 inch lumber for making cupboards in the cellar $60.00\n  (the latter price is that of the Home Lumber Co.)\n\nMoreover there is a granary which requires important repairs. The building is 28'x14' and needs a concrete floor, a shingle roof and stone or concrete foundations. The Principal is of the opinion that the total cost would not exceed $200.00 as he volunteers to do most of the work if not all with his own men.\n\nKindly give your attention to this matter and advise Rev. Fr O. Chagnon and myself accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Guy, O.M.I.\nOttawa, Oct. 19, 1923.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, relative to certain requests from the principal of the Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nI am pleased to inform you, in reply, that the equipment suggested in your letter will be supplied, with the exception of the spinning wheels and wool carders - articles that the Department does not allow. The Indian agent at Portage la Prairie will be instructed in connection with the purchase of the equipment, and the Rev. Principal will be requested to state explicitly what material is necessary for the improvements to the granary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J.

It is to be noted that the school have painted last in 1915, so to delay this repair would mean much depreciation to the value of the building.\n\nRepair to a grainery near the school; Joists, floor, shingle roof required. This building is 30-14-16\n\nHouse for hired men; According experienced managers of Indian Boarding Schools, unmarried hired men working for these institutions are in many occasions a cause of trouble and worry for those in charge. At Sandy Bay School we have three hired men working by the year, two unmarried ones boarding in the school, the other with his family is living in a log house near by. A house 30-20-16 according my opinion, would accommodate two small families and would answer the purpose. If this house is not built this year the little shanty will need a new flooring and a shingle roof.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nO. Cahoon. O.M.S.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Rogers, Portage la Prairie..............$2,050.00\nGeo. Garnier, \"..........................1,975.00\nE.L.

Bouveron, for the amount of his tender as above cited, namely $1,965.00, money being available from the Vote for Indian Education, No. 279.\n\nThe Board concur in the above recommendation and submit the same for favourable consideration.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

L. Bouweron, of Winnipeg. The contract price is $1,965.00. You should inform Mr. Geo. Garnier and Mr. G. R. Rogers, both of Portage la Prairie, that their tenders, not being the lowest, have not been accepted. You should also intimate to Mr. Thomas Ogletree, of Portage la Prairie, that his tender is not accepted. For your information I have to add that Mr. Curtis' tender, although $10 lower than that of the successful tenderer, was incomplete in that it did not quote on all the work required.\n\nYou should communicate with Mr. E. L. Bouweron, 662 Agnes St., Winnipeg, and with the Rev. Principal of the school and make arrangements to have the painting done as soon as a successful job is possible. It may be necessary to postpone this activity until the spring.\n\nMr. Bouweron should provide all labour and paint; scrape off all blistering paint and place two coats of pure lead paint, mixed with linseed oil and turpentine, on the exterior of the main building, the wash-room, the ice-room, the shop and the garage. The shingles on the roofs should be given one coat of shingle stain. One coat of lime or whitewash should be put on the servants' house, the stables, the granary and the implement shed. Before the second coat of paint is put on the buildings to be painted, he should properly repair the putty of the sashes, including the storm windows. You should inspect the work, before certifying to the final voucher in favour of the contractor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA.

The main building is in fair condition but needs painting. I understand that Mr. Bouyeron, the caretaker who was employed this same time ago, was about to commence the activity. The saw troughs need repairing. The outbuildings were good, with the exception of the main barn, which is old. Flooring is required for the hay loft (4000 ft. shiplap f. o. b. Amaranth). Two beds and mattresses suitable for guests are needed in the school.\n\nI have made a note for the Estimates that a residence for the hired man is required. The main building is lighted by acetylene. The farm is small - only 50 acres is being cropped by the school. The management, however, uses 150 acres of Oblate property, which is 3 miles to the south. They have good agricultural machinery. The grounds around the buildings are ample but are not improved a great deal. The soil is not very suitable for lawn, shrubs, etc. Some ornamental fencing is required for the front garden and lawns.\n\nI noticed that the plumbing was in urgent need of repairs in several important places in the building and I asked Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree to send a plumber up to estimate the cost of putting the water system in fair state of repair. If the expenditure is not too large, it should be attended to without delay.\n\nI was very pleased with Father Chagnon. He is a hard working gentleman and has the interests of the school at heart. His assistant, Father Cordeau, is a splendid little chap and is an excellent worker among the pupils.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed find Estimate of Material required and work to be done at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, with Tenders attached from Mr. Ramez, of Portage la Prairie, and from Mr. Turner of the Standard Heating and Plumbing Co. of Winnipeg.\n\nI also enclose voucher No. 256 amounting to $8.00 in favour of Mr. J.W.

I had thought of making provision in the Estimates, but I am informed that funds are available this fall. I should be pleased if you would arrange to have a suitable building erected by day labour. Two Thousand Dollars may be expended in this connection. I believe it is extremely desirable that the residence be ready for the winter months.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the Deputy Superintendent General has directed that favourable consideration be given to the provision of a residence for hired men and Mr. Commissioner Graham is being asked to arrange for the building, by day labour, without delay. As you were informed in my letter of September 20th, Mr. Commissioner Graham has already been asked to send to the school the shiplap required for the loft floor of the barn. The Department is in correspondence direct with the Rev. Principal, with reference to what is needed at the septic tank. A new windmill top should be provided from school funds. Please secure an estimate of the cost of re-soldering the eave troughs of the main building. Mr. Ferrier reports that this improvement is advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

I therefore request that this sum be\nprovided for in the estimates.\n\nJoseph [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 2)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK. November 8, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, No. 126-9-5, informing me that the Church authorities have been pressing for years for a residence for the hired men at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, and that you had thought of making provision in the estimates for this, but that you now find you have funds available to do the work at once, and asking me to arrange to have the building erected.\n\nI have no information whatever regarding this building other than your letter, although I visited the school within the period you mention. Inspector Christianson has also visited this institution two or three times, and he has never had the question brought to his attention by the Principal. Since your letter was received I called up our Agent at Portage la Prairie, and he informed me that he thought there were other things more important than this residence at the present time, and that the matter could stand.\n\nMr. Christianson is absent from the City today, but he has told me on different occasions about the very elaborate garage that was built at this institution some years ago, and which was not recommended by our Agent. If my memory serves me he told me that there was sleeping accommodation upstairs in this garage. This may be summer sleeping accommodation, I am not sure.\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWinter is now here and it will be just as difficult a matter building this house now as it would be a couple of months hence, and I would ask that the matter be deferred for the time being. I do not know what kind of a building should be erected, if a building at all. No building could be plastered in the dead of winter, nor could concrete be set for the foundation. I regret exceedingly that you cannot see your way clear to take the advice of your officers in the field, in matters of this kind. I cannot see how we can ever expect to have harmony when you deal over the heads of your own officers with the Church authorities, as you have been doing. It makes matters unpleasant for me. You have qualified Inspectors in this field, who are able to judge what should be done and what should not be done. Instead of referring to them, you depend in many cases entirely on the Church authorities and ignore your officers. I tried my very best for over a year to work in harmony with you in regard to this building. If your idea is that I should go ahead and spend money regardless of the necessity for doing so, this is another matter. Enough has been said about the foolish expenditures of money in connection with schools without bringing it up again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nNovember 28th, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the erection of a residence for the school help at the Sandy Bay school. In view of the lateness of the season I concur with you that action should be postponed. In the meantime I should be glad if you would have inquiry made regarding the necessity for this building, and let me have a report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

McLEAN.\n\nChg. Dept. I.A.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA.\n\nCommissioner's Office,\nNo.208-11A. Regina, Sask., December 3rd, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of a letter that came in from Mr. Scott today in connection with the erection of a residence for the school employees at Sandy Bay, in which he states that he would be glad if you would have inquiry made regarding the necessity for this building, and let him have a report.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that I am really at a loss to know what the school authorities want this building for. Outside of the Sisters there are the two Fathers (one being the principal, and the other a missionary for the reserve), and a Brother. Two years ago they had a white man who is married to an Indian woman employed, but the last time I was there they just had a young halfbreed boy. The rest of the work, as far as I know, is done by the boys, and from time to time in busy seasons the school employs some of the ex-pupils but they live in their own homes on the reserve, coming to work in the morning and going home at night.\n\nThe amount of land farmed by the school on the reserve is about 100 acres; the balance of farming land being situated off the reserve along the Eastern boundary and, I would judge, about two and a half or three miles from the school. As far as my information goes this land belongs to the Church and there is a log house and stable on it.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nChateau Laurier,\nOttawa.\nIt may be that the Priests want to move their quarters out of the school. I cannot see that they need a house for the staff unless it is their intention to hire a married Farming Instructor, and that the house would provide accommodation for him.\n\nIf the Department will look up their files I believe that the argument advanced by the Principal when he was asking for the garage that was built at the school was that he wanted accommodation up over the garage in the way of sleeping quarters for men. The money was furnished for this building and it was erected according to his own plans. It may not be fitted up for winter accommodation, but it is certainly all right for summer, and as far as I can see the school is in no more need of extra accommodation for the staff at the present time than they have been ever since the school was built.\n\nWhat is needed at this point more than anything else is extra school accommodation, as there are more children on the reserves than there is accommodation for and, if I remember correctly, the last time I was there Father Chagnon told me that he had a waiting list of about thirty.\n\nI am giving you this information, thinking you would probably wish to discuss the matter with the Minister while you are there.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Christianson.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa December 1st, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo with reference to the erection of a residence at the Sandy Bay school asking to have enquiry made regarding the necessity for such a building.\n\nI attach herewith a report that I received from Inspector Christianson who is familiar with the conditions at Sandy Bay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

The cost of this will be approximately $65.00 for the material only, as the work can be done by the help at the school.\n\nA line of water pipe in the Infirmary also requires cleaning and repairing at an estimated cost of $100.00, which will have to be done by a plumber. The Agent also refers to the necessity of renewing the tubes in the steam boiler.\n\nI shall be glad to receive authority to expend the necessary amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 8, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 206-11A of the first instant, with reference to further plumbing which is required at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. You are authorized to expend $65.00 in the purchase of self-closing basin cocks. I note that the installation can be made by the school management. You may also engage a plumber to clean and repair the water pipe in the infirmary, at an estimated cost of $100.00. Further, if you consider it necessary to renew the tubes in the steam boiler, you may make arrangements; but I have to request that you will keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sept 11th, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI might mention the fact that I found a great difference in dealing with the Principal at this point and the Principal at Fort Alexander where nothing could be done without being paid for. Here, the Principal, without any suggestion on my part, offered to haul the lumber with his own team and men free of charge, and to dig the cellar, haul the gravel and paint the building and assist the carpenter when he came in every possible way so as to get the work done and keep within the amount allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nRegina, Sask., Sept 18th, 1925\n\nSir,\n\nThe Inspector speaks very favourably of the conditions at the Sandy Bay School, and you will see from his report that he has a high opinion of the Principal, and feels that he will cooperate with the Department, and makes a comparison with the Principal of Fort Alexander.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nRegina, Sask. Sept 11th, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nThe school buildings are all in a pretty fair state of repair. The exterior of the school was painted two years ago. The interior is beginning to show lack of attention, as nothing has been done in the way of decoration since it was built, and there are places that need re-plastering - the plaster having come loose in several spots and fallen off. It, however, is not bad yet but will soon need attention. The whole school requires decorating inside, but this need not be done all at once. The Principal informed me that he would be quite willing to do as much of the painting as he could himself with the help of his staff, and stated that if the Department would furnish him with 300 lbs of white lead, 5 gallons of turpentine, 40 gallons of boiled oil and 10 lbs of lamp black together with 4 brushes, he would be able to put this paint on this year. As it would not cost very much money I would ask, if the Department have funds, that this material be furnished. He has also asked for a cream separator about 50 lb. capacity. I would recommend that this be allowed, as the Principal has not the funds with which to make the purchase and the one in use at the present time is completely worn out.\n\nThere were about 60 children present when I was at the school, which has accommodation for seventy. The remaining ten children were expected that week.\n\nArrangements were made while I was there in connection with the building of a Farming Instructor's house at the school, and the only matter in question was the size of the house, which you have since decided upon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson\nInspector.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner, R e\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 2)\nRegina, Sask. Sept 16th, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nYou will note that the building requires considerable interior decorating, and the Principal asks for a certain amount of material. I think it would be well to supply this at once\u2014300 lbs of white lead, 5 gallons of turpentine, 40 gallons of boiled oil and 10 lbs of lamp black and a few brushes would not cost a lot of money but it would help to get a lot of work done. I do not know whether I am prepared to recommend the purchase of a cream separator. Are we doing this for all schools? The material for the Farming Instructor's house at the school has been ordered and the Principal is going to assist us in erecting this. As he has asked for a change to be made which entails a little more work he is offsetting this by his own labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Sept. 23, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, covering Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. I note, with satisfaction, that the principal is cooperating with your office in connection with the improvements. You are authorized to purchase the following materials, so that the interior decorating may commence this year. It is understood that the school management will be responsible for the labour. Competitive prices should be secured in the usual manner:\n\n- 300 lbs. White lead.\n- 5 gal. Turpentine.\n- 40 \" Boiled oil.\n- 10 lbs.

Everything around the school, both outside and in, was clean and tidy. The garden was in excellent shape. The same can be said of the summerfallow. The school has about 150 acres under crop this year, which was an exceptionally heavy crop, but badly affected by rust, thus causing a decrease in yield. The school owns about 60 head of cattle; were milking 20 cows; own 59 hogs, and about 200 chickens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nW. M.

There was an appropriation of $2000.00 in the Estimates this year to cover this expenditure, and in August Inspector Christianson went down there for the purpose of arranging for the material etc. The plans which he had with him were for a house that we could have kept well within that figure, but the Principal was anxious to get a place large enough to accommodate two families. On his return the Inspector submitted this to me, and about the same time I had a communication from the Rev. Father Boys of St. Boniface, asking me, if possible, to endeavor to meet with the Principal's request, as they needed a house large enough to hold two families at the school. I then got out another bill of material and submitted it to Messrs. Brown & Rutherford, who were the lowest tenderers on the previous bill, and I found that the material for the present house would cost over $400.00 more than the material for the house which I had originally intended to build. However, as the season was advanced, and our men who had been building at the Little Sagkeehwan and Dog Creek Reserves were on their way over to Sandy Bay I could not do anything else but go on with the work. The Principal, however, agreed to do the handling, take out the excavation, and do the painting gratis with his own staff, and to give any other assistance possible in order to keep down the expense. At the present time I cannot just say what the additional cost will be, but it will be somewhere in the neighborhood of two or three hundred dollars. The erection of the house is well under way and will be finished in the course of a week or ten days.\n\nI trust that my action in this matter will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 6, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 208-11A of the 2nd instant, relative to the erection of a house for the farming instructor at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. It is noted that, owing to the desire of the Principal and the Rev. Father Bays, a house with sufficient accommodation for two families, which is larger than was at first contemplated, is in course of erection and consequently the additional cost will be approximately $200. Your action, in incurring the extra expenditure over the amount appropriated, is approved. When timely, please forward accounts for the material, labour, etc., in the construction of the house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

As the Department wishes to have Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham's recommendation in connection with repairs and replacements to buildings, I am returning this letter to you, with the request that you send it to Regina with your comments.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nSANDY BAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThis school had been closed for the summer holidays and had just re-opened. About 60 children were present at the time of my visit and the rest were expected to arrive in a few days. Everything around the school was in good order.\n\nThey have been very unfortunate this year, their crop was practically a total failure on account of the dry weather. Their gardens, however, looked well and they will probably get sufficient potatoes and vegetables for their own use.\n\nAs you are aware, there is considerable repair work to be done at this institution and to get a price on this, I got Mr. Turner of the Standard Plumbing & Heating Co. Ltd., Winnipeg, who has previously done a lot of work at this school, to go up there with me and I am attaching herewith his tender for this work.\n\n$800.00 was allowed by the Department for repairs in connection with the school and this amount will in no way be sufficient to meet the requirements. The work that I authorized while I was there was,- the deepening of the well at the stable. It had gone dry and the well driller had set his machine over the well and cleaned it out. This, however, did not start the flow of water, and from the lay of the land and other wells around there, it would be necessary to go through a limestone rock at the bottom of the well. As the well driller would have pulled away\n\nW.M. Graham, ssq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nunless he received instructions to go ahead with the work, I authorized the expenditure of an amount not to exceed $150.00 to be spent on deepening this well, and less if he struck water sooner than expected. I also authorized the purchase of material for the following work. The Principal and the staff were to furnish the labour.\n\n20 pcs. stair treads, 4 ft. long on the Boys' side.\n\nConcrete foundation at the bottom of the outside stair.\n\nConcrete cribbing for the reservoirs at the barn well and the school well.\n\nThese wells have been lined with plank, but this has rotted away so badly that you could pull pieces out by hand, and I saw it was absolutely necessary to have them re-lined. This will probably take about 50 sacks of cement. I also authorized the purchase of 1,000 ft. of lumber for cribbing, repairing interior of ice house, etc., and repairing plaster in Girls' Dormitory, providing the Principal can get a local man to do the work.\n\nTotal cost authorized by me.\n\nWell $150.00\n\nCost of material, cement, lumber, etc. $150.00\n\nTotal $300.00\n\nI will also enumerate on the work figured on by Mr. Turner.\n\n1. 5' x 5'6\" galvanized iron tank. The water is pumped from the well up to tanks in the attic. The tank in question is one of three and the bottom is so badly rusted that it cannot be repaired. The eave-troughing also needs re-soldering. For this work and supplying a new tank his price is $116.00.\n2. **Main Steam Boiler.** Installing new grate bars and arch plate and re-lining the side walls with fire brick, and point up brick-work on outside of boiler, repair defective water column, etc. I might say that the fire-box is in very poor shape; the grates are warped, and the brick side wall is badly tumbled down, and in its present shape it would probably not get through the winter. The price for this work and material is $198.00.\n\n3. **Acetyline Gas Machine.** The school is lit up by Acetyline Gas. This machine is practically worn out and leaks gas as the carbide has eaten holes around the bottom rim of the machine. I would judge that it is very unsafe in its present condition. If this kind of a lighting system is to be continued a new machine is necessary; the cost is $225.00.\n\n4. **Septic Tank.** The Septic Tank is about 200 ft. from the building and seems to have completely caved in. The concrete top and walls have all crumbled. The price on this is $614.00. This includes the making of a manhole between the building and the septic tank where the drains come from each side of the school into the main sewer. This, the Principal informs me, has often blocked up and they should have some means of cleaning this place out.\n\n5. **Heating Pipes in Laundry.** These pipes were all leaking; eaten out with rust, etc., so badly that they cannot be repaired without replacing them with new pipes. The price for this work is $239.00.\n\nThe toilet and the drain pipes also seem to be badly clogged up and in another year it will probably be necessary to take down the drain pipe and clean them out. Some of the pipes will probably have to be replaced, but this is a big undertaking and a costly one.\none. Mr. Turner was under the impression that if the toilets were all cleaned out with acid, it would be sufficient for this year. This would cost about $20.00.\n\nTotal cost of repairs as outlined by the Standard Plumbing & Heating Co. Ltd., amount to $1412.00.\n\nThe Principal is also asking for four washing machines and three wringers, which are certainly badly needed. The ones they have in the Laundry now are practically useless. These will cost about $100.00.\n\nSummary of Expenditure\n\n| Already authorized | $300.00 |\n|-------------------|---------|\n| Amount of tender from Standard Plumbing & Heating Co. Ltd. | $1412.00 |\n| Washing Machines & Wringers | $100.00 |\n| **Total** | **$1812.00** |\n\nIn the Department's letter dated the 16th June, advising you that $800.00 was available for repairs and replacements at this institution, they mentioned that the individual requests of the church authorities were gutters, inside staircase, foundation of exterior staircase, flooring of Boys' Recreation Room and flooring and ceiling of stable, and repairs to interior of ice house and some equipment for the laundry and dairy. The equipment for the Laundry, I have enumerated. A Cream Separator was required for the dairy, but the Principal has already purchased this and paid for it. The other articles mentioned have been attended to, with the exception of the flooring for the boys' recreation room. This is not needed, and flooring and ceiling for the stable is also not necessary. This has come up several times and I have always been under the impression that it was a waste of money putting additional flooring in the loft of the stable. This building is in very poor shape. The construction of the stable is of log\nlog framework and just lined on the outside with two ply of rough boards, no lining whatever on the inside. The foundation was of stone and mortar but the mortar has all pretty well washed away leaving the bare stones. On the West and North side of the building the foundation has rotted away badly and most of the boards from a foot up to two feet are all rotted. This is caused by no eave-troughing being on this side of the building and the water running down the boards and lying around the foundation. It will probably hang together for another winter but I certainly would not recommend any further expenditure on this building at the present time as it is going to be a very difficult job to repair the foundation, and until this is done it would not be wise to spend money on repairing the rest of the building. This is something that should be provided for in the estimates this year.\n\nI consider that the repairs I have enumerated are absolutely necessary and in addition to this, it may be necessary to clean out some of the drains under the floor as the whole drain and sewerage system seems to have gone out of order.\n\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThis institution was also just re-opening after the holidays and about 80 children were present and they expected about 20 more to arrive this week. Everything in connection with this institution was in A1 shape and I never saw the place look better. They were just harvesting an excellent crop and Mr. Henry, the Principal, informed me that he expected to thresh about 6,000 bushels of grain. The summerfellow, gardens, etc., and the premises in general, are a credit to any institution.\ninstitution.\n\nThe outside buildings have all been painted this summer by the school boys and the work has been well done. Considerable painting has also been done in the interior of the school. The repair work to the balconies, etc., that was authorized while you were in Ottawa has not been done yet but the Principal informed me that he expected Mr. Hamilton, who does any carpenter work of that kind around the school, to arrive in a few days. The only expenditure necessary at the present time is the following:\n\nA ventilating system was put in the barn last year with one ventilator on the roof; we find this is not sufficient, another one should be placed there to insure proper ventilation. This will cost about $40.00. Mr. Henry also asked to be supplied with 20 gals. of paint and 5 gals. of oil to do some inside decorating during the winter. Some of the steps in the stairs should also be replaced as a few of them are practically worn out. Mr. Henry will have these replaced if he is furnished with the material. There is about 14 steps that need replacing. I would ask that this expenditure be allowed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\nREGINA, SASK., August 27th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the Sandy Bay Residential School which was visited by Mr. Christianson last week. I sent Mr. Christianson there for the purpose of looking into the conditions of the buildings and to find out what repairs were absolutely necessary to put this institution in good shape. He has given a very clear detailed report and I think the $1412.00 asked for should be spent. To meet this amount we have an unexpended authority of $500.00 so that it will take $900.00 additional to meet the expenses outlined. In addition to the above, you will note that he mentions Washing Machines and Wringers are urgently required, which expenditure will amount to approximately $100.00. I would be glad to have this authority at the earliest possible moment so that we can get the work done.\n\nThe report on the Portage la Prairie Residential School is highly satisfactory. We always get good reports from this institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nRegina, Sask., Oct. 29th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nSandy Bay Reserve.\n\nI saw Mr. Turner of the Standard Heating and Plumbing Company in Winnipeg, and he advised me that the work which they have undertaken at the Sandy Bay school was practically completed, but that they were having trouble with the septic tank, as there was hardly sufficient slope to take the overflow from the tank. The ground there, as you know, is very level, and it is a very difficult place for drainage. I, however, pointed out to Mr. Turner that he had undertaken this work and we would expect him to make a satisfactory job.\n\nM. Christianson.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree, enclosing a copy of one received by him from the Rev. Principal of the Sandy Bay Boarding School, in which he makes a request to have a very large barn built, to accommodate 60 head of cattle and 20 head of horses.\n\nI took this matter up with Mr. Inspector Christianson who is familiar with the situation at Sandy Bay, and who was referred to by the Principal as being aware of the conditions, and Mr. Christianson informs me he is of the opinion that, with an expenditure of from seven to eight hundred dollars at the outside, the existing barn could be made to give very good service for a number of years to come. The Inspector points out that the foundations under the north and east walls have more or less sunk and rotted away; these will have to be replaced by new timbers and cement and the building refloored. It would cost from four to six thousand dollars to build a new barn such as the Rev. Principal asks for, and from the information which I have I do not think the Department would be justified in incurring such an expenditure, especially in view of the fact that there is much more important work to be done.\n\nI believe\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI believe that Mr. Mayoh, whom I have employed to do a great deal of our work, would be quite capable of going down next Spring and making a good job of this building if we had authority to do the work. There is no person in the Sandy Bay district who could undertake to do it, or who would make the money go as far as it should. My recommendation is that the Department place an amount of $800.00 in the Estimates for this purpose. It may not take this much money to complete the necessary work, but it is best to have a safe margin, and if there is a surplus it can be returned to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

LTD.\n\nWinnipeg, Canada,\n\nFebruary 3rd, 1927.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe-Residential School, Sand Bay, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 31st ultimo concerning an amount of $75.18, charged by us as an extra on the Septic Tank, constructed in connection with the building above noted, we would give you further explanation in the matter as it appears that previous letters could not have constituted a satisfactory submission.\n\nThe method of disposing of the effluent from the building was considered by us with Mr. Christianson of your staff in the Summer of last year, and it was decided that we should submit a proposal for constructing a reinforced concrete septic tank having general dimensions 12'-0\" x 8'-0\" x 10'-0\" deep, with two compartments each having manholes and double cover, those being dimensions that Mr. Christianson decided on.\n\nWhen we were considering this matter first at Sandy Bay, we were informed that the existing arrangements for sewer disposal were by means of a septic tank, but that the tank then in use had fallen in, and it was necessary to replace it by another. Thus it is, that the contract was duly entered into for the construction of a Septic Tank of the dimensions required by Mr. Christianson, according to our quotation included with other quotations in letter of August 20th last, addressed to Mr. Christianson, naming the cost of the septic tank at $614.00.\n\nAfter we had completed our contract and had re-arranged the drains so as to cut off the old tank and have the effluent go into the new one, it was discovered that the old tank was not of septic tank design but merely used as a cesspool, and we also discovered that the nature of the ground was not suitable for the proper operation of a septic tank system of sewer disposal, because of the presence of ground water, which we have since learned, saturates the soil practically all the year round.\n\nThe new tank we would state was built in ground that was high lying in comparison with the old tank site.\nHaving completed our contract and become entitled to payment, we might have come away and left matters as satisfactorily completed according to instructions, but we felt that neither Mr. Christianson nor yourself when confronted with the real situation of affairs would appreciate it if we did not take advantage of the opportunity of re-arranging the outlets so that the effluent might overflow into the ground. This is the reason of our extra charge of $75.18, and we can do no other than stand by our claim.\n\nInstead of letting this matter overflow through the opening near the top of the tank and mingle with the waters in the ground floor, we suggest that the tank be pumped out and contents removed to a point far away from the wells, or the source of water supply for building.\n\nOur recommendation in letter of November 15th last to construct a second tank is to allow for the new tank existing to be completely covered over. The contents, after bacterial action has taken place, will leave the tank by way of the Syphon and enter the second tank, which from time to time can be emptied by pumping.\n\nWe submit the above explanation for your consideration. You will doubtless realize how that in untried sections of the country it is very difficult for any person to decide on what will be a thoroughly satisfactory method of sewerage disposal, for as in all other matters relating to human habitations, there have to be pioneers to discover what systems of construction are suitable for the different localities.\n\nOur sub-contractor, R.M.Wyatt is pressing for payment of his bill, amounting to $75.18, and we trust that you will see your way clear to passing the item through the Department for payment. If it should want any further explanations, please let us know.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE STANDARD PLUMBING & HEATING CO. LTD.\n\nPer: (Sgd) J. R. Turner\nSir:-\n\nUnder cover of my letter of January 3rd, File 208-11A, I forwarded to the Department, Regina Voucher No. 4549 for $705.00, in favour of The Standard Plumbing & Heating Co. Ltd., Winnipeg.\n\nOn their statement for $614.00, you will note that the amount of $75.18 was deducted. This was on the advice of our Agent at Portage la Prairie. You are aware that his recommendations are not always to be relied upon. I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Turner, the Manager of the company, a copy of which I enclose, giving his reasons for this extra charge and if the Department think he is entitled to this extra payment, I would recommend that he be paid the additional $75.18 which was deducted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

(RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., August 18th, 1927\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report from Inspector Christianson who recently made a visit to the various schools in the Portage la Prairie Agency, which deals largely with buildings and repairs at the different points.\n\nWith regard to the sewage disposal system at the Sandy Bay School, which has been entirely unsatisfactory in the past, it seems to me that arrangements should be made to have an engineer sent there. Perhaps the Department could arrange with the Provincial Government of Manitoba to send one of their Sanitary Engineers to that point and have him make a report as to what is necessary. The plumbing throughout the building should be overhauled and I should be glad to have your authority to proceed with this work. I doubt if anything can be done to remedy the condition of the sewage system this winter, but the plumbing certainly should be overhauled with the least possible delay.\n\nWith reference to the amount of $800.00 granted to the Principal for repairs to the stable at the Sandy Bay School, the Inspector has gone over this building again and he is of the opinion that it might be well to postpone the spending of this money. The question now is as to whether a new building should be erected.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nbe erected. The Principal can very well get along during the coming winter with the existing stable in the condition it is in now.\n\nWith regard to the cisterns authorized by you last year, these are needed and I have instructed the Principal to go ahead and have the work done, at a cost not exceeding $150.00.\n\nI would ask for your authority to put a new furnace in the Fairford Improved Day School. This will cost a little more than if it were in a town, as the expenses of a man to install it will have to be paid, viz:- his transportation to and from the school, etc. $400.00 should be authorized; it may not take this amount but it will be well to have it available.\n\nThe other items mentioned in the Inspector's report will be dealt with through the Estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSANDY BAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI also paid a visit to the boarding school at Sandy Bay, and as per your instructions, I instructed the Principal to go on with the work on the drain in the basement as I saw this was needed. They are to receive $75.00 for labour. This, of course, will not be sufficient as they are doing a lot of the work themselves, but the $75.00 is simply to give them a little assistance and the Department is to furnish the tile. There is considerable repair work that should be attended to around this school, such as floors heaving, stairs worn out, etc., and an amount should be placed in the estimates for the coming year. It would be necessary to employ a good carpenter to do this work.\n\nThe septic tank is another matter that is unsatisfactory at this school. You will remember that we renewed this tank last fall, but on account of the slight fall, it blocks up at times. The contractor who did the work on the septic tank last fall recommended that another\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School. (Cont'd)\n\ntank be built the same size, and an engine be used for pumping the tanks. This may be the only solution, but I am of the opinion that the proper way to proceed would be to have a sanitary engineer look into this matter and then advise us what is the best thing to do. The Principal also claimed that several of the closets in the school were blocked up and not in working order and he is of the opinion that the main stack is so badly corroded that it is filled up. This would be work for a plumber and will have to be attended to before the cold weather sets in.\n\nThe matter of repairing the stable has been under consideration for two or three years and the Principal has an amount of $800.00 to spend on it, but is of the opinion that it would probably be money wasted and I quite agree with him, because, as I have said in a previous report, a lot of the foundation is rotten it being very poorly built in the first place. To get at the actual facts we would need to have a first class builder go over the building to see if it was worth repairing and I think it would be money well spent to get Mr. Ellwood, who is a reliable builder in Portage la Prairie, to go up and examine the stable and then have him submit a report as to whether it is worth fixing and what the cost would be.\n\nLast fall the Department authorized certain expenditures at the school and on my visit there last August you instructed me to go into this matter with the Principal and I authorized him to spend $150.00 on cisterns for the two wells, which are needed, the material amounting to about $150.00 and the work was to be done by the school staff. On account of the bad weather last fall the Principal could not go on with the work, but this is now required and he would like to have your authority to go.\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School (Cont'd)\nto go on with the work.\n\nSigned\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Chief Engineer.\nREPORT\n\nIn his letter of August 29th Mr. Johnston stated that the Department of Indian Affairs had as a result of unsatisfactory sewage conditions at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School requested that engineers of this Bureau make an investigation of the conditions and submit a report with recommendations for the overhauling of the sewage system.\n\nWinnipeg, September 26th, 1927\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIn his letter of August 26th Mr. Johnston stated that the Department of Indian Affairs had as a result of unsatisfactory sewerage conditions at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School requested that engineers of this Branch make an inspection of the conditions and submit a report with estimates of costs for the overhauling of the sewerage system. Following this the writer and Mr. Rose visited Sandy Bay Indian Residential School during the week beginning September 12th and made the necessary survey and inspection of the work. The report which follows describes the present sewerage disposal system and recommends what work together with estimates of the cost is necessary to put the system into satisfactory working conditions.\n\nPRESENT SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM.\n\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School is on the west side of Lake Manitoba in Township 18, Range 9, West of the Principal Meridian. The school, which is situated about one mile back from the shore of the lake, was opened in 1905 and the disposal of the sewerage at that time consisted in simply running the sewerage through an eight-inch tile down to a small creek which, as shown on the general layout plan, is located a short distance below the school. This system, although always giving a certain amount of trouble from odors, was in operation until 1913, when a concrete septic tank was installed a short distance above the creek, the affluent from this tank running into the creek. This system was in operation until the fall of 1926 when as the tank was being cleaned out the structure collapsed. A contract was then let to the Standard Plumbing and Heating Company for a new septic tank.\nwhich was built in the late fall of 1926. The location of this tank which is now in use is shown on the accompanying plan. For a short time conditions appeared satisfactory but at the end of December, 1926, Father Chagnon, Principal of the School, stated that water started seeping up through the floor of the basement and though this condition to some extent passed away, trouble again occurred from this cause in June and July of this year, the rise of water in the basement floor becoming so pronounced that the school authorities were instructed by the Department of Indian Affairs to uncover all the outside sewer pipe and the septic tank in order, if possible, to discover the cause of the trouble. At the time of the visit the tile drains and tank were uncovered and open for inspection and showed that the sewer pipes were three-quarters full of solids; the pipes in poor condition, a number being broken; that the eight-inch tile leading to the septic tank was reduced to a three-inch pipe of entry into the tank, and that owing to settlement of the ground or some other cause the connection at the tank was broken. The disposal of the sewage under these conditions was very unsatisfactory, the sewage slowly seeping away through the pipes and through the broken connection into the septic tank and from there through a short tile drain down to the ditch leading to the creek. There is very little breaking up of the solid matter, the sewage gradually draining into the ditch and creek and causing a very bad odor.\n\nIt was not possible to make an examination of the drain pipe under the basement floor of the school and it is assumed that though these pipes may be partially filled with solids that they are in good condition.\nPROPOSED ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS.\n\nThe disposal system as recommended has been decided on in view of the following considerations:\n\n1. The ground from the school towards the lake has very little fall and is not favorable for a modern sewage disposal system at a moderate cost.\n\n2. Though it is considered that the present septic tank is too small for the proper treatment of the sewage from an institution as large as the school, it was thought advisable that in view of its recent installation that some use if possible should be made of it in the proposed system.\n\n3. The source of the drinking water for the school is rain water and not from wells, so that there is no danger of contamination from disposing of unpurified sewage in the ground.\n\n4. It was advisable if possible to provide a system that would do away with the disposal of semi-purified sewage into the small creek as with the small available fall the sewage practically seeps away causing, during the warm weather, disagreeable odors.\n\nIn view of the above it is proposed to utilize the present tank and run the effluent from it into a large cesspool located immediately below. The present septic tank is a concrete structure with a settling chamber 5 feet by 6 feet by 10 feet deep. From this chamber the sewage flows through a dividing wall through a three inch pipe into a siphon chamber, though no siphons have been installed. Though, as already stated, this tank is too small for the proper breaking up of the solids it still will effect a certain action along this line and in combination with a cesspool should give a fairly satisfactory disposal of the sewage.\n\nThe cesspool proposed would be 25 feet long by 10 feet wide with a concrete bottom and wooden sides and roof, and as shown on the attached plan it would be located about 20 feet below the present septic tank. To avoid undue maintenance costs all lumber used in the tank is to be...\ncreosoted. The roof would be placed about one foot below the ground so that there would be no unsightly structures showing. Two man-holes in the roof reaching to the ground level would give necessary access to the tank for cleaning or other purposes. By use of the cesspool any disagreeable odors which have been experienced in the past would be done away with as the sewage instead of trickling away into the creek would by use of the cesspool gradually drain away underground.\n\nThe present tile pipes are in such condition that it is necessary to relay all these pipes with new tile at proper grade. In replacing the eight-inch tile six-inch will be used as this size will easily handle the sewage from the school. As shown on the general layout plan it is also proposed to have two man-holes, one immediately outside the building on the right branch of the sewer pipe leading from the school. This man-hole is considered necessary as at this point the foundation drain running around the school is connected to the sanitary sewer and according to Father Chaganon due to the rats, a certain amount of earth is carried from this drain into the sanitary sewer. With a manhole located at this point the foundation drain can be trapped in the man-hole and the danger of earth being carried into the sanitary sewer overcome. The other man-hole will be located at the junction of the two drains from the school and from this man-hole the sewer will run direct to the septic tank, thus doing away with the right angle bend which now occurs just before the sewer pipe enters the septic tank. The small three-inch pipe connecting the sewer to the septic tank will also be replaced by one of proper size, as it is considered that this has had quite a bit to do with the retarding of the sewage and causing a gradual blocking up.\nIn addition to the above the sewer pipes under the basement floor of the school should be thoroughly flushed and cleaned by a plumber as no doubt due to outside stoppage of flow these pipes will be badly choked.\n\nWith the cleaning out of the sewer pipes underneath the basement floor, the replacing of the pipes outside the school, proper connections to the septic tank, and with the cesspool installed as described above, a satisfactory disposal of the sewage should be accomplished. On account of the small size of the septic tank it will probably be necessary to remove the solids every six months, but the cleaning out of the cesspool will probably not have to be done more than once in three or four years.\n\nThe disposal of the sewage in the manner above described is only allowable in view of the fact that the drinking water for the school is not obtained from wells but from rain water which is collected in a large concrete tank outside the school. For this reason it is not necessary to take into account the contamination of the ground water by sewage which has not been properly purified.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This tank is actually too small by itself for the work required of it, but in conjunction with the cesspool the system should give satisfactory results.\n\nIn view of the fact that there will be only a few more weeks of suitable weather this season Mr. Attwood suggests that the building of the cesspool should be left over until next spring. He recommends, however, that the sewer pipe should be relaid and the pipes in the basement cleaned out immediately, as the present conditions at the school are very unsanitary and disagreeable.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In the first place the tank installed is too small for what it is intended to do. Then in examining the sewer pipe from the building to the tank, we found it had no grade, in fact, just at the point of the building, in place of it sloping down grade, it was inclined to slope back to the building\u2014this making this sewer pipe line practically useless. We also found that the pipe line was constructed with an eight inch tile, running from the building, and where it enters the Sceptic Tank, it was reduced down to a four inch, which in our opinion means that they would have been just as well off if they had run a four inch pipe the entire length, as reducing it to a four inch cuts off the capacity to a four inch pipe.\n\nWe are,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nAB/S\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ogletree,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nSir,\n\nInspection were made of the two boilers at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School and Inspector Heys reports as follows:\n\n\"On Wednesday I visited the Indian School at Sandy Bay and found two boilers there, one being used for the Laundry and the other for heating premises. The boiler for the laundry itself was in good shape, but another boiler connected to it was not good; one of the heads being in poor condition. They had been carrying about 40 lbs. pressure on this boiler, but I cut it down to 20 lbs. to make it safe, as they said they could get along with that amount. However, I advised them to replace with a new heater as soon as possible. I could not make hydrostatic test as I had not test pump with me (being prepared only for heating boilers), and there was a fire on boiler at the time, so had to be satisfied with external inspection.\n\nThe heating boiler was in good shape except for minor repairs, as ordered on my report. It is a return tubular boiler and the main flues run along top of boiler to chimney; just below the ceiling. This flue I found in very dirty condition and full of soot, although the ceiling is painted with asbestos plaster. It is a fire menace. I called the attention of the caretaker to this danger, and he promised to look after it. My intention was to leave a written report to that effect, but overlooked it. I was thinking if you were writing Mr. Ogletree, Indian Agent at Portage, you might draw this to his attention, or if you think it best I will notify him.\n\nIt was a very hard trip getting into this school, being about 80 miles from here, over the worst of roads and to make matters worse I had to come back in the dark and raining all the way. Was on the road most of the night.\"\n\nMr. Ogletree\n\nI attach copies of Inspector's reports 405-406 of October 4th and would draw your attention to the inspection fees, which are $8.00. Kindly remit and much obliged.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n(Sgd) A Macleanaray,\nChief Inspector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This work, which was authorized in your letter of October 6th, comprises the re-laying of the outside drains to the septic tank, the cleaning out of the pipes in the basement and the building of the man-holes recommended in Mr. Craig's report of September 26th. Mr. Babb, in his letter accompanying the accounts, requests that payment for this work may be made as promptly as possible, and in view of the comparatively large outlay for the small profit due him I would be obliged if a cheque covering this account be forwarded at an early date. In forwarding this cheque, please have the Department of Indian Affairs transmit it through this office.\n\nThough the building of the cess-pool has been left over until next year, as instructed, the school authorities should have no trouble in the disposal of their sewage in the meantime. With reference to the estimate for the cess-pool as given in Mr. Craig's report, I wish to point out that at the time the estimate was made a price of $80.00 per thousand feet board measure for creosoted lumber was secured from the local representative of the creosoting company in Calgary. Sometime afterwards, however, I was advised that this price of $80.00 per thousand should be increased to $110.50 per thousand, as the price first submitted had been corrected by the creosoting company in Calgary. As 4,000 feet of creosoted lumber are called for this will increase the estimate for the cess-pool by $122.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. H.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received a letter from Reverend Father Guy referring to the probable estimates for our Indian Residential Schools, and I have noticed with regret that the Sandy Bay School will get credit only for sewage disposal. But as a sum of $800.00 has already been authorized for repairs of the stable, and as the work was not proceeded with, it seems that no new appropriation was made for Sandy Bay.\n\nReverend Father Chagnon, Principal of Sandy Bay School, not being aware that Rev. Father Guy was going to Ottawa, has written Oct. 7th to Mr. Agent Ogletree asking him to submit to the Department the following requirements:\n\na) New stable for 60 heads of cattle, 20 horses and 200 chickens. Lumber could be hauled from Amaranth Station to School, 7 miles at a rate of $2.50 per thousand, provided hauling takes place in winter.\n\nb) Maple flooring for boys' recreation 30 by 40.\n\nc) Medal Laundry Washing Machine, $17.75 at Eaton's Winnipeg.\n\nd) About 1000 ft of one inch lumber to make cupboard from floor to ceiling in sewing Room.\n\nReverend Father Chagnon has repeatedly during the last three years petitioned for a new stable. He thought that to repair the old one was a mere waste of money, and this was also the opinion of Mr. Graham, as may be inferred from his letter of August 18th, 1927.\n\nWith reference of the amount of $800.00 authorized for repairs to the stable at your School, writes Mr. Graham, it is a question in my mind as to whether this work should be proceeded with or not, as I am doubtful whether the building would warrant spending this money on it, and it might be better to erect a new building. I am not saying that we should, but the matter will be thoroughly looked into and if you can get along during the coming winter, as I am told you can, with the existing stable, I will have an opportunity of getting into the matter before the estimates are prepared.\n\nThe estimates have been prepared and nothing is provided. The Reverend Principal told me it is more than doubtful whether the old stable would stand for another year. I hope it is not too late to have the Sandy Bay School requirements included in the supplementary estimates.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDecember 12, 1927.\n\nDear Father Magnan:\n\nI have your letter of the last instant, with reference to the requirements at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. I am writing to Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham for a definite recommendation regarding the stable. He was evidently of the opinion that it would do for another year or two because it was not included in his Estimates. I am authorizing Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree, of Portage, to purchase the maple flooring, lumber and washing machine mentioned in your letter. He will see the Rev. Principal before selecting the material.\n\nWishing you the Compliments of the Season, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. J. Magnan, O.M.I.,\n340 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\nOttawa, December 12, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to authorize you to purchase 1200 feet of maple flooring, 1000 feet of 1\" lumber and 1 \"Model\" laundry washing machine, for the use of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. The flooring is for the boys' recreation room, and the lumber for making a cupboard in the sewing room. The washing machine required can be purchased from the T. Eaton Company, Winnipeg, for $17.75. Before actually making these purchases, you should correspond with Rev. Father Chagnon, informing him that you have received authority, and secure his confirmation concerning just what is required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nOttawa, December 12, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Church authorities are pressing for the early erection of a new stable at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. I should be grateful if you would make enquiry and let me know when this building is really required. I understand that there are 50 head of cattle and 20 horses at the school, but I am sure that it is not necessary to stable this number.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nI have acknowledged receipt of your letter of the 12th instant #126-9-5 informing me that the Church authorities are pressing for the early erection of a new stable at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. You express the opinion that it is not necessary to build a barn to house 50 head of cattle and 20 head of horses, and I may say that I agree with you. We do not provide stabling for half this number of stock at any school in the West, and it is not the intention to allow them to keep so many.\n\nIn regard to the existing barn at the Sandy Bay School, this matter has been under discussion for some considerable time, and I have again taken it up with Inspector Christianson today, who is quite familiar with the situation, and to use his own expression - \"It would be a positive shame to discard this building.\" He describes it as being a very large barn, the skeleton built of spruce logs and sided with two thicknesses of common lumber, and covered with lumber and metallic roofing. The back and one end of this building have become somewhat deteriorated, owing to the fact that manure has been piled against it to keep the building warm, and this has rotted away the lumber to some extent. The Inspector thinks it will be necessary to have it re-sided, and parts of the stone and cement foundation will require repairing.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nInspector\nInspector Christianson, on the occasion of his next visit to the agency, will take with him a practical builder and will see just what can be done to put the building in shape.\n\nI feel that the authorities of this school have heard what is going on in the way of building at other points and it is just a matter of wanting to have something as good as the other man, because they would never discard this building if the Government were not to be called upon to pay for the erection of a new one. No white farmer would think of abandoning a building of this kind, and I do not think the Department is called upon to spend money to replace buildings that are still serviceable. I certainly cannot recommend a new building, in view of the information I have before me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nDecember 27th 1927\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant,\nNo. 126-9-5.\n\nThe boys recreation room is 30 ft. by 40 ft.,\nsurface measurement and it will require 1600 feet,\nof flooring to cover this room, allowing for tongue\nand groove estimated one third more. The best price\nI can get on this flooring is $128.75 per thousand.\n\nThe Rev. Pathe also asks for the enclosed\nlist of material (hardware).\n\nKindly advise in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 4, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the quantity of flooring required for the boys' recreation room at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of 1600' of maple flooring, and the quantity of lumber required for the making of a cupboard in the sewing room. The price at which you can obtain the maple flooring has been noted. Please arrange for the purchase and delivery of this material at an early date, and forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nThe list of hardware which the Principal requests be supplied was also received. It is considered that these supplies should be purchased by the school authorities from their per capita grant or other receipts, and we are, therefore, not prepared to supply same. The list which you forwarded is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA.

Voucher No 4604 was paid at $118.95 and Voucher No 4605 at $120.30, not $119.30 as made out, the correct amount of Mr Olson's account of the 3rd September being $120.30.\n\nAs the cheque is outstanding the Department is prepared to consider the question of the issue of a duplicate. I enclose herewith a blank form of indemnity, and also another form. The Department leaves to you to decide which form should be filled out by Mr Olson. As a rule the small form is used when the cheque lost is small, and a surety to the bond is not required. Possibly it may be advisable to have the bond of indemnity executed by Mr Olson and two sureties.\n\nThe form signed, etc., by Mr Olson should be forwarded to the Department at an early date, and a cheque can issue if the action taken is found to be satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H.

Paget\nChief Accountant.\n\nThe Accountant,\nBank of Montreal,\nOttawa.\nSANDY BAY BOARDING SCHOOL\n\nAs I have reported on this school several times it will not be necessary for me to say much in this lengthy report, as things are about the same. Everything was in good order, both inside and out. The crop was looking well and the garden was in excellent shape. I believe that as far as the work in the school is concerned it is carried on satisfactorily, and Father Chagnon is always willing to co-operate with the Department, but one thing is plain, and that is that as far as the Indians are concerned on the reserve the influence of the school is not noticeable. The school may not be so much at fault in this regard, of course, as conditions in the past have been so bad on the reserve that in all probability it would not matter how good the influence of the school was, the bad influence on the reserve would predominate, and the children coming out from the school simply fall in with the rest of the gang as soon as they are turned loose.\n\nI do not wish to be unfair to the Principal, as he has always endeavored to co-operate with us; at the same time, he is not the same type as the Principal at Pine Creek, and does not command the same respect from the Indians.\n\nAs regards the fire protection at this institution, I might say that the fire hose are absolutely rotten, and I have asked that the school be supplied with four new ones. They have sufficient fire extinguishers, but the hose must be replaced. There is a similar arrangement here as at Pine Creek, a door opens from the dormitories out on to a platform, which has a sliding pole leading to the ground. Fire drill is held once a week, and when the hose are renewed I think that every precaution will have been taken to protect this school against fire.\nRegina, Sask., July 31st, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Manitowah Agency, which shows that the work is being carried on satisfactorily. There are several matters, however, that require the attention of the Department.\n\nThe fire hose at the Sandy Bay school should be replaced.\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nFollowing a recent inspection of the schools in the Manitowah Agency, Inspector Christianson reports the following requirements, and I beg to recommend same,-\n\nShoal River School,-\n\nAbout 1000 ft. of flooring\n3 rolls tar paper\nNails\nTeacher's desk and chair\n3 Gals. white paint\n1 Brush\n\nThis paint is for the re-decorating of the ceiling and woodwork in the school.\nZinc gurads for stove.\n\nSandy Bay Residential School,-\n\n250 ft.

Attwood.\n\nRe - Construction of Cesspool at Sandy Bay Indian School.\n\nFollowing the submittal of Mr. Craig's report dated September 26, 1927, on the sewage disposal system of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, the Department of Indian Affairs decided to have certain alterations and repairs made and a cesspool constructed as recommended by Mr. Craig. The alterations and repairs were completed last fall and the cesspool was constructed during August under the supervision of the undersigned.\n\nArrangements were made with Mr. P. H. Hancock, building contractor, of Portage la Prairie, to construct the cesspool on the basis of cost plus a sum of Fifty Dollars. Wages were paid and materials purchased by this office. The work was started on August 21st and completed on the 25th.\n\nThe cesspool, which is a frame structure built of 3\" lumber, is located on the discharge pipe from the septic tank. The overall dimensions of the cesspool are 10' x 25' x 7' high. It is constructed below the ground level and is provided with a manhole. The roof is painted with a coat of coal tar and covered with a foot of earth. The details of the framing of the structure are shown on the attached blue print.\n\nThe cost of constructing the cesspool was Four Hundred and Seventy-one and 63/100 Dollars which was disturbed as follows:\n\nDistribution of Construction Costs.\n\n| Account                        | Expenditure |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|\n| GENERAL                       |             |\n| Travelling expenses, Engineer.| 12.40       |\n| Contractor's bonus            | 50.00       |\n|                               | 62.40       |\n| MATERIAL AND LABOR            |             |\n| Lumber                        | 145.38      |\n| Spikes                        | 3.00        |\n| Manhole Cover                 | 16.20       |\n| Tar                           | 3.10        |\n| Wages                         | 190.25      |\n|                               | 357.93      |\n| Carried forward               | $420.33     |\n\nIndian Affairs.

All the work was performed in a workmanlike and satisfactory manner.\n\nE.B. Patterson\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIn further reference to your letter of June 2 authorizing the carrying out of certain improvements to the sewage system at the Sandy Bay Indian school in Manitoba, I enclose herewith a report from Mr. E.B. Patterson, the engineer who superintended the work, describing the construction of the repairs which have been carried out.\n\nThe total cost as shown by the accounts which are enclosed herewith in duplicate amounts to $471.63, while the estimated cost was in the vicinity of $760. The difference is due mainly to the elimination of the creosoted lumber and to dispensing with the concrete floor for the cesspool. The reason for not using creosoted lumber was because the creosoting had to be done at Calgary and no lumber company would give delivery except upon a date two months after receipt of order, which would have made the completion of the job impossible this year. The district engineer reports that the nature of the soil did not require the placing of a concrete floor.\n\nDue to the reduced cost of construction there is a credit balance of $288.37 in the Bank of Montreal at Winnipeg and I shall be glad to know whether to refund this money to the Department of Indian Affairs or allow it to remain until the end of the fiscal year in case additional expenditures are required for other Indian schools in the Winnipeg district.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Department is in doubt concerning the amount that should be expended on the old building in view of this request for the re-establishment of the school elsewhere. I should be glad to have a recommendation from your office concerning the location of a good farm either on or contiguous to the reserve. At a later date, we could ask the Dominion Water Power Branch to investigate the questions of water supply and sewage disposal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, September 10th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Church authorities have requested a few repairs to the plumbing at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. Will you please ask Alfred Babb, plumber of Portage la Prairie, to proceed to the school and let you have a report showing the cost of effecting whatever improvements are really necessary at this time? When this report is received, with estimate of the cost, please forward to Ottawa and you will be authorized to have Mr. Babb undertake whatever can be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. J. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nOttawa, September 26, 1929.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your requests for the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School and to recent conversation with the Rev. Father Proude, I have now to inform you that Mr. Commissioner Graham is of the opinion that we should seriously consider a new locality altogether, if the school is to be rebuilt. He believes that the farm land in the immediate vicinity of the school is unsuitable for the satisfactory conduct of one of our institutions, and he recommends that, when the Department contemplates a new school, a site somewhat distant from the reserve be selected.\n\nThe Department has already requested the Indian Agent to have a plumber proceed to the school and submit a report as to the cost of effecting whatever improvements are really necessary at this time. I am also asking the Dominion Water Power Branch to make a report on the water supply and sewage disposal systems. Concerning the outbuildings requested, I may say that a note has been taken for future estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVery Rev. J. Magan, O. M.

Waite,\nCity.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nActing under your instructions to examine the plumbing at the Indian School at Sandy Bay. We made the trip up to Sandy Bay and made an inspection of the plumbing in the building.\n\nOn examination we find that the pipes were very badly corroded, some of the pipes being practically filled. This is caused from the nature of the water, and it would be quite impossible to give you a definite figure for repairing same. In our opinion the only way that this job could be done satisfactorily would be to do it on a percentage basis, charging you for what new material was required and time. Even if you had an Architect or a Plumbing Engineer examine same he could not give you any more information as it is quite impossible to find out just what condition these pipes are in until same are taken down, and where the pipes are very badly corroded it would be much cheaper to put in new pipes than attempt to clean the old ones.\n\nIf you give us instructions to go ahead with this job we will ship the material that we think is necessary to Sandy Bay and will use all old material that we find suitable, replacing the ones that are badly corroded with new pipes. Regarding the time it would take, I presume that it would take in the neighbourhood of four weeks for two men.\n\nIt will be necessary to replace one or two of the closet bowls as we find these are cracked.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions. We remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They tore down some of the plumbing to see what condition it was in, and we are very glad to report to you that the condition is not quite as serious as our first inspection indicated. We are now in a position to quote you a price of what we can do the repairing for.\n\nWe find that the nickel-plated waste pipe will have to be renewed; also there are 33 self-closing basin taps; one high closet tank; two closet bowls, and one closet seat. This price will also include approximately 80 feet of soil pipe, with soil pipe fittings and other fittings necessary to complete the job; also cleaning all pipes in the boys dormitory.\n\nThe price we are prepared to do this work for is Seven Hundred and Eighty Six Dollars (786.00). This price, of course, includes all trips that we have already made there.\n\nIf you decide to go on with this work, give us your instructions at the earliest possible moment, as we will have to arrange to get the material on the grounds and also some additional help.\n\nThanking you for the opportunity of figuring, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned ALFRED BABBI.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nOctober 14th, 1929\n\nI beg to attach hereto a letter received from Mr. Alfred Smith, Hardware Merchant, Portage la Prairie, in regard to the repairs to the plumbing system, Sandy Bay Residential School.

Principal can arrange to have the stairs built without any cost to the Department for labour.\n\nI have also learned that three hand washing machines with wringers are needed at the Sandy Bay School.

I wish to learn if well drillers at Portage or elsewhere have had any success in the Sandy Bay area. The Department is considering an Artesian or deep well. Please report at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. J. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nconsidering, as there is a marsh of about one mile in extent between the lake and the school, and the lake is very shallow for a considerable distance, and freezes to the bottom in the winter time. The actual cost of drilling a well would be $1.50 per foot for the first 120 feet, and $2.00 per foot up to 250 feet, the casing would be extra. I was not able to obtain a price on the work of piping water into the school from a well on the little ridge, which is on the Sandy Bay Reserve. An engineer would have to survey the line etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir;-\n\nRe. 126-9-5, Ottawa, May 5th, 1930\n\nI beg to advise you that I have this date interviewed Mr Wm. Smith of Amaranth with reference to wells drilled in the vicinity of the Sandy Bay Residential School. Mr Smith has drilled in this district for the past 20 years. He informs me that in the Maygrove district which is 2 miles north and 7 miles west of the school, alkali water was struck at a depth of 60 to 70 feet, and after a depth of 130 feet, first class water was obtained. The greatest depth he has drilled on the reserve is 127 feet at the School, and this water was not good. I asked him if he thought it would be possible to obtain good water if a well was drilled to a greater depth. Mr Smith claims that the water in the well at the school and at the Home Farm was obtained in a layer of blue sand on the top of limestone, and that by drilling into the limestone further supplies of water would be obtained and in all probability this supply of water would be good. He admitted that the whole thing would be a gamble, although the district is similar to that at Maygrove.\n\nPersonally I am of the opinion that good water could be obtained if a deep well was sunk, as the layer of Gypsum is about 60 feet deep and the salt water appears to come from the Gypsum deposit, the well would have to be cemented at the places the salt water entered the hole. There is good water in abundance about 2 miles from the school, about 12 feet from the surface, and I would judge that the land at this point is at least 50 feet higher than the level of the school. I do not consider if would be a difficult proposition to pipe the water into the school from a well drilled at the place mentioned. The other alternative is from Lake Manitoba, which I do not think worth\nOttawa, May 22, 1930.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nPursuant to official letter of the 5th instant, concerning a deep well at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, I have now to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Waite has interviewed Mr. Wm. Smith, of Amaranth, a well driller of 20 years' experience. It is reported that, 2 miles north and 7 miles west of the school, alkali water was struck at a depth of 60 to 70 feet and, at 130 feet, fresh clean water was obtained. The deepest well in the reserve is only 127 feet at the school itself, and the water is not good. Mr. Smith claims that the water in this well is obtained in a layer of blue sand on top of limestone and that, by drilling into the limestone, further supplies of water would be obtained and, in all probability, good water. He admitted that the whole thing would be a gamble, although the district is situated in Manitoba, where they had good luck in deeper wells. Mr. Waite is satisfied that good water can be obtained if a deep well is sunk, as the layer of gypsum from which the salt water comes is 60 feet deep. A deep well would have to be cemented at the joints in the gypsum deposit.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of this letter for you to send to Father Chagnon. If you and he can recommend that a deep well be tried, the Department will favourably consider the expenditure; but no action will be taken until I hear from you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S.

He has answered that a supply of good water is a most pressing need for the School.

School, and I believe it is my duty to inform the Department of Indian Affairs that the boiler in the Laundry Room and the chimney are in a very poor condition and should be repaired before the reopening of the School. Two years ago, the pressure of the Boiler has been reduced from 40 to 20 pounds, but even so it was still dangerous and the inspector has recommended to Rev. Fr Principal not to use it for more than two or three years. The chimney is also in a very dangerous condition and a new one should be built this summer.\n\nKindly send your Agent or someone else to inspect the School and report to the Department on this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. J. Magnus O.M.I.\nProvincial.\n\nMr. A.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secy.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 11, 1930.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of recent date relative to the condition of the boiler and chimney in the laundry at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to inform you that we are instructing Mr. Agent Waite, Portage la Prairie, Man., to send a competent man to visit the school and furnish a report stating what he would recommend be done in overcoming the present conditions as regarding the boiler and chimney. When we have this report, favourable consideration will be given to authorizing the carrying out of the recommendation made by the man who makes the inspection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVery Rev. J. Magnan, O.M.I.,\n340 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\nOttawa, July 11, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is informed that the boiler in the laundry room and the chimney at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School are in a dangerous condition and require immediate attention. I have, therefore, to request that you will arrange to have a responsible man visit the school and inspect this boiler and chimney and furnish a report as to what he would suggest be done. He should furnish full details, together with an estimate of the cost. When you have his report, you should forward same for the consideration of the Department. Please give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. J. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nSir:\n\nRe 126-9-5, Ottawa, June 16th 1930.\n\nI have the honour to advise you that Mr Smith, Well driller, Amaranth has commenced operations on the well at the Sandy Bay Residential School. The accounts for the well casing are forwarded under separate cover. Mr Smith advised me that he omitted to charge for board under his contract. I have taken this matter up with the Reverend Father and he has agreed to board Mr Smith for two weeks free of cost. The cost to the Department after this time will be .75 per day. Mr Smith expects to have the well completed within a month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nCity.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nActing on your instructions, Mr. Grassie and myself made a trip to the Indian School at Sandy Bay, and made an inspection of the chimney and the boiler and the hot water tank.\n\nOn examining the chimney we found that the top of the chimney down as far as we could see from the top of the roof, would require to be renewed. In conversation with one of the priests there, we found that his report was that in some of the rooms the smoke would come out through the walls of the chimney into the room. In our opinion, for the safety of the building and the occupants, this chimney should be re-built.\n\nRegarding the boiler, we find that the brick work on the outside is cracked in places, and it would be necessary to repair same. Also the fire box of the furnace or boiler would require new fire brick.\n\nRe the Hot Water Tank. On examination we find that there would have to be at least a new end put on same. This would have to be taken down and shipped into Winnipeg in order to do this. What would be more satisfactory, however, would possibly be to buy a new tank, and instead of the coils being ordinary galvanized pipe on the inside, as they are now, brass coils would be very much better, and would give longer service, on account of the conditions of the water at this particular point.\n\nAnother thing we noticed when we were on the roof was that the shingles in some places were entirely off and would need immediate attention. We were not asked to inspect the roof, but we are making this notation.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions, we remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 3)\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nJuly 28th 1930\n\nNo. 40.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, No. 126-9-5, re-Laundry room and chimney at the Sandy Bay Residential School. I beg to enclose herewith report received from Mr. Alfred Babb, of Portage la Prairie who made an inspection in connection with this matter on my request.\n\nI would say that on receipt of your letter I asked Mr. Babb if he would proceed to the school and give me a report and an estimate of the cost of the work required. On the 19th instant Mr. Babb advising that he had been out there and made an inspection which was not satisfactory has he did not give an estimate of what it would cost, so he made a second trip with Mr. Woodman a bricklayer and then made another inspection, find letter of the 19th instant also attached.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Waite\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 1, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 40 of the 28th ultimo, with enclosures, concerning improvements at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. You may replace the hot water boiler in the laundry, at an estimated cost of $274. It is understood that this price includes a set of expansion tank mountings for the other boiler.\n\nYou may also repair the chimney at this school. The proposal to take down the lower part of the ventilator and renew the chimney and to rebuild 15 ft. of the top of the chimney is approved. You should insist that when rebuilding at the boiler end fire brick be used. I note that the brick work on the boiler will also have to be repaired and the arches of the boiler rebuilt with new fire brick. All this may be undertaken, at an approximate cost of $347.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Aest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. J. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 3)\nSir;-\n\nI have the honour to advise you that the following repairs and material are very necessary at the Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nFour hose valves, eight hose connections.\n\nTwo closet bowls will have to be taken down and cleaned, repaired and reset.\n\nThe stove of the agricultural boiler is burnt out and a new one is required, the old stove was made by a firm named Smart?. I have made inquiries, and am informed that this firm has gone out of business. The approximate cost of these repairs etc., will be in the neighborhood of $150.00. I am also informed that the shingles on the roof have been blown off in one or two places and should be repaired and that the whole roof of the new addition will have to be shingled in the course of another year or so. Will you please advise in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 9, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the repairs and materials required at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange to supply 4 hose valves and 8 hose connections of the dimensions and type required. You may also arrange to have the two closet bowls taken down cleaned, repaired and reset. It is noted that the stove of the agricultural boiler is burnt out and unfit for further use. The Department will approve of the purchase of a stove of a type suitable for the purpose for which it is required, and no unnecessary expense should be incurred.\n\nIt is also noted that the shingles on the roof require to be repaired in one or two places. It is considered that the school authorities should be able to carry out these repairs. If any new shingles are required, you may arrange to supply same. I may say that it is also thought that the school authorities could attend to the repairing and resetting of the closet bowls.\n\nAfter the above purchases have been made, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nI respectfully beg to advise you that in the drilling of the well on the Indian Reserve, Sandy Bay, Amaranth I have encountered serious and unforeseen difficulties.\n\nAt 52 ft I tapped a vein of salty water, at 122 ft another of similar quality, and at 127 ft I struck quicksand. Below this there is a stratum of limestone rock with excellent water, but of insufficient supply. From this depth onward I had intense trouble to cope with the invasion of quicksand and salty water. To prevent or check the invasion I had to resort to the use of cement, which is the principle in cases of this kind, but all to no purpose.\n\nFinally, owing to the invasion of this quicksand my well caved and in my\nEfforts to release the same I took my new cable, thereby losing my complete set of tools, and consequently am now unable to proceed further with the well.\n\nI feel satisfied that had I been able to sink lower I would have met with water of excellent quality.\n\nThe Rev. Father Chagnon, Principal, is extremely anxious that I remain here and make yet another attempt to get water, but without tools I am unable to accomplish anything and being but a poor man cannot bear the expense of a new set as I have lost heavily in this untoward happening.\n\nIt is through no fault of mine, nor any negligence that the tools were lost and I humbly suggest that the Indian Department provide me with the tools to replace the lost ones, to enable me to proceed with the work, and that the Department bear the cost of such equipment.\n\nI am hopeful of being able to remove the large casing as I have already raised it a matter of three feet.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter your immediate attention, I remain\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nWm. A. Smith\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter I have received from Mr. W.A. Smith of Amaranth, who is drilling a well at the Sandy Bay Residential School. The well is down 134 feet and the following tools are lost: one 4\u00bd inch bit, set of jars and sinking bar also 50 feet of cable; the total cost of these tools would be approximately $150.00. During my recent visit to the reserve, I inspected the well; at that time Mr. Smith was having considerable trouble with quicksand, which he hoped to eventually overcome. There was a very heavy flow of water which was of a salty nature; he informed me that he had struck very good water in limestone at about 100 feet but not in sufficient quantity; he hoped for a good flow as soon as he got through the quicksand. The hole at present drilled will be useless as apparently it is impossible to get the tools out, and the water is not satisfactory. Mr. Smith asked me regarding the presenting of his account for the hole drilled which is 134 feet; the cost of same will be approximate $225.00 less the $100.00 advanced. Will you please advise in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOctober 15, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE THOMAS G. MURPHY,\n\nWith reference to the attached letter from Mr. W. H. Smith, of Amaranth, Man., I have to state that the Department received a report from Mr. Indian Agent Waite, of Portage la Prairie. Mr. Smith was engaged to drill a well at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. The well was down 134 feet when he lost his tools. The Department is arranging to pay him for drilling the well and will supply him with a new set of tools at a cost of approximately $150. This, I am sure, will be satisfactory to him.\n\nMr. Smith is the only well driller in the vicinity and it is proposed to ask him to try again at the school, as the present water supply is most unsatisfactory.\n\nDuncan C.

Will you please advise regarding the tenders inclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 21, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing the quotations which you received for the supplying of hose valves and connections for the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you should place the order with the firm quoting the lowest price. The quotations which you received are returned herewith. After these supplies have been delivered, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost, to which should be attached the enclosed quotations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

MURPHY,\n\nWith reference to the attached letter from Mr. W. H. Smith, of Amaranth, Man., I have to state that the Department received a report from Mr. Indian Agent Waite, of Portage la Prairie. Mr. Smith was engaged to drill a well at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. The well was down 134 feet when he lost his tools. The Department is arranging to pay him for drilling the well and will supply him with a new set of tools at a cost of approximately $150. This, I am sure, will be satisfactory to him.\n\nMr. Smith is the only well driller in the vicinity and it is proposed to ask him to try again at the school, as the present water supply is most unsatisfactory.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nSir:\n\nI beg to inclose herewith a further tender received from Messrs Cadham Hardware, Portage la Prairie, on the hose connection and valves for the Sandy Bay Residential School. Mr Cadham recommends the valves etc., at a cost of $100.00, these he claims would give greater satisfaction and would last for 25 to 30 years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPurchased in connection with the deep well drilling at the Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nLetter No. 126-9-5 June 16th, 1930\n\nVoucher No. A.514\n\nIndian Affairs.

The water is a little salty, but the Reverend Principal is quite satisfied with the quality, which is vastly superior to any in the vicinity of the school. I have forwarded a sample to the Bacterial Department, Department of Public Welfare for testing purposes and will forward the result of the test as soon as I am in receipt of same. I have also instructed the driller to pump the well with a power pump until the 8th of December; this will clear the water and prove an ample supply. I request permission to go ahead with the work of piping the water from the well to the school, providing a sufficient flow of water is on hand, of which I have very little doubt. I beg to suggest that a new wind-mill be purchased together with the tower, the old mill is practically worn out, the legs are set in cement, which would make the moving a big job and the mill is not worth it. The mill would be very useful in pumping water to the hog pastures. It would also be very useful in case of fire. Approximate 200 feet of 2\" pipe will be required, together with cement and lumber, and the labour of digging a trench to a depth below frost line, also the labour of erecting the wind-mill etc., laying and connecting the pipe line. The estimates given are approximate. I have asked Mr Smith for an estimate covering the cost of all labour less materials. I will ask two plumbers in the City here for estimates as soon as authority is granted to go ahead with the work.\n\nOne 3' Vaneless mill complete with 40' tower and braces, legs etc. $150.00\n200 feet of galvanized pipe @ .25 50.00\nLumber & cement for cribbing and pipe line 75.00\nLabour, digging trench 6' deep and erection of mill etc. 200.00\n\nThe Best Deputy Secretary,\n\nIndian Affairs.
