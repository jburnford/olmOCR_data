McLean  \nDepartment of Indian affairs  \nOttawa Can.,\n\nDear sir,-\n\nUpon coming to Golden Lake today I found that the teacher Miss Schroeder had moved into the new school yesterday, on inquiry I found that the contractors had left the school on charge of the painter, who, told the teacher that the school was ready, and not knowing any better she moved all the old desks et cetra into the new school and began teaching, as the school is almost ready with the exception of the furnace, blackboards, blinds and some painting I decided to leave her in it, I told her however to keep the children in order, so as, not to soil the wall and floor, too much, at least until the school was taken off the contractors hands.\n\nUpon speaking to the contractors about it today they felt very much annoyed at my leaving her in, but, under the circumstances I thought that was the best thing to do.\n\nTrusting that this is to the satisfaction of the department.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6133, File 394-5, part 1)\nOttawa, September 9, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that there was any misunderstanding with reference to the occupation of the Golden Lake School by Miss Schruder. However, no doubt she will take good care of it and the Department will take over the building from the contractors upon your recommendation as soon as you make your final report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

McLean\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear sir,\n\nReplying to your letter # 152205/05 pf September 3/12 I must say that I again have been at the contractors and told them that they should have allowed something for the erection of those closets, but they again claimed that they did not allow anything for them as they had no specifications or plans to figure from, they admit that they have made a mistake by not figuring on those closets but as the closets are now up they are willing to take what the department will allow them.\n\nThe school as I mentioned in my letter of the 4th inst is just about completed, the only delay now is the blackboards, the furnace and the blinds, they have them ordered and the furnace is in the basement, but the registers went astray in transit. They expect to have it all completed in about a week or ten days.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory to you\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.G.R./G.\nOttawa September 13, 1912.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr Bedley,\n\nI would recommend an additional payment of $25.00 to the Contractor for the Golden Lake School House for the construction of two closets as per plans submitted by the Department which were more elaborate than those figured on by the contractors.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Schroeder told me today that she would require some school desks, said she would like to get at least six single #5 desks for primary. If you wish I can get those out in at $3.50 each.\n\nShe also complained that there was no place for the teacher to keep her clothes separate from the pupils and consequently I gave an order to the contractors to put a partition in the stationery cupboard and put hat and coat hooks in one part and shelves in the other, allowing them the sum of $4.75.\n\nTrusting that this will be to the satisfaction of the department.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.G.R/G.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6133, File 394-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nRe Golden Lake Day School.\n\nWhen the above mentioned school was completed some eight or ten years ago a McClary's hot air coal furnace was installed to heat it. A car-load of coal was purchased after the school was opened and when this supply was exhausted, it was found more economical to heat the school with hardwood, therefore, purchases for this wood were made locally for the past six or eight years. This system of heating has not proven very satisfactory at any time, inasmuch as it is unhealthy for the teacher and the pupils for the following reasons:- In the first place the furnace is so constructed as to burn hard coal only, and since the burning of hardwood blocks creates smoke and odor, the main draft was found to be too small to carry off the fumes sufficiently enough and the result is that the surplus smoke is forced up through the hot air pipes into the class-room which makes conditions there rather abominable throughout the winter months. I would strongly advocate the installation of a wood-furnace in place of the old one, because wood is plentiful on the reserve and is the cheapest in the long run. During my visit to Golden Lake some time ago, I made enquiries as to the probable cost of such a furnace. Messrs. Fluery Bros., of Eganville quoted a price of $175.00, subject to change, for its complete installation. There are, of course, other firms in neighbouring towns who would quote should it be found necessary to call for tenders. This firm (Fluery Bros,) by whom the present furnace was installed do not seem to care about making any allowance for this on a new one, for the reason that it requires to be entirely rebuilt before it can be used again for coal.\nThere is no woodshed in connection with this school and same would be necessary in order to store the required supply of wood. This could be erected on the school grounds at an approximate cost of about $40.00 as the lumber can be purchased at Golden Lake.\n\nIt is customary to have the wood cut early in the summer in order that it may be fairly dry for use in the winter, and this will have to be withheld pending the decision of the Department in the matter of re-installation, as a wood furnace will require a different length of a stick to that used in the coal furnace.\n\nTrusting this matter will receive favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRecords Branch.\nOttawa, March 24, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. P. J. Bernard of this Department has reported that the furnace in the Golden Lake Indian Day School is no longer giving satisfaction. It was installed some 8 or 10 years ago and was used for coal, but for the past few years wood has been the fuel. It is reported that Fluery Brothers, of Eganville, have stated to repair it would cost as much as a new wood furnace and they are willing to install a suitable wood furnace for $135.\n\nPlease report whether the furnace which this firm will install for $135 is suitable for the purpose and inform me if it would be possible to secure competitive prices.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

J. Hugle for supplies to Indian day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nP. Rankin\nIndian agent\nRuby\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nIn reply to letter of March 24, 1924, re furnace at School. I may say the furnace is in poor condition and not giving good satisfaction. Flury Bros. of Eganville will place a wood furnace in School for $140 or guaranteed to give satisfaction. If this is satisfactory I will have Flury Bros. order the furnace & have it placed in School before the opening.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nP. Rankin\nIndian agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nManitoba\n\nJuly 18, 1924\nOttawa, July 24, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, furnishing a price at which you can have a wood burning furnace installed in the Golden Lake Indian Day School building. In reply I have to say that you have not stated whether you have obtained prices from any other firm than the one mentioned by you. It is considered that there are a number of firms in Eganville, Pembroke and Renfrew, from whom you could obtain prices for a wood burning furnace of the size and type which would be satisfactory to properly heat this building. It is necessary that competitive prices be obtained from a number of firms, unless you are satisfied that Fluery Brothers of Eganville are the only firm who can supply and install a satisfactory furnace. You should obtain prices as soon as possible and inform the Department of the quotations received.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear from you in the course of the next ten days, giving full information as to the prices you have obtained from the various firms handling and installing furnaces. The firms whom you ask to quote should state the type and size of the furnace they will supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nP. Rankins, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRuby, Ont.\nOttawa, August 22, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Bernard, of this Department, has reported that Fluery Brothers, of Eganville, is the only firm that can give satisfaction in connection with the installation of a wood burning furnace in the Golden Lake Indian Day School. You are authorized to have Fluery Brothers place a suitable furnace in the school. I have noted that $140 will be the cost in this connection. Please have this attended to immediately and also arrange for a supply of wood for the new furnace, without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nP. Rankins, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRuby, Ont.\nOttawa, September 8th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to draw your attention to official letters of July 24th and August 22nd, last, regarding the installation of a wood burning furnace to replace the present furnace in the Golden Lake Indian Day School. We are informed that this work has not yet been completed. The Department cannot understand why you have not arranged with Fleurie Bros., of Eganville, to install the furnace as instructed. Please be good enough to take immediate steps to have the work completed as soon as possible. In order that there will be no interruption in the classroom work, you should arrange with Fleurie Bros. to do the work on a Saturday. We understand that they can make the change and put in the new furnace in one day. As stated in previous letters, the cost of the furnace and the installation is not to exceed the sum of $140, the amount which Fleurie Bros. quoted for this work. The work should be completed in a satisfactory manner, and properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded by you in favour of Fleurie Bros. covering the cost. It is hoped that it will not again be necessary to repeat these instructions. The Department expects you to give prompt attention in future to school requirements on the Golden Lake Reserve.\n\nI shall be pleased to be informed of the date on which the work of installing the new furnace will be completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. Rankins, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRuby, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th inst. #11-1-5, on the subject of the installation of a furnace in the Golden Lake Day School, I have to inform you that your instructions contained in your letter of August 22/24 were immediately carried out. On August 25/24 I instructed Fleming Bros. to have this work completed at as early a date as possible. As the Fleming Bros do not carry these furnaces in stock it was necessary to order from the factory which takes time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nPatrick Rankin\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6133, File 394-5, part 2)\nOttawa, September 15, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, informing the Department that you had instructed Fleurie Bros. to install a new furnace in the Golden Lake Indian Day School, but that it was necessary for them to order the same from the factory. You have not stated when they expect to have this furnace delivered and the work of installation completed. It is hoped that there will be no further delay, and you will be good enough to see Fleurie Bros. and request them to complete this work at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. Rankins, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRuby, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of Sept 15/24 # 11-1-5 re furnace.

There is at present 17 desks and we require twenty-four more. This will leave us throwing out some old double desks. Trusting that this matter will be attended to as soon as possible.\n\nYours Truly,\nMatt Bernard\nOttawa, Sept. 30, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the new desks required for the use of the Golden Lake Indian Day School. Before placing the order for the 24 single desks required, I shall be pleased to have further information as to the sizes. Desks are manufactured in the following sizes and suitable for children of the ages given, as follows:\n\n| No. | Pupils Ages |\n|-----|-------------|\n| 2   | 15 to 18    |\n| 3   | 12 \" 14 \"   |\n| 4   | 10 \" 12 \"   |\n| 5   | 7 \" 9 \"     |\n| 6   | 5 \" 7 \"     |\n\nPlease consult the teacher and ascertain from her the number of desks of each of the above sizes required.

Canadian History\n- Dictionary\n- 2 dozen erasers\n- 6 doz. smooth paper Exercise books\n- 6 doz. rough paper (lined) Exercise books\n\nIn connection with the serving of a hot dish in the school please give me information regarding what kind of food may be purchased and to what extent this purchase may amount to, for the year.\n\nIt will be necessary to purchase cups as there are\nonly about one dozen fit for use at present. Something will also have to be supplied as the old issue is completely exhausted. May these be bought under the Govt bill at Mr. Hugh's Golden Lake, as necessary school supplies?\n\nRegarding the Christmas closing is it customary for the Government to make an allowance towards supplying each child with a gift? If so please quote the amount allowed. There are now forty pupils on the roll.\n\nOn account of being new at this system of management I did not want to take any steps which were not sanctioned by the Department; hence the series of questions.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\nAileen L. Costello\nOttawa, Nov. 19, 1924.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, and in reply beg to inform you that a requisition is being forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to send to your address the classroom supplies asked for.\n\nWith reference to the furnishing of a hot drink to the pupils at midday, I beg to say that you may purchase a small quantity of tea and sugar. You should obtain an account, in duplicate, from the merchant from whom you make the purchase, which you should hand to Mr. Agent Rankin to certify and send to the Department for payment. Only the quantity of tea and sugar absolutely required to carry on until the end of the year should be purchased. You may also purchase a number of granite ware cups and 6 yards of towelling. The Department is not prepared to authorize any large expenditure in providing a lunch to the pupils at midday.\n\nThe Department will also allow an amount not exceeding $10 for the purchase of prizes or gifts to be given to the pupils before the school closes for the Christmas holidays. If you make the purchase of these articles, you should obtain an account, in duplicate, from the merchant from whom you obtain the same, and you should also hand this account to the Agent.\n\nIn future all requests for expenditures should be forwarded by you through the office of the local Indian Agent, Mr. Rankin. We are informing him of the authority given you to purchase a small quantity of tea and sugar and the cups, towelling and gifts for the pupils at Christmas, not exceeding the above amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

She is also being authorized to purchase a number of granite cups and 6 yards of towelling, and to expend an amount not exceeding $10 in the purchase of gifts or prizes to be given to the children before Christmas.\n\nThe teacher has been requested to obtain accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost of any purchases made and to hand these accounts to you.

In addition, the closets are filled to the seats and need immediate attention.\nOttawa, November 27th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, who recently visited the Golden Lake Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the condition of the water closets. He states that the closets are filled and need immediate attention.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will arrange to have these closets thoroughly cleaned out and put in a good sanitary condition.

Last year the sum of $10 was allowed for the purchase of supplies for this purpose. Dr. Stone, Director of Medical Services, who visited this school last spring, recommended that the serving of this midday lunch be continued and that the grant for the purpose be increased.\n\nThe Department will allow, during the coming winter months or until the end of April, next, an amount not exceeding the sum of $25 in the purchase of these supplies. You should take this matter up with the teacher at once, and arrange with her to see that the midday lunch is furnished the pupils. If any equipment is required, you may arrange for the purchase of same, obtaining an account, in duplicate, which you should certify in the usual manner and send to the Department. You may also arrange for the purchase of the food supplies used in the serving of the meal. The total expense, however, is not to exceed the sum of $25, and you should furnish accounts covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you at the earliest possible date regarding the arrangements you have made for the preparation and serving of the midday meal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6133, File 394-5, part 2)\nMarch 17th, 1930.\n\nI visited the Golden Lake Indian Day school on the 13th instant. 23 pupils out of a roll of 37 were present. There are a few cases of chicken pox among them at the present time. Attendance is irregular.\n\nThe school property is in good condition on the whole, a few minor repairs are required. Miss Currier is giving satisfactory service and the pupils are making progress.\n\nThe teacher is anxious to continue the hot lunch until the Easter holidays; it has been of very great help to the pupils and I would recommend that the teacher be authorized to continue it until the week of Easter.\n\nApparently the janitor and truant office - Mat Barnard - is not fulfilling the duties in a satisfactory manner. The teacher was not aware that such a person as a truant officer existed. I understand he has not asked for or been given the names of truants or absentees at any time. The class room has not been scrubbed recently, the teacher informs me that the pupils sweep and dust the class room every afternoon when school is over, this work should be done by the janitor.\n\nThe closets are completely filled and should be cleaned right away and kept properly cleaned out at all times.\n\nThe pump is out of order and unfit for use. It should be cleaned out, a new pump installed and a cement...\ntop pot on, the water for school purposes has to be taken from the lake at present, this is both dangerous for the pupils and inconvenient. This work should receive early attention.\n\nFour of the window blinds in the classroom and two in the entrance hall are very dilapidated and should be replaced by new ones.\n\nA few new posts should replace broken ones and the wire needs to be stretched and stapled and the present posts on the school fence need to be cut to uniform height.\n\nThe closets need some attention, the seat covers are off the boys closet, the latches of both closets are broken as are also the two front steps. There are no screens in front of the closets. These could be erected at very little cost and I would recommend that the agent be instructed to have screens put up as soon as weather conditions permit.\n\nThe school grounds are very rough and untidy, this condition could be much improved if the grounds were levelled a bit and some large stones removed, the brush around the fences cut and a small plot plowed for a flower garden at the front of the building.\n\nA supply of truant officer forms Nos. 139 and 140, also Monthly school report forms No. 19, should be sent to agent Rankins.\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, March 19, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, who recently visited the Golden Lake Indian Day School, has drawn the attention of the Department to the need of various repairs, etc., at this school. He states that the closets should be cleaned out and placed in a good, sanitary condition. The seat covers are off the boys' closet and the latches on both are broken, also the two front steps. The Inspector recommends that screens be placed in front of the closets. He states that these could be erected at very little cost. You should therefore arrange, as soon as weather conditions permit, to have the necessary repairs carried out, viz.: repair the seats, have new latches installed on the doors, the front steps repaired, screens erected and the closets cleaned. The Department will expect you to see that this work is satisfactorily completed and that all costs for the purpose are kept as low as possible.\n\nThe Inspector states that the pump is out of order. I have to request you to have the well cleaned out, a new pump installed and a cement top put on. This work should be done as soon as weather conditions permit. The Department will also expect you to see that a satisfactory job is completed in placing the pump in good condition and as inexpensively as possible.\n\nYou should arrange for the purchase and installation of four window blinds of the size required for the classroom and two blinds in the entrance hall.\n\nRegarding the fence around the school\n\nP.

These repairs to the fence should also be carried out as soon as the work can be satisfactorily done.\n\nThe Department is informed that the school grounds are very rough and untidy and that this condition would be much improved if the grounds were levelled, some large stones removed, the brush around the fences cut and a small plot ploughed for a flower garden at the front of the building. You should arrange to have the school grounds placed in good condition by carrying out these suggestions. Please see that a small plot is ploughed, to be used as a school garden in front. All this work should be done early in the coming spring.\n\nThe teacher is anxious to continue the hot lunch to the pupils until the Easter holidays.

G. GRIFFITH LIMITED\nPHONE ELGIN 8809\n165 King St. East \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Toronto\n\n100% Manufactured by Canadians in Canada\nDescription of Griffith Chemical Toilet\n\nThe Bowl\n\nTHE Griffith bowl, seat and lid, and nickelled vent pipe attached to bowl, are the only parts of the equipment visible in the toilet room. These parts, therefore, are made with particular attention to elegant appearance in design and finish.\n\nThe bowl is designed especially for our system. It is pure white vitreous china, which is made of the celebrated English ball clay. The china is perfectly fired, producing a vitreous body guaranteed to stand the Ink Test. A good vitreous china bowl will not absorb ink; a poor one will. The bowl has a glossy, smooth surface. Nothing but \"firsts\" are passed by the inspectors or accepted at our factory. \"Firsts\" are bowls without a flaw in form and finish.\n\nThe Griffith bowl is designed perfectly to meet the requirements of a chemical toilet. The diameter and the position of the seat are based on accepted standards with respect to anatomical requisites.\n\nThe bowl will last indefinitely. The base of the bowl is oval and fits into an oval funnel. The bowl can be placed in any position with reference to the tank.\n\nThe seat and lid are similar to the seat and lid of bowls of the best flush toilets. The fittings are heavily nickeled.\n\nThe four-inch nickelled vent pipe in the toilet room matches the white china bowl. It runs through the ceiling.\n\nThe Tank\n\nGriffith Chemical Toilet Tanks are made of 14 gauge Copper Bearing Steel. To make doubly sure of the lasting qualities of our Tanks, all metal parts below the floor line, are heavily coated with plastic enamel.\n\nPlastic enamel is a coating that water, air, alkali or gases do not affect. This enameling process is a feature in the manufacture of Toilet Tanks.\n\nThat is one reason why Griffith Toilets are the best that science has devised and given to the user, insuring a toilet of long service.\n\nThe durability of Griffith Tanks is certain and the Griffith Service stands back of each Griffith-made product.\n\nGriffith Chemical Toilets\nthe result of years of skilled research\n\nThe T. G. Griffith Limited research department has spent years in testing and experimenting with new ideas, investigating the latest developments in sanitary improvements and seeking always to keep their own system up to the highest standard of excellence that modern requirements call for. We believe that these years of endeavour have resulted in our being able to offer the people of Canada the most sanitary and efficient chemical toilet system at the least cost. Griffith Chemical Toilets are the only chemical toilets entirely manufactured and financed in Canada.\nSewage Disposal Conditions that exist in Rural Districts\n\nJust glance at these pictures from life of two old-fashioned outhouses in Winter and Summer. It is almost incredible that such places should still be in use, but they will soon be entirely abolished. They breed flies that carry filth and disease into the home and on to the food; they allow seepage of raw sewage, alive with germs, which contaminates the water of adjacent wells; they are inconvenient uncomfortable, unsightly and nauseating; a menace to physical health and an eyesore to the neighbourhood.\n\nThink of the menace to health and the discomfort that an outhouse such as this entails in Winter.\n\nThe illustration on the right shows a Griffith Chemical toilet installed in a room which might be in a school, home, factory, club, lodge or any other building. It is, as you see, a complete installation, making a neat, comfortable, odorless, sanitary toilet room. The tank is connected properly to the home-made leaching pool and the vent pipe goes through the ceiling, follows the rafters and leads out near the ridge of the roof and runs three feet above it as illustrated on front page. Such an installation will be a success and provides sewage system equal to and less expensive than flush system.\n\nA Griffith Toilet must be installed properly, special attention being given to the vent pipe, and it cannot fail to give satisfaction. Show the Griffith Toilet the same care as you would a flush toilet and it will give you a perfect sewage disposal service.\n\nHere's an old outhouse on a farm, that is a breeding place for flies and pollutes surrounding land in Summer.\n\nShowing how a toilet room looks when a Griffith odorless Chemical Toilet has been installed. Clean, neat, sanitary, comfortable.\nIllustration showing Griffith odorless Toilet System installed in a modern country home or school, with cross section showing interior workings of tank.\n\nMade in Tank Sizes: 125, 200, 250, 375 and 500\n\nTank made of Steel; Welded in Heads; Dasher type Agitator, Copper Funnels; Manhole Sleeve 10' x 14''; Funnel Sleeve 10' x 12''; Length Tank to Floor Maximum 20', Minimum 16'; Coated with Plastic Enamel; Vitreous China Bowl; Nickel-Plated Vent Pipe.\n\nT. G. GRIFFITH LIMITED - Toronto, Ont.\nAugust 4, 1932.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe are wondering if the Government would consider installing chemical toilets in the Golden Lake Continuation School, at Golden Lake.\n\nWe understand that these school toilets are not in very good shape, and could stand equipment like this very nicely.\n\nIf you were in a position to consider this this year, we would be very pleased to quote you on an installation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. G. Griffith Limited,\n\nPer\n\nH. E. Simpson,\nManager.\nOttawa, August 6, 1932.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, regarding the installing of chemical toilets in the Golden Lake Indian Day School and enclosing a pamphlet descriptive of same.\n\nIn reply I have to say that it is not intended to incur any expense this year in installing toilets at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nT. G. Griffith Limited,\n165 King St. East,\nToronto, Ont.\nGolden Lake Ont\nSept 15, 1937\n\nI beg to advise you that the Golden Lake band wish to have a meeting in the Indian School on Sept 12th 1937, to deal with the Narcisse estate.\n\nJ.M. Farrell\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, September 19, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the holding of a meeting on the 17th instant in the Golden Lake Indian Day School by the members of the Band.\n\nIn reply I have to say that your letter was received too late for a reply before the meeting. The Department will have no objection to the Indians holding an occasional meeting for band purposes in the school, provided they do not interfere with the regular classroom work and also provided the janitor is on hand to see that the school is cleaned and placed in good condition after the meetings. It is not intended, however, that the Band be allowed to use the school building indiscriminately, but only for special meetings, and you should see that these instructions are adhered to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Farrell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGolden Lake, Ont.\nGolden Lake Ont\nOct 25/32\n\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI recommend that the Indian School be supplied with a hammer, a screwdriver, and a pair of pliers. When the above-mentioned articles are needed they have to be borrowed from the caretaker, and at times this is rather unhandy. The cost of the articles would not exceed $1.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M. Farrell\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, November 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, regarding the request of the teacher of the Golden Lake Indian Day School to be supplied with a hammer, a screwdriver and a pair of pliers.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department does not consider this equipment necessary. Supplies of this nature are easily mislaid or stolen. The Department is not prepared to authorize the expenditure required at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Painting the class room a cream or light buff and oiling the floors. 4.

Some of them have made several articles for the school, such as a medicine chest, door stops, bookends, and are now making a magazine rack. I bought the girls yarn and oilcloth, out of my own money.\nI wonder if the Government would allow a certain amount, in order to buy material for girls in \"Home Economic\" work, and paint for boys to put finishing touch on their work.\n\nWe have the medicine chest now but we haven't anything in it, for \"First Aid\" work.\n\nTrusting you will be able to help me out some, and thanking you.\n\nYours sincerely,\nJosephine A.

January 26th, 1939\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nDear sir,-\n\nI enclose herewith a letter from Miss Currier the teacher at the Golden Lake Indian School, asking if the Dept. would buy a First Aid Kit to place in the cabinet built by the children. I believe a First aid kit would be a good investment for the School. I recommend a grant of about $3.00 for the kit. I am not sure of the price but this amount should buy one put up by Johnsons & Johnson Co. I recommend also about $1.00 for paint and little fixtures to assist in the children's work.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 1, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo you may expend an amount not exceeding $4.00 in purchasing miscellaneous supplies required at the Golden Lake Indian day school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Holy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. M. Farrell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGolden Lake, Ont.\nGolden Lake Ont March 23rd, 1939\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear sir,-\n\nI have your letter of October 28th 1938, file No 11-1-5, regarding a report on the Golden Lake Indian day school by Inspector Anderson,\n\nI have to say that I recommend a set of smoke pipes for the furnace and about one length of heat pipes that is from the furnace to the floor upstairs.\n\nI have mentioned for the estimates for 38-39 $100.00 for painting school. The School should be painted on both the inside and outside on the inside to brighten up the room as between smoke and dirt the school is a very dull colour, and on the outside to preserve the sheeting as nearly all the old paint is washed off the clapboards.\n\nI recommend a new set of toilets for the school that is the new kind built in the school nearly all the rural schools around her have them.\nthese outdoor toilets have been condemned in all rural schools.\n\nWith regard to fire wood supplied by Mr Matt Bernard. Last year Matt cut about 25 cords of poplar for the school last fall about the time fires were necessary I looked the wood over again, and it was dry as it was piled where the sun could get at it. This wood appeared to me to heat the school alright when the furnace was fired properly. Matt usually starts the fire about 7:30 in the morning, sometimes when the teacher gets to the school the fire has burned out and naturally the school is cold especially when the temperature is below zero, and I know this has happened. Poplar will not last as long as hard wood, but I believe it would heat that school if the furnace is fired right, I must say that the teacher does not possess the ability to make fires, that is in my opinion. She made very few complaints to me this winter, about being cold, only once or twice and I took the matter up with Matt. The only difference I can see about Matt supplying poplar or hard wood such as elm and ash is that it takes more soft wood to keep the school warm. I should have answered your letter sooner, but I wanted to see how the school would be kept this Winter. Matt has a supply of mixed wood prepared for the school for next year cut now.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 30, 1939.\n\nEXD,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th instant with reference to the Golden Lake Indian day school.\n\nI note that you consider the school should be painted on the inside and outside during the coming summer holidays and that you estimate the cost at $100.00. It is presumed this amount covers both material and labour.\n\nIf you can have the work done by Indians please let me have a requisition stating the quantity and colour of paint required both for the interior and exterior.\n\nYou may purchase the new pipes required for the furnace.\n\nI shall write to you under separate cover regarding the wood.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. M. Farrell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGolden Lake, Ont.\nGolden Lake Ont. July 7th, 1939\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear sir,-\n\nI have your letter of March 30th regarding the painting of the Golden Lake Indian day School.\n\nI beg to say that in my estimates for expenditure on repairs to Building and Works for the year 1938-39, I put in a grant for paint for the School. I had in mind at that time painting the outside of the School, however last Winter Inspector Anderson recommended painting on the inside among other things. In the estimates for 1938-39 stated $100.00 and figured that this would cover the cost of painting the outside of the school, but I know that it will not do both the inside and outside.\n\nWith regard to your letter of March 30th the third paragraph, regarding Indian labour. I am unable to recommend this as we have no Indian painters on the Reserve and inexperienced painters would be more expensive and likely do an unsatisfactory job.\nTo paint both the inside and the outside of the School would likely cost close to $200.00, I would recommend this grant however if only $180.00 one hundred dollars is available this year, I would recommend the painting of the inside of the school, because it certainly needs it.\n\nI believe the best price on the job could be obtained by taking tenders, however if this is not desired, I would recommend John Grand of Eganville, as I see his work, and I know that he can paint.\n\nMr Anderson recommends Cream colour for walls and ceiling light buff for wainscoting, and varnish for the floors. The walls should be thoroughly washed treated and filled. The walls should get about three coats of paint. I estimate that it will take about five gallons of paint to do the walls and ceiling once.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Mr. Hughly, Golden Lake, Ont.\n\n**ADDRESS:**\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| July 12/39 | To supplies for Indian day School on Golden Lake Reserve as per accounts attached. | $5.20  |\n\n**TOTAL:** $5.20\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n**FORM No. I.A. 506**\n\n**Voucher No.:** 14\n\n**DATE:** July 12, 1939\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

The pupils are using two separate toilets which are in desperate condition. In the school room the pupils are all drinking from an open water pail and only one cup and on account of the health condition of some of the families' families on the reserve this constitutes a real danger to the general health of our children.\n\nI might state that Mr. Anderson, district separate school Inspector, has recommended changes covering the above conditions and he has also suggested that the school building should be\nthoroughly cleaned and painted.\n\nAs I stated before these matters have been taken up with officials of the Indian Department some time ago and the local Indian Agent has attended our council meetings in which these matters have been discussed and recommendations for the improvement of conditions in our school passed by our Council were, we understand, to be forwarded to the Indian Dept by the attending local Agent.\n\nI trust that your Department will see fit to have an investigation of the conditions here by one of your Officials as soon as possible and I feel sure that on your report the Indian Department will carry out the improvements we feel are absolutely necessary for the health of our children.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nWm Tennessee\n\nChief of Golden Lake Indian Reserve.\nP.S.\n\nI might state that since I have written this letter, I have found out that the Indian Department has granted a paint job on the inside of our school \"only.\" Nothing Else.\n\nW.T.\nOttawa, August 26, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter sent forward to this Branch from the Department of Pensions and National Health. The letter, you will note, is signed by Wm. Tennescoe, Chief of the Golden Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nYou are already aware that authority was granted to you in a letter dated August 10, 1939, to paint the interior of the Golden Lake school. I am anxious, however, that you should thoroughly investigate and report upon the sanitary condition of this school and particularly the conditions referred to by the Chief in his communication. In view of the fact that a large percentage of the Indians of Golden Lake are in receipt of unemployment relief, would it be too much to expect them to keep the toilets at the Indian day school on the reserve in a sanitary condition, or will it be necessary to employ white men to go in and do this work? Your immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nPlease return the Chief's letter with your reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. M.

It is almost impossible to keep outside toilets at a school perfectly sanitary, but these toilets were cleaned out during the school holidays and on Labour day at the school the boys scrubbed out the boys toilet and the girls scrubbed out the girls toilet, so there is very little more to be done in this case. I will say that most rural schools around here have installed inside toilets at a cost of five or six hundred dollars, I believe the School Inspector favours inside sanitary toilets individual paper drinking cups.\nand a water tank rather than outside toilets; a water pail and one cup as has been in use for the past years.\n\nI recommend these improvements when you have the money to spend.

The children always does the sweeping and it makes the work much easier when half a dozen pupils work together.\n\nThis is by no means a new arrangement as it has been done since the present school was built about twenty five years ago.

There is also a great need for kindergarten material and a number of necessary books which I have not been able to list at the present time as it requires some thought and study.\n\nThe clock and flag are standard equipment in any school. My watch is not dependable.\n\nBesides the articles required there are a number of repairs needed. There is a door knob missing on the door leading to the basement. The seats are badly in need of repair and adjustment. Eleven are broken.\n\nI am aware of the need to curtail expenses at the present time but if the school work is to be carried on effectively and in accord with the present course, should be provided.\n\nSo far there has been nothing to worry about the school.

Mrs. George is proving to be an excellent teacher who is insisting on much better discipline than the pupils have ever been accustomed. There are 30 pupils on roll with an average attendance of 24. Isabel Benoit a pupil has not been attending school for no reason. Her mother was visited and warned. She promised to send Isabel to school. Her attendance that afternoon was noted. Minor repairs to desks and shelves are necessary at an estimated cost of $12.00. This repair work is recommended as necessary. Desks require re-spacing and placement on new runners. The supplying of a better grade of fire wood was discussed with Matt Barnard who has supplied the wood for a number of years. He promised to have the quality improved. This complaint is not of a serious nature. Outside toilets should be cleaned at least twice a year instead of once as at present, and lime used throughout the year.\n\nW.S.

After a thorough checkup there did not seem to be anything missing.\n\nI visited the school and found that although the windows had locks on them, none of the locks worked as the top sash of each window seems to have slipped down.\n\nI would recommend that these sashes be forced back into place and blocks be nailed under them to keep them there. Also that a board be placed in a slanting position in each window so that the cold air will be forced to go upward above the level of the children's heads when the windows are open.\n\nAlso I would recommend that a clock be supplied to this school. Miss McNulty, the teacher, has been using her alarm clock during the past month. This is very inconvenient for her as she has to carry her clock to school in the morning and back home at night. She tells me that a clock is a necessity in the method she uses to teach.\n\nHoping for an early reply, I remain,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6133, File 394-5, part 3)\nOttawa,\nNovember 10, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, you may make the repairs suggested to the windows at the Golden Lake Indian Day School. You may also purchase an ordinary alarm clock for use at the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. H.P. Ruddy,\nIndian Agent,\nGolden Lake, Ont.\nOttawa, November 25, 1942.\n\nMr. H. P. Ruddy, Indian Agent, Golden Lake, Ontario\n\nI am in receipt of a report from Mr. J. T. Anderson, Public School Inspector, on the Golden Lake Indian Day School, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"I would urge that the school be given a good scrubbing and the out-houses a thorough cleaning as soon as possible. It would be well, also, to make certain of an adequate supply of good dry wood before winter sets in.\"\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that these matters, relating to the operation of our schools, be brought to our attention, not by the public school inspector, but by our own agent.\n\nThis will be your authority to purchase the wood necessary for the heating of the school. It is noted from the records that last year we purchased 10 cords of hardwood at $6.00 per cord and 2 cords of kindling wood at $10.00.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be possible to have the Women's Club take an active interest in the school. Would it be possible to have a couple of these women or a couple of the senior pupils scrub the school intermittently? The scrubbing of a school floor and the dusting of a school should form an indispensable part of an Indian pupil's education. Nothing he, or she, can learn in the school is of greater importance than this. I have been wondering, also, if there are scrapers outside the school door and if these boys are taught by the teacher to clean their feet before entering the classroom. Indian day and residential schools can be kept clean. I have visited Indian day schools, in charge of Sisters, that were simply spotless.\n\nIn respect to the out-houses, these should be kept in a clean and sanitary condition at all times and chloride of lime should be used for this purpose. These are matters that you might well discuss with the teacher, and, if you consider it advisable, with the members of the women's organization. We are, as you know, taking a special interest in the welfare and progress of the Golden Lake Indians, and the program we have in mind should certainly include the school.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nGolden Lake, April, 8th. 1943.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nRE- OILING THE FLOOR OF THE\nGOLDEN LAKE INDIAN DAY\nSCHOOL.\n\nThe floor of the Golden Lake Indian Day School is in need of a scrubbing during the Easter holidays. I recommend that after it is scrubbed it be given a good oiling as it is very hard to keep as clean the way it is now. This oiling would cost approximately ten dollars for material and labour but I believe the improved condition of the floor would more than make up for this expenditure.\n\nHoping for an early reply I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. P. Ruddy,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 12, 1945.\n\nMr. H.P.

You should do this and this will obviate the necessity of digging a new well.\n\nThe teacher states that repairs are required to the furnace, as the grates are burned out.

In fact I believe that we will have enough left to get oil for the floor. I have made arrangements with Mr. Knuth a local merchant to supply us with Canada Paint Company's first quality paint. In our discussion of the paint it was suggested that the school be trimmed with green. I am inclosing a colour sample of the shade of green that I ordered. I hope that this shade is satisfactory.\n\nWith regard to the fencing of the school grounds I would suggest that some kind of heavy, meshed lawn fencing be supplied for the front while the side and back be fenced with ordinary page wire. I am inclosing a requisition for this wire as it cannot be bought locally. I believe that I can get enough fence posts on the Reserve to do this job.\n\nI will have the toilets moved further back so as not to be so conspicuous from the road. There should be new screens for these toilets and these will require 120 bd. ft. dressed lumber and 80 bd. ft. 2x4 scantling.\n\np.t.o.\nA cement walk from the gate at the road to the school steps (a distance of 50 ft.) would improve the appearance of the grounds. Also it would be much easier to keep a path open in the winter months.\n\nMichael Bernard, an Indian, will do this work. He is the same man that was overseer at the building of the roothouse last year, and he also built the chick brooder this spring. He will charge .60\u00a2 per hour to paint and .45\u00a2 per hour for any other work that has to be done.\n\nHoping that you will give these suggestions your consideration, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. P. Ruddy\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 22, 1943.\n\nMr. H.P. Ruddy, Indian Agent, Golden Lake, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, it is noted that the paint required for the exterior of the Golden Lake School will not cost $50.00. You may arrange for its purchase. The shade of green for the trimming is satisfactory. I note that you can engage Mr. Michael Bernard, at a cost of 60\u00a2 an hour, for doing the painting. You may proceed with the necessary work at once.\n\nI am requesting the Purchasing Branch to secure the fencing. You may have the toilets moved. In order to provide new screens you may purchase 120 board feet of dressed lumber and 80 board feet of scantling. I note that Michael Bernard will do any work required in regard to the fencing and moving the toilets for 45\u00a2 an hour.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Description                  | Quantity | Price |\n|------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| 10 yds.

In my estimate of the cost of this work I stated that I thought that I would be able to get posts from the Indians. When I went to get them all the posts were cut six feet long which was too short for the kind of a fence that we put up, so I had to buy them from Mr. Thur a timber dealer.\n\nThe following work was done by these men; the toilets moved to the back of the school yard, a new floor put on the front porch, the grounds completely brushed, mowed and the trees trimmed to a height of ten feet, a new fence put up, the school and toilets painted and the classroom floor oiled. They also put new screens on the toilets. We had some paint left after painting the school so we painted the fence posts in the front of the school white and trimmed them with green the same as the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. P.

In circular C-150-48 (SCHOOL YEAR AND HOLIDAYS ACADEMIC YEAR 1944-45) June 9th is not mentioned as a holiday.\n\nI would like to get authority to install Yale Locks on the two outside doors on the Indian Day School. The locks that are on these doors can be opened with skeleton keys and although nothing has been taken we have reason to believe that someone has entered the school at night recently. Also the locks on some of the windows are not in working order due to the fact that the upper sashes have slipped down. I would like authority to have these repaired at the same time.\n\nHoping for an early reply I remain,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nH. P. Ruddy,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 6, 1944.\n\nMr. H.P. Ruddy, Indian Agent, Golden Lake, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, you may allow the teacher and pupils of the Golden Lake Day School to enjoy a holiday on June 9.\n\nYou may purchase two new locks for the outside doors of the school and also locks for the windows.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, July 10, 1944.\n\nMr. H.P. Ruddy, Indian Agent, Golden Lake, Ontario.\n\nI have your requisition which has recently been forwarded from your office. We would appreciate it if you would carry out the repairs mentioned on this requisition. It is understood of course, that you will keep the expenditure as low as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nGolden Lake, Ont.,\nSept. 11th, 1944.\n\nMr. McGill,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt some few times during the past year, Dr. McCann has been interviewing you re. quarters for the teacher at Golden Lake Sch. He was assured, I believe, that this matter would be attended to.\n\nNow, I have returned for the yr 1944-45 to find nothing done. It so happens that I have developed a foot condition from the two mile walk every day \u2014 and for which I have had to have treatment over the holidays. While it has cleared up, I am assured it will return with continued walking.\n\nIn addition, it is difficult getting quarters in the village. The pop. is practically German and so decidedly pro-German that living with them is most unpleasant. There are no conveniences or privileges yet I must pay as much as in larger centres.\n\nI have the present room until the end of Sept. and no longer, nor do I know of\nany other. I hope the Dept will make something ready for me.\n\nMrs. Davalley says the kitchen of her former home could be made available by a partition. The front and upstairs could still be used by the club. The necessary furnishings and fuel would be the only expense.\n\nOf course the better plan would be to build on the end of the school\u2014three small rooms\u2014and convert some of the school heat. There is extensive building going on at Eganville\u2014possibly this could be prepared in short order.\n\nI would appreciate something done, as a teacher cannot work under existing conditions to advantage.\n\nThanking you Mrs. McGill, in anticipation, and may I have an early reply.\n\nI am,\n\nVery Sincerely,\n\nMargaret MacNulty,\nGolden Lake School.\nOttawa, September 15, 1944.\n\nMiss M. MacNulty, Teacher, Indian Day School,\nGolden Lake, Ontario.\n\nYour letter of September 11, addressed to Dr. McGill, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nYou are probably aware that no Indian day or residential schools and no teachers' residences have been built by this Department at any time in recent years. As a matter of actual fact, none of the schools such as the large Indian day school at Caughnawaga have been rebuilt since they were destroyed by fire. When the Government's immediate post-war building program is organized, I am of the opinion that schools destroyed by fire throughout the Dominion will have a first claim, and rightly so, on our resources.\n\nThe desirability of erecting a teacherage at Golden Lake has been reviewed on a number of occasions since I entered the Department 8 years ago. No action has been taken, however, for the simple reason that a great many teachers, perhaps the majority, prefer to live off the reserve where at all possible. You will realize, therefore, that we hesitate to proceed with the construction of a building in which your successor or successors might refuse to reside. However, I have noted with interest the suggestion contained in the last two paragraphs of your communication. It is my intention to ask Mr. Morris to investigate this matter at the time of his next visit to Golden Lake.\n\nR. A.

P. Ruddy,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 28, 1945.\n\nMr. H. P.

In the latter event, you should state if competent Indians can be secured and also the quantity of shingles and other material required. If the cost of the material is over $50.00, it will be necessary to make purchase through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nGolden Lake, Ont.\nJuly 7th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nChief Training Division.\n\nRE- RENT FOR INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nPlease find attached cheque No. 372 which I received from the Returning Officer for South Renfrew in the recent Provincial Election.

I understand that this arrangement has been completed and that I can figure on using it this fall.\n\nWe will need about twenty-four desks for this room, also blackboards. This building is approximately nineteen feet wide so we will require about eighteen feet of blackboard for the front of the classroom. We will not be able to put blackboards on the sides as there are too many windows. We will also need a desk and chair for the teacher, extra yardsticks, blackboard brushes and other suitable equipment for the classroom. We should have this equipment anytime after the 15th of August so that there will be time to install it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. P. Ruddy\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 15, 1946.\n\nMr. H. P.

The walls are very smoky and they give the classroom a dark appearance. The floor of the Community Hall (which is being used as a second classroom) will also have to be scrubbed. The toilets at both places will have to be cleaned before the opening of school, but as a rule we do this in the latter part of August just before school opens.\n\nAlso I would ask permission to purchase another barrel of Dustbane for the school floors. The barrel which we purchased three years ago is all used up.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. P. Ruddy,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1947.\n\nMr. H.P.

It is our intention, in our next year's estimates, to provide for the construction of an extra classroom at this school.\n\nOur Superintendent of Welfare and Training has himself inspected the school and is of the opinion that an extra classroom can be added on to the present school.\n\nIt will be necessary, however, at the same time to provide for a new roof for the old school, as the present one is in a bad state of repair. As we would also like to put a full basement under the extra classroom and to provide flush toilets, we would like to have one of your officials visit this reserve and draw up the necessary plans and specifications.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nGOLDEN LAKE, August 31/47\n\nMr. H.

I understand that the installing of the heating system will be by sub-contract which will be taken care of at a later date. The gravel may be purchased locally from a white farmer and the cost will be approximately ten cents per yard plus the cost of hauling. The only cost of the stone used, will be the hauling.\n\nIn the requisition for Hardware I quoted the number of sash balances as given in the list of material (Index No. 837), but I am of the opinion that this number is required for a Two room school with living quarters. I would ask you to kindly check on this, and if I am correct in my assumption then I would ask you to change the number of balances to the following-\n\nSash sizes-\n7 pairs - 2'-1\" X 2'-9\"\n2 pairs - 2'-1\" X 2'-5\"\n4 pairs - 2'-5\" X 2'-5\"\n5 pairs - 3'-0\" X 3'-0\"\n\nHoping that this requisition, as submitted, meets with your approval, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent\nMay 6, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Golden Lake Indian Day School.\n\nAttached is requisition for materials required for the above school.\n\nThe Indian Agent states that gravel may be purchased locally from a white farmer at a cost of approximately ten cents (.10\u00a2) a yard, plus the cost of hauling. The only cost of the stone that is needed will be the hauling. We are authorizing the Agent to secure the gravel and the stone locally.\n\nIn issuing purchase order, please request the Treasury Branch to charge to E.R. 319.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nBernard F.

They make card playing a real pleasure and they last for a long, long time. Two complete decks in an attractive gift box.\nBOILER NEVERLEAK\n\n\"The Miracle Liquid\"\n\nBoiler Neverleak is a highly concentrated liquid and is GUARANTEED to repair and permanently stop all leaks in steam boilers and hot water heating boilers, if directions on package are followed.\n\nIt will stop the leaks almost instantly by simply pouring Neverleak into the water in the boiler, merely giving it time to circulate through the boiler and find the leak. It is equally effective in both tubular and cast boilers.\n\nBoiler Neverleak has frequently repaired very old boilers, boilers so long in service that they were practically rusted out in several of the sections. Boiler Neverleak coats the water-ways of the boiler, thereby preventing what is known in the trade as \"rust-pit leaks.\"\n\nIt is not necessary to know what sections or tubes of a boiler are leaking, or to lose the use of the boiler. Simply pour Boiler Neverleak into the water in the boiler, as required, following the directions on each can, and it will search out the leaks and seal them in a very short time. Boiler Neverleak makes an absolutely permanent repair. It will not deteriorate or lose its efficiency so long as the can is kept tightly corked.\n\nBacked by a Million Dollar Guarantee\n\nThe manufacturers guarantee that Boiler Neverleak will do all that is claimed in the foregoing statements, and that it will permanently and securely seal leaks in broken, cracked or leaky boilers, by following printed directions on each can; that leak stopping of the most surprising character will result and that hundreds, and, in many cases, thousands of dollars, can be readily saved by its use. Should any case prove otherwise, the manufacturers agree to refund the purchase price upon reasonable evidence of Boiler Neverleak having failed to do everything claimed herein and they pledge their entire financial responsibility of considerably more than one million dollars to the faithful carrying out of their guarantee.\n\nManufactured only by\n\nLIQUID VENEER CORPORATION\nFort Erie North, Ont.

Therefore I would ask you to order two single beds instead of one double bed. These along with whatever other bedroom furniture the Department allows may be forwarded immediately.\n\nWith regard to the furniture for the living room and kitchen I might say that the only item received so far is the cooking range. I understand that the furniture for these two rooms is also a regular issue. However I would suggest that a small dinnette set be used in the kitchen as there isn't too much space.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. P. Ruddy,\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 12, 1949.\n\nMr. H.F. Ruddy,\nIndian Superintendent,\nGolden Lake, Ontario.\n\nGolden Lake Indian Day School\n\nI have just received a letter from Dr. Procter concerning the use of a room in the basement for a medical examination room. There is a room in the basement of this school especially designed for this purpose, and we are very pleased to grant permission for its use by Dr. Reeves.\n\nBernard E.

F. Neary,\n\nFurniture etc - Teachers' Residence,\nGolden Lake Indian Agency.\n\nOn my visit to the above-mentioned Agency yesterday, January 26th, I discussed with Indian Agent H. P. Ruddy and the teachers the furniture required for the residence.\n\nAt present the teachers are residing in the quarters carrying on the best they can with what equipment they have been able to gather together. I would recommend, therefore, that the standard furniture, as shown (with the exceptions set out below) on your list be ordered from either Eaton's or Simpson's with the request that delivery be made at the earliest possible date.\n\n2 single bed outfits should be purchased 3' 3\" rather than the one double bed. There are two lady teachers and they should have separate beds.\n\nCurtains and blinds for three double windows to provide privacy were authorized to be purchased by the Agent at a cost not exceeding $30.00.

Neary,\n\nIn a recent inspection trip to Golden Lake Indian Reserve, Indian Agent Ruddy advised that he expected there would be certain surpluses of building materials after the school is completed. I requested him to make a list showing the quantities and types when the work on the school is finished, then this would be sent to your office for advice as to what should be done with the surplus. In my opinion, it should be turned over to Welfare to be used for the building of Indian houses.\n\nMr. Ruddy also mentioned that Dr. Reeves was very anxious to have a small room made available in the basement where Indians could be examined and treated on his regular visit to the Reserve. Materials are available to do this job, but it would cost approximately $50. for the labour. I would recommend that Mr. Ruddy be instructed to have the work done and payment be made out of the School vote. (You will recall I discussed with you on the telephone the advisability of charging the Medical Health Services for the materials and labour and you stated that you thought that the Schools would pay the small cost to make the space available.\n\nMr. Ruddy also showed me a large cupboard, which was manufactured and delivered to be installed in the kitchen, but said that he thought the cupboard would take up too much room, as the space was rather small. However, he should be instructed to have the cupboard installed, as provided in the specifications.\n\nJ. E. Morris,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for the Province of Ontario.\nFebruary 7, 1949.\n\nMr. H.P. Ruddy,\nAssistant Superintendent, Indian Agency,\nGolden Lake, Ontario.\n\nGolden Lake Indian Day School\n\nThe furniture required for your school has now all been ordered, and parcels should start reaching you in the near future.\n\nI understand that you are preparing a list showing quantities and type of surplus materials so that a decision can be reached as to their disposal.\n\nAs you are aware, our plans call for a small First Aid room in the basement. Mr. Morris advises me that with an expenditure of approximately $50.00, we can have this room set up for use by Dr. Reeves. You may have this done. With regard to the cupboard, our plan is to provide a built-in kitchen of a small size with all meals being eaten in the combined living-dining room. I appreciate that the teacher may want to eat in the kitchen, but unfortunately, the design does not provide for this accommodation.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Dec. | 23 Res.

The painting of the window sash goes very slow and will take up more time than the rest of the painting. While this work will run over into the new fiscal year this could not be helped, as there was no advantage in taking on extra men because, due to the weather conditions, they could not do this work. We will also have some levelling of the ground to do as soon as the frost is out.\n\nWith regard to the amount of money it will take to do the rest of the work I would say that if $250.00 was transferred to Vote 516-10-491 it will definitely be sufficient. I would ask you to forward an advance of this amount at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly\n\nH. P. Ruddy,\nIndian Agent.\n9th April, 1949.\n\nMr. H.P. Ruddy,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nGolden Lake, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to the Golden Lake Day School.\n\nIt is noted that the school is completed with the exception of an expenditure of $250.00. As the work will not be completed before the end of March, this particular account will have to be paid from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nWe are not yet issuing cheques on this appropriation, but hope to do so within a week or ten days.

He states that there are 31 children of school age who live in the village all the year round. The Indians would take out the logs for the building and put it up if the government would provide food supplies while they are so engaged. The only additional cost for the building would be about $100.00 for shingles, tar paper, nails, windows, doors, etc.\n\nMr. Paget, who visited this locality lately, informs me that a school is badly needed there.\n\nIf this application is approved authority might be given for getting out the logs and arrangements made for sending in the other material required, so that the school would be ready for occupation early next year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Personally I would not recommend the opening of this school, as the Indians at Gull Bay are hunters, and move away from the Reserve in the winter time.\n\nI suggest that the children be sent to the St Joseph's Boarding School at Fort William, Ont., this the Indians objected to, as they do not want to send them away from the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. BURK,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 14, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a resolution passed by the members of the Gull Bay Band requesting the Department to re-open the day school on the Gull Bay Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department cannot approve of the re-opening of this school owing to the fact that the Indians are away at long periods from the Reserve each year. Your suggestion that these children be sent to St. Joseph's Boarding School at Fort William is considered the best means available for the providing of educational facilities for the children of Gull Bay. You should endeavour to influence the Indian parents to allow their children to enter St. Joseph's Boarding School. We feel that if the day school was re-opened the attendance would be so irregular that it would not warrant the department in incurring the expenditure involved in paying the teacher's salary and other expenses. Please inform the Indians interested accordingly, also that the Department will authorize the admission of any of the children they may send to the Boarding School at Fort William. Applications and certificates of health on the forms for that purpose should be forwarded if any children are sent. All particulars on the form should be filled in and they should be properly signed in the presence of a subscribing witness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. C. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, has discussed the day school situation at Pic, Sand Point, Mobert and Gull Bay. At one time or another schools were in operation at all four of these Reserves. Mr. Burk is of the opinion that there will be an agitation for the reopening of these schools. He considers it advisable to experiment with one Reserve, and suggests Pic as the most promising. A summer school might be granted here, as there is an old schoolhouse. Desks would be required and, if the work was continued during the winter months, arrangements would have to be made to put the building in good shape.\n\nI have not suggested to Mr. Burk that he advocate commencing a school at Pic, but if the demand is strong enough we might favourably consider the matter.\nSir,\n\nRegarding the school situation in this agency I beg to submit the following report:\n\nAt Gull Bay Reserve there are between 30 and 35 children of school age. The parents of these children have built permanent homes and are most anxious to have school facilities for their children on this Reserve. The old school at Gull Bay has not been opened for a number of years.\n\nDuring the last three years on every visit to Gull Bay this matter has been brought to my attention, and I have taken no action owing to the fact that I have hoped to enroll the children in the St. Joseph's Boarding School. I find here, as on all other Reserves in this Agency, a strong desire on the part of the parents to have their children with them, as well as a growing prejudice against Boarding Schools. I have done all in my power to encourage the parents to send their children to the Boarding School but with little success.\n\nAs there are so many children on the Gull Bay Reserve receiving no education I would also recommend the erection of a new school and residence at this point.\n\nThe Indians on the above mentioned Reserves are gradually taking up farming and have built permanent homes. The Indian Day Schools not only educate the children but the whole family in modern way of living and in sanitary habits. I would recommend that provision be made in the estimates for the erection of schools and teachers' residences at Pic, Sand Point and Gull Bay Reserves.\n\nThe approximate cost of these buildings would be $20,000.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 22, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 13th instant relative to the erection of a new school and teacher's residence on the Gull Bay Reserve, I beg to say that as the school at this point has not been in operation for sometime, it is considered that it might first be advisable to conduct a summer school with a view to ascertaining whether the Indians would take advantage of the opportunity and have their children attend regularly. We will have no funds next summer with which to erect a building at this point, but, if a suitable house could be obtained in which to carry on classroom activities, we would be prepared to provide for the salary of a teacher and the other necessary expense in conducting a summer school. You might give the matter of a summer school at this point your consideration and report later as to whether you would advise that same be conducted or not and also as to what accommodation could be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Brock -\nThe Indian Agent.\n\nSir:\n\nWe the Indians of this place have assembled and the Indians themselves have agitated and adopted a day school to be established in this Reserve and wish to send their children to school this winter. Port William is too far for them and it's exceedingly inconvenient to get there.\n\nThey are fully 35 children of schoolable age.\n\nWe want you to attend to this soon.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nChief J.

Burt,\nthe Indian Agent.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe the undersigned, directly and fully authorized and approved for the use of the Indians of this Reserve, state that the school house is here, specially built for that purpose, and erected purely in the execution of it, and the size is ample large enough for the expected daily attendance, say about 25. Besides being picking and fishing is failure, and they are fully convinced to earn their daily victuals. And yet they are convinced their children should go to school to meet the irresistible obligation coming upon them. They also agree to send their children to boarding schools, as it is very awkward to get out from here, in case sickness. In short we want the school here and done.\n\nChief J. Kewiwekus\nCommissioners [signature]\nPaul Shoneyans\nSec. [signature]\n\nThis letter was omitted in my personal letter of September 5th.\n306 Tunney Ave\n\nMr. Russell could come here to open & examine me to get my important.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise I have just received communications signed by the Chief, and councillors, of the Gull Bay Band, requesting me to re-open the school on the Gull Bay Indian Reserve.\n\nDuring Annuity payments this year I estimated there are approximately forty children of school age, who are constantly running around, and continually getting into trouble.\n\nUnfortunately the old school building, that was used, formerly, as a combination school and residence, is far too small and beyond repair.\n\nI would strongly recommend building a similar school to the one the Department built on the Pic Reserve. The approximate cost to build this school and equip same would be $6,500.00.\n\nI would suggest that a temporary school be opened for the winter months on this Reserve. If the Department approve we can obtain the services of an Indian on the Reserve as a temporary teacher. This man has been fairly well educated, having studied for the priest-hood, and would answer the purpose for the time being. His services could be secured for $40.00 per month.\n\nThe cost of re-opening and conducting this school would be very small, and would provide the children with regular school habits. This would be of great assistance for the regular teacher if the Department decide to build a new school on this Reserve.\n\nI would appreciate an early reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 20, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing communications signed by the chief and councillors of the Gull Bay Band requesting that the school be reopened on the Gull Bay Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your recommendation that a temporary school be opened for the coming winter months at this point is approved, and you may arrange to obtain the services of the Indian referred to by you as teacher. We note that his services can be obtained at the rate of $40 per teaching month. The Department will allow him salary at that rate during the period he has the school in operation. You may, therefore, make the necessary arrangements to have this school reopened at the earliest possible date.\n\nShould any minor repairs or cleaning of the old building be required, you may arrange to have the work carried out, keeping all expenses for the purpose as low as possible.\n\nYou should forward a requisition at an early date for any supplies or furnishings that may be required, and only the supplies absolutely necessary should be asked for.\n\nA requisition should also be forwarded for the classroom supplies considered necessary.\n\nShould it be necessary to purchase fuel, you may arrange to have the quantity required supplied.\n\nAccounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering all expenditures incurred.\n\nYour recommendation that a new school building be erected at this point similar to the one that the Department erected on the Pic Reserve has been noted. An item will be included in our estimates for the next fiscal year to provide the funds required for the purpose.\n\nPlease inform the Department when you have concluded arrangements for the reopening of the school and state the date when the teacher began duties. This matter should receive your early attention.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. Middleton,\nActing Asst.

Father Couture has nominated Miss Florence Morriseau, an 18 year old Indian girl, who attended the Lake Helen Indian Day School under Miss Leusch.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Joseph Couture complained very bitterly regarding the appointment of Joe Esquimaux as teacher on the Gull Bay Reserve. He pointed out that this man undoubtedly had a very good education, but he was not a Catholic, and thought it advisable to appoint a new teacher.\n\nHe recommended a Miss Morriseau, a Catholic teacher, who would, no doubt, answer the purpose as temporary teacher during the winter. Consequently I appointed Miss Morriseau, who began teaching on the Gull Bay Reserve on November 2nd. I deemed it advisable to make this change immediately as navigation on Lake Nipigon will be closed in the very near future.\n\nI trust my action in this case meets with the Department's approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Jos. Couture, appointed Miss Florence Morriseau as teacher of the Gull Bay Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Morriseau, with salary at the rate of $40 per teaching month. We understand that she is an eighteen year old Indian girl, who attended the Lake Helen Indian Day School, and that she has no special qualifications. Her retention in the position will depend entirely upon the success with which she meets in the work, and on the occasion of your next visit to Gull Bay, you should report on the success which she is accomplishing.

Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to securing the services of a teacher for the Gull Bay Indian Day School, which will be completed in the next 10 days, I beg to advise I received numerous applications from various teachers in Ontario, but unfortunately when hearing that the Gull Bay School was so isolated and the only mode of transportation in the winter time was by dog team, a distance of 75 miles from the Reserve to the railway, the applicants did not wish to teach in such an isolated spot.\n\nOn the 31st ultimo, I received an application from Miss Hamer, who lives in this City. In a personal interview Miss Hamer advised me she had been teaching for the last 6 years, and was quite willing to teach at Gull Bay. She advised me she would be willing to teach for $80.00 per teaching month, but on recommendation from the Inspector hoped to have an increase by next term.\n\nOn the same date I received her application I received a wire from Orient Bay advising me the last boat of the season would be leaving on the 2nd. I assisted Miss Hamer to secure her winter's supply of provisions and escorted her to Gull Bay Reserve. Miss Hamer will use the old log building for a temporary school until the new school is completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant, I beg to say that the appointment of Miss Homer as teacher of the Gull Bay Indian Day School, at a salary of $80 a teaching month, is approved.

She is extremely interested in the Indians, and does a great deal of charity work.\n\nUnfortunately the Gull Bay Reserve is extremely isolated, and Miss Hamer is the only white person living on this Reservation.\n\nUnder the circumstances would it be possible to grant an increase in the teacher's salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is noted that at the time of her appointment you stated she advised you she had six years' previous teaching experience. Any salary increase that could be allowed would depend on the qualifications which she possesses.

The salary allowed Miss Hamer will be at the rate of $85 per teaching month.

Vesey Age:- Fifty.\n\nQualifications:- Interim Second Class Professional Certificate (Ontario).\n\nSuccess: Satisfactory in the main.\n\nGeneral Remarks:- I don't know just what to say about the poor man who is teaching here. He evidently is trying to do his best, and his results were quite fair, but some of the success may be due to his predecessor. As already remarked, I shall be better able to estimate his worth in the spring.\n\nHe may do well in Indian Schools where the pupils are more docile, but would, I fear, not be an outstanding success in some of our large city schools. For he lacks totally those qualities colloquially known as \"pep\". As noted, he is some fifty years of age, and has the manner of one who is just recovering from a long illness which has left him a little tired and listless. I would suggest that he be left where he is until he has had a chance to produce some evidence of worth or the contrary. I shall watch him particularly on my next visit.\nFebruary 21st, 1931.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:-\n\nRe:- Teacher, Gull Bay Day School.\n\nSee telegram under, dated September 12th, in which Agent Burk stated that he was considering transferring Mr. George W.

This Indian Reserve has had a bad reputation in regards to intoxicants, and manufacture of intoxicants, so I made a thorough investigation at this point. I found that supplies had been sent to this Indian reserve for the winter through the Indian Agent, which had greatly improved living conditions. The school teacher G. W. Vesey and his sister were found to be taking great interest in the welfare of the children. They reported a full attendance at school, and informed me that they cooked porridge and also gave them cod liver oil quite regular. They have an excellent Indian school built on this reserve.\n\nF. H. Bebb,\nI/C Nipigon Detachment.\nEXTRACT FROM SEPARATE SCHOOL INSPECTOR GREENING'S REPORT REGARDING HIS VISIT TO THE GULL BAY INDIAN DAY SCHOOL ON NOVEMBER 9, 1931.\n\nOriginal on File 9-2-6.\n\nI fear that one could hardly class Mr. Vesey as a teacher of outstanding ability. I believe that the Department would have been better advised to have dispensed with his services in view of the report upon his operations at Mobert. However, the Department having kept him on, coupled with his claim to recognition on account of overseas service, complicates the situation somewhat.\n\nThis much can truthfully be said of him. He has very evidently done the best he could and the children do show evidences of having derived some advantage in an academic way from their contact with him since my last visit. From what I could gather at my visit,-I had to remain at Gull Bay overnight - he seems to be popular with the adult Indians, but, although he sees that the children are regular, I have been told that his discipline is a little weak.\n\nSo far as academic work is concerned, which, after all, is about the only thing one can determine at all safely in the short time available, I should be inclined to grade the school as a little better than a fair average school.\n\nTo my mind, best results will not be secured with male teachers. I am trying to have the teachers take up sewing, darning, cooking and such like activities.\nJune 22, 1932.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Burk, in a personal letter to me, writes in part as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Greening and I returned from a recent tour of Lake Nipigon. We were both very pleased and surprised to find that Mr. Vesey is doing much better work. I was under the impression we would have to let him out at the end of this term. His sister, who is keeping house for him, is teaching the children knitting and is also doing social work. Vesey has the happy faculty of getting on well with the Indians, which is 75% of the battle.\"\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher does not take a very active interest in gardening.\n\nIt was suggested by the Chief and several Indians that a new teacher be appointed. I would suggest that the Department communicate with Mr. Greening, School Inspector, and ask if he does not consider it advisable to appoint a new teacher for next term. The teacher appears to be very disinterested in the Indians, and very lackadaisical with the school children.\nOttawa, September 15, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, I beg to say that the Department approves the transfer of Miss Dorcas Ross as teacher of the Gull Bay Indian Day School. She will be allowed salary at the rate of $90 a teaching month. The transfer of Mr. Geo. W. Vesey from Gull Bay to Lake Helen is also approved. His salary will be at the rate of $85 a teaching month.\n\nAs you were informed in our telegram of the 13th instant, present regulations do not permit our changing the salary ratings at Indian day schools, and the salaries mentioned above are the same as were allowed teachers at these two schools during the past year.\n\nIn future, you should, at the end of each academic year, make definite enquiries from the teachers of the Indian day schools in your Agency regarding their intention of returning to their respective schools after the holidays. If any teachers are resigning or you consider transfers advisable, the Department should be so informed, in order that your recommendations may be considered in due time, and thus avoid the many difficulties that have arisen this year due to the fact that the Department was not informed until the time had arrived to reopen the schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

She advised that in a great many cases the parents were so sick they were even unable to get their own wood. Three deaths have occurred.

Consequently, there has always been considerable trouble in connection with the payment of salaries to the teachers of these schools.\n\nI would, therefore, appreciate if you would advise me, at once, the names of the schools in your agency which you consider should remain open until July 15th.

Both these schools are situated approximately 200 miles farther North than the other schools and the Indians commence travel as a rule, two weeks later than bands situated South of these points and consequently they do not return to the reservations two weeks later in the fall, in order that they may participate in the blueberry harvest.\n\nThe balance of the Day Schools in this agency will close as usual at the end of the academic year, June 30th.\n\nMiss Doreen Ross is teacher at Gull Bay school and Miss Amelia McGuire teacher at Whitesand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have a few suggestions to offer which would certainly prove most useful here, and possibly on other reserves in like circumstances.\n\nIt is the opinion of Father Couture, the Indian Agent, and myself that academic studies be taught in the Indian schools in the mornings, and manual or vocational instruction be carried on in the afternoon under the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6134, File 395-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nsupplying the necessary material. The Inspector for the school stresses such work, but we have been unable to secure material from the department, and the Indians are unable to supply it themselves, so we have been forced to neglect such instructions.\n\nI suggest that on the larger reservations the department employ a matron to work in conjunction with the teacher, to co-operate with the parents to encourage the Indians to live cleaner, and to systematically hold sewing classes and see that instructions are carried out. This combined with the cooperation of the Mounted Police will undoubtedly prove very beneficial. A few of the Indians have sewing machines, but all are more or less in a broken condition. I suggest the department purchase two sewing machines for the use of this reserve.\n\nIf funds could be supplied to employ a suitable instructor, quilt work, basket work, bead work and braid bark work could be taught, and the articles they make be offered for sale, helping these Indians to be self-supporting.\n\nOn this reserve, the Indians have\nconstructed in spare time, a good log building, two storeys high and which is 30 by 40 feet in size, with the hope that the department would consider using it for a hospital.\n\nThe question of drinking water on the reserve is of utmost importance. At present the water tastes so bad that one can hardly drink it without it turning the stomach. We go out about 600 feet on the bay for it, but it is terrible. There is no well on the reserve and I suggest the department have two wells dug to serve the twenty-five families living here.\n\nWith regards to your 'Follow-Up System', I am enclosing a list of the names of pupils who have left school since I was appointed teacher and hope what information I have and send will be of use to you.\n\nI trust you will give these suggestions your kind consideration.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I received the cheque for janitor work on Nov. 15.\n\nWill you kindly investigate this matter at your earliest convenience, and oblige,\n\nYours very Truly,\n(Miss) Dorcas M. Ross\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss Doreen M. Ross requesting payment for her services as teacher of the Gull Bay school for the first two weeks of July, 1938.\n\nOur files have been carefully reviewed and no record can be found of your having advised us that this school was open from July 1 to 15.\n\nPlease let me know if Mrs. Reed taught the Pic school to July 15 and also the date on which she began duties at the Gull Bay school.\n\nAs we had no intimation from you that these schools were being kept open for the first two weeks in July the salary of Mrs. Reed as teacher of the Gull Bay school was paid from September 1.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJanuary 13, 1939\n\nAttention - Supt. of Welfare & Training\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of January 10th, file 9-2-1, in connection with a request from Miss D. M. Ross, for her services at the Gull Bay School from July 1st to 15th, 1938, I beg to report that Miss Ross taught this period at the Gull Bay school and Mrs. Reed did not commence her duties until Sept. 15th, as was shown on the quarterly reports submitted to the Department for the quarter ending September 30th.\n\nI was under the impression that, as authorization was obtained in 1937 to have this school remain open until July 15th and re-open Sept. 15th, as requested by the Gull Bay band, that this procedure would be followed each year. As Mrs. Reed's report for September showed only fifteen days employment and as a report was forwarded the Department for Miss Ross's time in July, I am at a loss to understand why the Department paid Mrs. Reed for a full month in September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant in which you advise that the Gull Bay and Pic schools were open during the first two weeks of July.\n\nWith reference to the last part of your letter it is easy to understand why Mrs. Reed was paid for the full month of September. As you are aware we do not await receipt of the returns before issuing cheques. All teachers of Indian day schools are on the monthly pay list and their cheques are forwarded at the end of each month. As previously pointed out Indian Agents are expected to keep the Department fully informed regarding any school which is not open or is in operation for any other than the regular academic year. Unless Indian Agents comply with these instructions it is not possible for the Department to be certain that all cheques are correctly issued.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Ross had given up duties at the above school on June 30.\n\nI am now informed by the Indian Agent that following the usual practice this school was kept open until July 15 and Miss Ross remained in charge until that date. There is, therefore, a balance due her of $42.50 and cheque for this amount should be issued in her favour and sent to 123 North Archibald St., Fort William, Ontario.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJanuary 19, 1939.\n\nAttention - Supt. of Welfare & Training\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 17, file 9-2-1, in connection with wages due Miss D. M. Ross, former teacher at Gull Bay School.\n\nWith reference to making settlement with Miss Ross, I would be pleased if the department would advise if it would be possible for them, to deduct the fifteen days overpaid Mrs. Reed for September, from her January or February check, and have this amount paid to Miss Ross. If this cannot be done, I would be pleased if the Department would advise what steps should be taken in order that settlement may be made with Miss Ross.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 24, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant arrangements are being made to forward Miss Ross a cheque for her services for the period she was in charge of the Gull Bay school during the month of July, 1938.\n\nAs intimated in my letter of the 17th instant you should, at the end of June each year, forward a statement showing the schools in your Agency at which the summer holidays will be taken from July 15 to September 15.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJuly 26, 1939.\n\nAttention\u2014Chief, Training Division\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 20th, file 9-3-1 in which you direct that Miss Amelia McGuire (Morgens), of the Whitesand Day school submit her resignation, as she has recently been married, may I be informed, please, if this ruling will have any effect upon the continued employment of Mrs. Harriet Reed, Gull Bay Day School.\n\nSome years ago her husband was unable to secure any work and they were about to apply for relief. In the circumstances her employment, to fill an existing vacancy at Heron Bay, was recommended by Mr. D. J. Cowan, the then local member.\n\nMrs. Reed's services have always been most satisfactory, but as she gave birth to a child within the past two or three weeks, we were wondering what the attitude of the Department was, in such cases.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated as Mrs. Reed would have to be given notice before the end of this month, should her services be no longer required.\n\nReferring to Miss McGuire, I have written her asking that she forward her resignation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Burk, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJuly 31, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th instant with reference to Mrs. Reed, teacher of the Gull Bay Indian day school.\n\nI understand from your letter that Mrs. Reed's husband is now employed and is able to support her but you do not state this definitely.

At a later date I will try and get in touch with her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

Burk, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM\n\n20th November, 1939.\n\nThe Deputy Minister.\n\nRe - Teachers for Gull Bay Indian Day School and Whitesand Indian Day School, Port Arthur Agency.\n\nIn Dr. McGill's memorandum of the 16th instant he reports that Mrs. Harriet Reed's husband is working and able to support her and that Miss McGuire (Mrs. A. Donie) is married and her husband is working; also, that neither of these schools was opened this term. In cases of this kind it is suggested that full information be furnished in the first submission because unless it is given the result might prove embarrassing to this office, and others. There is nothing in the two memoranda dated October 20th to indicate the schools had not been opened or that there was any objection whatever to the re-employment of the former teachers.\n\nI understand Indian Agent Burk canvassed the teacher situation carefully and arrived at the opinion it would be difficult to get other teachers, particularly at this late season of the year. About the only hope would be in the event of there being available some persons familiar with the localities, and Mr. Burk is said to have looked into this angle rather closely. Both these women are half-breeds and so far as this office is aware their teaching ability has not been questioned. In view of all the circumstances and the advisability of opening the\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor action as indicated.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6134, File 395-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nschools as quickly as possible it is suggested that the two women be employed until the summer holidays. About that time the Branch should bring up the question of finding persons to take their places.\n\nW.C. Bethune,\nAsst. Private Secretary.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Bethune's memorandum of November 8 with reference to teachers required at the Gull Bay and Whitesand Indian day schools.\n\nI note that the memorandum suggests the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Reed as teacher at Gull Bay. She is a married woman and I understand her husband is able to support her. I may add that when Indian Agent Burk visited the Department recently he stated that Mrs. Reed had given birth to a child last June.\n\nMiss McGuire is mentioned as a possible teacher for the Whitesand school. While she has taught at that school for some years she was married early this spring. Her married name is Mrs. A. Bonie and I understand her husband is working.\n\nIndian Agent Burk did not advise us until the latter part of October that neither of these teachers had resumed duties on September 1 and when we received this information from him the question of appointing new teachers was immediately brought to your attention in my memorandum dated October 30.\n\nI understand that it is not the policy to employ as teachers married women whose husbands are in a position to support them. Besides, in view of the number of qualified teachers at present unemployed it is difficult\nto justify the selection of married women.\n\nTaking everything into consideration I should appreciate your reconsidering the selection of teachers for the two schools mentioned above.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nMinister's Office\n\n8th November, 1939.\n\nThe Deputy Minister.\n\nReferring to Dr. McGill's two memoranda of the 20th ultimo we are advised that Mrs. Harriet Reed, Teacher at the Gull Bay Indian Day School, and Miss McGuire, Teacher at the Whitesand School, are willing to continue on until June. If this is so there is no need to secure anyone else for the time being.\n\nW.C. Bethune,\nAsst. Private Secretary.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nTo note,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Donie.\n\nI realize that the information given in my memorandum of November 16 might have been included in my memorandum of October 20 but at that time I did not consider that there was any likelihood of these teachers desiring re-appointment.\n\nIt was not until the latter part of September when Indian Agent Burk visited the Department that we were aware that both teachers had given up duties at the end of June. At that time Mr. Burk suggested to the officials of the Welfare & Training Division that these teachers be re-appointed but it was pointed out to him that in view of all the circumstances it would not be in the best interests of the children attending these schools to consider such action.\n\nI still feel that new teachers should be secured for both of these schools and I should, therefore, appreciate your kind reconsideration of this matter.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\n30th November, 1939.\n\nThe Deputy Minister.\n\nRe - Teachers for Gull Bay and Whitesand Indian Day Schools.\n\nReferring to Dr. McGill's memorandum of the 25th instant, it will be satisfactory if the Branch is able to secure the services of teachers other than Mrs. Harriet Reed and Mrs. A. Donie. It is, however, desirable that residents of the district be appointed. On this account the matter had better be put up to Indian Agent Burk.\n\nW.C. Bethune,\nAsst. Private Secretary.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nTo note\nOttawa,\nDecember 2, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the teaching services at the Gull Bay and Whitesand Indian day schools the Department has decided that it would not be in the best interests of all parties concerned to again employ Mrs. Harriet Reed and Mrs. A. Donie (Miss McGuire). This decision has been approved by the Minister's office.\n\nI should, therefore, appreciate it if you would make immediate inquiries with a view to securing a qualified teacher for each of these schools. Residents of the district should be nominated if possible. As both of these schools are conducted under Catholic auspices I would suggest that you communicate with Rt. Rev. R.H. Dignan, Bishop of Sault Ste. Marie, North Bay, Ont., with a view to ascertaining if he is aware of any qualified teachers desiring employment. In writing to him you should point out that residents of the district are required.\n\nAs these schools have been closed since last June the Department does not see any necessity of re-opening them until after the Christmas holidays. It should, therefore, be understood that the appointment of the new teachers will date from January 1, 1940.\n\nAs soon as you have received nominations of qualified teachers for these schools you should forward the information to the Department for our consideration. At that time you should give each teacher's name, age, qualifications and experience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nR. A.

Burk,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nOctober 15, 1940.\n\nAttention-Supt. of Welfare & Training Div.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to our verbal conversation of recent date regarding the proposition of appointing a qualified nurse in an Indian Day school, for this term.\n\nAs it is practically impossible to secure qualified teachers at this time, I would strongly recommend that a registered nurse be appointed to the Gull Bay Indian Day school.\n\nThe present Gull Bay teacher could be transferred to the McIntyre Bay school, where there is a vacancy.\n\nThe question of employing a nurse has been discussed very often for this reserve, but unfortunately the funds have not been available.\n\nThe suggestion, as made by me, during my recent visit to Ottawa is as follows. A nurse be employed, who is capable of teaching a certain amount of the school work. This work would be given in the morning and the afternoon would be used for various forms of health training, which I will outline as follows:\n\n1. The proper methods of cooking plain foods, particularly vegetables and soup.\n2. Keeping the body and clothing clean.\n3. Keeping their houses and out-houses clean inside and whitewashed outside.\n4. Instruction in sewing and mending and keeping care of clothing.\n5. Looking after the sick and the isolation of T.B. cases from the other members of the family.\n\nIn addition adult...........\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIn addition, adult classes would be held for mothers and expectant mothers. There is a great deal of training needed here, as the infant mortality is very high.\n\nWe have in view, a nurse, who has had considerable experience with Indians and public health work. She is highly recommended by Dr. J. C. Gillie and the sisters of the St. Joseph's Boarding school. She has nursed and also taught Junior work at this school. Her services could be secured for $100.00 per month, which would include her living and board, $85.00 per teaching month. $5.00 for Janitor service, and the dispensary fee increased from $5.00 to $10.00. I feel certain this small additional cost would more than repay itself, by the decreased number of hospital cases and the unnecessary doctor's fees. It is practically impossible to tell from this office, those cases where a doctor is really necessary. On isolated reserves all the doctor can do, at best, is to bring the patient to the hospital, for treatment. If a nurse were present, all unnecessary expense in sending doctors would be avoided. The doctor would only be called for emergency cases.\n\nThe Gull Bay reserve is isolated some seventy miles from the railroad, and the season of freeze-up is approaching. I would urge that this letter be given prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 23, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant suggesting the appointment of a qualified nurse to be in charge of the Gull Bay Indian Day School during the balance of the present academic year.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to your suggestion but our experience shows that it is seldom successful to expect one person to fill dual positions.\n\nIf you admit the necessity of having a school on this reserve the teacher's work is a full time job and the same applies in the case of a nurse.\n\nYou should continue your efforts to secure a qualified teacher to take charge of the Gull Bay School. I am bringing to the attention of the Assistant Medical Superintendent the desirability of appointing a nurse at Gull Bay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.G.

The way in which Miss Graham has had her regular pupils; the older part-time girls; and the married women, convert old worn-out military clothing into worth-while garments for wear on the reserve deserves special mention.\n\nMr. Agent Burk and I have tried to persuade her to return to Gull Bay next year. That she will do so, however, is not too certain, since the scarcity of qualified teachers is forcing salaries steadily upward.\n\nIt is appreciated that it is difficult for the Department to interfere with the salary schedule, but I was wondering if it would be possible to increase, from five dollars to ten dollars, the allowance made this teacher for the dispensing of medicines. I may say that I enquired as to the amount of time spent by Miss Graham in this dispensary work, and was told that it was unusual if she were allowed to get a full night's sleep during the winter, without someone calling for medicine or attention. She claims to have spent over one hundred hours some months in dispensing medicines or visiting sick Indians. This would make her remuneration for this work about five cents per hour.\n\nI dislike interfering in the question of salaries, as it is none of my business, but having watched the work being done by unqualified teachers in the east, where the teachers were really trying to do their best but were obviously untrained, I would prefer to make it worthwhile for our trained teachers to remain with us.\nOttawa, July 10, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of Inspector Greening's report regarding his visit to the Gull Bay Indian Day School, on June 22. The Inspector reports very favourably on the work of Miss Graham. If you consider it advisable, you might offer her an increase of $5.00 a month for the next teaching year, which will make her salary at the rate of $90.00 per teaching month, plus bonus. As soon as you have an opportunity of speaking to her in regard to the matter, please inform me. You might let me know if we can depend on her continuing in charge of this school for the coming academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nMay 10, 1943.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss Margaret M. Graham, teacher at the Gull Bay Indian day school with regard to the amount of her salary.\n\nMiss Graham was re-engaged last term with the understanding that her salary would be increased from $85.00 to $90.00 per teaching month and in her letter she has advised that her present cheque actually amounts to less than she was receiving last term. This of course may be due to the increased taxation, but I would be pleased if you would forward a statement showing just how the amount is made up in order that I may explain this to her.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMay 17, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Gull Bay Indian Day School No. 395\n\nIt has been decided to increase the salary of the teacher, Miss Margaret M. Graham, from $85.00 to $90.00 a teaching month, effective May 1, 1943.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nMay 17, 1943.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the salary of Miss Margaret M. Graham, teacher of the Gull Bay Indian Day School. If you refer to official letter of July 10, 1942, you will note that at that time you were instructed to speak to Miss Graham regarding her resuming duties during the current academic year and, in that event, it was stated in the letter that she would be allowed $90.00 a teaching month. No reply was received from your office to that communication and consequently the salary of Miss Graham has not been increased. Under present regulations it is not possible to date an increase back to last October and consequently the only action we can take in the matter is to increase her salary to $90.00 a teaching month effective May 1, 1943. Instructions to this effect are being given to the Treasury Branch.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe salary,\n\nI have been going to broach this subject to you for a long time. I returned to Gull Bay last fall, because I was under the impression the salaries were to be raised, but they have not; and after April first, by the new tax rating, my salary will be less than last year.\n\nThe work of the dispensary alone requires hours of duty and usually in the most inclement weather and at all hours of the night, sometimes too.\n\nI know other teachers who are doing Indian work, when I don't think dispensary duties are as heavy, have received the pay we were promised.\n\nI feel unjustly treated when my annual salary is thirty-six dollars ($36) less than other teachers. I trust that this matter will receive your prompt attention and that I receive reimbursement of the shortage due me.\n\nMargarette McClean\n\nGull Bay School, 9-2-1\nvia Mac Cormick, Ont.\nApril 6, 1943.\nOttawa:\nJune 9, 1943.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss Margaretta M. Graham, teacher of the Gull Bay School, stating that she is being paid less than teachers of other Indian day schools in her neighbourhood. I do not know to what school she refers as the salary in effect for her from May 1, namely, $90.00 a teaching month, is more than is paid to any of the other teachers in your Agency. You might so inform her. As far as the coming academic year is concerned, the term will be ten months. This actually means an 11% increase in the salary of all Indian day school teachers.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, July 6, 1943.\n\nMr. J. G. Burk, Indian Agent, Fort Arthur, Ont.\n\nOn June 9 I wrote you regarding the salary of Miss Margaretta M. Graham, teacher of the Gull Bay Indian Day School. I would appreciate your advising if it is Miss Graham's intention to resume duties at this school on September first, next.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt., of Welfare & Training.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJuly 21, 1943.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th inst. file No. 9-2-1 with regard to the Gull Bay Indian day school teacher, I am pleased to advise that Miss Graham has advised it is her intention to return September 1st next.\n\nIt is hoped however, that her salary can increased to $95.00 per teaching month, as Inspector W. J. Greening considers her the best teacher in this District, and with the scarcity of teachers it would be regrettable if she were to resign.\n\nJ.G.

Renton and he advises it\nwill be in order for you or Cst. Gamble to accompany me to\nthe reservation next Tuesday morning Oct.12th.\n\nIt is my intention to leave here Oct.12th in\ncompany with Magistrate J.A.R. MacNaig by car and will contact\nyou at Nipigon.\n\nIf the above meets with your approval will you\nkindly advise me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) J.G. Burk, Indian Agent.\n\nWhile in telephone conversation with Mr. Burk on the\n8th instant in connection with other matters, the above was\ndiscussed. He advised that the complaint involved some damage\nto the Indian Dept. School at Gull Bay and an alleged assault\non the school teacher. He judged from her letter that the\nguilty parties were known by her and could be identified, so\nhe was taking the Magistrate to the reservation in order that\nthe matter could be disposed of at once.\n\nOn the 10th instant a telegram was rec'd from Mr. Burk\nadvising that plans had been changed to the 13th for the trip,\nproceeding via railway to MacDairmid rather than auto.\n\nA.M. of 13th accompanied by S/Cst. D.Morrisseau the\nwriter proceeded via CNR to MacDairmid where Mr. Burk was\ncontacted. Patrol immediately proceeded via Indian Dept. boat\nto Gull Bay Reservation, accompanied by Magistrate LeMay and\nMr. Burk.\n\nOn arrival at Gull Bay at 1 p.m., Miss GRAHAM was inter-\nviewed. She stated that at approx 9 or 10 p.m. of 30-9-43\nwhile she had been in the classroom she had heard something\nhitting the outside wall of the school and the backdoor.\nWhen she went out the door to investigate, she was hit on the\neye by an article that appeared to have been thrown. The only\narticles she could find afterwards were a door scraper (foot)\nand a small piece of lead, about half an inch square. She\nran after the culprits to try and identify them but was only\nable to discern that there were 3 men or boys and saw nothing\nthat would enable her to identify them. In all the damage\namounted to 3 panes of glass, 10\" x 10\" in school windows\nbroken, one door panel loosened, one of the lens of Miss\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6134, File 395-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMiss GRAHAM'S eyeglasses were broken and she suffered max surface cuts on left eyelids. Miss GRAHAM was of the opinion that she was accidentally hit rather than with intent, the article with which she was hit probably being thrown at the school door, but intercepted by herself as she stepped out. She visited homes on the reserve and by the process of elimination believes the following persons are responsible:- Pat HAGLJIAK, Gilbert HAGLJIAK and Sam BERNARD as they were not at home and all turned up together shortly afterwards at the Hudson Bay Post. These persons are not pupils of the school and range from 16 to 21 years of age. There are also 2 other persons who she was not sure of being on the reserve namely:- Abel BOUCHARD and Francis NAWLA.\n\nMiss GRAHAM's statement reads as follows:\n\nI, Miss Graham, hereby state that on evening of Thursday Sept.30th, when I was in the classroom someone threw something against the school twice. One object sounded like the footscraper. About half an hour later there was more banging. Then when I went to go out from the classroom door, an obstacle struck me, breaking my glasses. My face was cut in three places and my eye badly discolored. I chased the culprits, there were 3 of them. Then I went to the HAGLJIAK home. Pat and Gilbert were not there. When I went to Sam BERNARD'S home he was not there.\n\nMr. Macaulay, the Hudson Bay Factor stated that these 3 boys were in his store that night.\n\nAll the boys from the north side of the reserve were at their homes or visiting with their neighbors. Therefore there were only 5 who were not at home. I did not find out where Francis NAWLA was that night nor if Abel BOUCHARD and Norman BOUCHARD were on the Reserve that night.\n\n(Margaret MacGraham)\n\nAll persons mentioned in Miss GRAHAM'S statement were not on the reserve, since having left to work in Camps of Pigeon Tbr-Cor, some 4 or 5 miles distance. Due to the fact that Magistrate LeMay wished to return same date and the boat was leaving, these persons could not be interviewed by this patrol. However a meeting was called of all the grown-ups on the reserve. No information was forthcoming from them as to the identity of the perpetrators. They were addressed by both the Magistrate and Mr. Burk on the importance of the school and instructed that they as parents should maintain sufficient discipline over their children to see that such things did not happen.\n\nPatrol returned to MacDairmid and thence to Nipigon, leaving Gull Bay at approx 3 p.m. same date.\n\nFurther patrol will be made to Gull Bay at first opportunity for the purpose of interviewing those mentioned in Miss GRAHAM'S statement and further this investigation.

Further to the marginally noted C.R. under the above heading, I have to report that on the 4th instant, Mr. Burk, Indian Agent, Fort Arthur, Ont., was contacted by telephone and arrangements made whereby the writer and S/Cst. D. Morriseau would patrol via Indian Dept. boat from MacDairmid to Gull Bay in a.m. of the 5th instant for the purpose of furthering this investigation.\n\n2. Early a.m. of 5-11-43, the writer accompanied by S/Cst. Morriseau proceeded to MacDairmid with the Game Warden via his auto transport, gratis. On arrival the Captain of Indian Dept. boat was contacted and he advised that due to rough weather he would be unable to proceed to Gull Bay that date, but would pick us up in MacDairmid in a.m. of 6-11-43. At 9 a.m. of 6-11-43 patrol continued to Gull Bay via Indian Dept. boat.\n\n3. On arrival at Gull Bay Indian Reserve same date, Pat and Gilbert Nawhiijik, suspects in this connection were sought out and interrogated individually. Pat Nawgiijik stated that he had not been near the school the night the school teacher had had her glasses broken. He maintained that the only place he had been other than his home was at the Hudson Bay store, which is situated at least \u00bd mile from the school, and that he had been accompanied there by one Alex Dubiskopens and a Sam Bernard. No information of assistance could be gained from him.\n\n4. Gilbert Nawhiijik stated that he had spent the entire evening at the home of Martin Nawia playing cards with the Nawia children and that he had not been near the school. Persistent questioning failed to divulge any information of value from him.\n\n5. Sam Bernard, another suspect mentioned by the teacher was not available for questioning, being absent from the reserve, setting out trap lines and not expected to return for at least 3 weeks. Alex Dubiskopens was also absent being similarly engaged.\n\n6. Mr. McCaulley, Hudson Bay Factor, was interviewed and he stated that he recalled Pat Nawgiijik, Alex Dubiskopens and Sam Bernard having been in his store the night in question but was unable to set the time. The store usually closes at approx. 8 or 9:30 p.m.\n\n7. On 7-11-43 investigation continued and the home of Martin Nawia was visited. Martin Nawia and his son Paul, mentioned by the school teacher as a suspect, were not at home being away on trap lines and not expected back for 3 weeks.\n\nCONT'D PAGE (2)\n7. (continued) A daughter, Jean WAWIA, approx. 20 years of age was at home with several younger children. She was questioned and stated that Gilbert NAWIGIJIK had been at their home on the night that the school teacher had had her glasses broken. He had been with Alex DUBISIERS and that they had left shortly before midnight. She was unable to state the time of their arrival but as DUBISIERS had also been in the Hudson Bay store it would appear that it might have been after the time set by the school teacher at which her glasses were broken. She further stated that her brother Francis WAWIA had not been on the reserve that night, having been away with her father.\n\n8. P.M. of 7-11-43 patrol left Gull Bay to proceed to MacDairmid but after proceeding approx 12 miles we were forced to anchor in shelter to weather a severe blizzard, remaining there until the a.m. of 9-11-43 at which time we continued to MacDairmid, returning to the detachment via gratis livery in late P.M. same date.\n\n9. While in MacDairmid on 9-11-43 Abel and Norman BOUCHRED, other persons suspected by the school teacher were located and interviewed. Both stated that they had not been near the reserve on the night in question having been in their winter camp, approx 4\u00bd miles from the school.\n\n10. On 7-11-43 while at the Reserve patrol checked the school and it was found that only 2 panes of glass had been broken rather than the 3 previously reported by Miss Graham. Miss Graham was re-interviewed and questioned. She stated that she had been under the impression that 3 panes of glass had been broken but had since observed that there were only two. It was further learned from her that one of the windows had been broken the Saturday previous to Sept.30th and the other on the Sunday following Sept.30th. It was also gathered that the door panel had been knocked previous to Sept.30th. Questioned more closely as to how her glasses had been broken, Miss Graham admitted that she couldn't swear that it was done by a thrown article and conceded that she might have broken them by running into the foot scrapper had it been hanging on the porch support outside the door through which she stepped when investigating the noises she had heard.\n\n11. The Indians interviewed maintained that one of the windows was broken a considerable time ago, having been done by a painter pushing his brush through it. They also claimed that Miss GRAHAM had told several different stories the night her glasses were broken, the first to the effect that she had been hit by some boys and her glasses broken, 2nd that some boys had thrown a rock throw a window where she was sitting and broke her glasses and 3rd that some boys had been teasing her and had broken her glasses with a stick.\n\n12. Information was received that Miss GRAHAM attempts to keep the children off the school grounds after school is over and that some of the older boys are inclined to tease her because of this and it is believed that probably some of the boys did make a noise outside the school on night of Sept.30th to attract her attention, but that she broke her glasses by running into some object rather than by anything thrown by them.\n\n13. During the course of this enquiry S/Cst. KORRISEAU carries on general conversation with the majority of the Indians on the reserve and he states that there appears to be a general feeling of resentment among the Indians against Miss Graham, due, according to them to her inquisitiveness into their personal affairs and her officious attitude towards the people on the reserve. This attitude on the part of the Indians would cause...\n13. (cont'd) cause them to shield anyone of their number that Miss GRAHAM attempted to get into trouble.\n\n14. From the foregoing it would appear difficult to establish an 'offence' let alone securing sufficient evidence to prosecute the alleged offenders, in view of which investigation will be considered closed, unless otherwise instructed.\n\nCONCLUDED - F.I.U.\n\nEXP. INC.\n\nThe O.C., \"D\" Division,\nR.C.M.P. Police, Winnipeg.\n\nFORWARDED 12-11-43. Para's 10 and 11 are most significant with respect to the question of an offence herein. By reason of the fact that the complaint has not maintained a story consistent with the surrounding facts and particularly in view of what the Indians have stated in regard to the windows having been broken previous to the alleged offence, it would seem that we would be justified in making a file closure as hereunder shown.\n\nCOMPLAINT UNFOUNDED\n\nSupt.,\nO.

Greening's Report as Inspector of the Gull Bay School on June 17, 1944.\n\nIt is no easy matter, however, in these days when schools which used to pay seven or eight hundred are now offering twelve, thirteen and fourteen hundred, and when schools at twelve hundred and fifty, quite near large centres, are going a-begging.\n\nAnd so I was wondering whether the Indian schools Branch could make the proposition more attractive to her. I do not know whether she is already receiving the maximum salary allowed for her school. If she is, perhaps a little increase in the allowance for sick care might be managed.\n\nAny increase, however small, if in reason, might suffice. It is not so much the extra money, though that is quite an attraction, but the feeling that one's services are really appreciated by those ghostly \"powers-that-be\".\n\nSuch a small mark of appreciation would beat all hollow all the blandishments of Mr. Agent Burk and myself, but if anything is to be done it ought to be done rather quickly, before some other school snaps her up.\n\nPP\n\n28/6/44\nOttawa, June 29, 1944.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk, Indian Agent, Fort Arthur, Ontario,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Greening's report on his visit to the Gull Bay Day School on June 17th.\n\nAs regards the salaries being paid in certain white schools they are somewhat higher than we are paying in Indian Day schools. However, it should be kept in mind that a bonus is paid at the rate of seventeen percent. I trust that you have given this information to Inspector Greening as payment of the bonus makes the salary much larger than it appears if you only consider the basic salary.\n\nI understand from Inspector Greening that Miss Graham has done exceptionally good work. You will realize that it is rather difficult for us to increase the salary of one school without giving consideration to the others. However, it has been decided to allow Miss Graham an increase of $5.00 a teaching month making her salary at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month effective from September 1, 1944. In addition there will be the bonus of seventeen percent making her total salary $117.00. Of course, you will realize that there will be the usual deductions for income tax, etc.\n\nI trust that Miss Graham will decide to resume duties at the Gull Bay Day School for the academic year 1944-45.\n\nR.A.

The Hudson's Bay Co. have a fine store about a half a mile from the school. Gull Bay Reserve, where the school is located, is about 67 miles, by water, (Lake Nipigon) from MacDiarmid, which is a fishing village on the C.N.R. to the east of Port Arthur. It is a beautiful boat trip up Lake Nipigon to this reserve. There are quite a number of lumber camps operating in the area of the reserve which help remove the feeling of isolation. Our previous teacher, (Mrs. Martin) who left to get married spent six years at this school and liked it there very much.\n\nI am looking forward to your further advice on this prospective teacher and hope you are successful in persuading her to accept the appointment.\n\nJ.J. Burk, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, July 11th, 1947.\n\nDear Mrs. Sharette:\n\nI desire to refer to my letter of the 8th instant with reference to appointment as teacher in an Indian day school. At the present time we have two schools vacant as follows:\n\n(1) Gull Bay School, in the Port Arthur Agency. This school is in good repair and furnished living quarters are next to the building.

It seems evident that this school has deteriorated in a short time under this teacher. It appears that she is not a very strong teacher and some thought will have to be given to the problem of whether we should consider paying her again next year.

Father Rolland has just returned from a trip into that area and he was informed to that effect. Consequently, will you please make a note of this forthcoming vacancy and do what you can to ensure a replacement for Mrs. Sharette reports to this school for the coming September term.\n\nWe might add that although Mrs. Sharette has shown some improvement in her teaching over last year, she has not attained the standard desired as yet. It is hoped that her successor will be more competent. The attendance at this school is not heavy, usually averaging around twenty pupils, mostly in the lower grades.\n\nJ.G.

She is a nervous and excitable type and is sincere in her efforts to make a success of her new position. She is qualified and has the necessary experience. There are only a few pupils in attendance as the main body of the Indians is not yet moved over to Gull Bay from the town of MacDiarmid.\n\nSITUATION OF SCHOOL - This school is situated on Lake Nipigon and is quite isolated. There is a new logging road to within three miles of the school but supplies all have to come across the lake from MacDiarmid. The mail is sent in care of R. Mills Store at this point.\n\nThe Hudson's Bay store has been moved to within a mile of the school and this provides a source of supply for the teacher as well as social company.\n\nSCHOOL BUILDING - This is the standard 1930 design with attached teacher's residence. It has a full basement with a furnace in poor repair. The chimney is also in need of renovation. The teacherage has two bedrooms upstairs with a living-room and kitchen downstairs. We are providing new furniture and this should be a comfortable little school when the renovations are completed. It will need painting or lining with insul brick next year.\n\nCLASSROOM ACTIVITIES - Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the inspection of this school due to the fact that weather conditions prevented our stay. I was accompanied by the Provincial School Inspector Mr. Greening, and it was evident that Mrs. Kibbee should do a good job if she will show a little more patience with the children. We spent some time discussing classroom problems and she seemed relieved by the advise we were able to give her.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMr. John N.

Q.\n\nDear Mr. Kearns:\n\nI have for answer your letter of June 7 concerning the Gull Bay Indian Day School, which has been on my desk for some time during my absence on an inspection trip.\n\nUnfortunately, Civil Service regulations do not permit the payment of salaries of employees reporting to a position for the first time.\n\nIt is not wholly necessary that you go through a training school and this suggestion was advanced merely to indicate that there is a future with the Department once you start working towards a teaching certificate. Naturally, if you had a teaching certificate your salary would be very much higher than that which we can offer you without a teaching certificate.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot guarantee the payment of any money to you before you report for duty on the first of September.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard T.

Kearns, I wish to state that the young man was with us at Quebec three years, during which he acquired the esteem of his teachers as well as his fellow-students. He is intelligent, a hard worker, trustworthy and honest. His behaviour was beyond reproach, and his jolly dispositions attracted many friends. Had he remained to pass the final exams, he could have obtained the degree Bachelor of Arts.\n\nI can fully recommend him as a reliable catholic. His suitability for teaching is indicated by the fact that the Eudist Fathers (a teaching Order) had accepted him for that kind of work.\n\nHoping he will live up to my opinion of him,\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

He left us of his own accord, stating his was not the Eudistic vocation. As regards conduct we have had nothing with which to reproach him. As regards studies, he has given us satisfaction.\n\nJ.-B. Faquet, C.J.M.\nSuperior.\nJuly 12, 1949.\n\nMr. John N. Kearns,\n129 Claire Fontaine,\nQuebec, P. Q.\n\nGull Bay Indian Day School\n\nDear Mr. Kearns:\n\nI have received letters from the Benedict Fathers verifying your references. I do hope you will find it possible to accept this teaching position at Gull Bay. I realize your expenses will be high for the start but feel that in the long run, you will be starting in a new career in the teaching profession.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr Bernard F. Leary,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter received. Thanks for answers to my query. I hope you have continued with my application for the Indian Post Office Schools. I am glad enough of the work (and experience), and still wish to find out what it entails.\n\nThanking you again for your thoughtful answer, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\nThomas M. Keene\nJuly 21, 1949.\n\nMr. Thomas McKeone,\n7 Wellesley Place,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. McKeone:\n\nI have received your letter of July 20th and would ask you to write at once for details concerning the Gull Bay Indian Day School to Mr. J.G. Burk, Supt. of Indian Agency, Port Arthur, Ont.\n\nWe also have a position open in the Fort Frances Agency at the Seine River School. Would you please write to the following address for details of this position: Mr. J.F. Lockhart, Supt. of Indian Agency, Fort Frances, Ont.\n\nI am sending both Mr. Burk and Mr. Lockhart a copy of this letter so that they will expect to hear from you concerning these two teaching positions.\n\nIn conclusion may I say that there are 16 children in Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 at the Gull Bay School and 24 children in Grades 1, 2, and 3 at the Seine River School.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6134, File 395-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nJuly 21, 1949.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nGull Bay Indian Day School\n\nI have been able to interest a qualified teacher in this school, but wish to get further details concerning it before proceeding further with her application.\n\nShe is a married woman and has three children. Would the residence be satisfactory for her and do you consider that this school is too isolated for such a teacher? I have also been in correspondence with a man, Mr. McKeone in Toronto, and he will be writing to you about this position.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent, Indian Education.\n\nBFN: MMoN\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nRe: Gull Bay I.D.S.\nLetter July 21,\nFile 395-1 (E)\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter as above regarding the Gull Bay Indian Day School.\n\nI have discussed the matter of a teacher for this school with Mr. Greening, and he advised as it is rather an isolated place, it would be rather awkward for a woman with three children, especially in case of sickness. On the other hand, it might be somewhat difficult for an Englishman just out from the old country. However, if you send us either of these teachers, we shall do our best to make them comfortable and happy. Of the two, I would prefer Mr. McKeone.\n\nJ.G. Burk,\nSuperintendent.\nPORT ARTHUR, Ont.,\n11th August, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nFort William Mission Day School,\nGull Bay Day School,\nMobert (Pie) Day School.\n\nMay orders be placed for Health Biscuits for the above schools for shipment directly to the teachers.\n\nAt Fort William Day School, an enrolment of 20 is anticipated, at Gull Bay and Mobert Schools we expect there will be 25 and 28 to enroll, respectively.\n\nThe subject of a replacement for Mr. Jos Douglas at the Mobert school has been dealt with in a previous letter, but in the event of no teacher being available our request can be disregarded. As this school is in tip-top shape, and the pupils have made good progress, it would be regrettable indeed if no teacher is available.\n\nI have communicated with Mr. J. Sharette, the teacher of our Gull Bay School for this term, and have advised her I will meet her at Orient Bay and escort her on to Gull Bay on our Boat the Keego.\n\nJ.G.

We note that his services can be obtained at the rate of $40 per teaching month. The Department will allow him salary at that rate during the period he has the school in operation. You may, therefore, make the necessary arrangements to have this school reopened at the earliest possible date.\n\nShould any minor repairs or cleaning of the old building be required, you may arrange to have the work carried out, keeping all expenses for the purpose as low as possible.\n\nYou should forward a requisition at an early date for any supplies or furnishings that may be required, and only the supplies absolutely necessary should be asked for.\n\nA requisition should also be forwarded for the classroom supplies considered necessary.\n\nShould it be necessary to purchase fuel, you may arrange to have the quantity required supplied.\n\nAccounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering all expenditures incurred.\n\nYour recommendation that a new school building be erected at this point similar to the one that the Department erected on the Pic Reserve has been noted. An item will be included in our estimates for the next fiscal year to provide the funds required for the purpose.\n\nPlease inform the Department when you have concluded arrangements for the reopening of the school and state the date when the teacher began duties. This matter should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nActing Asst.

Couture, appointed Miss Florence Morriseau as teacher of the Gull Bay Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Morriseau, with salary at the rate of $40 per teaching month. We understand that she is an eighteen year old Indian girl, who attended the Lake Helen Indian Day School, and that she has no special qualifications. Her retention in the position will depend entirely upon the success with which she meets in the work, and on the occasion of your next visit to Gull Bay, you should report on the success which she is accomplishing.

I did not think it advisable to return this report to the Gull Bay Reserve, as the only mode of transportation from MacDiarmid to the Gull Bay Reserve, a distance of 80 miles, is by dog team and it is extremely doubtful when the report would be returned to this office.\n\nFor the teacher's assistance in making out the report I sent her a duplicate copy from the Lake Helen Indian Day School, but apparently the instructions were not carried out carefully. I expect to visit the Gull Bay Indian Reserve by dog team during the next 6 weeks and will bring this matter to the teacher's attention.\n\nI would be pleased if the teacher's cheque will be sent in care of this office, as I have already advanced her supplies of food amounting to $40.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Brown\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 22, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 13th instant relative to the erection of a new school and teacher's residence on the Gull Bay Reserve, I beg to say that as the school at this point has not been in operation for sometime, it is considered that it might first be advisable to conduct a summer school with a view to ascertaining whether the Indians would take advantage of the opportunity and have their children attend regularly. We will have no funds next summer with which to erect a building at this point, but, if a suitable house could be obtained in which to carry on classroom activities, we would be prepared to provide for the salary of a teacher and the other necessary expense in conducting a summer school. You might give the matter of a summer school at this point your consideration and report later as to whether you would advise that same be conducted or not and also as to what accommodation could be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWhen visiting the Gull Bay Reserve last July the Indians asked that the School be re-opened, in fact they have been pressing for this for sometime, and one has only to visit this reserve to see the necessity for it. There are about 35 children of school age running around like little wild animals with no restraint upon them whatever, and their parents declare they have no control over them. The little old building that was formerly used as a school house is quite unsuitable to re-open a school in as it is much too small and beyond repair and has no accommodation for a teacher. What is required is a building similar to the one erected this year at Heron Bay which combines a School house and Teachers' residence, and cost about $5,500.00, and is a credit to those concerned in its construction. It has been economically built. The cost of a similar building at Gull Bay would be somewhat greater as all materials would have to be transported up the Lake from the Railway about 50 miles.\n\nIf the Foreman-Carpenter who built the Heron Bay School was given a similar job at Gull Bay it would be erected with due economy as his work proved to be very satisfactory.\n\nA proper person at this Reserve as Teacher would have a good effect upon the Indians generally as they are getting rather out of hand, making \"Home Brew\", etc., and the Agent requires some one he can trust to advise him from time to time of how the Indians are behaving and to issue rations.\n\nAs these Indians live by hunting and fishing their children require only an Indian Day School Education.\n\nI promised the Indians to lay this matter before you, and I hope that provision will be made in the next Estimates.\n\nChief Accountant.\nOttawa, September 20, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 15th inst., enclosing communications signed by the chief and councillors of the Gull Bay Band requesting that the school be reopened on the Gull Bay Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your recommendation that a temporary school be opened for the coming winter months at this point is approved, and you may arrange to obtain the services of the Indian referred to by you as teacher. We note that his services can be obtained at the rate of $40 per teaching month. The Department will allow him salary at that rate during the period he has the school in operation. You may, therefore, make the necessary arrangements to have this school reopened at the earliest possible date.\n\nShould any minor repairs or cleaning of the old building be required, you may arrange to have the work carried out, keeping all expenses for the purpose as low as possible.\n\nYou should forward a requisition at an early date for any supplies or furnishings that may be required, and only the supplies absolutely necessary should be asked for.\n\nA requisition should also be forwarded for the classroom supplies considered necessary.\n\nShould it be necessary to purchase fuel, you may arrange to have the quantity required supplied.\n\nAccounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering all expenditures incurred.\n\nYour recommendation that a new school building be erected at this point similar to the one that the Department erected on the Pic Reserve has been noted. An item will be included in our estimates for the next fiscal year to provide the funds required for the purpose.\n\nPlease inform the Department when you have concluded arrangements for the reopening of the school and state the date when the teacher began duties. This matter should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

(RG 10, Volume 6134, File 395-5, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI have your 921 of the 20th inst., relative to previous correspondence regarding a communication received from the Chief and Councillors of the Gull Bay Band, requesting the Department to reopen the school on the Gull Bay Indian Reserve. In reply I beg to advise that I am enclosing herewith list of children of school age, and would be very pleased if you would forward school supplies for 31 pupils to the following address: J. G. Burk, Indian Agent, Supplies for Gull Bay Day School, MacDiarmid, Ontario, via C. N. R.\n\nReferring to the second paragraph of your letter I note it will be in order to appoint Joe Esquimaux as temporary teacher on the Gull Bay Reserve at $40.00 per teaching month.\n\nAll minor repairs and cleaning of the old school building will be kept as low as possible.\n\nI would be pleased if the Department would rush the school supplies as soon as possible as the teacher is anxious to reopen the school on the 1st of the month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nApril 24, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. PAGET\nand\nMR. ORR.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Burk, of Port Arthur, writes that the foreman contractor he engaged to build the Pic school and teacher's residence last year is contemplating moving to Calgary unless he is sure of a summer's work at Port Arthur. Would you please indicate if Mr. Burk's handling of the building activity last year was satisfactory. If so, I propose recommending to Dr. Scott that he be authorized to erect the Sand Point and Gull Bay school buildings, by day labour, under the supervision of the same foreman.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nSir:\n\nWith reference to earlier correspondence and conversations when you were in Ottawa last week, I have now to authorize you to erect a classroom and teacher's residence at Gull Bay and also Sand Point. The work may be proceeded with when timely. The Department relies on you to supervise the activity and to see that there is no unnecessary expenditure.\n\nYou should purchase the materials required, after securing competitive prices from the best sources of supply. When forwarding properly certified accounts, in duplicate, in favour of the firms awarded the business, you should attach memoranda showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted. The bill of material and your experience last year in connection with the Pie Indian Bay School should guide you as to what is required. I understand that the Department Architect has provided you with specifications and has given you his advice.\n\nYou may engage the services of a competent foreman-carpenter, who will be responsible for the erection of the buildings and who will be paid by the day. Indian and other local labour should be employed as far as possible. Labour returns, in duplicate, should be prepared, as usual. When timely, you may apply for an accountable cheque, with which to pay for the labour, and also for a supply of labour returns. The plans which were forwarded to you last year should be followed as closely as possible.\n\nWhen these two buildings are being constructed, you should visit the work when possible for the purpose of overseeing the activity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The material for this school was shipped to Orient Bay where same was loaded into scows and towed to Gull Bay Reserve\u2014a distance of 72 miles. The loading and reloading of lumber and freight charges increased the cost of building this school.\n\nOwing to Gull Bay being very shallow the lumber was unloaded a mile from shore and transported in small boats to the Reserve, and then hauled by wagon to the school site, which also increased the expense.\n\nThe sand and gravel was obtained 7 miles from the Reserve and conveyed to the school site in canoes.\n\nI have been unable to secure accounts from C.

Cox for one scow load of lumber towed from Orient Bay to Gull Bay, but will send in this account as soon as possible.\n\nAs you will note by the enclosed voucher there is a balance of $274.40 still owing the contractor for wages. I would be pleased if the Department would mail a cheque covering this amount at their earliest possible convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

Removing the old log schoolhouse $25.00, grading the school grounds, approximately $75.00.\n\nI would be pleased to receive the necessary permission to make the above mentioned improvements at the Department's earliest convenience.\n\nNavigation will, no doubt, open on Lake Nipigon by the 15th of this month, and as I expect to visit Gull Bay by the first boat, I would appreciate the Department's views on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In this connection I have to say that our funds for the present fiscal year are extremely limited and the above work will, therefore, have to stand over until next year. You might draw this matter to the attention of the Department again early in the Spring of 1931.\n\nI have also your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to the request of the teacher to be furnished with garden seeds, garden tools, supplies for the teacher's living quarters and screens for the doors and windows. In this connection I have to say that the Department is doubtful as to the success of a garden at this school. I would point out that the school will be closed for the summer holidays during the two months when the garden would require the most attention. As our funds are extremely limited, I should be pleased if you would prepare another list of supplies for the teacher's living quarters, requesting only those items which are absolutely needed. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of window screens for the school and teacher's residence, and screens for the porch door. No unnecessary expense, however, should be incurred, and an account, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the cost.\n\nA football and a softball and bat will be ordered here and sent to the teacher's address, also a supply of tooth brushes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

As the hunting is almost exhausted in this agency, through bush fires and also the increased timber and mining activities, it is almost impossible for the Indians to make a living.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe question of drinking water on this reserve is of utmost importance. At present the water tastes so bad that one can hardly drink it without it turning the stomach. We go out about 600 feet on the bay for it, but it is terrible. There is no well on the reserve and I suggest the department have two wells dug to serve the twenty-five families living here.\n\nDoreen M. Ross.\nOttawa, May 5th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nIn replying to a recent letter I directed to all teachers of Indian day schools, Miss D. M. Ross, teacher of the Gull Bay Indian Day School, requests that some provision be made for a supply of drinking water.\n\nIt appears that she has to secure her water from the bay and, at the present time, the taste of this water is very objectionable. Do you consider it possible to secure proper water if a well is dug at this school? If so, let me have an estimate of the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey.\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nMay 15, 1937.\n\nAttention-Supt. Welfare & Training\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, file No. 9-2-1, in connection with a letter from Miss D. M. Ross requesting that some provision be made for the supply of drinking water at the Gull Bay Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I wish to report that it is impossible to drink the Lake water until it has been strained and allowed to settle, owing to the shallowness of the Lake at that point.\n\nThe ground formation consists of 12 ft. of sandy loam, and at this depth weeping clay is encountered and it is very difficult to make any kind of an accurate estimate as to the cost of sinking crib work etc. to permit the digging of a well. However, I would suggest that the sum of $100.00 be authorized to cover approximately 30 ft. of crib work etc. and the purchase of an inexpensive pump and fittings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 20th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to making provision for a supply of drinking water at the Gull Bay Indian Day School.\n\nOur experience regarding the digging of wells has been rather unfortunate. In many cases, considerable sums have been expended without an adequate supply being secured.\n\nUnless you can assure us that a supply of drinking water can be secured for the Gull Bay School at a cost not exceeding $100.00, the Department will be unable to authorize your proceeding with this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. G.

H. Reed, of the Pic Indian Day School, however, advised as her attendance averages around 36 pupils, the amount of $5.00 is not sufficient to supply each child throughout the month with a noonday lunch.\n\nI would be very pleased if the Department would authorize at least $10.00 per month for the Pic School and $5.00 for the balance of the schools above mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.G.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ.G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nNov., 10th, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nAttention School Branch\n\nI would be pleased to receive the necessary authorization to purchase Christmas gifts for the school children at the following schools: Mission Bay, Whitesand, Gull Bay, McIntyre Bay, Pic, Mobert, Lake Helen, and Martin Falls Day Schools. The cost of these gifts would amount to approximately $75.00 for each of the schools, with the exception of Pic School, which would be $10.00. This school has an exceptionally large attendance, thus it is necessary to provide a larger grant.\n\nAs some of the schools, especially those on Lake Nipigon, are isolated, it will be necessary to ship in the gifts before the freezeup, I would be pleased if authorization could be obtained as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Bung,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

School\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo, file 1941E-Ont., regarding school repairs etc., I beg to enclose herewith requisition covering the material required, for the above noted school.\n\nLabor, to paint and make the necessary repairs should not exceed an amount of $100.00 and I would be pleased if the Department would forward and advance cheque for this amount.\n\nI might add, that for the past four years appropriation for repairs to the various day schools in this agency, has been requested, in our estimates, but up to the present time, very little has been authorized. The Pic, Mobert, McIntyre Bay, and particularly the Gull Bay school, urgently require painting outside and kalsomining inside, as well as repairs to the windows, doors etc. I would therefore request that repairs, painting etc. be authorized this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Due to the urgency of the matter, at the time it was possible only to make a very rough estimate, and as it turned out, the Mobert school only cost $21.35, but the Gull Bay school has cost $139.20, however, with careful supervision on the total cost of the repairing, painting and draining, at each of these schools, I believe it will be possible to keep within the balance now on hand.\n\nThe high cost of doing this work at the Gull Bay school, was due to the fact that the soil surrounding the school is a type of weeping clay and it was found that before any excavating could be done it was necessary to cut timbers and brace the walls of the ditch or drain. In addition it was necessary to remove a large quantity of silt and debris from the basement itself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

It is anticipated there will be an attendance of approximately sixty-five (65) at this school.\n\nIt is also trusted that the health biscuits from George Weston Biscuit Co. in Toronto, which were made available to our schools last year, will be similarly available this year, as the school teachers report favourably on the benefits derived from the biscuits.\n\nJ.G.

Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo regarding the amount authorized for noon-day meals at the schools in your agency, I feel that the amounts authorized should be sufficient.\n\nIn view of the payment of Family Allowances, it is reasonable to suppose that the Indians are in a better position to provide adequate food for their children and in many cases should be able to supply them with some lunch to take to school for the noon meal. Consequently, it is not considered necessary to allow any large amount for noon-day lunch purposes.\n\nBernard F.

Father Richard states that the Indians would be willing to put up a schoolhouse if the Department would pay the teacher. These Indians are an off-shoot of the Garden River Band, but as that Band is already heavily taxed for educational purposes, I do not think that their funds could stand any additional drain.

Indian School, on her arrival here and learning the accommodation which she would have and the difficulty of access to the place as it would at least cost her ten dollars for a team to take her there, she decided to return home as she seemed to have a very different conception of the place as that appeared to be a misunderstanding as to surroundings &c. She rather blamed me for not giving her more definite information regarding the place, but as I had no correspondence with her I could only give the information I gave the Department in my letter of Oct 26 last.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\nFrank Nicholas\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, January 12, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant advising the Department that Miss McGuire has declined to take up the duties of teacher of the Goulais Bay school on account of the inaccessibility of the location.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that when the Department wrote to Miss McGuire it was under the impression that the Algoma Central and the Hudson Bay Railway was in operation and that Goulais Bay could be reached easily from Silver Creek Station. This would appear, however, not to be the case. It will be necessary, therefore, to make further inquiries with a view to securing a teacher and you should at once correspond with Rev. Father Richard of Emult Ste. Marie.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. L. Nichols, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEmult Ste. Marie, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nYou are no doubt aware that Miss Emma McQuire of Alumette Island, Que., whose services you had secured as a teacher for the Goulais Bay Indian School, after having journeyed as far as the Sault on her way to Goulais Bay, turned back and went home. Will you try to get any of the four other applicants, whose names I sent you, or shall I put another ad. for a teacher in the papers? The four applicants were Miss Rose M. Chaput, Pembroke, Ont., Miss Anna Roche, Killaloe, Miss E. Murray, Pembroke, Ont., and Miss Mary Breen, Bulger, Ont.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. R. Richard\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6135, File 396-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 27, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Goulais Bay school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets very much that Miss McGuire did not see her way clear to go to the reserve, but there was some misunderstanding as to the means of getting to her location and no doubt she considered that the place was not very favourable.\n\nOf the four other applicants & to whom you refer only one has a certificate, that is Miss Chaput of Pembroke. Miss Roche, although not the holder of a certificate, would appear to have a very fair education and the Department would be prepared to accept the services of either of these two ladies, preferably Miss Chaput. As you are more familiar with all the conditions in so far as means of getting to the reserve and the matter of obtaining a lodging, etc., etc., the Department would like very much if you would undertake to communicate with these ladies and if you can make arrangements with either it will be quite satisfactory. A salary of $50.00 per annum will be paid.\n\nTrusting that you will be successful and that the school may be re-opened at an early date, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. J. R.

It seems impossible to get a girl to go up and live at the mission during the winter months. They got a girl as far as the Ice, but she refused to go further.\n\nThe Father in charge of the mission had done all in his power to get a teacher. When I was at the mission July 2nd 1911 the Indians thought if a married man and family could be secured they would like it much better but there is no accommodation for a family.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nActing Agent\n\nJ.

Father Richard was again communicated with in reference to this matter. It is hoped that he will be able to secure the services of a competent teacher before long.\n\nYour remarks with regard to the appointment of a married man to this school are noted, but the Department does not consider it is practical to carry out this suggestion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Father Richards who informed me that he had used every endeavor to secure a teacher but found it impossible to get a girl to live at the mission during the winter months. I wrote him again about the 1st of May and he said he had advertised in the Catholic Record for girls but have heard nothing further from him.\n\nYour Obit Servant\n\nJ.W.

I was granted a certificate for two years and by a series of unfortunate circumstances have been unable to write final examinations to make my certificate professional.

I have three years experience, and can furnish recommendations from Rev. P. Tracey, Rev. J. M. Guillaubault, and School Inspectors Messrs. F. X. Guay and A. M.

I would recommend you to apply to Rev. Father Belanger, Principal of the Wikwemikong Industrial School, Wikwemikong, Ont., who is conversant with educational matters in Roman Catholic schools on Manitoulin Island and along the north shore and it might be that a position in a congenial school could be found for you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Should you continue in charge of this school till the 30th of June, next, you will be paid a full year's salary, provided your school is open for 208 days.

I expect to leave Ottawa at one o'clock Tuesday morning & arrive at the Sault during the evening.\n\nTrusting you will have your agent to meet me there.\n\nI beg leave to Remain Yours Very Respectfully\n\nMary E. Gallagher\nMaryland, Pa.\nOttawa, August 14, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThis will serve to introduce to you Miss Mary M. Gallagher, of Ryanville, Que., who has been engaged to take charge of the Goulais Bay Indian School.\n\nThe Department will be pleased if you will give Miss Gallagher any assistance you can by way of seeing that she gets transport on the boat to her destination, etc., and should it be that you are acquainted with the reserve or the locality you might be able to serve Miss Gallagher by giving her a letter of introduction to the people in the neighborhood.\n\nMiss Gallagher has been instructed to communicate with you at once in regard to any repairs that may be necessary to the building and in reference to any stationery that she may require and you will be good enough to see that these matters are properly communicated to the Department so that action may be taken in reference to any repairs before the weather becomes cold.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMurdoch McLellan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, August, 14, 1911.\n\nMadam\u2014\n\nThe Department is pleased that you are now prepared to proceed to Goulais Bay to assume your duties as teacher of the Indian School there and it is hoped that you will find the work congenial and meet with a large measure of success.\n\nThere has been no school there for some months and it may be that some repairs will be necessary to the building to make it comfortable. As soon as you arrive there you should communicate with the agent and inform him of any such repairs and he will at once notify the Department and the necessary action will be taken.\n\nSome school supplies in the way of books, stationery etc., will no doubt be necessary. These will be furnished if you will make out a list on one of the forms enclosed with this letter.\n\nReturns on the forms provided, a supply of which is also enclosed, have to be made out at the end of September, December, March and June of each year and upon receipt of these returns a cheque for the salary due you will be forwarded.\n\nWith regard to the class-room work it is not necessary to give you any instructions as you have had considerable experience as a teacher. The Department would, however, like you to take up some branch of domestic science, preferably the teaching of sewing to the girls. If you will consent\n\nMiss Mary E. Gallagher,\nOttawa, Ont.\nconsent to do this the necessary materials will be purchased for you when you open the school. A certain length of time each day can then be allotted for this work.\n\nYou will be good enough to give special attention to the teaching of calisthenics and not less than ten minutes each day should be devoted to this. A copy of the manual for this purpose is being enclosed herewith.\n\nI would also ask you to pay special attention to the teaching of hygiene using the Ontario Public School text book. A copy of this book is also enclosed.\n\nOne of the difficulties that Indian teachers meet with is the apathy of the parents in respect to the education of their children. It would be well for you, therefore, to visit the parents in their homes frequently with a view of impressing upon them the necessity of sending their children regularly to school.\n\nShort monthly reports upon your work would be very gladly received by the Department and any assistance in its power towards helping you in your work will be very gladly given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSaulte, Marie\nOct. 7, 1811\nSecretary Dept.

And will continue to do so, if you are satisfied to pay me two dollars per month.\n\nI might also say that the children are making good progress and I would be much pleased to teach them sewing if you would be kind enough to send the necessary material.\n\nAlso there are five children who\nHave about one mile and a half to come to school, and they attend punctually and regularly. Their parents are dead, and the children are living with their grandparents, who are very poor, old, and not able to work, and I would like if they could be furnished with their mid-day meal at school. All the other children are quite close to school and apparently quite comfortable.\n\nI have written on more than one subject\u2014as it is so very hard for me to have a letter posted.

Your accounts for this work should be submitted quarterly through the office of the Indian Agent.\n\nYou may also arrange to purchase in Sault Ste. Marie some flannellette, needles, thread and two pairs of scissors for the use of your sewing classes.\n\nWith regard to the children to whom you refer I may say that the Department will allow you $1.00 per week for the purchase of provisions for the five, upon condition that they attend school regularly. This amount should not be exceeded and the accounts should show in detail the articles purchased with prices.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Mary E. Gallagher,\nTeacher,\nBox 159,\nSault Ste.

This expenditure is not to exceed $1.00 per week and she has been asked to forward the accounts through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMurdoch McLennan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWill you please let me know if I may close school on the 22nd of May, as I will have two hundred and eight days of actual teaching done, by date mentioned, as I was engaged for.\n\nAlso I have been caretaker of school and did not receive any salary for it.\n\nAnd likewise,\n\nYours Very Respectfully,\n\nM.

It is to be distinctly understood that her engagement is only temporary and that her retention in the position will be dependent upon the success with which she meets in the school work and among the Indians on the reserve. The salary will be at the rate of $400.00 per annum.

Mr. Cadreau has taught at Goulais for a number of years but some way Father Richards does not seem to be very favorably impressed with the idea of sending him to Batchewana. If I did not have to consult him in these matters I would have had both schools going now.\n\nI would recommend that these 2 applicants be engaged for the balance of the year.

Father Richard was written to in connection with the appointment of a teacher for the Goulais Bay School and informed that his nominee, Miss Kehoe, would be accepted, but up to the present time the Department has had no notice of her decision to take up the work there. It will, however, have to wait a reasonable time for a reply from Father Richard.\n\nIn the meantime the Batchewana Bay School is vacant and Miss Mallon may be appointed to this school at $400.00 a year. If she will devote her leisure time to field matron work on the reserve an additional $50.00 a year will be allowed her.

McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. R. Richard, S.J.,\nBaill Ste. Marie, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. Pedley.\n\nWhen on a visit to the Sault last week I discussed with Mr. McNab, Indian Agent, the problem of dealing with health matters at Goulais Bay where I understand a school has been built and a school mistress is being appointed. I learned from Mr. McNab that a Miss Mallon was applying for the situation as teacher and was being offered a salary of $550. The school has from 15 to 20 pupils and there are, I understand, a dozen or so families at Goulais Bay. It is difficult of access and is proving a very hard place to fill. I suggested to Mr. McNab that as the Indians of the Goulais band are, like others of the district, greatly affected with tuberculosis, it will be very desirable to make the teacher a district health visitor as well and to give a certain amount of money for this part of her work. At my suggestion Miss Mallon met me at the Indian office and we discussed this phase of the matter. I learned that she was for sometime a teacher in some Roman Catholic Institution in London and has done some nursing work. She appeared to be a woman of at least twenty-five years and capable. She had recently come to Canada and was nervous about going to a place where there were only Indians, but I fancy that if $100 were added for this work to the salary as teacher, that her fears would be overcome and that we likely would get a permanent employee in that isolated district. I trust that this view will be approved of. As Mr. McNab is awaiti\na telegram regarding the matter, I would suggest that he be communicated with without delay.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.W.O.\nSir,\n\nI received, last evening, a letter from Rev. J.

While there I had to make arrangements for the care taking of the school and also ordered lots of wood to be supplied. I find quite a lot of sickness among the Indians, mostly colds and the effects of having consumption in their systems. The greater part of the sickness is among the women and children. They are nearly all at work cutting Cordwood and Pulpwood. There is some of them in very hard circumstances they are asking me for relief. I made it plain to them that they would not get any relief from the department when they were able to get work. I made arrangements with the merchant at Goulais Bay that he would buy all the Cordwood and Pulpwood the Indians would sell out during the Winter and pay them a fair price for it, and give them supplies as they would have money coming to them. I told them in plain language they had to work or starve as the Dept. could not encourage laziness. I find that sympathy...\nSir,\n\nis written on these fellows they are lazy and shiftless. I mean to visit them as often as I can (with your permission) and see that they are not a burden on the Department. They make all kind of excuses that they cannot work, but no excuse goes any more.\n\nIf the sickness amongst them continues much longer I think it would be advisable to take Dr. McCaig up for a visit and find out what is really the matter and also the cause prevailing from further commands.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.D.

They seldom if ever leave me alone, not even on Sunday or Saturday, always wanting to help; their favorite literature, all are very kind, but at times I would annoy their attention, however, I suppose we must do the inevitable.\nAccompanied by two of my senior pupils I visited on Friday evening, some of the families on the Reserve, and in their few homes I found six persons very sick, four of whom are confined to the bed and are victims of that dreadful disease, consumption. Believe me, Mr. McNaught, if you were to visit some of these places you would not at all be surprised. Prince, I feel as though I had contracted the disease myself.\n\nOn entering one place, the odor was so offensive, I really thought I would have to back out the door without speaking to anyone inside, and from the house, three delicate children attend school.\n\nOne hour under that roof would be the death of your humble servant.\n\nTherefore, if there are many more like these, on the Reserve, I do earnestly\nthink it is high time for the Department to do something for the poor Native, or they will soon have but very few.\n\nOn asking the children in school if they have any more brothers or sisters among who are able to attend school, very often the answer is\u2014No! Miss White, they are all dead.\n\nMrs. Apakwash was almost three days cleaning the school and teachers' quarters\u2014 I really believe some of the Natives lodged in the above quarters during the teacher's absence.\n\nI fear very much that they have not gotten oil wood enough for one year. I think it would take at the very least 15 single cords for the school store and and 12 for the cooking store.\nThese articles on my account I was obliged to get the second day I was here, could not wait to receive orders, therefore, I paid for all when I bought.\n\nThe Merchants here tell me that my predecessor's always had 5 gallons of oil put in the can and sent in the $10 to the Department and they paid. If this is the case, might I do likewise? I suppose the Merchant will have to make out the $10 in duplicate.\n\nIf the Department will not give me $10, I fear I shall have to pitch my tent elsewhere or provisions etc., are so very expensive here.\n\nBelieving you and yours are quite well\n\nI am Very respectfully yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She is also doing field matron work and the Agent recommends that she be treated the same as Miss Mallon in so far as the salary is concerned.

April 30, 1915.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEarly in January I took up the work here as Field Worker.\nOn my first trip I called at the homes of seven of the Indians\nand to my surprise found six persons at the point of death, all\nof whom died of Tuberculosis shortly afterwards. My next trip two\nor three evenings later, I visited five of their homes and found six\nsuffering from Tuberculosis, all are living yet, but I expect four of them\nwill not last much longer. One of the ladies, Thomas Cadman,\nformerly a teacher here, the other two may linger for some time.\nAll the other Indians on the Reserve appear to be enjoying good\nhealth at present. The houses are kept in hot and ventilated\nPine Camp. I have insisted on their letting lots of fresh air, sun-\nlight and sunshine into their homes and the roofs of them all\nwere started to facilitate it. I saw when visiting, blinds taken off\nthe ceiling and walls, over the beds, inside hot stove, and I rec-\nommend, when all went to bed, the shutters dropped so as to keep all\nfresh air out.\n\nOn opening school hours at 10.30 A.M., I always give\n15 minutes for recreation and then open door and windows.\nwhile all the pupils are out\u2014This went on alright for a few days; then the caretaker, George Spackman, came along and ordered me, not to put them children out in the cold but they stay inside and play as they always did; however, next day I had all of them go out just the same and your humble servant along with them, though the caretaker and caretaker were not at all pleased\u2014the former even ordered me to fill up the store of wood in the school and keep the windows and doors closed instead of opening as I did\u2014However, a few days later the Doctor came to make his visit, and as the children in school he gave an excellent lecture on the good of fresh air, light, sunshine and outdoor recreation; since then, I do not think I could urge them to remain in school at recess\u2014Before then you would seldom if ever see a woman or child out on the Reserve, but since they go out, and take the smaller children.\n\nDr. McEachern left medicine, along with directions for the men and women, old people, grown up girls and boys and school children\u2014The latter ones have not lost any time out of school through sickness, before they were always so dull, headachy, pains etc., now they are lively and bright and attend school regularly. For the girls and boys out of school, men, women and old folks, many of them have told me if it was not for the medicine I gave them they would be in their beds\u2014It has also done the children under six years of age a great deal of good.\nThe Indians keep their dead too long, usually three and four days inside a hot stove \u2014 I might safely say they start to mummify before burial \u2014 Neither do they bury them deep enough; the last one buried was only about four feet from the top of the coffin to the level of the ground and had been kept for three days and nights beside a cooking stove; the breath was hardly gone from her when her body became covered with little bugs.\n\nEarly in January, when visiting, I found two mothers who were nursing children that should be three and four years on their next birth day; the one with the four year old child has since passed it, but the other one who is a victim of tuberculosis has not, as yet, and she is in such poor health, coughing etc., that she is scarcely able to lift the child \u2014 She is one of the two that I spoke of in the beginning of this summary.\n\nThe Indians are, for the last week busy cleaning up their homes, yards, etc., and most of them are doing it very nicely.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The school house is in a commons house and cattle grazing around it and that makes it impossible to keep the grounds clean or in any kind of shape.

They are so scared to ventilate, keep their doors and windows shut up most of the time, but yet they air their dwellings a great deal more now than when I first took up this work. I expect that gradually they will see through things differently.\n\nFour of the six Consumptives, that I spoke of in my last report are able to sit and walk around. I have looked from the class room window, they are out at all particular where or how they prefer to sit, though I have told them many times, but they do not think I see them as much as I do. In any instance they are very careful. The school children are all healthy and well all present and attend school very regularly and all like so much to prepare their tasks etc.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McVay, Indian Agent,\nSainte-Marie, Ont.\n\nWard Matron Work.\n\nSince my last report three Indians have been sick, one of\nold age and the other two of tuberculosis. There are confined\nto their beds by the same disease and two more are scarcely able\nto move about. Little can be done for those who are in this stage.\nI really believe it is from them who are in this stage, that the disease\ncontracted. In the homes of these, if the game could be seen, I am\nsure they are flying around as thick as snowflakes when falling.\nIf they could be compelled to be more careful.\n\nI have visited them when they would have hemorrhage so badly that they\nwould almost choke and what they would cough up would be like this.\nThis instead of being buried would be flung out on the chips and all\nthe hens, chickens, dogs, cats and other animals around would come\nalong and devour it in a twinkling. I have many times advised\nthem of the great danger. In any manner they are very careful.\nVery often I pretend not to notice and then they do just as they have always been in the habit of doing.\n\nI was where there was a young woman dying she could not get the physician up, her grandmother took the towel and assisted her, then she dipped the towel in the tea kettle on the stove and wiped the woman's hands and face and when through hung the towel up over the stove to dry, a few minutes later she was about to make tea out of the water the towel was dipped in etc. I explained to her and she appeared to be pleased with my explanation, cleaned out the kettle etc. but once I was out of her sight she would not practice.\n\nI think they do not bury their dead deep enough \u2014 One morning went into the camp from the South end accompanied by a squaw and two children, a strong wind from the North was blowing, the odor was very pungent. To the squaw, there must be a cow or a horse dead around here, No, says she, it must be a dog \u2014 Would that the Department would order about one half of the dogs to be done away with as the small children near them do play toys, I mean the little dogs that are of no earthly use.\n\nThe school children appear to be quite well after their two months' holiday but are again in the same filthy condition as found them in January on coming here, their heads and bodies swarming with lice. But through time I shall get them cleaned up again then I shall give them more of Dr. McLeay's medicine which has sprung forth so\nwonders on them\u2014Not one of the school children complain of being sick since I started to give them Dr. McEaige medicine. One of my pupils, the only female forward and complaint of her little brother, said her Grandpa, Uncle and Aunt asked her to do so; her mother being dead and father away\u2014Her little brother will steal off into a room and there pick out of all the cracks in the floor all the dirt and eat it\u2014she said her mamma and auntie who are dead did the same thing.

One of them cannot move about at all, another never leaves the house; three others are able to go out, split and chop wood, and at times go to the woods to do so; the other two are wonderfully well, able to do as much work as anyone. All of them are using Dr. Mc Caig's medicine and it is doing them all kinds of good, particularly the last which I refer to.\n\nIf it were possible for Mr. Mc Nabb and Dr. Mc Caig to come very often and visit the Indians in their homes as they do, I think consumption here, in\na short time would be a thing of the past, some of\nthe Indians, those with the district house and who\nare most consumptionous, came up for about two\nweeks after their visit, they got there such a talking to,\nand their children come to school smelling fresh and\nclean.\n\nI think a good idea to prevent the disease\nfrom spreading more would be to pick up these cases\nthat are incurable and put them in a Sanitarium,\nwhere they will be watched closely, for in their homes you\ncannot make them be careful.\n\nA number of the Indians have, this fall, built new\nhouses, left old ones, because they have been talked\nat so much, and so plainly of their being prone to\ntheir old houses where so many have died of con-\nsumption, they are really beginning to think it is\ntrue.\n\nDr. Mc Cain, left many leaflets from the Board\nof Health to be distributed among them, this too,\nappears to make an impression upon them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I find on my visits to the Goulais Bay Mission that she is taking a great interest in this work, occasionally some of them do not pay much heed to what she says to them in regard to keeping their houses clean. She reports them to the Doctor and myself on our visits there and we call into every house and read the Riot Act to them. That is the reason she would like to have the Doctor visit the place more frequently than he does at present.\n\nAs there is so much sickness there, I would be pleased if the Doctor was allowed to take a trip there once every Quarter, more especially in the winter months as so many complain of Colds, and that appears to be the commencement of Tuberculosis with those people.\n\nI am pleased to say that Miss Kehoe herself is improving in her health; it is so hard for her to get the right kind of Food where she is living that she got run down.

My pupil who was so poorly of the same disease is much improved and attends school regularly.\n\nThe sore on my third pupil who has the mal aiguine itch are fairly well healed up\u2014these poor children suffer everything from the itch, their whole bodies are a mass of raw sore skin scratching but now they seldom if ever catch Dr. McEaige's medicine and salve. I think will cure them.\n\nThere has been an increase of four in the population since my last report\u2014Mothers and infants are doing splendidly.\n\nThere is a great deal of liquor used here\u2014the Indians think nothing of going to the bar and bringing...\nliquor house by the race and while this lasts there is nothing done among them but drinking and fighting.\n\nOn Monday night before Ash Wednesday they had a big dance at one of the Indian homes\u2014On Sunday morning before two of the Indians drove to the Pass and brought home a case of liquor for the dancer, nearly all the Indians got drunk, fought in the house and outside\u2014One of them, I believe, had some of his joints broken from his hands.\n\nThe next day a number of them came to me and uttered all kind of complaints, etc. I told them if they came for me, as Mrs. Marlet did at New Grass, when they were not within the fight, I could then have them punished but as they did not give me an invitation to see the fight, little could be done\u2014They said they would come the next time.\n\nThe Indians say that up to New Grass, 1913, no one ever interfered with their fighting, drinking, going into houses, breaking, smashing, etc., that they always had done the like and it was a common thing to see the snow where they fought covered with blood and in a few days they would all be good friends, etc.\n\nThey also say that in the future, they will just do as they have done in the past that they do not care for any one. They never before had an Agent, who tried to civilize them and now they find it very hard when they are\nchecked.\n\nMr. McHatt is doing his utmost to have them become better subjects \u2014 he certainly has work ahead of him as all his predecessors appear to have done but little; and moreover, I think care but little only get their pay and this makes it very hard now.\n\nThe Indians here would quit at any time, war black was white.\n\nThere is all kind of badness practiced among the young and the old too well, and for this reason I think so many of them have died, they abuse themselves.\n\nAn Indian, for policeman here, is of no use, as he would run to the woods and hide before he would act.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAnna Kuhn.\nOttawa, April 8, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that the Department will increase the salary of Miss Kehoe, teacher of the Goulais Bay school to $500 per annum.

In addition to her duties as teacher she acts as field matron on the reserve and Mr. McNabb says that since the dismissal of the constable she has maintained excellent order. She is a woman of strong character and is much interested in her work and both the Agent and doctor speak very highly of her success. I would recommend that the increase asked for be granted, as it would be next to impossible to fill her place.

I have been doing my best attempt to work until the end of June, but I fear I shall not be able to earn my annual leave, earlier. I have taught every Saturday and Sunday since January 1st, did not take any Easter holiday. Therefore, if you were to allow me to put it all together and let me off that much sooner, I certainly would appreciate it.

Our navigation claims I expect they shall again have any ambition of it. A week or two ago a woman and her little son went to spend the evening with friends who live about a mile from her house, her husband had gone to the Boo and would not be home that night, they stayed later than they intended to and the people would not let them go home\u2014they said there was a number of the Indians came from the Boo that evening and they were all drunk and had liquor in abundance. The next morning this woman's husband and three of his friends came home so drunk that they did not know anything\u2014the sober Indians are scared of their lives if they drink once\u2014they are just as cute as posses with their liquor, they put it in Molida water bottle and drink it from them. They tell me there are a few of them who can drink almost a gallon of pure liquor and if you did not know it you would not think they had any taken but they say it killing them.\n\nThe parents of a child of 14, went off for 3 or 4 days and left this child keeping house, needles it say she kept house night and day\u2014this same mother spent...\nOf those beautiful days, strolling through the park with one of our bachelor friends, I think is the sort of thing that has always gone on here \u2014 I would prefer to see all the young spinsters nod at 4, than do they have in the past \u2014 wander through the woods for the whole summer season with some lover.\n\nTwo more of my pupils, who are 14, are going to board shortly.

The other two of whom I said were threatened with death are breathing and nothing more; though they may linger for some time, one of them may even get better for a while \u2014 One of them gave birth to a child about two months ago, and the other six months ago, both got up too soon and went vomiting, now they are suffering for it.

Very little liquor has been used this last month, though time they shall all become civilized providing there is always an Agent like the present one.\nSince I started this Report, the Consumptive that I first spoke of has died\u2014The house in which she died, should now be burned with everything in it and around it, by so doing the lives of two children who are there might be prolonged, though they certainly must have the germ in their system as there has been too many dead of the disease in that house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAnnie Kehoe.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find Returns from the Goulais Bay School for the Quarter ending June 30th /14.

He might be made Professor of Music some day but of course he could not be let go away.\n\nI have in school two other boys who can read the same three languages fluently but one of them is a consumptive and the other is about twelve years of age. In fact, I might say all the children in school are very bright to learn and their conduct too is good in school, but alas... out of school on the playground and other places it could not be worse\u2014I have five pupils between eleven and twelve years of age that I really believe I shall have to expect for the bad actions, etc., that I have caught them at.\n\nThey are not fit companions for innocent children of which there are very few here\u2014It is at this age, as far as I can learn all started to abuse themselves and any who tried to become men and women very decidedly, and when they should be very healthy were dying\u2014I really believe this is true judging from what I have seen of it since I came here.\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McNaught, Indian Agent.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince my last report there has not been any sickness except those two consumptives who have been ill for such a long time and they are keeping fairly well. The Indians have done considerable cleaning of late, whitewashed their house inside and out, etc.\n\nI keep the school, my quarters and the school grounds as much for an example as I possibly can, they seem to imitate it too fairly well.\n\nI put them to scrub the closets about a month ago, well, they laughed and laughed at the idea of anyone scrubbing the closets!\n\nThe children are very careful and enjoy cleanliness and will tell of it when they go home if they see the\nstore or pipes blackened etc. and will ask them at home to fill the store and pipes like the ones at the school \u2014 A number of them came to me for instructions to use the blacking.\n\nSome of the married men are so pleased with these little girls who are coming to school that they asked me to print the A.B.C.'s on paper for them as they were going to try to learn to read and write.\n\nAll who are coming to school can read English and Indian as well and three of them Latin.\n\nThere has been very little liquor used on the Reserve this month that I know of the men all being away trout fishing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAnna Kehoe.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that I visited the Coulais Bay School yesterday, I found only one pupil present.\n\nThe Teacher Miss Annie Kehoe was going around with a crutch and a walking stick, she is in bad way. I advised her to go away and take a rest and go to her friends. She claims she cannot travel alone and her two Sisters are in the west. She told me she wanted to get this quarter in. I offered to pay her and get her pay till the end of February. She said that after the length of time she worked for the Department and the services she rendered while she was in good health she thought the Department should allow her till the end of March.\n\nThe Parents that are at the Bay now does not care about sending their children to her in the state she is in. The most of the people are away with their families in the woods at work and there are only about 6 children that could attend from now till along in April. If the School was closed now it would save my buying wood and also those other articles that she ordered some time ago.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that she be paid for the current quarter and that the School be closed till April let next. I think this the easiest way to get her out of there. Teachers are plentiful and her place could be easily filled at that time. I do not want her back in the state she is in now.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions,\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst.

This matter should be brought before the Department by you at a later date.\n\nThe articles asked for in the requisition forwarded by Miss Kehoe for supplies for the teacher's quarters need not now be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Marie, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nAs the Goulais Bay school is now closed owing to the illness of Miss Kehoe, who will never be able to resume her duties, I would suggest that the position of teacher of this school should be offered to Miss Annie O'Connor, who has been in charge of the Michipicoten School up to the other day, when the school-house was burnt down. The attendance at the Michipicoten School had dropped off so much that Mr. Agent McNabb had recommended its being closed. The Goulais Bay School has teacher's quarters and, although the attendance has been very uncertain there for the last three months due to Miss Kehoe's illness, there are enough children on the reserve to justify the Department in keeping the school on and, as Miss O'Connor has been a long time in the service, I think she might be offered the place if she cared to take it. The Department is in receipt of a letter from one of the residents of Michipicoten who stated that she lost everything.\neverything in the fire and was overcome with the smoke and at the time of writing was laid up.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6135, File 396-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 18, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 4th instant in which you state that, owing to the continued ill health of Miss Annie Kehoe, the teacher, the Goulais Bay School should be closed for the present I beg to say that, as the school at Michipicoten has been destroyed by fire and Miss Annie O'Connor thrown out of employment, she may be offered the position of teacher of the Goulais Bay School at the same salary paid Miss Kehoe. Should she accept this offer the school should be re-opened on the first of April next. Be good enough to ask her to let you know as soon as possible whether she will take charge of the school at Goulais Bay or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst.

I re-opened school on the 4th, with an attendance of nine, who attended regularly up to the last day of the month; then they began to drop off until all are gone but three, and two of them are just about fit for bed; they are coughing so \u2014 consumption is the whole trouble \u2014 I do not expect they shall attend again until April or May, as they are little tots who are coming now.\n\nIndian Affairs.

She is now in the general hospital at the Soo in very poor health and Mr. McNabb says that the doctor says that she cannot live very much longer and he considers that she is deserving of all the Department can do for her, as she worked faithfully while in his agency and has done her very best for the benefit of all the Indians on the reserve, old and young.\n\nMiss Kehoe has been in the Department's employ for over seven years and her services have been satisfactory. She mentions in her letter that she has been twenty-two years in the employ of the Department, but this is a mistake, as, although she has been teaching for a long time, it was in schools in the province of Quebec prior to being employed by this Department.\n\nThe Goulais Bay School is now closed and there is no prospect of getting a teacher, at least until after navigation.\nnavigation opens, which will be towards the end of May, and I think, under the circumstances, the Department would be quite justified in paying Miss Kehoe until a successor is appointed, but not longer than for the current quarter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, as a slight recognition of Miss Kehoe's faithful service during the seven years she has been in the employ of this Department, she will be allowed to draw her salary as teacher until such time as a successor is appointed, but not longer than for the current quarter.

She asked me to bring her case to the notice of the Department, as she claims that she was in good health when she entered our service eight years ago and that she contracted the disease from contact with the Indians, as in addition to teaching school she acted as field matron and visited and attended the sick Indians on the two reserves where she was stationed. While she was in the Department's service she did excellent work and Mr. Agent McNabb has reported most favourably on her usefulness among the Indians while at Goulais Bay. She has been laid up for a long time and is now quite helpless with no chance of recovery. She says that she has expended all her savings in hospital treatment and would like the Department to help her out. Her salary as teacher of the Goulais Bay School was paid up to the end of April and if the Department could see its way to pay her...\nher until the end of June it would be only a small reward for her long and faithful service.

As it is not likely that she intends to resume her duties, the Department agrees with your suggestion that Miss Peltier be appointed as teacher at this point instead of at Batchewana. The Department will, therefore, approve of her taking charge of the Goulais Bay School, with salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum, together with bonus at the rate of $150.00 during the period it is continued to teachers in Indian dayschools. This is at the same rate as was allowed her brother when he taught at Batchewana. If you have any word from Miss Kelly that she intends to return, the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Peltier to Batchewana, but, if not, you may arrange to have Miss Peltier proceed to Goulais Bay and re-open that school as soon as possible. It is noted that there is a comfortable house at Goulais Bay.\n\nIf any school material is required you should instruct Miss Peltier to prepare a requisition and forward it to you for transmission to the Department.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you at a later date as to the date on which Miss Peltier takes up her duties at Goulais Bay.\n\nIn connection with the securing of a teacher for Batchewana I would refer you to official letter of August 27th, last, in reference to the appointment of an Indian girl named\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nnamed Lucy Tenisooe and have to request that you will be good enough to state whether she called to see you regarding this matter. She gave her address as 281 North St., Sault Ste.

I could not send Miss Tenisco to Batchewana until I had some place for her to board. I was trying to make arrangements with Father Desatels to allow her to use his House as the Indians do not want to board the Teacher, and she had no money to make a start there so I sent her to Geulnis Bay where there is a nice comfortable house, and I made arrangements with Mr. Greek the Merchant there to give her whatever she wants in the provision line until she gets her Cheque in January. She took a younger sister up with her and I knew she will be comfortable there.\n\nI do not think that there is much use in trying to carry on the Batchewana School until we have a building of our own there.\n\nHoping that this explanation is satisfactory,\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.

She will be paid a salary at the rate of $550.00 per annum, as you were informed by official letter of August 27th, last, and will receive the bonus additional at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. It is noted that you have arranged with a merchant at Goulais Bay to provide her with the necessary provisions until she receives her first salary cheque.\n\nWith reference to Miss Peltier, who was offered the position at Batchewana, I now beg to say that she has been appointed as assistant teacher at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School on Manitoulin Island.\n\nAs you have not been able to obtain the services of a teacher for Batchewana this school will have to remain closed for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

She never mentioned to me that she was leaving until I got a note from her this morning that she had left and had taken another position. She does not give any reason for her leaving. She was running down to the Soo too often and I spoke to her about losing so much time away from her duty and that may be the cause; it is always 3 or 4 days lost time every trip and that once a month at the least is too much lost time for the Pupils.\n\nWill you please try and get me a good Teacher with a certificate for this School. I have two good Teachers at the R.C. School at Garden River, but the Anglican School might as well be closed as the Teacher that is there is not fit to Teach.

I do so only in the way of a report to call the matter to your attention so that you may give it your earnest consideration.\n\nThe Goulais Bay Indian School is not in operation, there being about 20 children without any schooling.\n\nNo doubt, one of the chief causes is lack of teachers. It is too bad to have children growing up illiterate.

It is understood that there is a residence for a teacher, and that the equipment for carrying on the school is complete.\n\nIn December, last, when you visited the Department you urged the re-opening of this school under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. I will be pleased if you will take up with the resident missionary, the question of obtaining the services of a qualified teacher to re-open this school on or about September 1st, next. We will be prepared to pay a fair salary, depending upon the qualifications possessed by the teacher secured.\n\nKindly give this matter your early attention, and endeavour to obtain the services of a suitable teacher. You should consult the local Roman Catholic Clergy regarding the obtaining of the services of a teacher. We are anxious to have this school re-opened next September, and hope that you will be successful in obtaining a qualified teacher to begin duties at that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

However, the price of cattle is so high, and the inconveniences so numerous, that I feel it almost impossible to continue my work, unless you are prepared to increase my salary. Kindly let me know at the earliest possible date what you can do for me.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6135, File 396-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nUp to the present I have been doing the caretaking. Should I continue the work? What salary will I receive? I would expect at least $40 for the term.\n\nI have taught school on three successive Saturdays in order to fill the required number of school days for September. Should I teach every Saturday until I have my 200 days teaching completed which will be about May 1st/23. Will it be to your satisfaction providing the pupils' parents are satisfied to send their children?\n\nI am quite sure that you have received the school Inspector's report concerning the state of my living apartments and school-room at present, and I feel sure that you will do something to better my situation as soon as possible.\n\nAddress: Hope to hear from you at an early date\n\nSault Ste Marie\n\nH. A. D. Webb. Bot 355 Oct.\n\nPoveshell\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am respectfully,\n\nAngela Taylor.\nOttawa, October 7, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, in which you request an increase in your salary as teacher of the Goulais Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to point out that you are now in receipt of salary at the rate of $800 per annum, plus a bonus during the present fiscal year of $15 per month, or a combined salary and bonus of $915 a year. You have only an Elementary Quebec Certificate, and it is considered that the salary you receive compares very favourably with that paid to teachers with your qualifications in the rural schools.\n\nThe inspector who visited your school on the 27th ultimo has given this Department a favourable report regarding your work. He has also drawn attention to the conditions at Goulais Bay in connection with your living accommodation and the condition of the school building. I may say that we have authorized Mr. Agent McNabb to purchase a quantity of supplies for the use of the teacher's residence, also to have a few minor repairs carried out to both the school and residence. We hope that the agent has made these purchases and that the various articles have been received by you, also that he is making arrangements to have the authorized repairs completed. We desire to make both the residence and school as comfortable as possible before the cold weather sets in; but we regret that we are unable to grant an increased salary at the present time.\n\nWe cannot approve of the school being conducted on Saturdays. It would not be fair to the children to ask them to attend on that day and, besides, it is against our regulations to allow teachers to teach Saturdays except in very exceptional cases when it is necessary to make up for a regular teaching day when the school was closed for satisfactory reasons.\n\nRegarding the caretaking, I beg to say that if you will undertake this work, the Department will allow you salary at the rate of $40 per year. This will help to augment the salary which you receive as teacher. We will inform Mr. Agent McNabb of the amount allowed you for doing the caretaking, which will be paid quarterly, upon receipt of vouchers from him for the amount due each quarter at the above rate.\n\nWe hope that you will remain at this school and that conditions will be greatly improved when the supplies ordered arrive and the few repairs are made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I had a telegram from Miss Thero yesterday that her Mother was sick and that she could not be here before Monday next. I wrote her that she had to take the Batchewana School for the next term.\n\nI must say that I am not very favorably impressed with Miss Thero, in my opinion she is too flighty and did not attend strictly to her school. She was away from her work too much to suit me, at Batchewana she will not have the opportunities to get to the Sault as it is isolated in the winter and fall. I would let her try Batchewana for the next term if she is willing to go, if she does not want to go I can get a Miss Cagnon from this City, I am inclosing 2 applications for positions.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

I enclose herewith a copy of our letter to Miss Thero.\n\nThe Batchewana School may remain closed during the present month, and you may arrange to obtain the services of a suitable teacher to begin duties on or about October 1st, next. The applications which you enclosed from Miss M. A. Gagnon and Mrs. P. F. Goulais have been noted. The department would not be favourably disposed to the appointment of Mrs. Goulais. If you consider that Miss Gagnon would be satisfactory, you may appoint her, or make further enquiries with a view to obtaining a satisfactory teacher for the Batchewana School to begin duties on the above mentioned date. The salary allowed will be at the same rate as was paid last year, viz: $650 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law, which, during the present fiscal year ending March 31st, 1925, is at the rate of $15 per teaching month.

Smith; Joe Neveau; John Neveau and Louis Neveau,\nthese people are either the parents or guardians of 13\nchildren, and from what the Teacher told me they, the\nchildren did not attend school but very little.\n\nI was at Goulais Indian Mission on May 24th,\nand 26th in connection with other matters and I took the\nmatter of the attendance to school of these children with\nthe School Teacher, and she stated that for the past two\nweeks that they had all attended regularly, this was borne\nout by the register which is kept at the school.\n\nAt present there are 25 children attending\nthis school regularly, this is all the children of school\nage on the reserve. I would like to point out that there\nis only enough seating accommodation for 16 children at\nthe desks, and it is necessary for the remainder to sit\non boxes, with either boxes or a small table for writing\ndesks, this tends to make the discipline a little lax, I\ndo not think that the Department knows of the shortage of\ndesks at this school, as I understand that there was more\ndesks when the School Inspector made his visit last year,\nthese have become broken and have not been repaired, parts\nof these are outside the school.\n\nI think that the children at this Mission will\nattend regularly until school closes next month, but I\nthink it will be necessary to check them up again in the\nfall.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.A.

Ferrier, Esq., M.A.,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIn case I forget to say so there are two teachers at the bottom of the list as far as I am concerned in your Indian schools inspected by me. They are Miss McDermott at Blind River, Mississauga Reserve, and Miss M. A. Gagnon at Goulais Bay. While no doubt they have their good points yet there are many better without schools.\n\n(Sgd.) J. M. Bennett.\n\nToronto, Oct. 11, 1927.\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.,\nMarch 17, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to report a trip to Goulais Mission which Chief Nolan, Mr. Samson and myself made to investigate complaints, which we received from several Indians concerning the teacher Miss Cagnon, and also to look into the matter of relief for the Indians of that reserve.\n\nI am very glad to report that after investigating the complaints against Miss Cagnon, we found them to be without foundation.\n\nx x x\n\nG. H. Sims.\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nRe: Patrol to Goulais Indian Mission.\n\nI have the honour to report that on the 7th inst., C. H. Sims, local Indian Agent, informed me that as soon as the weather was fit and the roads in good shape he was making a trip with Gus. Nolan, Chief of the Batchewana Band of Indians to the above Mission to look into conditions there, as well as to investigate a complaint he had received about the School Teacher, he requested that I accompany him on this trip.\n\nOn account of the conditions of the roads and the ice being bad on the lake, we did not start until midnight of the 13th/14th, arriving at The Mission at 1.00 P.M. on the 14th inst. A meeting was called of all the members (both male and female) of the Band that afternoon and they were all present.\n\nThe first thing taken up was the complaint against the school teacher, Miss M. A. Gagnon. Mr. Sims produced a letter signed by Mrs. Ben Reil, Mrs. Alex. Neveu and Mrs. Mike Reil, Indians of this mission in which it stated that the teacher had been using the strap too much on the children, that she was teaching them bad things and that they wanted a new teacher.\n\nI questioned these three women regarding the excessive use of the strap by the teacher but neither of them were able to state that any child had been strapped in a brutal manner, neither were they able to prove in any way that the teacher was teaching the children anything bad, in fact it seemed just the reverse. The Teacher, Miss Gagnon, was then called, she did not deny strapping some of the pupils, but stated that she had cause to do so, as some of them stole things from the school, wrote obscene words on the black-board and were generally disobedient, she also stated that it was necessary for her to wash some of the children, they were so dirty, this no doubt the parents objected to, after having heard the teacher, Mr. Sims asked if anyone present had anything else to say against as he did not think that there had been sufficient evidence brought forward to ask for the teacher's dismissal, no one had anything to say against her, but Alex. Robertson who is one of the best Indians in this district, stated that he had 4 children going to school at the Mission and that none of them had ever complained about being strapped, if they had he stated he would have looked into the matter and if the children were in the wrong he would have given them another licking, he further stated that Miss Gagnon was the best teacher they had ever had and that the children learnt more this last term than ever before.\n\nA number of other Indians came forward and stated that Miss Gagnon was the best teacher they had had for 15 years and that they wanted her to stay.\nAfter hearing both sides of the story, Mr. Sims informed the meeting that he thought the charges against the teacher were without foundation and were rather petty and that he would not take any action for the teacher's dismissal. Later he spoke to Miss Gagnon and told her to use a little diplomacy with the parents of the children. I talked with some of the Indians both before and after the meeting and they stated that the women making the complaints are sore at the teacher because she does not cater to them. Regarding this school, I might say that it is always kept clean and the attendance is good, there being 26 pupils on the register, all of whom attend regular and who are as far advanced as the majority of children of their age in the towns.\n\nF.A. SAMSON, CorpI.\ni/c Sault Ste Marie Detachment.\nOttawa, March 27th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 17th instant in which you report on your visit, in company with Corporal Samson, to the Goulais Bay Indian Day School to investigate complaints which the Indians made concerning the services of Miss M. A. Gagnon, I beg to say that the Department notes, after reading the report of yourself and Corporal Samson, that the charges against the teacher were without foundation. It is hoped that, as a result of your visit and the investigation held, a better feeling will exist between the few discontented Indian parents and the teacher. It is also noted that there was a regular attendance, and that the pupils are progressing satisfactorily in their studies.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

In reply I beg to say that the Department has not been informed of the intention of Miss Gagnon, the present teacher, to resign.\n\nI may say that the Department prefers to obtain the services of teachers having professional qualifications, and we already have a number of applications on file for positions as teachers.

You should see that her return, showing the attendance and days taught for the quarter ended June 30th, last, is forwarded, in order that payment of the balance of salary due her can be made.\n\nWith reference to the appointment of a successor to Miss Gagnon, I beg to say that the Department will await the receipt of any further applications which you may receive, as it may be possible to obtain the services of a teacher having higher qualifications than Miss Fitzpatrick possesses.

You probably can recall to mind too, that I sent you an application, applying for any Indian School in Ontario of a year ago.\n\nI might say that as far as I can remember there has never been a fully qualified teacher at Double Bay Indian Day School nor do I think that anyone would be anxious to get it who could teach elsewhere, and feel that if a teacher without full qualifications is hired that I am entitled to have my application considered as I am the a resident of the place and was the first pupil to get Entrance from that\nSchool and to attempt anything like High School work.\n\nHoping that you will re-consider my application and if there is any chance of my getting the position, I will be most grateful to you for any effort you will make to secure the same for me.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Margaret Duff,\n1334 Lillian Ave.,\nWindsor, Ont.\nOttawa, August 7th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 5th instant, concerning the vacancy at the Goulais Bay Indian Day School, I have now to state that an application has been received from Miss Margaret Duff, who attended Pembroke Convent High School for two years and then completed a business college course. This young lady is a friend of Miss Eva Robicheau, who is teaching at the Bazmah-Indian Day School. She makes application for the Goulais Bay vacancy. The Department is today writing to her, offering appointment at the rate of $80 per teaching month. She will report to you on or about September 1st, before proceeding to her school. Please give her any help you can.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nGoulais River P.O.\nVia Sault Ste. Marie Ont.\nAug 8th 1930.\n\nMr. G.H. Sims Indian Agent\nSault Ste. Marie Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSeeing that there is a vacancy in the Goulais Mission School, I would like to apply for the position. I am the holder of a Third Class Certificate and have completed two sessions at the University Schools, Toronto. I might also state that I have been successful in preparing four Entrance Classes during the four years I have taught.\n\nI have already taught in the Goulais Mission School one year and have put the Entrance Class successfully.\n\nShould I be favoured with the position I will discharge my duties with the best of my ability.\n\nI remain\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nM. Arnette Javell.\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nAugust 6 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith application from Mrs. M.A. Jewell of Goulais Mission for the position as teacher at the Goulais Bay Indian School.\n\nI may say that Mrs. Jewell (nee M.A. Gagon) was Miss McCoy's predecessor having taught one year in the Goulais Indian school. The Inspector always found her work very satisfactory which his reports will show. In view of the fact that Mrs. Jewell is living at the Mission, and has no children, her appointment I believe would be very satisfactory if the Department should so decide.\n\nShould I receive any further applications, I will forward same to the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, August 12, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing an application from Mrs. M. A. Jewell (nee M. A. Gagnon) for the position as teacher at the Goulais Bay Indian Day School, and stating her qualifications and previous teaching experience.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to official letter of the 7th instant, in which you were informed that the Department had offered the appointment as teacher at this school to Miss Margaret Duff, and that she would report to you on or about September 1st, next. In the event of Miss Duff not accepting the position, the Department would favourably consider the appointment of Mrs. Jewell.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

What is the matter? Have they refused payment? It seems strange. Every one in this locality has had \"La Grippe\" I suppose it is prevalent in the city too. I found the trip a hard one and the weather was exceedingly cold. Hope I shall be favorably from Dept. very soon, as I am considerably overdue. Hoping you are quite well and wishing you all success and gratification.\n\nYours sincerely,\nAmos Kootenay\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose letter received from our old friend Miss Annie O'Conner, in reference to her salary for the last part of services as Teacher, I may say that her return was sent to the Department on Nov 16th, last, on the return she gave as her address, Bank of Montreal, Hull, Quebec.\n\nIf this money was sent to the Bank, they have failed to notify her of the fact. Kindly let me know so that I can keep Annie from worrying.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ. D.

He owes me over $50 dollars for work and my friend Irwin about $3 dollars and Mr. Holcomb also says he owes me funds of security for the job. If this is true something badly wrong.

I am sorry that Mr. Holcombe has not settled this matter as he promised to do so when I saw Him after your previous letter. However, as soon as I am able to be out again, which will probably be in the course of a week, I will see that he makes payment in full. This matter has been a source of a great deal of annoyance to me. Mr. Holcombe did not receive his money for the Goulias Bay school until about the 7th of December last, as it lay some time in the Post Office here before I got the check for him, so that until that time he was correct in saying that he had not received it. I had previously advanced to him a portion, I think $20.00, for your wages and also the wages of Fraser, but apparently he did not give you any of it. I also had advanced him, before he received his money, out of my own pocket, the amount of the wages of the plasterers. Had you let me know in reasonable time instead of writing to the Department concerning the matter I could have held all your money from him without any trouble, but I never supposed for an instant that he had not paid you until I received your first letter. However, I shall see that Mr. Holcombe pays this as soon as I can possibly attend to it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

He left with me some money to pay off any claims that were here as he had not seen the papers. I have something like $30.00. Had you let me know that he had not paid you I could have seen to his settling the amount, while the money he left with me was in my hands.\n\nYour writing to the Department was certainly ill-advised as, had you written me before or told me that you were unpaid I am almost certain that there would have been no delay, as the matter stands if you get a certified statement of the amount due you at the Indians Bay School.\n\nIndian Affairs.
