Specht S.J.\nFort William October 4th 1895\n\nMr. L. D. O'Leary\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have visited the Indians of Michibicoton a few days ago, and I was very sorry to see over twenty children in age of frequenting the school, obliged to stay home ill, because the school is closed for a great many years. The Indians asked me, if I could not do anything to obtain from the Department the reopening of the school, to give their children a\na chance of learning something. Therefore having found out by myself that there were then present in the vicinity 22 Indian children, a few more being absent with their parents, I write you to say that you know the miserable state of these poor children without any education, when the Department often opens schools for a smaller number of children.\n\nNow besides the Indian children about ten or twelve white children would attend the school regularly if it was opened. I hope Mr. Secretary that you will do all in your power to give a school to these poor boys who, it seems to me, have a right to an education just as well as the others.\nThe school building is still good but the furniture are wanting. Please do your best to obtain from the Department the reopening of that school and obliged.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nL.

B. Co's post to the reserve. $100 was, however, voted by the Government to pay for the removal of the school building, which has been re-built on the reserve, and is now ready for occupation, and the Roman Catholic authorities have for the last two years been applying for a grant to carry on the school, and in December of '97 Mr. Agent Van Abbott was informed that an item of $250 to provide for the salary of a teacher at this place would be included in the Estimates for 1897-98, and he was requested to inform the Rev. Father Specht at Fort William accordingly. This item was disallowed, and the Rev. Father Specht has renewed his application, and Father Dugas who has since succeeded Father Specht has called the Department's attention to this matter, and asked to have provision made for the teacher's salary. The Missionary states that there are about 20 children of school age who could attend if the Department consented to open the school. He states that he can obtain a substitute teacher and urges that the Department will make provision for having the school reopened after the summer holidays\u2014in September next\u2014as there is not other opportunity for the Indians to receive an education.\n\nThere are no funds available for this purpose, and the salary would have to be voted by Parliament.\n20/1/97\n\nMrs. Scott\nTo note for intimates.\n\n2 Return to School\nOTTAWA, 22nd February, 1893\n\nRev.

Chief Cass has written the Department stating that this is so and that the Indians have all moved to that place. Miss Kate O'Connor, who was sent up by the Department to take charge of this school, was instructed to carry it on at Michipicoten River, and unless there is some good reason for changing the location, it will be continued there.\n\nKindly report at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

In answer to that letter, I inform you that it is not the wish of the majority of the Michipicoten Band to have their school transferred from Michipicoten to Sora Cap. Notwithstanding requests of Chief Cass, I inform you that the Indians have not all moved to Sora Cap. I have written myself to Father Dugas, who was formerly charged with the spiritual care of the Indians here, to try to have the school continued in the old mission, for one year more at least.\n\nThere are now four or five families in the new place, at Sora Cap.\nFather Bugo believes that if the school could start this new site, he would not attend it. Besides, some of these boys may attend the school during the winter in the old mission.\n\nI believe then that there is no reason for changing the location of the school here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

I am sorry that our children here at Gros Cap will be without school for this year; but I hope that you will consider the matter over before reengaging the teacher.\nFor another year, and see whether it would not be more in the interests of our Band to have the school removed from Michipicoten River to the reserve at Gros Cap.\n\nWhen you came to Michipicoten last summer, you told us that as soon as the new agent would be in office, he would give us the money which is to be given us for the land which we have surrendered at the Harbor.

She has had charge of the Indian school at Michipicoten since September 1901, and has been paid at the rate of $350 per annum. During that time the Department has been forced to raise the salaries of many of its teachers; in fact we are paying as high as $400 in a great many cases, and I doubt if we will in future be able to get any more teachers at less than $350 or $400. All that is provided for this school for the current year is $300, but I think that $50 additional might be included in next year's estimates, as the increased cost of living and difficulty in securing teachers for Indian schools seem to demand it, and when increases are made length of service should be taken into consideration.\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, October 10, 1907.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st ult., asking for an increase in salary as teacher of the Michipicoten River school, and in reply I beg to say that no provision is made for an increase in your salary for the present fiscal year, but your application will receive consideration when the estimates for next year are being dealt with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Now I have looked this thing up and I find out that any nation living off of the reserve and occupying land are subject to taxes same as white people and I do not see why these people are exempt. They have an Indian school here but it should be one on the reserve that is the place for it, not here. If you have any law or authority or that showing that they are exempt let me know by return mail.\n\nGeo Reed\n\nGeo Reed J.R.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nHave the honor to reply by\n\nletter of 27th Jan., 1896, in which we\n\ninformed you of Indians who attended\n\nthe R.C. Indian School at\n\nMackinac River, and\n\nto state that\n\na school section has been formed\n\nunder the Ontario School Act, and\n\nall property has been acquired under\n\nthe terms. Further have been elected\n\nand school opened in an occupied\n\nbuilding, etc.\n\nThere are five families of Indians residing\n\nat Mackinac part of the time at the Indian\n\nSchool, and an increase of attendance\n\nis noticed during the past year.\n\nFrom the fact that the Indian School\n\nis supported out of the funds of the Band and\n\nis virtually in the function of a Separate School,\n\nI have thought the Indians should be exempt from\n\ntaxation and therefore advised them not to pay\n\nuntil the matter was looked into.\n\nI have received the enclosed letter from Mr. La Rue, Jr.\n\nwho is one of the trustees.\n\nThe Secretary Department\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nIndian Agent\n\nMackinac River\n\nJuly 24, 1907\nOttawa, July 30, 1908.\n\nThe Acting Deputy Minister,\n\nA number of families of the Michiricoten River Indians reside at a point called \"The Mission\", some three or four miles east of the reserve. There is at this place a Roman Catholic Church and a school, to the latter of which the Department pays from the Parliamentary appropriation a grant of $350.00 for a teacher's salary. The building was erected by the Indians some twenty-nine years ago.\n\nThe influx of white settlers at this place has necessitated the formation of a school section under the Ontario Act, and the holdings of the Indians are within the boundaries of this section. Their property has been assessed for public school purposes, but the Indians consider that they are exempt from taxation and are refusing to pay the levy.\n\nIf the Indians have to pay taxes, there would not appear to be any need to keep up the Mission school, as they would be entitled to attend the public school; in fact the latter might be the better arrangement in any case.\n\nI think the Law Clerk might be asked for an opinion as to their liability. The correspondence is on this file.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. Clark\nOttawa, August 6, 1909.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nAssistant Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nI have Mr. Scott's memorandum of July 30, in reference to Michipicoten River Indians' school matters, and beg to say:\n\n1: That the property of Indians situated outside of a reserve is subject to taxation the same as the property of other people, and would, therefore, be subject to the public school rates unless the owners or tenants of the property are Roman Catholic and the supporters of a separate school in the municipality or the municipality contiguous thereto.\n\n2: The Indians' Mission school here, while it is Roman Catholic, does not appear to be an established separate school under the act, but rather a private school maintained by the Department. Under these circumstances I am of the opinion that the property of these Indians is subject to the public school rates and that the Indians have therefore a right to attend the public school. And I would favour Mr. Scott's suggestion that it would not appear to be necessary to continue the maintenance of this Mission school.\n\nLaw Clerk.\nOttawa, January 12th, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant applying for leave of absence as teacher of the Michipicoten Indian School and stating that you have secured a substitute, Miss Annie O'Donnor, a former Indian school teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your request is granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

She had living quarters over the school and Mr. Agent McNabb reports with regard to her loss that there is no doubt about the stove pipe being the cause of the fire. There was no chimney on the school-house and the pipe went through the roof and the fire started from an overheated pipe in her living quarters or from sparks getting in between the sheeting and the roof and her personal effects were all lost. They were able to save the school furniture and material, but they were not able to get anything out of the upper part of the building. Miss O'Connor only saved the clothes she had on and she submits an itemized list of her loss, which amounts to $211.00.\n\nMr. McNabb states that sometime ago he explained that the stove pipe was dangerous, but he could not have gone to the expense of having a chimney built on the old wreck.\nwreck of a building and he thinks that some compensation should be made her for her loss of clothing.\n\nIt is for the Department to say whether it will allow her any compensation and, if so, how much.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, June 25, 1915.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 21st of April, last, claiming compensation for personal effects which were lost in the burning of the Michipicoten Indian School I beg to say that the Department cannot favourably entertain your claim.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean\nSecretary of the Indian Department\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the past summer I have visited all the Indians on the north shore of the Georgian Bay, and on the west shore of Lake Superior. At Goulais Bay I met Miss O'Connor, then teaching in that school. This lady was engaged as teacher for several years in the Michipicoten River School.\n\nShe occupied rooms over the classroom of the school. She did splendid work in that school both as regards the secular instruction and moral formation of the children. I could see that in the children when I had them all before me for examinations on the occasion of my visit.\n\nShe is an excellent lady, and her good example had no small influence in the forming of the children.\n\nThe school at Michipicoten River was burned last February, and Miss O'Connor lost all her houseweds effects, a list of which with value of same I hereunto enclose. Miss O'Connor submits that the Department should compensate her for her loss. The agent of the department\nFor that District Mr. McRee himself admits that the fire was caused because of defects which the Department should have repaired in the school building and agrees that she should be compensated. In fact, the agent states that he has urged the Department to compensate Miss O'Connor for her loss.\n\nWhen I was at Michipicoten I took information on the spot and ascertained that the school was destroyed not on account of any negligence on Miss O'Connor's part but because of defects in the adjustment of stove pipes and the nearness of same to woodwork when passing through ceiling and partitions.\n\nOf course the whole upstairs was in a blaze before it was known the fire was discovered, although the teacher was in the classroom just underneath same. These being the circumstances, I believe the Department should compensate Miss O'Connor and hereby respectfully request it to do so.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of S.O.M.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nI beg to call your attention to letter hereunder from Bishop Scollard in which he advocates the claim of Miss O'Connor for her loss of her personal belongings which were destroyed in the fire which took place at the Michipicoten School in February, last. As I pointed out in my memorandum of the 24th of June, last, the fire was attributable to the want of a proper chimney in the schoolhouse and was not due to any carelessness on the part of Miss O'Connor. In the event of your re-considering this application I think $100.00 would be ample compensation for Miss O'Connor.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, September 13, 1915.\nOttawa, 14th September, 1915.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant on behalf of Miss O'Connor for loss of personal effects sustained by her owing to the burning of the Michipicoten School.

The fire was due to negligence in not having necessary repairs done. No reason given why they did not wish to do any work or make any expense they could avoid. They intended building a new school. I submitted a bill of two hundred and twenty-five dollars, a final estimate of expenses, which they have refused to pay, but have given me no reason therefor. I feel certain if you would, as our representative, take this matter up in my behalf, I could get some adjustment in matters, as the loss is more than I can properly afford.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nAnnis Coleman\n\nMr. A.

She has been in places like Michipicoten Mission and Goulais Mission on the outskirts of civilization for a number of years, and has given faithful service.

Scott, Esq.,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nRE- Annie O'Connor, Indian School Teacher,\nOgulais Mission.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter from Miss Annie O'Connor, with reference to the loss sustained by her when she was teaching the Indian School at Michipicoten Mission last February, in consequence of a fire which caused the destruction of her clothing and property, to the value of $250.00.\n\nIt appears from what Miss O'Connor says that the fire occurred in consequence of omission to make the necessary repairs to the building. I presume it is an old building, but it is very apparent that the loss was a serious one to this girl, who can ill afford to sustain it.\n\nOn general principles, as the fire was not due, in any way, to any omission of duty on her part, I would respectfully submit that it is a case for compensation, and knowing the affairs of the girl, and having regard to the fact that she has been in the service of the Department for the last Sixteen years, I think it would only be proper treatment to allow her compensation.\n\nShe had no insurance on her property, and it represented her all.\n\nWill you kindly take this matter up and let me know what you can do?\nJanuary 3, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Boyce,\n\nI have your note of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the claim of Miss Annie O'Connor for compensation owing to the loss of her property by fire when she was teacher of the Indian school at Kichipiooten Mission. Miss O'Connor has endeavoured to collect something from us on this account, but without success, and I am bound to say that I do not feel that we could favourably consider payment.\n\nWe have some hundreds of field officers of all grades and they are rather prone to make claims against the Department for losses in the discharge of their duties by accident or under other circumstance. It does not seem to me that Miss O'Connor has any claim, but I will be very glad to discuss the matter with you as well as the question of the change in her employment.\n\nA. C.

The fire was not, in any way, due to any omission of duty on the part of Miss O'Connor, and as she has been a faithful servant of the Department for the last sixteen years, I commended it to you, as a proper case for reasonable and fair compensation. Miss O'Connor had no insurance on the property, and the goods that were destroyed represented all that she had.\n\nIn reply to the above mentioned letter,\nHouse of Commons\n\nSault Ste.

The fire caught between the ceiling and roof and spread so rapidly that I was unable to get upstairs to save my own clothing, but the bulk of the Government property, which was in the school-room downstairs, was removed.\n\nThe building was old and inflammable, being constructed of logs, clapboarded outside and sheeted inside, and had no chimney, the stove pipe passing up through the ceiling and the roof.\n\nI have been in the Indian school service for about eighteen years and during all that time it has been impossible on the salary I received for me to save anything.

He explained that it had not been considered advisable to build a brick chimney because of the age and unsatisfactory condition of the building. The agent further explains the stove-pipe projected through the roof and consequently allowed the sparks to fall between the sheeting and the roof, and though at the time of the fire it was possible to save the school furniture and material, nothing could be taken out of the upper part of the building.\n\nThe accompanying inventory and statutory declaration attest to the fact that Miss O'Connor lost personal effects to the amount of $211.00.\n\nThe undersigned would recommend\nthat authority be given for the payment\nof the amount covered by the above mentioned\ninventory, money being available therefor\nfrom the Vote for Indian Education, No. 292.\n\nActing Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nTo reply to your letter of Aug. 10th., No. 16450, I have sent forward to Department the losses and estimated value of personal effects lost in the burning of the Michipicoten School February 8th. 1915.

T. Walkom, had been discussing with him the possibility of establishing a Combined White and Indian Day School at Michipicoten Harbour. Michipicoten Harbour is located about six miles from the Michipicoten Reserve and Mr. Sims states that there are practically no Indians residing on the reserve at the present time.\n\nIn company with Mr. Sims, I met Mr. McCormick and Mr. Walkom on the morning of November 6th and, in the course of conversation, it was found that, in the event of a school being established, there would be the following children, at least:\n\nT. Andree - 2 boys - 1 girl\nJ. Andree - 2 \" - 1 \"\nW. Boyer - 4 \" - 1 \"\nS. Andree - 2 \" - 2 girls\nMrs. S. Cash - 2 \"\nSimon Lewis - 2 \"\n\nTotal - 10 boys - 5 girls\n\nMr. Sims stated that all of the above are recognized as Indians.\n\nIn addition to the above, there would be six or seven white children whose fathers are working for the Algoma Central Railway and five children by the name of Perreault. This man was enfranchised about three years ago and is living at Michipicoten Harbour and, I understand\nunderstand, has spent practically all the money which he obtained at the time of his enfranchisement.\n\nMr. McCormick and Mr. Walkom wanted to know what the Department would be prepared to do towards getting this school started and I informed them that, as it was not on a reserve, we would not be responsible for the securing of a building or equipping it.\n\nMr. Walkom estimated that, if a proper building was secured, the annual cost of operating would be approximately $1,400., and asked if, in the event of the school being started, the Department would favourably consider making an annual grant of $700. I informed him that I would bring this to your attention and was inclined to feel that the Department would be favourably disposed to assist to the amount stated.\n\nMr. McCormick and Mr. Walkom realized that the Department could not assume responsibility for the erection of the building and stated that they would be well satisfied if, in the event of this being secured, the Department would assist in the annual maintenance to the amount stated in the preceding paragraph. If you approve, I promised Mr. Walkom that an official letter would be directed to him in order to permit him to make his arrangements for the securing of a building and obtaining a grant from the Provincial Government.\nOttawa, November 24th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Phelan has reported concerning the proposal to establish a Combined White and Indian School at Michipicoten Harbour. The Department is giving consideration but, before a decision can be reached, it is necessary to know if the proposed school will take the place of S. S. No. 4, Michipicoten. This white school has been in receipt of grants for Indian children fairly regularly up to, and including, the academic year 1928-29.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSIR,\n\nIn reply to your letter No.13-5-1 of Nov.24th, with reference to the proposed combined white and Indian school at Michipicoten Harbour, I have to say that this school does not take the place of S.S. No. 4 which is at Michipicoten River, about six miles distant from the harbour. This will be an entirely new school. I may say that some of the Indian children who attended the school at Michipicoten River, are now living at the harbour.\n\nThere are approximately twelve treaty children, seven non-treaty, and ten white children, now living at Michipicoten Harbour, all of school age.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 5, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the proposed combined white and Indian school at Michipicoten Harbour, and stating the number of children - treaty, non-treaty and white - of school age who could attend.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will allow a grant of $700 per academic year as from May 1, 1931, towards the maintenance expenses, salary of teacher, etc., provided there is an average attendance of eight or more treaty Indian children. Should the average be below this number, the Department would allow, instead of the grant as mentioned, a per capita grant based on the average attendance. It is understood that a proper building for carrying on classroom activity will be secured and equipped without expense to this Department. Returns showing the attendance of the treaty Indian children only should be forwarded at the end of each quarter on forms for the purpose, the same as in the case of Indian schools. Our grant will be paid quarterly, upon receipt of these returns.\n\nWe are informing Mr. J. T. Walkom, Public School Inspector, Sault Ste. Marie, accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nOttawa, December 5, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to a recent conversation with Mr. Phelan, an officer of this Department, regarding the establishment of a proposed combined white and Indian school at Michipicoten Harbour I have now to inform you that Mr. G. H. Sims, Indian Agent, states there are approximately twelve treaty children, seven non-treaty and two white of school age who could attend. If a proper building is secured and furnished to carry on class-room work without expense to this Department, we will be prepared to allow a grant at the rate of $700 per academic year as from May 1, 1931, provided there is an average attendance of eight or more treaty Indian children. In the event of the average falling below this number, a per capita grant only, based on the average attendance, would be allowed. Payment of the grant which this Department will allow will be made on receipt of the usual quarterly returns showing the attendance of Indian children, and cheques in payment of same will be drawn in favour of and sent as directed by you. I shall be pleased to hear when the building has been made ready and the services of a teacher have been secured.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Sims of the grant we will allow towards the carrying on of the combined white and Indian school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We have to request that you will encourage the Indian parents to see that their children attend regularly and take advantage of the opportunity offered them to obtain an education. Any assistance you can give towards encouraging a regular attendance will be appreciated.\n\nThe teacher should prepare, at the end of each quarter, a return on the form for the purpose, giving the names of the Indian children only, their attendance, etc. This return she should forward to you, in order that you can certify and forward same to the Department. It should be definitely stated on the return the name of the person to whom the cheque in payment of our grant should be sent. Please supply the teacher with the necessary forms for making her returns.\n\nWe will supply classroom materials, such as text-books, pencils, etc., required by the Indian pupils only, upon receipt of a requisition, which should be prepared by the teacher and forwarded through your office.\n\nIt is hoped that this school will meet with every success and that there will be a regular attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

H. Sims. She should forward the return to Mr. Sims, as it is necessary that he certify and send same to the Department, when payment of the grant will be made. The name of the person to whom the grant allowed by this Department is to be paid should be stated on the return.\n\nWe are communicating with Mr. Sims regarding the establishment of this school. It is hoped that it will meet with every success and that there will be a good and regular attendance of all the Indian children in the municipality.

No. 1, Michipicoten Harbour, has been issued and sent to G. B. Gray, Esq., Secretary-Treasurer of Board.\n\nPresent regulations of the Treasury Department require cheques to be issued in favour of the teacher, and, consequently, at the end of September a cheque was issued for $70 in favour of the present teacher, Harry Sussman. The cheque was addressed to Harry Sussman, c/o E. B. Gray, Secretary-Treasurer of Board, Michipicoten Harbour, Ont. Without the knowledge of the Schools Branch, Sussman's name was placed on the monthly pay list, and a cheque for October, amounting to $70, was also issued and sent in a similar manner to the one issued for September. We are now in receipt of the following letter from Sussman, which the Department cannot understand:\n\n\"Michipicoten Harbour,\nNov. 11, 1935.\n\nComptroller of the Treasury,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe account No. of the last cheque is B37724.

Please interview him, also the Secretary-Treasurer, in order that both of them will be aware of the contents of this letter. There is no necessity for Sussman to acknowledge receipt of salary cheques.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nDear Mr. Helen,\n\nHaving inherited Father Proulx's Indian Missions along the east shore of Lake Superior brings me somewhat into your sphere of activity also. You may rest assured that I shall try always to be reasonable, just as you may rest assured that I will always respect your decisions, etc., knowing, as I have reason to, your integrity and justice. This is not what is commonly called \"soft soap,\" but my sincere position.\n\nNaturally the education of the children on the reserve is one of my biggest concerns, also as the salvation of their souls is intimately connected with it. The whole principle of Catholic education and Catholic schools is based therein. Catholic children cannot get in public schools the necessary Catholic education they are bound to get\u2014and since we will all have to answer for it some day according to our responsibility, I feel under an obligation to write to you in regard to the Michipicoten Reserve children. I know of course that there are places where a Catholic school is impossible\u2014but the question that confronts me is whether in the country a Catholic school is not only possible, but in fact justifiable and before God, due to the children of the Michipicoten Reserve. As things stand, I am told:\n\n1) The reserve (Michipicoten) has no school;\n2) The Michipicoten Band pays $700.00 a year for the support of the white school at the Harbour;\n3) And the Indian children don't go to it because it is too far and too difficult in winter, and, they say, dangerous now (due to the necessity of passing under the ice bridge).\n\nI am not infallibly informed\u2014but has the reserve not a right or quasi-right to a school? Or would it not be able to support one for very little more than the $700.00 it now pays. And no matter what the cost, is there not their right to an education that is morally \"possible,\" etc., to conditions that would make the school suitable to their circumstances.\n\nIt is true, the $700.00 must be quite handy for the whites\u2014they can't have much to add to it.\nin order to finance their school. But it doesn't seem just to the Indians, so far as I can see. I am told only one Indian child went regularly to school last year, and only 3 or 4 for a short time. And yet there are 26 children for school according to the list the chief gave me. I enclose the list with their respective ages.\n\nThen there is the further fact that the Indian children are all Catholic\u2014 and the teacher at the Harbour is not. There is no need for me to develop this point. You can see the effect that must follow\u2014the non-reception of what is most essential to these children, that is, a Catholic education. Catechism is only one point\u2014it is not that that influences the children most\u2014it is the Catholic method and attitude that a competent and worthy Catholic teacher would impart. And the fact that the missionary can only manage to go there once a month at the most makes the need for a Catholic and Catholic teacher on the reserve at Michipicoten and centralized power to make attendance possible the year round, all the more urgent and necessary.\n\nI'm sorry I couldn't get this written to you earlier in the summer but it's never too late as long as the school is at the Harbour. I believe Father Paul Roma has already spoken to you about the matter in the past, and I trust you will pay your way here to provide the needed school. In the meantime, the funds are being wasted yearly as far as the Indians go\u2014and not by the Indians\u2014now can we say it is their fault\u2014because the school is certainly too far, and it is outside the reserve, and takes the children off the reserve?\u2014and it is not a Catholic school as they should have.\n\nThis letter may be long but I have tried to be clear\u2014we know the situation and when things are written at length. I shall hope for a favorable reply. With every best wish,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nE. A. Primrose\n\nMissionary.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 21, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Father Primeau:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant in connection with educational facilities at Michipicoten.\n\nI am not certain whether you wish a school built on the Michipicoten Reserve. At the time the Department first allowed the grant to the Michipicoten Harbour white school it was pointed out that these Indians were not living on the Reserve but were residing in the vicinity of Michipicoten Harbour. If this condition still prevails it will not be possible for the Department to erect a school for them because we are not permitted by law to erect day schools outside of a Reserve. I note the list of names that you have forwarded. Are you certain that all of these are recognized as Indians? As you are aware this Department has no responsibility for the education of halfbreeds. I am, therefore, returning it in order that you may check it again and make certain that all of them are recognized Indian children. When replying you might return the list again with any notations that you desire to make.\n\nWhen I receive your reply to this letter further consideration will be given to your request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Marie, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 4, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has recently received the September quarter return of the Michipicoten Harbour combined school and it is noted that the names of only 4 Indian children are shown.\n\nIn connection with the payment of a grant by this Department to the Michipicoten Harbour school I would direct your attention to official letter of December 5, 1930, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nAt the time we made this arrangement we were advised that the Michipicoten Indians were living on the Reserve but were living near Michipicoten Harbour and that there were the following recognized Indian children who should attend the Michipicoten Harbour school:\n\n| Name       | Boys | Girls |\n|------------|------|-------|\n| T.

Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nhow many recognized Indian families are living within two miles of the school. How many children of school age are there in these families? Why is it that the attendance has decreased to four? Have you received any request for the establishment of a school at some other point? Are the majority of these Indians living on the Reserve or are they living off the Reserve?

If by \"these Indians\" is meant \"the Sixty Indians\", then the first part of the above is not true, as I am told they always lived, as now, on the Reserve. And I know of no non-treaty Indians at the Harbour except one Indian woman married to a white man but they have only been married since November 1937, and have no children of school age yet. As for their residing in the vicinity of Michipicoten Harbour, it all depends on how much the word \"vicinity\" is stretched. I mentioned, if I remember rightly, in my first letter, that the distance is precisely one of the difficulties in the Indians' educational facilities here at Michipicoten, especially in the winter.\n\nI hope I have been clear.

I am writing from the Michipicoten Reserve. I have checked up on the list the chief gave me my last visit here and I have noted which were recognized as Indian children i.e., as Treaty Indians.\n\nYou ask if a school is desired to be built on the Reserve? Yes, that is my hope. The Indians are living on the Reserve and conditions have grown worse since my last letter as far as the white school at the Harbour is concerned. Those who want to go to the Harbour now have to go on the railway tracks at the Harbour, which added to the distance, makes the Indians keep their children home\u2014and in the winter time, when the snow plough has piled up the sides of the track, it would be a truce, they say.\n\nHowever, I don't advance these as primary arguments\u2014the main need is a school on the Reserve to which the Indians will send their children and where the children\u2014well educated\u2014will receive a Catholic education. This afternoon I went into the Harbour around 4 o'clock, and happened to meet the school children on their way home. There were only two of them (I spoke of the Indian children) and they said they were the only ones and that sometimes...\nOttawa,\nOctober 13, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to my letter of the 4th instant regarding the establishment of a school on the Michipicoten Reserve we have received the following list showing the names of children who would attend school if one were established:\n\nEliza Andre    Age 13 Treaty Indian living on Reserve\nElie Andre     \" 15 \" \" \" \" \"\nMary Andre     \" 12 \" \" \" \" \"\nThomas Andre   \" 15 \" \" \" \" \"\nArthur Andre   \" 10 \" \" \" \" \"\nMatthias Andre \" 7 \" \" \" \" \"\nJohn Cote      \" 7) Mother a Treaty Indian living on Reserve, separated from husband\nEmile Cote     \" 6) (a non-treaty Indian), mother living alone with children.\nMarjorie Cote  \" 11) \" \" \" \" \"\n\nMary Jordan    \" 12 Treaty Indian living on Reserve\nCharlotte Kashk \" 16 Too old now perhaps but a Treaty Indian living on Reserve.\nDella Kashk    \" 13 Treaty Indian living on Reserve\nEllis Kashk    \" 12 \" \" \" \" \"\nGeorgina Lewis \" 7 \" \" \" \" \"\nFrederick Lewis \" 13 \" \" \" \" \"\nAlbert Lewis   \" 11 \" \" \" \" \"\nChristopher Lewis \" 15 \" \" \" \" \"\nClorence McCoy \" 16 \" \" \" \" \"\nViola McCoy    \" 8 \" \" \" \" \"\nWilfrid McCoy  \" 11 Father a non-treaty Indian, living off the Reserve, mother dead.

Marie, Ont.\nDecember 26, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 12-5-1, December 20th, I beg to state that the number of recognized Indian families living within two miles of the school is ten. The number of Treaty Indian children of school age, living within two miles of the school is 12; non-treaty Indians, 6; halfbreeds, 1; total - 19.\n\nThe reason the school attendance has decreased to four is that the Indians claim the road conditions are unsafe, and that it is too dangerous to allow their children to go back and forth to school. There are large holes in the wooden bridge and bad mud conditions in wet weather. Also the road was blocked by the railway company when the new ore bins were built. The children are now compelled to walk the track between cars in order to reach the school. This danger could be eliminated somewhat by building a road parallel to the track.\n\nOn my last visit to the Reserve, the Chief and Council requested verbally that a school be built on the Reserve for the Indians. All the children mentioned above are living on the Reserve.\n\nI regret the delay in replying to your letters of Oct. 4th and 13th, and this was due to the fact that I was expecting Inspector McGookin to visit this Agency as mentioned in your letter of Oct. 13th, at which time I intended to discuss this matter with him before replying.\n\nTrusting this explanation is satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.P.G.

However, you do not make a definite statement in this regard and before giving the matter further consideration, please let me know if, in the event of a school being opened, it would be necessary to build a new building or is there any building on the Reserve that could be used for school purposes. The financial situation at the present time is so unsatisfactory that it is doubtful if funds can be obtained during the next year or two for the erection of a new school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Due to present economic conditions it will not be possible to consider providing the funds that would be necessary for the erection of a school on this Reserve during the summer of 1940.\n\nIn your letter of December 26 you stated that the attendance at the Michipicoten white school had decreased to 4. Under these circumstances the Department is not justified in allowing an annual amount of $700.00. However, we wish to deal fairly with the school board and consequently you should inform them that in view of conditions that have arisen payment of our grant at the rate of $700.00 a year will be discontinued on June 30, 1940. After that date if any Indian children wish to attend the Michipicoten white school and the school board is prepared to accept them the Department will allow an amount of $20.00 an academic year based on the average attendance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. R.F.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nApril 1, 1940.\n\nMr. Phelan,\nPlanning Division,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYou will probably recall my petition of last Fall for a Catholic school on the Indian Reserve at Michipicoten. In your last letter you mentioned that Mr. McCookin would be visiting the Sault Agency and that he would look into the matter. I have asked Mr. Lawrence, the Indian Agent, at times if Mr. McCookin had come, but have always had a negative answer. The school year is advancing and summer will soon be with us so I am writing again to see if something could not possibly be done before the beginning of a new school term next Fall.\n\nI don't think there is any need for me to go into the question of the need of a school or of its advisability again\u2014I think that is clearly enough stated in my former letters.\n\nPerhaps the Department is not prepared to make the outlay required to erect a school similar to that in other reserves. May I suggest then, in despair of a school like Neron Bay, Grand Bay, Longlee, etc., may I suggest that you permit the Indians themselves, or rather that you hire the Indians themselves to build a log school. It would provide them with work, and if properly directed should not entail any great expense. And if the Department has been able to pay from its own funds $700.00 a year up to now for the Indian\nChildren who went (or rather, didn't go) to the White school, then I think I can logically conclude that the Department could provide the salary for a teacher for the log-school that the Indians would build, and to which they would send their children\u2014a thing they don't do at present in respect to the White school. The educational level of the Michipicoten Indian Reserve is honestly pathetic. The children, if left as they are, that is, to roam and idle the day long, are certainly not going to become more energetic or self-supporting as they grow older. Their ignorance will but increase and their indolence with it; And if later on they become franchised, they would make sorry citizens indeed. And the moral atmosphere can never be improved or uplifted in an atmosphere of ignorance and indolence, or in other words so long as the children's education is neglected as it is at present. These are the facts\u2014I am not painting them up\u2014I have been among the Michipicoten Indians long enough now to speak as I have, I think, and I beg of you to do something in regard to my request that I may not labour in vain.\n\nHoping that this matter will receive favourable attention, and early attention, that thus something may be done before the fall, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nC.

Primau, B.J.,\nGoulais River, Ont.,\nOntario.\nCopy sent to Mr. Laurence\n\nOttawa,\nApril 4, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 1st instant with reference to the erection of a school on the Michipicoten Reserve has been brought to my attention.\n\nIn a letter dated December 26, 1939, Indian Agent Laurence stated that there were 12 Treaty Indian children and 6 non-Treaty Indian children who might attend a school if one were constructed on the Reserve.\n\nYou suggest that Indians be employed to erect a log school house. The construction of a building such as this would involve some expenditure and it is doubtful if it would be advisable to erect a log building as no doubt it would be necessary to provide accommodation for the teacher. The Indian Agent has already reported to us that there is no building at present on the Reserve which could be used for school purposes.\n\nAt the present time I am not in a position to state what amount will be available for the erection of new school buildings during the fiscal year 1940-41 as Parliament will not meet until some time in May. However, I cannot at the present time hold out any hope that funds will be provided for the erection of a building at Michipicoten as due to present conditions our appropriation will likely be reduced.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would see Indian Agent Laurence and discuss the whole situation with him. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. C. A. Primeau, S.J.,\nGoulais River P.O., Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nApril 4, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 17 and previous correspondence regarding the possibility of establishing a school on the Michipicoten Reserve I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter received from Rev. C. A. Primeau, S.J., also a copy of our reply.\n\nWhen Father Primeau calls on you the Department would appreciate your discussing the situation with him and if there is any possible manner of providing a school house you might let me know. The Department would like to give favourable consideration to Father Primeau's request but at the present time it is difficult to say when funds can be secured. Following the interview with Father Primeau you might let me know your opinion of erecting a log building as he suggests. What would such a building cost?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurende,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of April 4 and previous correspondence in connection with the possibility of establishing a school on the Michipicoten Reserve.\n\nI have recently reviewed the March and June quarter returns of School Section No. 1, Michipicoten, to which we have been allowing a payment at the rate of $70.00 a teaching month.\n\nOnly one Indian child attended this school during the March quarter and in the June quarter there were only three, one of whom attended for 21 days, another for 17 and a third for 5.\n\nApparently the Indians do not intend to send their children regularly to this school and under these circumstances the Department will have to either discontinue the grant completely or greatly reduce it.\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible your views with regard to the action that should be taken in connection with this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nAugust 30, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 13-5-1, August 6, I beg to state that I have been in touch with Father Primeau regarding the school at Michipicoten, and he is of the opinion that a log building could be erected suitable for a school, with quarters in the rear for the teachers' accommodation, at a cost approximately $1,000.00. This, of course, would not include the cost of the desks, stoves, etc., necessary to equip the school.\n\nFather Primeau stated that if this amount was granted he would be willing to look after the construction himself to make certain that the money was expended to the best advantage.\n\nI am of the opinion myself that with careful supervision a log school suitable for the purpose could be erected for the sum above-mentioned and doubtless this would be the best scheme.\n\nIf, due to the present economic conditions, it would not be possible to consider providing the funds that would be necessary for the erection of such a school the only other solution, in my opinion, would be to give the Michipicoten white school an allowance per academic year for Indian pupils who wish to attend. The farthest Indian home from the present school is not more than a mile and a quarter away. The Indian children would have to walk along the railway track for some distance to reach the school but the same also applies to some of the white children attending this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.P.G. Laurence\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 10, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to the situation at Michipicoten.\n\nAs no provision was made in the current year's appropriation for the amount mentioned in your letter that would be required to erect a school on the Reserve I regret that such action cannot be taken at the present time. The matter will receive further consideration when we are preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1941-42.\n\nIn view of the small attendance of Indian children at this school it has been decided to reduce our grant for the academic year 1940-41 from $70.00 a teaching month to $40.00 a teaching month and you should so inform those in charge of the Michipicoten Harbour White School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.P.C. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nThe Dept. of Finance\nOttawa, Ont., Can.\n(Indian Dept.)\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAm returning to you check for $420.00 to be re-issued, as Muriel Collins is not here any more. Also G.B.

If in favour of the teacher I should appreciate your advising Miss Collins' address.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.E. Mills,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nS.S.

Usually the cheque arrives here around Holiday time & the teacher has gone on holidays, or is hard to get in touch with. Hoping this is satisfactory.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA. E.

It is noted that Mr. Mills requests text books and supplies for seven Indian children.\n\nOn March 5th last we requested you to let us know the number of Indian children who were attending the Michipicoten Harbour School. Enclosed with your reply of March 16th was a letter from the Secretary-Treasurer in which he stated that there were two Andre children attending regularly and that two more Indian children would start during the summer. If, as stated, there are only four Indian children attending, it is not understood why text books, etc., are required for seven Indian children.

When Miss O'Conner came here by the advice of Dr Mc Gail I had her stop here till the epidemic was all over and her quarters were well fumigated, as soon as the Doctor in charge at Michipicot notified me that everything was all right Miss O'Conner went up.

An Indian School was operating there for some time under your auspices. There are about a dozen desks in the latter building which we could make use of and as we purpose taking care of the Indian children, by your consent, we will be pleased to have your authority to transfer seats/decks to the Public School Building.\n\nAwaiting your esteemed reply, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nDept. of Interior,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJBM/LB\nOttawa, Oct. 27, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 25th instant, requesting that the Department of Indian Affairs allow the Public School at Michipicoten River to use the desks lying idle in the Michipicoten Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent McHabb, of Sault Ste.

You are authorized to transfer the desks lying idle at the Michipicoten Indian Day School, to the new Public School. The Indian children in the vicinity have been promised the same educational facilities offered to the white community, and they should be encouraged to attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D.

MARIE, ONT.\nJuly 25th, 1928.\n\nRe Building a School at Michipicoten River, S.S.#4.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI submit herewith a statement re attendance of Indian children at the Public School in S.S.#4 Michipicoten. Would you be good enough to forward same to the Department?\n\nThe store now in use as a school house is not suitable, and there is a probability that it will not be available after midsummer. You are familiar with the fact that no suitable building is available in this settlement, and that nearly all the children are Indian or half-breeds.\n\nI understand your Department assume no obligation re education of non-treaty Indians; so that once an Indian is paid off in one sum in lieu of annual payments some other means must be provided for the children of such an Indian.\n\nNow the time has come apparently when a school house must be built. The cost will probably be somewhat over $1200.00. I am prepared to recommend that the Ontario Department of Education make a special building grant of $500.00 if there is any means of financing the whole. Ventures in this area should not, I think, be considered. Would your Department consider a special building grant of $500.00? If so I shall advise the trustees to make immediate preparations for building.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMr. Agent Sims,\nSault Ste.

Marie, in which he requests that this Department provide a grant to assist the School Board of the Michipicoten River S. S. No. 4 to erect a new school building. It is noted that he requests this Department to provide a building grant of $500.\n\nIt is not the policy of the Department to provide funds towards the cost of the erection of school buildings where the work is not under the complete control of this Department. The only assistance we could provide would be the continuance of the grant on the same terms as is at present paid for the tuition of the Indian children who attend. We regret that it will not be possible to provide the funds asked for towards the cost of the erection of a new school building, and you may inform the Public School Inspector accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mrs Whytall points out that the children have to walk quite a distance to the school, and find it hard to get home at the noon hour. This request is for the winter months only.\n\nMiss Munroe, the teacher, has signified her willingness to prepare the lunch for the children if food is supplied.\n\nI would recommend that the request be granted.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F.

We understand there is a number of Indian children attending white school at Michipicoten. I may say that the Department does not provide lunches for Indian children attending white schools or in the case of combined white and Indian schools.

There is nothing on file to show that Mrs. Swick paid for these things. In looking back on the file it is found that in November, 1902, Mrs. Swick was informed that a new stove had been authorized for her to replace the one worn out and it would appear that Mrs. Swick had no need to buy a stove as the Department supplied her with one.

There are some fifteen children of school age of whom four are treaty Indian children, the latter residing on the five acre reserve at above point. The only building available for use as a school is the \"McCoy\" house on this reserve now vacant and likely to continue unused, of which the present locate is Mrs. Barbeau residing at Goulais Bay. In consultation with your Agent at Sault Ste Marie, Ont., Mr. McNabb, he informed me that so far as he was concerned he would be pleased to recommend that this house be placed at the disposal of The Department of Education and would see Mrs. Barbeau personally in a few days and secure her terms.\n\nAs it is absolutely essential that speedy action be taken to avoid delay in levy of the necessary taxes, which delay would throw the opening of\nRussell T. Ferrier........\n\nschool into the next year, I would be glad on behalf of the Minister to have your decision at the earliest time possible and trust that, in view of the urgency of the need, it may be favourable.

It would appear that some of the inhabitants are still wards of the Government. In addition a number, according to their own statements, have within the last few years accepted a sum of money in lieu of yearly payments from the Indian Department. Only one family attending this school, the Cress family, are not Indian, or Indian in part. Statements as to receipt of treaty money are signed by those concerned and submitted herewith.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD. A. Walkom, Esq., B.A.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, July 27th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received from Mr. D. T. Walkom, B.A., Public School Inspector, Sault Ste. Marie, certain data as to the attendance and cost of maintenance of the white school at Gros Cap. He states that 6 of the pupils who attended during the past school year are wards of the Government, and he forwards certificates from the following who state that they receive treaty money, viz:\n\nMrs. E. Jendreau - 2 children,\nMrs. Barbau - guardian of Caroline Collins,\nMrs. Alex Neveau (Mary McCoy) - 3 children.\n\nThe Inspector states that he was forwarding to you a copy of the letter which he sent the Department.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a report as soon as possible as to whether the children above referred to are Indians, and if they are in receipt of treaty money. In this connection I would refer you to your letter of September 4, 1924, in which you stated that none of the children living at Gros Cap belonged to any Band. The Inspector has requested that the Department pay a proportion of the cost of operating the school, but before we can consider the matter it will be necessary to have the report asked for as to whether there are any Indian children in attendance or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. McNaughton, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th Instant No 13-7-1 in reference to Treaty Indian children at Gros Cap, and in reply have to say that there is only one Indian Child that is paid treaty money at Gros Cap she is from No 75 Garden River and adopted by Ben Reil.\n\nThe neveau Children's Mother Mary Mc Coy is a treaty Indian but her children are not on the list.\n\nThe Jondreau Children I know nothing about I think he must mean the Gingas children their Mother is No 15 Agawa branch but the children is not on the list.\n\nIn regard to the child under No 75 Bernadette Biron she lives as I said with Ben Reil no 19 Agawa Branch but they only live at Gros Cap during a few months in the summer their permanent home is at Goulais Bay and the little girl attends the School there.\n\nWhen I wrote you in September last there was no treaty Indian children living at Gros Cap.\n\nI understand that Mr Ben Reil intends moving back to Goulais in the early fall.\n\nXXX The Collina girl was enfranchised with her Father Charles Oquais No 26 Agawaa Branch in 1922. She is living with her Grandmother Mrs Wm Barbeau and only lives part time at Gros Cap her Home used to be at Goulais Bay.\n\nHoping this explanation is satisfactory.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.,\nActing Asst, Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, August 4th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 21st ultimo, enclosing data as to the attendance and cost of maintenance of the school at Gros Cap during the last school year, I beg to say that, after full enquiry into the status of the children who attended, it is found that they are not Indians.\n\nWhile Mrs. Ellen Gingras is in receipt of treaty money, her two children are not on the pay list. She is married to a half-breed, and the children take the status of the father. Mrs. Alex Neveau (Mary McCoy) is married to a white man, and the children are not in receipt of treaty money, and are also classed as half-breeds. The Collins girl was enfranchised with her father in 1922, and has ceased to be an Indian. She is not in receipt of treaty money.\n\nAs the children mentioned are not wards of this Department, it is felt that we should not be called upon to be responsible for any part of the cost of their education, and we regret, therefore, that it will not be possible to contribute to the cost of the maintenance of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He states that, for the past three years, Indian children have been attending the school, and that there is an attendance of about twelve Indian children each day.

In your letter you express no opinion as to the complaint, but recommend that if the missionary and the teacher cannot get along amicably together the latter should be removed; while the teacher in the statement you enclose from him asserts that the Bishop has been misinformed, and, in a letter addressed direct to the Department, maintains that he has been maligned and asks for an investigation. No report of inspection has been received since Mr. Hastings assumed the direction of the school, and the only charge against him is that contained in the Bishop's letter, which is written in a not over serious style and does not ask for any decided action, but intimates that he will ask for a change if he can offer a more desirable teacher.\n\nIt is impossible, therefore, in view of these\n\nJ. C. Phipps, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nthese facts, for the Department to take any action in the matter. You should fully investigate the charge against the teacher and report the result to the Department, making such recommendation as you, after such investigation, think wise. I must say that, judging from the teacher's communications, his qualifications would not appear to be of a very high order, and the certificate of cleanliness given him by the Chief and the other Indian is of a very indefinite nature. But, as I have already pointed out, the Department looks to you for a report sufficiently specific to enable it to take decisive action.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Dy. Sup't Com'l of Indian Affairs.\nIndian Office, Montreal\nSeptember 11\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to state that I have made inquiry into the complaints of ill-treatment against Mr. Charles Hastings, teacher of the school at this place. In reply to my inquiry one gentleman stated that he had been there for some time and wrote as follows:\n\n\"He spoke about his treatment in only two words, he was in hospital before he came here, two days in one place and three in another. I felt sorry for him being a stranger and I did not think he was so bad as the report, but I found he was much worse and had to tell him to find another place. The children were very dirty and full of disease, no one could believe he was so bad unless he knew him to be afraid. He is also disagreeing in other respects which I don't wish to mention. He may be better now, but I can say no apology for any attempt.\n\nWishing you success,\n[Signature]\n[Position]\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa.\"\n\"attempt at improvement, he was rather getting worse.\n\nI cannot learn that he got a shirt washed since he came to the Island, and he has very few changes.\"\n\nThe Rev.

He has been teaching for 25 years and has never worked harder or more faithfully in any school than in this one because the Indians are not...\namoment people and to you myself and think that they are imposed by us by all white people they know nothing about a public holiday or any other holiday we heard that both in school and they inside some compound it in sickness hints which if they have he has helped when they have no taste for I was going to write to Dr. Cromwell head of the Foresters which my husband is a member I prayed about this & was directed to write explain things to you if they Indians should be any untrue stories please do not believe them he has worked hard among them hard among them he was helping one another well Colonel of him he has sent them money whom he favored for them which he never gets back this he can not do at all times and then twice\nThemselves.

The Indians complain that Mr. Keatley is entirely failing in his duties, maintaining no order or discipline and takes no interest in the welfare of the children. These complaints were confirmed last year by His Lordship, the Bishop of Algoma, who reported that he had enquired carefully into the facts of the case when at Shigwanda, and that he had found matters as represented by the Indians.\n\nAt this time (last year)\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\ntook us action in the matter further than to ask an explanation from the teacher as to said charges, believing that the Indians had taken some offence against him which would pass in time. Mr. Keatley, in reply, emphatically denied all charges and averred that he was earnestly and honestly attending to all his duties as teacher, and that these complaints were without foundation. He further more stated that since he began to teach the school, he has been closely watched by the Indians and others, and that the knowledge of this fact prompted him to give the greater attention to the proper dispensation of his duties. Of late, however, complaints have been renewed against Keatley and I find that the animosity of the Indians is culminating in either their not sending their children to school or in prompting very irregular attendance.\nI believe that as Mr. Kelty does not suit the Indians, that they will not interest themselves in the teacher's efforts in behalf of their children; and, although I have been unable to find any fault with Mr. Kelty as a teacher, yet it appears that unless he is succeeded by one possessing the favor and confidence of the Band, that no good will result from the teachership of the school continuing as at present.\n\nLast year the Indians were desirous of having our Joseph Partidge, teacher of Perry Island, formerly of the Shingwauk Home, engaged to teach the school. Understand that Partidge holds a certificate for Entrance to High School but was uninformed as to his competency and character.

The Inspect. in his Feb. report, states that there has been some improvement in the attendance but that the teacher has much to contend against in the way of sickness and irregular attendance.

I would strongly recommend, if funds are available, that the work be commenced as soon as possible. I thought at first that the old Church building might be pulled down and the material saved therefrom used in the construction of a school house; but on examining it I found that it would not pay to demolish it, the cost of doing so would amount to more than the value of the material in it. It might be used as a store house for wagons, sleighs, farming implements &c, and the old school house could be used as a Council house. I estimate the cost for the materials and work at about $450 and would recommend Mr James Lewis of Sheguiandah as a most reliable man to superintend the work.\n\nAs regards the supply of wood I am quite convinced that the Chief has not acted squarely in this regard or the matter of cleaning the school house. I would not however recommend that he be censured in view of the negotiations now pending with respect to the adjustment of the money and land matters of the Band.\n\nThe Chief I think should be advised of the privilege of supplying wood to the school and receiving money for work such as scrubbing the school house.

Sometimes she will stay one hour in the school and then she will lock the school up and go back to the village. Sometimes she is not there for three or four weeks at a time. The children never know when this teacher comes she is teaching here.\n\nNow 2\u00bd years and if the teaching hours were all put together that she taught she did not teach one year all together out of the 2\u00bd it is an Indian school and she thinks she can do what ever she likes she never comes here any day that is not very fine. She says she is sick she is sick a good while and is always getting worse. There was no school here all summer hardly she came a day but once again the way she would loose the school. The middle of Nov. she put another girl in here place teaching until her year the children having a good time dancing & cutting up.\nOur school here is lost all together since this Miss Harmon came to teach here. I went down to Mr. Ross in the middle of June and told him about the school. He said he had her hired until he was paid then he would make a change. I kept count of the days she was not there from the middle of Sept. up to the 12th Nov. and again sent them in to Mr. Ross asking him for a change. He said he would send my letter to the Department and he told me the other day he got no answer yet now new year comes & no change we must have a change at once as we can't be fooled.\n\nBy this girl any longer we do not want a women teacher any longer cause she can't stand the work to the reserve she is sick all the time Miss Harmon don't teach an Indian school we had Mr. Ross really teaching here for 5 years he was always in the school mind his business no matter what kind of weather was he was always there doing keep him back from his work we want you hire him again for two\n\nChief William Ogimah\nJames Ogimah\nJames Supersmith\nWilson gateley\nWilliam Watahesh\nB.W. Ross, Esq.,\nIndian Dept.,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nOttawa 17th Jan. 1879\n\nSir,\n\nI have to ack. the receipt of your letter of the 24th ult. enclosing a letter from Chief Win Ogemah and three other Indians asking for the removal of Miss Florence Hammond, teacher of the Chequintah school. The Dept. has also received a letter directly from Chief Ogemah and some other Indians urging that immediate action be taken in the matter.\n\nIn reply I have to say that were there no other grounds for Miss Hammond's removal than the complaints of the Indians, the Dept. might have difficulty in deciding to dismiss Miss Hammond, as it is quite likely that the Indians are influenced by some\nextent by their desire for the appointment of a friend of their own in place of the present teacher; but as school Inspector Mr. Craig says that the school as at present conducted is useless, Miss H. meeting with no success among the Indians although having a good record amongst white children, there is no doubt that it is necessary to make a change in the teacher.\n\nYou may, therefore, notify Miss Hammond that her services will not be required after the June quarter.\n\nAs to the appointment of a new teacher, it is not at all probable that the Dept. will employ Mr. Keaton, who is recommended by the Indians, as his services as former teacher at the Big an Indian school were not satisfactory.\n\nBe good enough to notify Miss H. and the Indians to the above effect, and remind the Dept.\nin time to secure a teacher\nfor the September quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\nShegniandah Jan 27/98\n\nMr Ross\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been teaching the school again this week. I am Mrs Hammond. She has, I have just heard, become the possession of a daughter, and will not be able to continue to perform duty as a teacher. I would like very much to teach the school until Midsummer, if you could let me have the position. I will do my best to promote their interests, but not wish to take it under Miss Hammond, but as teacher having authority from you.\n\nIf you could give me an answer before Monday, school would not have to be closed. I think the Chief and\nothers will be agreeable.\n\nI hope you will give this your\nkindliest consideration\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n(Miss) A.A. McFarland\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of official letter of date 17th, with reference to the Shingwauk School.\n\nI regret to inform you that yesterday Miss Hammond became the mother of a daughter. This of course accounts for her late incapacity to teach School\u2014\n\nEnclosed you an application from Miss McFarland for the appointment as teacher until the end of the present half-year. She having acted as teacher for Miss Hammond for some time past. Chief Williams, Assistant from the Reserve called at the office today with reference to the Appointment of a new Teacher. I showed him Miss McFarlands letter and\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAnd, he the Chief said that the children liked Miss McFarland better than Miss Hammond. Others asked him to see that the children attended school regularly and that I would write his consent to appoint Miss McFarland as teacher, until I could hear from the Department at Ottawa. Others wrote the same lady to open the School on Monday and to continue as teacher until further notice.\n\nThe Chief asked that Mr. Kett be appointed as teacher. I stated him that this could not be done at present as the Department was considering matters connected with his late dismissal from the School.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would most respectfully recommend that Miss McFarland's services be\nbe heard until the end of\nthe present half year commit\na more suitable appointment can\nbe made. The Chief says she is a\nvery kind and industrious person\nand takes an interest in the school\nwill give kindly instruct me in\nthe matter\u2014\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nB.

Major, the teacher at Sheguianidah Indian school inquires if he may accept a position from the Howland Township Council. He states that it would necessitate his closing the school probably one day per month and that he would be willing to make up any time lost on school days by teaching on the Saturday following any such lost day.\n\nI would recommend that no objection be raised to such an arrangement as the salary of the teacher is small and this would augment his income to a certain degree.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 2, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr. Agent Sims has written the Department, reporting that the teacher of the Sheguianidah Indian school wishes to know if the Department would allow him to accept a position from the Howland Township Council, which would necessitate the closing of the school about one day a month. The teacher states that he would make up the lost time by teaching on the following Saturday.\n\nHe only receives $300 a year from the Department, and as the extra salary would be a great help to him, I cannot see that there would be any great objection to acceding to his request. He has been two years in charge of the school and the Inspector in his last report stated that he was doing excellent work and that his salary should be increased. If he is allowed to obtain this additional pay, I do not see that the Department would be called on to increase his salary.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nSir Redley,\n\nIf Mr. Major is allowed to accept this position it should be on the understanding that it will not affect the average attendance. There is no reason why all the pupils should not be able to attend school one Saturday a month.\n\nMr. Brown\nM.

Major, the teacher at Sheguianah informs me that the pupils at his school are suffering from hunger during school hours, that many of them do not bring any dinner with them as heretofore and those who do have very little.\n\nMr Major asks that he be allowed to purchase a bag of flour and some butter and that his wife will bake the flour into bread and he will serve the pupils at dinner time with the rations. He states that it will be a month or six weeks before the Indians will be able to get work so as to provide for their families as they should be provided for. As the request of Mr Major is not a very expensive one and as I have no doubt but what some of the children may be hungry at times and in view of the fact that if the pupils knew they would receive something to eat at school it would probably increase the attendance I would recommend that an expenditure of $6.50 be allowed in the purchase of flour and butter for the use above mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 13, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th inst., and in reply I beg to say I am hereby authorized to expend the sum of $50.00 for the purchase of supplies to furnish a mid-day meal to the children attending the Shaginawab school.\n\nThe account for the same should show in detail the articles purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

It is a common thing for children to come to school with little or no breakfast and they seldom get a dinner fit for their occupation. Some good bread with a little butter would be sufficient. In the spring of 1908 I gave the children of my school dinner for ten (10) weeks at a total cost of $6.50, my wife doing the baking gratis.\n\nF. W.

Major, teacher of the Sheguinadah Indian School writes me that he has purchased a business at Gore Bay and must take charge of it at once and that he would like to be relieved of the school as soon as possible. He goes on to say that his wife could take charge of the school until such times as a more suitable teacher could be found.\n\nMrs. Major taught the Sheguinadah school some time ago before she was married. She has not any qualifications and if she is given the school temporarily would not be entitled to receive any such a salary as is paid to her husband. The school is a very small one at the best. I have written the Bishop of Algoma advising him of Mr Major's wishes and have asked him to nominate a successor. I think that in view of the very liberal salary paid Major that he should be compelled to give proper notice when he wishes to quit and not such short notice as he has given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 30, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department accepts the resignation of Mr. Major, teacher of the Sheguiandah Indian school, and Mrs. Major may remain in charge till the end of the present quarter, her pay to be at the rate of $300.00 per annum from the time she takes charge.

I have the honor to report that the returns for the portion of the quarter that Mr. Major was in charge of the Sheguianidah School have been received and forwarded to the Department and I presume you have them before this.\n\nIn answer to the last paragraph of your letter I beg to say that the Bishop of Algoma, under date 4th Instant, in reply to an inquiry from this Office, informs me that he has a teacher that he intends nominating for the position, a young Englishman in his early twenties who has a fair English education gained in an English public school, no other qualifications.\n\nThe Bishop has not officially nominated the teacher but I am expecting daily to receive his nomination.\n\nIt is too bad that the school should be closed at this season of the year and I think the church authorities should be urged to appoint a successor to Mr. Major without unnecessary delay. Mrs. Major might have been allowed to keep the school open until the arrival of the new teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 23, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nAs Your Lordship is aware the Chequianah school is at present without a teacher and the Department would esteem it a favour if you would at an early date nominate a successor to Mr. Major.

Geo. Prewer, Anglican Missionary at Sheguianadah, has with the consent of the Bishop of Algoma, nominated Mr. Harry Cartlidge for the position. This is the teacher I mentioned in my letter to the Department under date 16th Instant. I would recommend that the Department approve of the temporary appointment of Mr. Cartlidge at a salary of $300.00 per annum his retention to depend on results.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 1, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo advising the Department that Mr. Cartlidge has been nominated for the position of teacher of the Sheguianah school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the Department would have liked to secure a teacher with qualifications for this school, as it is desirable that it should not be closed any longer than can possibly be helped, the temporary engagement of Mr. Cartlidge at $300.00 is approved, his retention in the position to be dependent upon the success with which he meets.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The late Agent, Mr. Sims, was asked for his opinion as to the advisability of keeping the school open and he stated that he thought it would be better to close the school and send the Protestant children to the Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste. Marie and the Roman Catholic children to the Wikwemikong Industrial School.\n\nThe Department approves of this and the school may remain closed. You should see that the building is properly protected. It will be necessary for you to interview the parents with a view to having these children recruited for the respective industrial schools, and report results to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. McLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, July 22nd, 1912.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department has decided to close the school at Sheguinandah on account of the poor attendance. The Indians and the church of England Missionary, Rev. Peever are very desirious of keeping the school open and ask that the Department give them another year's trial and they will prove that they want the school, by sending their children regularly.\n\nSome families have recently returned to the reserve so that now there are at least 18 children of school age to take advantage of the school if kept open.\n\nThe Indian parents stood up and held up their right hands at my request as a pledge to send their children to school regularly and those so pledging themselves can send 16 children.\n\nThe school house is in splendid condition and is being painted on the outside and nearly completed and as the Indians are sufficiently aroused to the importance of having the school kept open I would recommend that the school be kept open for another year and let the Indians prove their appreciation of education for their children. The last teacher was not a success and the parents were careless.\n\nMr. Fuller of the Shangrak Home was a teacher Sheguinandah when many of the parents went to the school as children and they were favorable at first to sending their\nchildren to the home knowing Mr. Fuller so well but they have changed their views and desire the children at home.\n\nRev. Peever has two teachers in view, one a young man without experience and an older man with experience, whom he can secure for $400 per annum which is small enough salary.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n(sgd) G. A. Conley.\nOttawa, July 25, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of June 22nd, last, in reference to the closing of the Sheguiandah School I beg to say that Mr. Conley of this Department, who recently visited the reserve in company with yourself, reports that the Indians are desirous of having the school kept open and have promised to maintain a fair and regular attendance if this is done.\n\nIn view of the circumstances the Department is prepared to comply with this request and will give the school another trial, its continuance, however, to be dependent upon the attendance and the success met with.\n\nMr. Conley states that Rev. Mr. Peever has two teachers in view. Mr. Peever should submit to the Department applications from each of these, accompanied by testimonials. These should be sent through your office. Kindly give this matter early attention so that final arrangements may be made to have the school re-opened on the first of September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\n\nWm. McLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nJuly, 27th, 1912.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a petition from the Indians, and a letter from the Rev. Geo. Prewer asking that the Sheguinandah School remain open and be given another chance.\n\nAs the Indians and the Rev. Prewer say they will endeavor to make it a success I would recommend that the School be kept open for another year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\nJuly 19, 1912\n\nWe, the undersigned members of the Shequianadah Band of Indians, learn with regret of the decision of the Department to close the day school on the Reserve and to petition the government that whereas there are 18 children of school age on the Reserve, to give us another trial, and we pledge ourselves to cooperate for the good of all, and to endeavour to have our children attend regularly.\n\nChief James Papewask\n\nWilliam Nahweeakishik\n\nWilson Gahkongai\n\nAlex Nahweegshik\n\nHenry Nahweegshik\n\nJohn Nahweegshik\nSipmanah - Oct\nJuly 18th 1912\n\nMr. McLeod Esq.,\nIndian Agent - Manitoulin - Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your favor of the 2nd inst. having reference to the decision of the Indian Department to close the Day School on the Indian Reserve here. I am both sorry and surprised that such a decision should have been arrived at without due warning being given and a thorough inquiry being made into the cause of the small attendance. No cause is given in your letter I only surmise that this is the cause.\n\nI cannot think that it is in the best interests of the Indians to close a school so recently built and at considerable cost, and therefore self-denial, on the part of the Board. A day school, apart from its value as a teaching institution, is valuable as a means to turn the people to acquire settled habits, where if their children are taken away to industrial schools, the people carry to the camp with which they can imprint from place to place, abandon their homes and allow their children to run to wander forth and seek, and take to dissolute habits around the centres of civilization, where whisky and gambling play a very prominent part. And then, when their children, fitted for a more civilized mode of living than in the trading post institutions, return to their homes, there is no preparation. Angels where they can carry out more fully the knowledge they have acquired; but instead have to take occupation in questionable pursuits. Our Industrial Schools aim at doing a good work. But their aim is primarily to look after the Orphans and Destitute Children of our Indians, where it seems, as it was,\nA second parent. But for the family life of the Indian I cannot see anything more beneficial than the way School and it is difficult to imagine what impression the Indians will get of such an act of the Department in closing an Institution which has existed for somewhere about 50 years without a break. There is, however, fault on the part of the Band in failing to appreciate the full benefit of the work by sending their children, and a threat only has the effect of weakening them to the situation, but I think it would be most unwise to close the school at this juncture, especially when the chief, James Papenack, who is a most efficient man, and whose re-election to the position is already making itself felt as he hastened to draw back to the centre various members of the Band who have, for various reasons, scattered away, and has succeeded in bringing back two families, which adds a nice children of about age to the list. There are now 18 children of about age, or about school age, resident on the Reserve, and I think it should not be difficult to maintain an average of from 9 to 10.\n\nAt a meeting of nearly all the male members of the Band held in Muskegina Hall yesterday morning, a resolution was passed, and unanimously carried, requesting the Department to reconsider their decision to close the school and have it re-opened after the holidays. At which time every one having children of school age would be assured to send their children.\n\nIn order to facilitate matters I propose to submit the following plan:\n\n1st. That an adequate salary be paid to a teacher, whether of say $600 for the year after which, upon general approval, the amount be raised to $700 and in the case of a married man a dwelling be provided with privileges of farm for garden and firewood.\n\n2nd. That certain provisions be made whereby children could organize a lunch.\nDuring the warm hours, and that an equipment be maintained, as far as possible, for sports and calisthenics, and that the boys be instructed, in addition, in gardening, farming, and the care of stock, and the girls in sewing and housework, and that provision be made for this in the warm hours, and for time given to teach them additions if the teacher is not qualified.\n\nThat a School Officer be appointed at a nominal salary whose duty it shall be to see that children of school age be in attendance, in case of default that the parties responsible be brought before the Court, and be fined or imprisoned, as he may judge best.\n\nI have little hesitation in saying that if these suggestions are carried out just deal better results will follow.\n\nAnd I have most respectfully to ask the Department to consider their adoption and for the school another trial.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeo. Pheon.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nAugust, 10th, 1912.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to report that The Bishop of Algoma nominates Theodore V. L'Estrange, as teacher of the Sheguandah Indian School.\n\nThe Bishop says he has no Canadian certificate but believes his education to be sufficient, and it was obtained in English Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont..\nOttawa, August 13, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant advising the Department that His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma has nominated Theodore V. L'Estrange as teacher of the Sheguianah School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department was advised by Mr. Conley, when he returned, that there were two qualified teachers in view for this school and if such is the case the Department would prefer to engage one of them. The matter is being taken up direct with His Lordship. The Department would suggest that you should communicate at once with His Lordship giving him the names of these two teachers with their qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. McLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, August 13, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. William McLeod, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, in which he states that Your Lordship has nominated Mr. Theodore V. L'Estrange as teacher of the Sheguianish School. It is stated that Mr. L'Estrange has no Canadian certificate nor other professional qualifications as a teacher.\n\nI may say that when an officer of the Department recently visited this reserve the missionary in charge informed him that he had two qualified teachers in view, one with experience and the other without. In view of this fact the Department does not wish to approve Mr. L'Estrange's appointment until it hears from Your Lordship. If Canadian teachers with certificates are available it is considered that they would do much better work than one without such qualifications. As Your Lordship may be aware it was the intention to close this school and it was upon a representation of the Indians that they would send their children regularly to school that a change was made in this decision. There has been a lack of interest in the school work here, owing, it is believed to the apathy of the teacher, and if a competent teacher is not appointed there is little likelihood of any success.

I have asked the Immigration Department at Quebec to pay my passage, but I do not know yet if I shall get it.\n\nIf I do, and in the meantime, have received July and August money from you, I will at once refund it to you.

Levis, Esq.,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been teaching on some of the holidays to make up for time lost in Sept.\n\nBefore Christmas, I taught on Thanksgiving Day and also a few days of Christmas holidays, and I have taught all of Easter holidays including Good Friday & Victoria Day.\n\nWould I be allowed to teach a few days in July to make up my full academic year of 197 school days. A few days of July would do it. I would then have a full year & could claim full salary of $450. Inspector Phillips allows this in White schools & I do not see why Indian Dept. would not as well.\nInspector Phillips tells me that some of the teachers in Indian Day schools are getting $500, and that Miss Shultz at Sucker Creek is getting that amount.\n\nI would like to make up $450. I could have done much better in a white school, but under the circumstances, I must not complain. The work fell to me; I took it as a make-shift to help the Bishop out. Still I am anxious to make the best of it now.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nP.S. - Does the Indian Dept allow a teacher 10 cords of wood for his own use? I have not received any. Mr. Murray says he has been informed by Mr. Prater that they are allowed this amount, so I thought I would ask you.\n\nP.S. - I have not received any.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter from R. S. Ferguson, teacher at Sheguiandah Indian School, requesting to know if he teaches a few days in July to make up his full academic year of 197 school days, as he did not start to teach until the first of October, if the Department would pay him the full year's salary of $450.00, also if the teacher is allowed 10 cords of firewood for his own use.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that the Department advise me as to what I should give Mr. Ferguson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing a communication from R. S. Ferguson, teacher of the Sheguiandah Day School, in which he requests permission to be allowed to teach a few days in July to complete the number of days required in order to receive a full yearly salary, $450.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say the Department will have no objection to Mr. Ferguson teaching the time required to complete his school year during the month of July, next. He should, however, forward a return for the period taught during the quarter ended June 30th, next, as well as a separate return covering the period which he teaches during July.\n\nI am enclosing, herewith, a copy of the Indian Day School Regulations in which you will see that all Indian schools shall be kept open not less than 200 days in each year, in order that a full yearly salary can be earned by the teacher.\n\nThe Department cannot accede to the teacher's request to be allowed 10 cords of fire wood for his own use, as when his services were engaged it was only stipulated that he was to receive a salary at the rate of $450.00 per year.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

I have observed in adult Indians and even in those who have not reached their prime that their teeth are almost invariably in a state of decay. This of course must greatly affect the health of the community. Even the teeth of the children are very much in need of proper care. I have fifteen children in the register but hope for more and if the Department would send me two dozen toothbrushes and the necessary amount of tooth paste I shall teach them to care for their teeth taking care that the brushes are not used indiscriminately and that they where they might be infected from each other.\n\nI shall also draw your attention to the position of the vacations allowed at Christmas.\nand Easter which I think might be improved. On disagreeable days in the winter the Indian children spend their time around the stoves in unhealthy houses when they would be much more advantageously occupied in the sunny school-room.\n\nIn the spring, however, the temptation of playing outdoors in the woods and sunshine often interferes with their attendance and the school is at great restraint. Then they are very often needed by their parents to work at the seeding. I consider that they would make more satisfactory progress if school were kept open on Saturdays throughout the winter, and also through the Christmas vacation with the exception of Christmas Day, and then closed a corresponding number of days earlier in June. I should also mention that strawberry picking interferes with attendance in the latter half of June. At sugar making time the children all go with their parents to make maple sugar and if the Easter vacation, with the exception of Good Friday, Easter Sunday, and Easter Monday, were given them, the attention...\nfor that quarter would be considerably improved. If the Department sees fit to allow me to make these changes I am sure that the new arrangement would be more adapted to local circumstances.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nDouglas Murray.\n\nThe Dept., of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 5, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to furnish this Department with two dozen tooth brushes and twelve boxes of camphorated chalk at the prices quoted by you, viz.- $1.50 per dozen for the brushes and 50 cents a dozen for the chalk. These supplies are for the Shiguandah Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Stewart\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nWeldon J. Graham, Esq.,\nDruggist,\nSparks St.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 5, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo asking the Department to send you two dozen tooth brushes and the necessary amount of tooth paste for the use of the children attending the Sheguian-dah School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is sending you two dozen tooth brushes and a supply of camphorated chalk for the use of the children in your school.\n\nIn reference to taking holidays, you will see from the copy of the Indian Day School Regulations enclosed that it is provided that where it is in the interests of the school work holidays may be taken at some other time of the year and the Department will approve of your keeping the school open during the Christmas and Easter holidays and closing it for a like period during seeding time and while the Indians are away at the sugar bush in the spring. This arrangement must not interfere with the actual number of teaching days required, viz.\u2014two hundred during the year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nDouglas Murray, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSheguian-dah Indian School,\nSheguian-dah, Ont.\nReport OF INSPECTOR PHILLIPS ON THE SHEGUINADAH C.E.SCHOOL.\n\nMaple sugar making interferes seriously with school attendance and could be remedied by having Easter vacation then. In the spring school becomes irksome and children are needed for seeding, also in June strawberry picking interferes. This could be remedied, by having school closed at the commencement of seeding and teaching instead thru' the Christmas vacation and on Saturdays throughout the winter. In this way better discipline could be maintained and the children would be busy in the sanitary school room instead of spending the days on which school is closed around the stoves in unhealthy houses. This arrangement would be more adapted to local circumstances.\n\nThe health of the children would be improved if tooth brushes were supplied at the school.\n\nDate of Inspection,-October 14th, 1915.\nExtract from Teacher's Salary Voucher for the Sheguiandah Indian Day School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1915. Original on File 151707-3.\n\nREMARKS:\n\nMr. Murray claims to have authority from the Department to teach on Saturdays, Xmas and Easter holidays, in order that he may close the school on the first of June. I consider this a great injustice to the children as those little Indian children enjoy their Xmas holidays just as much as any white child and it is much better for those who have any distance to walk to attend in the month of June than it is for them during the rough Saturdays and holidays in the winter time.\n\nSgd. R.J. Lewis,\nAgent.\nOttawa, January 13th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nYour statement, on the quarterly return of the Shenguandah day school, that you consider an injustice is being done to the children, in allowing the school to remain open during the Xmas and Easter holidays has been noted.\n\nWith reference to this, I beg to say that the Department granted Mr. Murray, permission to keep the school open during the Xmas and Easter holidays, and to close it during seeding time and while the Indians are away at the sugare bush.\n\nThis permission was granted at the request of the teacher, and on the recommendation of the Inspector, who stated that, if the school was kept open during the usual holidays and closed during the above mentioned times, the attendance would be more satisfactory and the children would make better progress.\n\nIn view of your remarks, the Department wishes to know if any of the Indians have complained to you about this matter, and also, any further statements you wish to make with regard to this arrangement.\n\nIt is understood, however, that the above must not interfere with the actual number of teaching days required, viz: two hundred during the year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nR.J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR PHILLIPS ON THE SREGUINANAH SCHOOL.\n\nThe Principal should become better acquainted with the Indian language so as to reach the little ones, who learn and hear the Indian language at home. It takes a long time for these children to get English when they are speaking in Indian at home. They do not mix much with white children.\n\nDate of inspection, May 19th, 1916.\nExtract from letter from His Lordship the Archbishop of Algoma dated the 15th of August, 1916. Original on 151709/1.\n\nDuring my visit to Sheguinabah I was sorry to learn that the teacher of the school is seriously out of harmony with the clergyman, the Rev. H. F. Hutton. The young man has imbibed peculiar notions which seriously interfere with his work and influence. He refuses to resign. I suppose the only way is to request the Department to relieve him. This I suppose should be done through the local Agent, Mr. Lewis.\nOttawa, August 26, 1916.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of Your Grace's letter of the 18th instant in reference to Mr. Murray, teacher of the Sheguandah Indian School, I beg to say that Mr. Agent Lewis is being instructed to inform Mr. Murray that his services will not be required as teacher of this school after the end of the current quarter. The Department would like Your Grace to nominate a suitable teacher to take charge of this school on the first of October, next.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. Geo. Thorneloe, D.C.L.,\nArchbishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, August 26, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma in which he states that during his visit to Sheguiandah he was sorry to learn that the teacher of the school, Mr. Murray, is seriously out of harmony with the clergyman, the Rev. H. F. Hutton. His Grace also states that the teacher has imbibed peculiar notions which seriously interfere with his work and influence and that he refuses to resign.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Mr. Murray that his services will not be required as teacher of this school after the end of the current quarter. The Archbishop has been asked to nominate a suitable teacher to take charge of the school on the first of October next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowanins, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that Mr. Douglas Murray, teacher of the Sheguiandah Indian School and the Anglican Church authorities are not in harmony, and it appears to be an impossibility for them to work together as Mr. Murray will not set a good example to the Indians, which the church authorities consider he should do.\n\nI have been to Sheguiandah and interviewed Mr. Murray in this matter, and found him very contrary and disrespectful to the church authorities, and he informed me that he would rather lose the school than do otherwise than he has been doing in the past.\n\nAs I consider that there is no possible chance of having a settlement between Mr. Murray and the church authorities, I would recommend that the Department should cancel the appointment of Mr. Murray, as teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Murray,\n\nI regret to say that relations having become strained between the Rev. H.J. Nutton of Shequianada and Mr. Murray teacher of the Indian Day School in that place.\n\nMr. Murray it seems has in some way acquired strange notions which are opposed to the Church's teaching. For example he thinks it quite right to work on Sunday and neglect attendance at the Sunday Service. He also has come to disbelieve the Christian doctrines of the Holy Trinity and the Divinity of our Lord. And he acts and teaches in accordance with these newly acquired views.\n\nI called the attention of Mr. Lewis,\nThe Indian Agent at Hamilton refers to these facts; and after looking into matters and interviews with Murray and Mr. Hutton he writes me that he has decided to recommend that the Department cancel Mr. Murray's appointment as he is of the opinion that Mr. Hutton and Mr. Murray cannot work together.\n\nMr. Lewis suggests that I should write you this letter of explanation. I hope very soon to be able to suggest a successor to Mr. Murray.\n\nI am\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Murray\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nI have just received your letter of the 26th inst., informing me that your Department is taking steps to relieve Mr. Murray of his charge at Skegimondok. I will shortly submit the name of a young person to succeed him.\n\nWith sincere thanks,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Agona\n\nJ.W. McLean Esq.,\nAss't Deputy Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, O.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nSeptember 8th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Official Letter No. 151709/I of the 26th ultimo, I have the honor to report that His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma has requested me to recommend to the Department Miss Maggie Ferris for the position as teacher of the Siegianah Indian school, to succeed Mr. W. D. Murray who is in charge until the first of October. His Grace states that this lady is twenty-one years old, and has not any certificate but that she is qualified to teach the pupils at the Siegianah school, and the church authorities count on her getting a permit to teach from Mr. Phillips, Public School Inspector for District of Manitoulin.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that the services of Miss Ferris be secured and she be paid a salary at the rate of $450.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, September 12, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant stating that His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma has requested you to recommend Miss Madge Ferris for the position of teacher of the Sheguianish Indian School, to succeed Mr. W. D. Murray, who is in charge until the first of October.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the appointment of Miss Ferris as teacher of this school, her duties to commence on the first of October, next, and will allow her a salary at the rate of $450.00 per annum. You will be good enough to inform His Grace accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, October 21, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your remarks on the voucher for the salary of the teacher of the Negaundah School for the September quarter, last, that Miss Ferris has asked that her salary be raised to $500.00 per annum, starting from the first of the current quarter, I beg to say that the Department is unable to make any increase in Miss Ferris' salary at the present time. She has, however, been granted a bonus of $150.00 for the current fiscal year and a cheque for $75.00, the amount of the bonus for the June and September quarters, last, has been sent her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Original on 151707-3\n\nMiss Ferris has asked that her salary be raised to $500.00 per annum, starting from the let of the current quarter as the cost of living is so high at the present time she cannot live on the amount she is receiving.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that her salary be increased to $500.00 per annum.\n\nSgd. R. J. Lewis\nAgent.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nFebruary 17th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that I visited the Sheguiandah Indian Reserve on the 11th Instant, and found the school closed. After making enquiries about the teacher I was informed that she was visiting some friends on a farm a short distance from Sheguiandah, and that she did not intend to resume her duties as teacher. About one hour ago I was advised that she left for her home at Garden River this morning, but she has not forwarded her resignation to this office yet.\n\nHis Grace, The Lord Archbishop of Algoma, has written me stating that Miss Ferris was about to resign her position as teacher at Sheguiandah School, and that he is in a position to recommend the appointment of Mr. Malcolm Roberts as her successor, and that he would be obliged if I would communicate this nomination to the Department with my recommendation.\n\nI advised His Grace of the Minister's wish, transmitted by circular letter of the 12th of November last, that the services of returned soldiers should be secured to fill vacant positions.\n\nAs there is not a returned soldier in this district that I know of, that would take charge of this school, I will leave the matter with the Department to decide if Mr. Roberts should get the appointment, but it is desirable that immediate action should be taken to secure a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 21, 1919.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Agent Lewis, in which he states that Your Grace has written him stating that Miss Ferris was about to resign her position as teacher of the Shagwunash school and that you are in a position to recommend the appointment of Mr. Malcolm Roberts as her successor.\n\nI have to ask Your Grace to be good enough to request Miss Ferris to forward her resignation as teacher of this school to Mr. Agent Lewis, who is being informed that, when he receives her resignation, he may appoint Mr. Roberts to the position at a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

When you receive her resignation you may appoint Mr. Roberts to the position at a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum.\n\nYou will be good enough to forward Miss Ferries' resignation to the Department and state when she gave up her duties at the school and also the date on which Mr. Roberts takes charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

This rather complicates matters, but I think I have in view a returned soldier who will be a suitable candidate for the position if I can induce him to consent to enter upon the work. I will write you further on the matter.\n\nRegretting that I have been the innocent cause of so much trouble, I remain,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nMcLean, Esq.,\nSuperintendent & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 3, 1919.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the matter of a teacher to replace Miss Ferris at the Shegandah Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted that Mr. Malcolm Roberts, to whom an offer of the position was made, has entered upon other work and that you have in view a returned soldier who will be a suitable candidate for the position.\n\nThe resignation of Miss Ferris has not yet been received and if she did not return, the school may remain closed for the balance of the current quarter.\n\nIt is hoped that a suitable teacher will be secured in time to begin duties on or about the first of April next.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nMost Rev.

It is not easy to find one who is in every way suitable.\n\nThere are two persons who are considering the proposal to offer their services. I can recommend both as to character etc. One is a man, the other a young woman of 21. Neither has a certificate. The man has taught in England in the junior classes, in Grammar school, other good testimonials; but he has been in Canada some 10 years during which period he has done no teaching. The young woman has merely a\nPublic School Training but is keen and anxious to make good. She is highly intelligent. Her lack of higher training has been due to lack of opportunity.\n\nI pass the task of selection on to the Departmental. Mr. H.G. Watts the man referred to is brother of the Mr. Watts who, I think, is teaching at Walpole Island.\n\nMiss Gladys Skipper. The young woman is living at Green Bay on the Mississaugas' Trunk Island.\n\nThirdly let me know whether the Department will, for the present and for lack of fully qualified candidates, accept one of these, and if so which.\n\nMr. Watts is married but has no children.\n\nYours\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nJ.M. Leam\nSec'y to Indian Dept:\nOttawa, O.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMiss Ferris, teacher of the Sheguiandah Day School, has been transferred to Garden River to replace Mr. Hardman temporarily. The Archbishop of Algoma, who was asked to nominate a successor to Miss Ferris, states that he has two applicants in view, one a man of at least forty years of age and the other a young woman of twenty-one. Both are of excellent character and the man has had some previous experience in England, but the girl has never taught. The Archbishop passes the task of selection to the Department.\n\nMr. Watts, the man referred to, is a brother of the teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 School. Mr. Inspector Conn gives a very favourable report on the work done by him at the Walpole Island School, particularly in regard to gardening and manual training. The Mr. Watts referred to by the Archbishop is a married man, without children, and I would be disposed to let him take temporary charge. Sheguiandah is an out of the way place and hardly suitable for a young, inexperienced girl. The highest salary we have paid at this school is $500.00, but a married man could hardly be expected to go there for less than $600.00 per annum.\n\nThe last census shows that there are 121 Indians on this reserve and there should be about 25 children of school age there.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, April 9, 1919.\nOttawa, April 11, 1919.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 7th instant in regard to the appointment of a teacher for the Sheguianidah Indian Day School, and stating that you have two persons who are considering the proposal to offer their services for this position, one Mr. H. G. Watts, who has had experience in England, and the other Miss Gladys Skippen, who has only had public school training, and that you can recommend both as to character, etc.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as Sheguianidah is an out-of-the-way place and hardly suitable for a young inexperienced girl, Mr. Watts may be placed in charge of this school temporarily. He will be allowed a salary at the rate of $400.00 per annum and he should begin his duties on the 28th instant, the date on which the schools re-open after the Easter holidays.

Watts, teacher of the Sheguiandah Indian Day School, applies for an increase in salary.\n\nMr. Watts began duties at this school on May 4, 1919. His appointment was recommended by His Grace the Bishop of Algoma, who stated that Mr. Watts taught in England in the junior class of the Grammar School and had good testimonials.\n\nInspector J. W. Hagan, who visited this school on December 10th, last, reports regarding the teacher, \"He holds no certificate and has had very little experience in teaching. This has been a decided handicap to him. If he makes proper use of the manuals he should improve. Mr. Watts lacks experience but may do better as he gains experience.\"\n\nThe enrolment at the Sheguiandah School for the quarter ending March 31st, last, was 16 with an average attendance of 6. At the present time Mr. Watts receives a salary of $600.00 per annum, $450.00 of which is paid from Band funds and $150.00 from Vote. In addition to his salary Mr. Watts receives the bonus allowed to teachers namely, $150.00 per annum.\n\nI will be pleased if you will state what answer should be made to Mr. Watts' request.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, May 12, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo applying for an increase in your salary as teacher of the Sheguindah Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department cannot grant you any increase at the present time, as it has no funds available for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The December quarter return shows an enrolment of 13 with an average attendance of only five. The Inspector states that the number of Indians on this reserve appears to be growing smaller and that they take very little interest in the school. The Inspector's report also shows that the teacher is not exerting himself to any great extent.\n\nOn your next visit to this reserve you should interview the Indians and point out to them the necessity of sending their children regularly to the school.\n\nThe Department would also like to hear from you whether you consider that, in view of the decrease in the number of Indians on this reserve, it would be advisable to consider closing this school. It would appear from the Inspector's report that it would be preferable to place the children of school age on this reserve in a residential school. However, before taking any definite action the Department will await your report.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nONT.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nFebruary 7, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to Official Letter No. 19-3-1 of the 25th ultimo, in regard to the report made recently by Mr. Inspector Hagan on the conditions of Sheguianadah School, I have the honour to report that I visited this school on the 4th instant, and found for the current quarter an enrolment of ten pupils with nine pupils present on the day of my visit and an average attendance of seven for the quarter so far.\n\nThe pupils are not progressing as favourably as they should, but on account of there being a great deal of sickness among the children on the reserve they were unable to attend regularly and, therefore, could not be expected to advance rapidly.\n\nI spoke to several of the Indians pointing out to them how necessary it is to see that their children would attend school more regularly in the future, and if the school register did not show a better average for this quarter the school is liable to be closed and all the pupils of school age placed in residential schools. The Indians assured me that as now sickness had disappeared from among the children on the reserve they would see that the children would attend regularly.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that the school be kept open for the current quarter, and at the end of the quarter if the attendance does not show a better average, and better progress in the class-room, then, I would recommend that the school be closed.\n\nBefore the end of this quarter I will make another report to the Department on the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 14, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the attendance at the Sheguiahah Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, this school may be kept open for the current quarter, but, if at the end of the quarter the attendance does not show a better average and better progress is not being made in the class-room, the school should be closed. It is noted that you will furnish another report as to the attendance, etc., before the end of the quarter. You should also, at the same time, furnish your views as to whether the school should be continued, or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the Sheguiandah Indian Day School for the month of February, 1921, Original on\n\nWhen Passing through Sheguiandah Village on the 22nd instant I visited the school and found the attendance much better than when I made my last report to the Department on the conditions at this school and better progress is being made in the class-room. Mr. Watts, the teacher, appears to be taking more interest in the pupils in the class-room. As long as the school register shows an average as it has for the past two weeks I would recommend that the school be kept open.\n\nR. L. Lewis,\nAgent.\nOttawa, March 5, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Sheguiandah Indian Day School for the month of February, last.\n\nIn connection with the continuing of this school I beg to say that, as you report a better attendance and also progress being made in the class-room, the Department will consent to the school remaining open as long as the attendance keeps up and progress is being made. The question of continuing this school in operation will be left in your hands and, when you consider that the attendance does not warrant its being kept open, you may, after notifying the teacher to that effect, have the school closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. L. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Sheguiandah School, April 10, 1922, 19-3-6\n\nMr. H. G. Watts, Age 43.\n\nHe holds no certificate. I have been hoping that with the assistance of the Public School Manuals and with experience Mr Watts would improve in his methods. I see very little change. His methods of teaching are not those of to-day.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nThis is rather a disappointing school as compared with the other two schools which it is my privilege to visit. The pupils are very backward and little progress is being made. This may not all be due to the teacher as I understand that the Indians of this reserve are more backward than those of the other two reserves.\n\nJ. W. [signature]\nInsp.\nOttawa, June 5, 1922.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Shagwundah Indian Day School, reports on the work being performed by the Teacher, Mr. H. G. Watts, as follows: \"He holds no certificate. I have been hoping that, with the assistance of the Public School Manuals and with experience, Mr. Watts would improve in his methods. I see very little change. His methods of teaching are not those of today. This is rather a disappointing school as compared with the other two schools which it is my privilege to visit. The pupils are very backward and little progress is being made.\"\n\nI am drawing these remarks of the Inspector to the attention of Your Grace, and will be pleased to have your views as to whether you consider a change in teachers should not be made at this school after the summer holidays. Mr. Watts has been teaching there since the spring of 1919, and, as he has had time to become familiar with his work and show some progress\u2014which the Inspector states he is not doing\u2014it is considered that it would be in the best interests of the work at this point if another teacher were secured.\n\nBefore taking any action, we will await Your Grace's views in the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. George Thornloe, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nYour letter, dated the 5th of June and having reference to the work of Mr. H.G. Watts in the Sheshaadak Indian School, has followed me about. It is now before me.\n\nYou are good enough to say you will take no action until my views are placed before you.\n\nI must confess that I share the regret of the Inspector that Mr. Watts has not before now qualified himself for his work so as to be able to use modern methods, and to use them effectively. He certainly has had both opportunity and encouragement. In the circumstances, I should not wonder at your giving him notice that unless a real improvement takes place, and he obtains his certificate, you would, at a specified date, terminate his engagement. In view however of the extreme difficulty of securing certificated teachers for these Indian Schools, in order to give Mr. Watts every possible chance I would like to\nurge that the Department be as generous as possible in respect to a date for action.\n\nI will write at once to Mr. Watts and see what he has to say for himself.\n\nMy permanent address is as before \"Sainte Marie, Ont.\"\n\nBelieve me\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the services of Mr. H. G. Watts, teacher of the Shagwundah Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in compliance with your suggestion that we give Mr. Watts a further opportunity, the Department will consent to his continuing as teacher until such time as the Public School Inspector makes his next visit. His retention in the position after that time will depend entirely upon the report received from the Inspector regarding the work he is performing. It is hoped that the Inspector will find that more progress has been made in the classroom when he next visits this school, and that Mr. Watts has improved in his methods of teaching.\n\nIt is noted that you will communicate with Mr. Watts regarding this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Watts, teacher of the Sheguinadah Indian day school. I am communicating the contents of your letter to Mr. Watts, and trust that he may make such a showing at the end of the period indicated as will justify your confirmation of his appointment.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Stigma\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Sheguiandah School. May 8, 1923.\n\nMr. H. G. Watts. Age 42. He holds no certificate as a teacher. Salary $600.00. His work shows little if any improvement.\n\nThere is very little change in the work of this school. The poor work in this school is in marked contrast to the good work done both at Sucker Creek and Sheshegwaning schools.\n\nJ. W. Hagan,\n\nInsp.\nOttawa, May 25th, 1923.\n\nMost Rev. Sir:\n\nI beg to draw Your Grace's attention to a report received from the Public School Inspector on his recent inspection of the Shagolandah Indian Day School. The Inspector has again drawn our attention to the poor work being performed by Mr. H. G. Watts, the teacher. He states that there is little, if any, improvement since last year, and that the poor work at this school is in marked contrast to the good work done at Sucker Creek and Sheshegwaning Schools.\n\nYour attention was drawn to this matter in official letter of June 5, 1922. The Department at that time, at your request, agreed to give Mr. Watts a further opportunity, but it would appear that the results achieved have not been very satisfactory. We consider, in view of the Inspector's report, that it would be in the best interests of the work at this school if a change in teacher was made for the next school year.\n\nI shall be pleased to have Your Grace's views regarding dispensing with the services of Mr. Watts at the end of the present school year, viz: June 30th, next, and engaging the services of another teacher to begin duties when the school re-opens after the coming summer holidays.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Watts at the Indian School at Sheguiandah is not satisfactory, according to the report of the Public School inspector. I regret this sincerely. When I received a similar intimation a year ago, I immediately communicated with Mr. Watts, who undertook in every possible way to bring things up if we would give him time. I gave him all possible encouragement, and urged him to the utmost extent, and I regret sincerely to learn that the result has not been satisfactory. I will take the matter up at once, and I quite understand that it will be necessary to dispense with Mr. Watts' services at the end of the present year.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, May 31st, 1923.\n\nMost Rev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 29th instant, informing the Department that you concur in the dispensing of the services of Mr. H. G. Watts as teacher of the Sheguinah Indian Day School at the end of the present school year. There is no doubt but that it will be in the best interests of the work at this point to obtain the services of another teacher to begin duties when the school re-opens after the coming summer holidays, on or about September 1, next.\n\nI shall be pleased if Your Grace will endeavour to nominate the services of a suitable teacher in due time. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Rev.

G. Watts as teacher of the Sheguinandah Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we took this matter up with His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma in May, last, the Inspector having drawn our attention to the poor services being performed by Mr. Watts. We considered at that time that it would be in the best interests of all concerned if a change in teacher were made for the next school year. His Grace concurred that a change would be advisable, and stated that he would, in due course, nominate a successor to Mr. Watts.\n\nWe are again communicating with His Grace, and informing him in accordance with the contents of your letter. If he considers that Mr. Watts should be given a further trial, and if he has not yet secured another teacher, the Department will approve Mr. Watts continuing his duties for a longer period. You will be advised as soon as we hear from His Grace.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J.

Watts from the position as teacher of the Sheguianah Indian Day School, and have to request that you will state whether you have been able to secure the services of a suitable teacher to succeed him.\n\nIn this connection I may say that Mr. Agent Lewis, Manitowaning, forwarded a copy of a resolution passed by the Chief and principal men of the Sheguianah Band, requesting that the services of Mr. Watts be dispensed with on the grounds that the children were making no progress. The Agent states that he made full enquiry into these charges and found that they were without foundation. He states that the substance of the Indians' charges was that Mr. Watts had complained about the non-attendance of the Chief's children, which irritated the Chief against the teacher. However, as our Inspector states that no progress has been made in the work at this school, and as the Indians appear to be against the teacher, it is considered that it would be in the interests of all concerned to make a change. I shall be pleased to hear from Your Grace, at an early date, as to whether you have been able to obtain the services of a teacher to succeed Mr. Watts or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

It surprised me to learn that he had received no formal notice of the Department's intention to relieve him; and that he was counting on continuing his work. I told him of your letter to me implying that the Department has fully decided the question of his removal, and of your request that I should nominate a teacher to succeed him. He was much disturbed.\n\nWill you be good enough to let me know exactly what the situation is? I have been in communication with certain persons who, I think, are willing to fit to undertake the work.

In view of the fact that Mr. Watts has, no doubt, resumed his duties, I wish to suggest that you arrange for a successor, as from the first of January, next.

It is not the usual custom, and the thought did not occur to me that I was expected to take such a step.\n\nI am at once informing Mr. Walter of your purpose concerning him.

I am sending you an idea of some of the work which has been accomplished which you will see by the enclosed prize list.

It might be advisable for you or Mr. Watts to take this matter up with His Grace.\n\nI have also to acknowledge a report showing the prize winners at the rural school fair. We are pleased to note that the pupils of this school who were in competition with the white pupils of the Howland rural school fair made such a splendid showing at the fair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\nI am in receipt of Official Letter No. 14-561 of the 4th instant, regarding the question of Mr. Watts continuing his services as teacher at the Sheguianah Indian Day School until the end of December next, and in reply I have the honour to report that in the communication from Mr. Watts which I enclosed to the Department with my letter of the 29th ultimo, I was of the opinion that he was asking to be allowed to continue his services until the end of March next, instead of the end of December as referred to by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 12th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the request of Mr. H. G. Watts, teacher of the Sheguiandah Indian Day School, to be allowed to continue as teacher until the end of March, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in our letter of the 4th instant regarding this request we inadvertently stated that we would have no objections to Mr. Watts remaining until the end of December, next, instead of to the end of March, next. This extension is granted on the understanding that His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma has not obtained another teacher for this school to begin duties on January 1st, next. As stated in a former letter, it would be advisable for either you or Mr. Watts to take this matter up with His Grace, and, if he concurs, Mr. Watts may remain until March 31st, 1924. You will be good enough to inform the Department as to the decision arrived at with His Grace as to whether he consents to Mr. Watts remaining until the end of March or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nJanuary 2nd, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to Official Letter No. 19-3-I of October the 12th last, and previous correspondence in connection with the question of Mr. Watts, teacher at the Sheguiandah Indian School, being allowed to stay in charge until the end of March next, I have the honour to report that on the 24th of October I took this matter up with His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma and today I am in receipt of a communication from His Grace to the effect that he would concur with the arrangement that Mr. Watts should remain in charge until the end of March quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMarch 14th, 1924\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to Official Letter No.19-3-I of the 12th of October last, and previous correspondence in connection with Mr. Watts remaining in charge of the Sheguandah School as teacher until the end of the current month, I have the honour to report that His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma has not nominated another teacher to take charge of the school when Mr. Watts' time expires. His Grace has advised that it would be well for Mr. Watts to remain where he is teaching until the end of the school year, that is on the 30th June.\n\nAs His Grace the Archbishop has not nominated another teacher to take charge of the school at the end of the present quarter, and I do not consider that it would be of any advantage to the pupils to make a change of teachers so near the end of the school year, therefore, I would most respectfully recommend that Mr. Watts be allowed to remain in charge until the end of the school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 19th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, in which you recommend that Mr. H. G. Watts, teacher of the Sheguiandah Indian Day School, be allowed to continue as teacher until the end of the present school year, viz: June 30th, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma has not nominated another teacher to take up duties at this school at the end of the present quarter, the Department will, in view of your recommendation, consent to Mr. Watts' remaining for the balance of the school year, viz: to June 30th, next. We cannot, however, agree to continue his services after that date, and I shall be pleased if you will take up with the Archbishop the question of his nominating a qualified teacher to begin duties after the summer holidays, on or about September 1st, next. You may notify Mr. Watts that he is to remain until June 30th, next, after which date his services will not be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J.

Fairbairn, of Sheguianadah, for the\nposition. She states that she has had three\nyears teaching experience, two years in private\nschools and one in public, also has passed her\nJunior Matriculation and attended Trinity University,\nToronto, and she is willing to take charge of the\nschool at the same rate of salary paid Mr. Watts\nduring the past year.\n\nHis Grace the Archbishop of Algoma has not\nyet nominated a teacher to take charge of this\nschool, and I have been lead to believe that His Grace\nis abroad at the present time and may not be home\nfor some time yet.\n\nIf the services of Mrs. Fairbairn as teacher\nof the Sheguianadah School would meet with the\napproval of His Grace and the Department of Indian\nAffairs I would be pleased to recommend Mrs. Fairbairn\nto the position as I believe she is a capable teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 8th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, recommending the appointment of Mrs. R. M. Fairbairn as teacher of the Sheguigandah Indian Day School for the next school year, and stating the qualifications and experience which she possesses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to approve of the appointment of Mrs. Fairbairn, temporarily, pending the approval of His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma. She will be allowed salary at the same rate as was paid Mr. Watts, viz., $600 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Payment of both salary and bonus is based on ten teaching months in the year. You may, therefore, arrange with Mrs. Fairbairn to begin duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays, on September 2nd. As soon as His Grace returns, you should inform him of the action taken to secure a teacher and obtain his consent or otherwise for the continuance of the services of Mrs. Fairbairn. After you have taken this matter up with His Grace, please inform the Department as to whether he approves of Mrs. Fairbairn's appointment or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Watts, who has been teaching that school for some time past.\n\nI have the enclosed application from Mrs. J. S. Rhodes who is a competent person and has had two years' experience in teaching at the Shingwauk Home. She is in my judgment quite capable of doing the work and doing it well. I am not sure, but I think she is not provided with a formal certificate from the Department of Education; but I should be glad if you would give her a trial, and I think that probably she would be quite ready to qualify if necessary.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nP.S. Should I find another more promising teacher ready or willing to undertake the work I will at once let you know.\n\nG.A.\nOttawa, August 21st, 1924.\n\nMost Rev. Sir:\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 18th instant, in which you nominate Mrs. J. S. Rhodes for the position of teacher at the Sheguinandah Indian Day School. In reply I wish to state that Mr. Indian Agent R. J. Lewis, of Manitowaning, understood that Your Grace was abroad, and on the 5th instant nominated Mrs. R. M. Fairbairn, of Sheguinandah, for the position. This teacher has had three years' experience, has her matriculation and was an undergraduate at Trinity College, Toronto. On the 5th instant, the Department temporarily approved of the appointment of Mrs. Fairbairn, at a salary of $600 for ten teaching months, supplemented by any bonus allowed by law. Mr. Lewis was instructed to arrange to have Mrs. Fairbairn commence duties on the 2nd proximo, and to inform Your Grace of his action.\n\nI should be pleased to learn if the appointment of Mrs. Fairbairn meets with approval.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nMost Rev. George Thornloe, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste.

Fairbairn as teacher of the Sheguianah Indian day school subject to my approval, and have notified her to that effect.\n\nI am sorry I was away during the period in which this matter was under consideration. However, in the present situation, I quite see that nothing can be done but appoint Mrs. Fairbairn, against whose appointment I have no objection whatever. I did not know when I nominated Mrs. Rhodes that Mrs. Fairbairn had any thought of the school. For various reasons I should perhaps in any case have given precedence to the former, but I quite understand how the situation has arisen. I trust in future I shall be able to attend more carefully to this duty.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nSeptember 5th, 1924.\n\nSir;\u2014\n\nReferring to Official Letter No. 19-3-1 dated the 5th ultimo, relative to the appointment of Mrs. R. M. Fairbairn as teacher of the Sheguianah Indian Day School, in reply I have the honour to report that I have recently communicated with His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma, Sault Ste Marie, Ontario, regarding this matter, and he has advised me that after considering the same, and having no objection to Mrs. Fairbairn, he has confirmed her appointment as teacher at this school, and has notified her to that effect.\n\nMrs. Fairbairn re-opened this school and commenced duties on Tuesday, September 2nd last, as instructed by Departmental letter as stated above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nNovember 25th, 1925.\n\nSir-\n\nI have the honour to report to the effect that Mrs. H.M. Fairbain, teacher of the Sheguiandah Indian Day School, has submitted her resignation to this office and the same is to take effect at the end of the current quarter.\n\nOn account of Mrs. Fairbain's being in poor health since the reopening of the school after the mid-summer holidays and now she feels that she cannot continue teaching during the winter months, I would recommend to the Department that her resignation be accepted, and the services of an Ontario qualified teacher be appointed to take charge of the school at the beginning of the new year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 30th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, informing the Department that Mrs. R. M. Fairbairn, teacher of the Sheguindah Indian Day School, has, on account of ill-health, tendered her resignation, the same to take effect at the end of the current quarter. In reply I beg to say that the resignation of Mrs. Fairbairn is accepted.\n\nAs this school is under the auspices of His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma, we are corresponding with him with a view to obtaining the services of a teacher having Ontario qualifications. As soon as we have the name of the person nominated by His Grace for this position you will be advised.\n\nMrs. Fairbairn should prepare her return of attendance at the end of the current quarter and forward it to the Department through your office in order that payment of the amount of salary due her can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\nOttawa, November 30th, 1925.\n\nMost Rev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is informed by Mr. Agent Lewis, Manitowaning, that Mrs. R. M. Fairbairn, teacher of the Sheguianah Indian Day School, has, on account of ill-health, tendered her resignation to his office, the same to take effect at the end of the present year.\n\nI have to request that Your Grace will be good enough to nominate the services of a qualified teacher, one having Ontario qualifications preferred, to succeed Mrs. Fairbairn when the school re-opens after the coming Christmas holidays on or about January 4th, next. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by Your Grace should be submitted for the approval of the Department. I shall be pleased if you will give this matter your early attention in order that the services of a teacher can be obtained in time to open school after the Christmas holidays.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am sending a nomination for the position to the local Indian Agent. Thank you for your letter.\n\nAs I think you are aware we have started, and are carrying on by means of Church Funds a little day School at White Fish Falls for combined groups of White and Indian children; neither of which is adequate of itself to justify a school. I have to thank the Department for occasional help. Encouraged by this fact I venture now to ask whether the Department would provide Mr Hardymar our teacher with a few simple medicines if he sent a list of what is necessary to the local Indian Agent, Mr Robert Lewis, for the purpose. Perhaps it would suffice for me to write to Mr Lewis but I write to you by way of information.\n\nBelieve me,\nFaithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nMr J.D.McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nDepartment Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.

I shall furnish you with any references, both from the school board and my present principal.\n\nMy own home is in Victoria. At present I am in Windsor, but should I receive an early reply from you, it would enable me to reach the school to begin my duties at an early date in Jan.\n\nShould I be accepted, I will\ndo allow me power to make the coming year a success.\n\nA early reply from you stating particulars, would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI hope to remain your obedient servant,\n\nMiss Laura Hartley\n219 Arthur St\nWindsor\n\nApr. 6.\n19-3-1.\n\nOttawa, December 28th, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, applying for the position as teacher in the Sheguandah Indian Day School, and stating the qualifications and experience which you possess.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this school is conducted under the auspices of the Anglican Church, and His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma nominates the teachers. We understand from your letter that you are a Roman Catholic, and we would not, therefore, be able to approve of your appointment as teacher of the above named school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

What you suggest, namely that, as there is just at present no better qualified applicant, we should recommend Mrs A.J.

Abbot, of Shguianah, who has had two years of experience teaching in White schools should take charge of the school until the end of the term, June 30th next, as there is not at present no better qualified teacher in view, but so far I have not had any instructions from the Department to authorize Mrs. Abbot to reopen the school.\n\nAs it would appear that His Grace has not any other teacher in view to succeed Mrs. Fairbairn, and Mrs. Abbot has had two years experience in teaching, therefore, I would recommend her to take charge of the school until the end of the current school term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 16th, 1926.\n\nMost Rev.

LEWIS, ESQ., INDIAN AGENT, MANITOWANING, DATED APRIL 8, 1932.\n\n---\n\nThey maintain that they have found out that the upkeep of two classrooms for the few pupils on Sheguiandah Reserve is too expensive, and would not under any consideration vote any of their Band Funds towards erecting any new school buildings.\n\nThe original motion which they passed in Council pertaining to this matter is enclosed herewith, which motion is signed by eight members of the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nI might say, also, that it appears to be the general feeling among the Indians to have the classroom conducted in the Roman Catholic Church during the last three years past closed, and all the children attend the Anglican School again, which they consider a public school.\nShequianadah, Ontario.\nDecember 15th, 1933.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast month I made application to Mr. R. Lewis, Indian Agent, at Manitouwining, for the position of teacher of the Shequianadah Anglican Indian School. He replied that he had received no communication from Headquarters to remove Mrs. A. J. Abbott but would advise me when he did get orders to that effect.\n\nNow, the reasons I applied for the said position are\u2014deeply need it financially\u2014as I have to support myself as my mother is a widow with very very small income which only partially takes care of her in her old age. I also\nfor teaching very much.\n\nThen again, Mrs. Abbott's husband is a husky young man with steady work at good wages, and in his spare hours has a taxi service which is well patronized. He owns a cow, a horse, hens, and has a good house and excellent acreage of land in the village. From every standpoint he is well able to take care of his wife and her needs and so leaves the position which she now holds, free for one in my position to take care of ably.\n\nAlso Mrs. Abbott's teaching certificate is of the same standard as mine. I have taught for four years at the end of that period I had a nervous collapse but am in perfect health now.\n\nThe Indians under her tutoring are not as advanced as are the pupils in other Indian schools in this district.\nMiss Abbott takes no interest at all in neither the Indian Church nor our English Church in the white village.\n\nI would be very pleased if you would write Mr. F. Hardymon, our missionary here, and ask him if he will verify my statement. I know he would do so and would give you a clearer picture of the situation.\n\nMay I ask you to consider my request very seriously and grant an favourable reply to my appeal for help in securing this petition?\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nMiss Isabel Orr.\n\nShequianal,\nMontoni Island,\nOntario.\nOttawa, December 19, 1933.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, applying for the position as teacher of the Sheguianah Anglican Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department has received no intimation from the present teacher of her intention to give up duties. It is noted that your teaching certificate is the same standard as Mrs. Abbott's and that you have had four years' experience. Mrs. Abbott possesses an expired Third Class Certificate, and, should a change be made at any time, the Department would prefer to engage the services of a teacher having higher qualifications.\n\nI may add, the last report received from the Public School Inspector who visited the school shows that the pupils are making progress. Unless Mrs. Abbott voluntarily resigns, the Department is not prepared to make any change in teaching services for the balance of the present school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

TROTTER\nGENERAL MERCHANDISE\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I draw to your attention that you have employed in the Indian school here a woman whose husband if he chose to work should be able to give her a living instead of her occupying a position that many a young girl would be glad to have in order to earn a living. Further I believe that Mrs. Abbott has no qualifications whatever.\n\nThe point to which I am anxious to draw your attention is that this woman though drawing what in these times should be considered a good salary is not content to do her work and mind her own business. I have undisputed proof that Mrs. Abbott is making disturbance among these Indians.\n\nWe have always provided that school with any requisites necessary for carrying on of work there. I would ask you to be good enough to look into this complaint and do something in way of correcting present conditions.\n\nYours Truly,\nMrs. W. L. Trotter\nOttawa, October 4, 1934.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the teacher of the Sheguiandah Anglican Indian Day School. In this connection I have to say that enquiry is being made regarding your complaint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. W. L. Trotter,\nSheguiandah,\nOnt.\nOttawa, October 4, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Mrs. W. L. Trotter, Sheguianish, Ont. - copy of which is enclosed for your information - making certain complaints against the teacher of the Anglican Day School at that place.\n\nI would request that you make enquiry into this matter and let the Department have a report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nManitowaning, October 23rd, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of Departmental Letter No. 15-3-1 of the 14th instant enclosing a copy of a communication the Department received from Mrs. W. L. Trotter of Sheguianidah making certain complaints against Mrs. A. F. Abbott, teacher of the Anglican Bay School at that place.\n\nWith regard to these complaints I have the honour to report that I have made an investigation and find that Mrs. Trotter has little reason for making such complaints. Mrs. Abbott is a married woman with a family of small children to support and her husband is out of employment. Her only qualifications as a teacher are some years experience teaching in white schools, and several years in the Sheguianidah R.C. Indian School at Sheguianidah, but she is a capable teacher. Upon making enquiries from different members of Sheguianidah Band I cannot find where she is the cause of any disturbance among the Indians or where she has any authority to prevent any of the Indians from buying at the Trotter store, and I know for a fact that Mrs. Abbott has not done anything in the way of preventing the purchase of Departmental requisitions for goods for use in carrying on with her work from this store. The Sheguianidah R.C. Indian School is only small and very little supplies required, but when the purchase of articles is authorized this store is given a portion of the business if they can supply the proper articles at a reasonable cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nLittle Current, Ontario,\nDec 24, 1934.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been advised to write you concerning the Indian School at Shiguanadah. The present teacher is a married woman holding a low certificate. She has a husband who fails to support her and her two children.\n\nI am without a position and have attended the North Bay Normal School and hold a Second Class Certificate for teaching. My mother cannot help me as she is a widow.\n\nI also am a member of the Anglican Church and hold a First Class Certificate in Anglican Religious Training which I obtained at Normal School last year.\n\nThe wishes of the people at Shiguanadah are to have a new teacher there.\n\nI need work right away and am hoping to hear from you soon.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlberta Hannah.\nOttawa, December 28, 1934.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, regarding the present teaching services at the Sheguiandah Anglican Indian Day School and applying for the position as teacher.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, in so far as the Department is aware, the services of the present teacher, as regards her work in the classroom, are satisfactory. The Department is not prepared to make any change in the teaching services at this school during the balance of the present academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

You wrote me you were investigating and would inform me later. Further do you employ married women without qualification when so many young girls are without work.\n\nWill appreciate an early reply.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMrs. W. L. Trotter\nOttawa, February 5, 1936.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, relative to your complaints against the teacher of the Sheguianah Anglican Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, upon receipt of your letter of September 26th, last, the Department investigated the matter, and it was found that you had little reason for making the complaint. Mrs. Abbott is a capable teacher. Upon enquiry being made from different members of the Sheguianah Band, it was not found that Mrs. Abbott is the cause of any disturbance among the Indians, nor has she exercised any authority to prevent any of them from buying at your store. This is only a small school and very few supplies are required. When the purchase of articles is authorized, your store is given a portion of the business when you can supply the proper articles at reasonable cost.\n\nIt is not intended to make any change in the teaching service at this school during the balance of the present academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. W. L. Trotter,\nSheguianah,\nOntario.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to previous correspondence regarding complaints received against Mrs. A. J. Abbott, teacher of the Sheguiandah Anglican Indian Day School, I would request that you will state your opinion as to whether Mrs. Abbott's services should be dispensed with at the end of the present school year.\n\nAs you are aware, Mrs. Abbott is a married woman and is not professionally qualified. However, she has taught this school for a number of years with fair success. I may add that, upon strict application of present regulations, a married woman, whose husband is living, is not eligible for permanent employment.\n\nThe Department will await the expression of your opinion before giving final consideration as to whether Mrs. Abbott should retire at the end of the present school year. Your early reply, therefore, will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J.

Abbott, teacher of the Sheguianah Anglican Indian Day School, I have the honour to report that her work has been more satisfactory than any other teacher who has been in charge of this school during a number of years past.\n\nIt is true that she is a married woman and is not professionally qualified, and has a husband living who should be able to support her. For these reasons it might be well that she should retire at the end of the present school year.\n\nIf it be the case that her services should be dispensed with I would recommend that the services of an Ontario qualified teacher be obtained as her successor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am told by our missionary at Sheguianish, Manitoulin Island, that the Indian Agent has said that the Department is going to ask for the resignation of Mrs. Abbott, teacher of the Indian day school at Sheguianish. I should be much obliged if you would kindly inform me if this is so, because I have two or three applicants for work who are better fitted for the post than Mrs. Abbott, and I should like to have the opportunity of nominating one of them to you before they accept any other position.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n+Rocksborough R: Algoma\n\nP.S.

Owing to the fact that the husband is unemployed, I hesitate to request her resignation, but, in view of the regulation above referred to, the Treasury Board would likely insist that her employment as a married woman be discontinued.\n\nI should be pleased to have your instructions, and, if you consider Mrs. Abbott's services should be dispensed with, I should appreciate your direction with reference to requesting the Bishop of Algoma to nominate a qualified teacher to succeed her for the coming school year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, May 22, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received the report of the Public School Inspector on his recent inspection of the Church of England Indian Day School on the Sheguianah Reserve.

She takes much interest in the welfare of her pupils both in the classroom and in their homes, and no complaints have been made by any of the Indian parents in regard to her teaching. She has two children to support as her husband is out of employment but appears to be in good health. It may be that he will not make an effort to find employment so long as his wife will continue to teach and from her earnings support the family, but she has advised me that he cannot find employment and for that reason she is forced to continue teaching to earn a livelihood for her children. On account of her being a married woman, her husband being in good health, and she has been allowed to teach for some years past on account of the husband being out of work, but during all this time he has not done much in the support of the family, and will continue in idleness so long as she has work so I would advise that the Department dispense with her services and a fully qualified teacher appointed for the coming school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Where it can be established by a married woman that her husband is unable, through illness or other cause, to contribute to her support, such married woman may be certified for permanent or temporary appointment.\"\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Algoma requested to be informed if the Department intended to ask for the resignation of Mrs. Abbott, and, if so, he stated he has two or three applicants who are better fitted for the post than she is.\n\n- The nomination\nThe nomination of a teacher for this school has always been in the hands of the Bishop. While Mrs. Abbott has given faithful service and has done her best, yet she is not professionally qualified and the pupils are making little progress. The local Indian Agent recommends that the Department dispense with her services and that a fully qualified teacher be appointed for the coming school year. The Agent states that this woman's husband is out of employment but is in good health and that he has made no effort to find employment while his wife is teaching and supporting the husband and children from her earnings.\n\nMrs. Abbott has been kept in this school for some time, owing to the fact that the husband was unemployed. In view of the regulations above referred to, the Treasury Board would likely insist, as she is a married woman, that her services be discontinued.\n\nI beg to recommend, for your approval, that Mrs. Abbott be notified that her services will not be required after the end of the current month, the end of the present school year, and that His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma be asked to nominate a fully qualified teacher for the coming school year.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, June 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, it has been decided to dispense with the services of Mrs. A. J. Abbott, teacher of the Sheguianadzoo of E. Indian Bay School. Her services should terminate at the end of the present academic year, viz., June 26th. Please inform Mrs. Abbott accordingly.\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Algoma is being written and requested to nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of this school. You will be further advised when his nomination is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J.

In 1934 she graduated from the North Bay Normal School with second class interim certificate. During the summers since she has attended the Summer School sessions for teachers in Toronto, and now has a number of Upper School subjects; and this summer she is taking a course in agriculture at Guelph. She has taught for the past two years in a Public School on the Manitoulin Island, and I believe the Inspector, Mr. Wightman of Gore Bay, has been well pleased with her work. I have also received excellent recommendations as to character.\n\nI trust the Department may see fit to appoint her to the position.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nPercy A.

W. McGill, Director of Indian Affairs, wrote, in part, as follows:\n\n\"On our way to Manitowaning, we called at the Sheguianidah Reserve and visited the two schools - one under Roman Catholic auspices, being held in the church building. The teacher is Miss Lapointe and her total enrolment consists of six pupils. The Protestant school, under Miss Millantyns, has an enrolment of five. Both these teachers seem to be capable and further comment seems to be unnecessary upon the fact that we maintain two schools and pay two teachers' salaries for a total enrolment of eleven pupils.\"\n\nIn view of the many demands for new Indian schools in various parts of the Dominion and the further fact that our funds are limited, it is exceedingly difficult to justify the operation of two schools at Sheguianidah for such a small number of pupils.\n\nPlease let me know, at once, if there is any prospect of the attendance at either or both of these schools materially increasing during the academic year 1937-38. In addition, you should let me have as complete information as possible regarding the children attending both these schools at the present time and indicate if it would be feasible to have them attend a neighbouring White school to which a tuition grant could be paid.\n\nYou should, also, immediately notify both teachers that it is quite probable that both these schools will be closed at the end of June, 1937, and, consequently, if they are able to secure another position, they should do so. For your personal information, I may say that a final decision regarding the closing of these schools will not be made until your reply is received but, in order to protest the Department, the notice requested above should be given to both teachers. I will expect to hear from you in the very near future in connection with the situation at Sheguianidah.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nH. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, June 10th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the Sheguianadah R.C. and Sheguianadah C.E. Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn view of the information now before us, it has been decided to close both of these schools on June 30th, 1937, and you should so inform the teachers. Please let me know whether or not the teachers were successful in securing other schools. If not, the Department will endeavour to place them in Indian day schools but, at the present time, we are not in a position to definitely assure you that this can be done.\n\nWhen you hear further from the Chairman of the neighbouring White school in Sheguianadah Township, you should advise me, stating whether or not they are prepared to accept Indian children and the rate which they would charge for their tuition.\n\nAny children for whom educational provision cannot be made in this way will have to be placed in one or other of the residential schools. For those going to residential school, early application should be made in order that accommodation may be obtained for them.\n\nAny books or school supplies on hand may be distributed among the other day schools in your agency or stored in a safe place until required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Marie, Ontario\n\n18th June, 1937.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am informed by our missionary at Manitowaning that the Department of Indian Affairs is closing our Indian School at Sheguandah and has given the teacher notice of dismissal. I understand that she has five pupils and I thought it was your rule to keep open a school of that size. Our school has been in existence many years before the Roman Catholic school was opened.\n\nI would like to add that it seems to me very arbitrary action and lacking in the courtesy which we expect from a Government Department if it is a fact that the Department intend to close this school without any reference to myself as Bishop of the Diocese. I should be much obliged if you would kindly inquire into the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n+ Rocksborough R. Algoma\n(Bishop of Algoma)\nJune 26th, 1937.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the closing of the Sheguinandah C. E. Indian Day School.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill, Director of Indian Affairs, visited this school during the early part of May and, in reporting to The Honourable the Minister, he wrote as follows:-\n\n\"On our way to Manitowaning, we called at the Sheguinandah Reserve and visited the two schools - one under Roman Catholic auspices, being held in the church building. The teacher is Miss Lapointe and her total enrolment consists of six pupils. The Protestant School, under Miss Ballantyne, has an enrolment of five. Both these teachers seem to be capable and further comment seems to be unnecessary upon the fact that we maintain two schools and pay two teachers' salaries for a total enrolment of eleven pupils.\"\n\nThe Department subsequently communicated with Indian Agent Lewis, who supplied the following information in connection with the Sheguinandah C. E. Indian Day School:-\n\n\"The\n\nRt. Rev. R. R. Smith M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nBishophurst,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\"\nRt. Rev. R. R. Smith, M.A., D.D.\n\n\"The Anglican School, under Miss Ballantyne as teacher, has an enrolment of five pupils. The prospect is that if the school re-opens after the summer holidays there will be an enrolment of not more than four pupils. Bridget Gaikesheyongai is over school age and will not return after the end of this school term.\"\n\nAfter giving the matter careful consideration, it was decided to close both the Sheguinandah C. E. and the Sheguinandah R. C. Indian Day Schools on June 30th, 1937, owing to the fact that the small attendance at both schools did not justify the expenditure. Mr. Lewis was instructed to negotiate with the neighbouring White school in Sheguinandah Township with a view to having the Indian children attend that school. We have not yet been advised if he was successful in this regard. If not, the children of school age on the Sheguinandah Reserve will be placed in a residential school.\n\nIn view of the information contained in this letter, I feel you will agree that the Department was justified in closing both these schools.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

We are, of course, very sorry to lose this school but in view of the small number of pupils I suppose we cannot make any objection. If, however, the Department had taken my advice and refused to sanction the opening of the Roman Catholic School the number of pupils of the combined school would have been sufficient, as it had been for many years before. May I add that, as I said in my last letter on June 18th, I cannot help thinking that it would have been more courteous if the Department had informed me of their decision to close this school, instead of leaving me to find it out by myself.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n+ Rocksbrough R.

Trotter of Sheguianadah has requested me to enquire if the Department would consider selling the Anglican School House at Sheguianadah Reserve.\n\nMrs. Trotter has not made an offer in her letter to me, but has indicated she would not care to pay a big price, as she would have considerable expense moving it.\n\nIt does not appear that the school will be required at Sheguianadah for some time, but if the matter of sale should be considered, I would suggest calling for tenders.\n\nC.

I purchased the necessary glass and other articles on the bill from Mr Trotter myself. As the school has been closed some time on account of the resignation of Mr Ferris and the failure of the Church authorities to secure a competent teacher before, I thought it advisable to have Mr Baker commence teaching at once in the old building until such times as the school is finished which will probably be not more than two weeks.\n\nMr Baker commenced teaching on the 3rd Instant.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 9th ultimo, I have to say that you may inform Mr. Beck that the amount of $5.00 will be deducted from his contract price for the erection of the school on the Sheguianish Indian reserve, and that he will, therefore, not be required to supply a bell.\n\nKindly consult the Indian Council, and purchase a bell such as they may desire at a cost of about $25.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B.

Major, teacher at Sheguiandah asking the Department to furnish him with a typewriter for the use specified in his letter.\n\nI do not think he requires a typewriter any more than any of the other successful Indian teachers.\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDay School\nSheguiandah, Ont.\n\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs\nParliament Bldgs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nNov. 23rd 1907\n\nSir:\n\nI hope it will not be asking too much of you to request you to give the following letter your earnest consideration, for it contains a request which if granted will greatly assist me in my difficult task of teaching the Indian children to use the English language intelligently.\n\nI find the lessons too long as they are given in our readers. They of course are intended for our children who are familiar with the words orally & who have only to learn to recognize them written or printed. But the Indian child has to learn, to say the English words, their meanings & their relation to other words in the sentence, as well as to learn to recognize the words when written or printed, & frequently he has to develop new concepts before he can get an intelligent idea of the lessons in our readers. You can easily understand the tremendous task before us.\nIndian child who has to learn a lesson as Book I, Part II, where he has no less than 73 new words (including the lesson on phonics) to learn before he can read the lesson at all intelligently. Any good teacher who has given serious thought to the subject will acknowledge that it is an impossible task. The child becomes weary & sick of the lesson before he has it half learned.\n\nWhat I propose as a remedy is that such a lesson as this be taken as a review, & that before the child is asked to read this he should be given a series of short lessons using the new words given in the book, that the child be taught the words orally with their meanings so that he can use them intelligently in conversation, & then teach him to recognize the words when written or printed. Then he may be allowed to read the lesson in the book as a review. To do this requires more equipment than we have. It requires a great deal of blackboard space which we have not & if we had the blackboard space the teacher would not have the time to write out these lessons on the\nBoard without losing a great deal of time which could be much more profitably spent if he had other means of presenting the lesson to the children.\n\nMy plan is that the teacher be furnished a typewriter (which would be cheaper & much more convenient than a small printing machine) with which the teacher could print the series of short lessons at home, & after the children had learned each lesson orally & had learned to recognize all the new word when written on the board they could be given the typewritten lesson to read & to use it for seat work.\n\nThis would facilitate the task to a great extent & give the children a splendid practice in the use of English.\n\nA cheap typewriter can easily be obtained which would do the work nicely.\n\nOf course it would need to be one that would print distinctly, but the work on it would not be heavy.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nH.V. Major\n\nTeacher.\nOttawa, December 23, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th inst., enclosing a requisition from Mr. P.W. Major, teacher of the Sheguinandah school, for a typewriter, and in reply I beg to say that the Department does not supply these machines for any schools.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.D.

Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning, Ont.\n26th December 1907-\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that one of the Indians of the Sheguifandah band apply to purchase the old building that used to be used for school purposes.\n\nHe has offered me $10. for the building and I would recommend that it be sold him for that price.\n\nThe building is not of any value or use to the Department any more and is, at its best, only an old log affair and not worth more than $10. Besides this its close proximity to their fine church is a menace on account of fire as should the old building take fire, as it might from various causes, it would surely burn the church.\n\nI would therefore recommend that if the Department see fit to concur with my recommendation that the building be sold with the understanding that it must be removed and not used on its present location.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ult., informing the Department that a member of the Sheguianah band has applied to purchase the old school building for the sum of $10.00 and recommending that the offer be accepted.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your recommendation is approved and the sale may be made, on condition that the building be removed from its present site.

If the work had been done by whitemen it would have cost a great deal more. The reason the Indians were so anxious to have the ceiling repaired, they were afraid their children would be injured by falling plaster.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Indian Agent,\nOttawa, Ont.\n| DATE       | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------|\n| **1919**   |        |\n| December 5 | Authorized by Dept. letter No. 151707/4 dated October 9, 1919. |\n| October 23 | To 5 yds of towelling to Sheguianah School at 28\u00a2 per yd .................. $1.40 |\n|            | * 3 cakes of soap at 12\u00bd\u00a2 each ................. .38 |\n|            | $1.78 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nDecember 5th, 1919\n\nSir,\n\nAuthorized by Official Letter No. 151707/4\nof October 8th last, I have the honor to enclose\nherewith an account in favour of Mr. W.

Wamdebence\nthat the school-room ceiling needs repair\nfor the plaster of the ceiling fallen, causing\ndanger for the school-children\nand the school to be painted on the outside\nand the roof to be repaired in places where it is needed.\n\nWe request the Department of Indian Affairs\nto grant us the amount for such repairs of the above mention.\n\nPassed Resolution by the Band.\n\nWilliam Legerboy\nJohn Makadabin\nAlex Nahwegigik\nFrancis Misumishkew\nElix Maywassigig\nDavid Cogemule\nCharlie Nahwegigik\nSam Nahwegigik\n\nJoe Wamdebence\nChief Wm. Wamdebence\nI have the honour to report that I visited the Sheguiandah Indian School yesterday the 5th instant, and on making a thorough examination of the building I found that the ceiling in the class-room is in need of repairs. The plaster is loose and is in danger of falling and doing harm to the children. I consider it would be well to take off the dangerous portion and replace with wallboard.\n\nThe exterior of the building has not been painted for a period of twenty-two years and is in need of repainting; also the roof requires some minor repairs. The steps at the entrance of the classroom are in a state of bad repair and require attention.\n\nIn order to have the exterior of the building repainted, the plaster on the ceiling replaced with wallboard and the necessary repairs to the roof and steps I estimate it would cost approximately $250 and I would recommend that this work should be carried out during the summer holidays.\n\nI enclose herewith a resolution passed in council by the Band requesting the Department to grant the amount from the funds at the credit of the Band for the purpose of painting and repairs to the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 13, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the painting required at the Shagwundah Indian Day School, and enclosing a resolution of the council of the band regarding the expenditure for the purpose.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of your arranging during the coming summer holidays for the painting of the exterior of the building. You should arrange to have the repairs required to the roof and steps at the entrance to the classroom, also any minor repairs required to place this building in condition, carried out. You should arrange for the purchase of the paint and any other materials required. You should see that a good grade of paint is supplied. The work should be performed by day labour. Time sheets should be kept for the labour employed. The work is to be carried out under your supervision, and you should see that a satisfactory job is completed. You should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the paint and other materials supplied. You should also forward time sheets properly certified for the labour. If you require an advance to pay the labour, same will be sent you upon request. It is noted you estimate the total cost of material and labour to be approximately $250, and the expenditure should be kept within that amount if possible.\n\nI may say that the expenditure required will be paid from our appropriation for Indian education and not charged to band funds. The Department is not now charging band funds with any expenditure in connection with the maintenance of Indian schools, and you might inform the Indians concerned accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It seems that a rather curious accident was the cause of them being broken.

It would scarcely seem to be worth while to maintain a school for such a limited number of pupils, and unless the Department desires to have it continued, I would suggest that it be closed at the end of the present school year. In the meantime I will ascertain if any further information can be obtained bearing upon the case.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy the\nSuperintendent General of\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, 10 Sept. 1896\n\nMEMO.\n\nAs requested in regard to building a school near the Methodist Church, we have engaged Mr. Richard Black as teacher. There are 16 to 20 children who would attend the school. The house was also found to be suitable for the church. The school has been closed about two years before now.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 11th October, 1896.\n\nACTING SECRETARY.\n\nThe facts in connection with the Methodist school at Naughton, on the White Fish Lake Reserve, in the Superintendency of B. W. Ross, are as follows:\n\nThe Methodist school at this point appears to have been closed on the 30th June 1896, the reason for which will be found in a letter from the Rev. Dr. Sutherland of the 10th January 1896, which reads as follows:\n\n\"I have just received two copies of the quarterly report of the Indian School at Naughton, on the White Fish Reservation, Ont., and thinking that the teacher may have omitted to send a copy to the Agent, I forward one copy herewith. You will observe that the entire number on the roll is only five, and there seems to be no probability of any increase, as the teacher states that all who are of school age now attend. It would scarcely seem to be worth while to maintain a school for such a limited number of pupils, and unless the Department desires to have it continued, I would suggest that it be closed at the end of the present school year. In the meantime I will ascertain if any further information can be obtained bearing upon the case.\"\n\nThere is at present a Roman Catholic school on the White Fish Lake Reserve, the teacher of which receives a salary of $200 a year. There are 18 children on the roll, with an average attendance of 8. In his annual report up to the 30th June 1896 Superintendent Ross refers to the White Fish Lake Band, under the heading \"Education\", as follows: --\"The progress of the children is satisfactory, and the average attendance is improving.\" As he makes no other remarks in respect to education.\neducation on the White Fish Lake Reserve, it is presumed that he is not aware of any necessity for another school.\n\nA salary of $200 has been provided by Parliament for the Methodist School at Naughton during the present fiscal year, so that if there are sufficient children to warrant the reopening of this school, there is no obstacle in the way. I may mention in passing that Mr. R. Black was the teacher at this school at the time it was closed.\nMr. Mr.\n\nPlease both meet here next\n\nand report\n\nSigned\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

I.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nREAD THE NOTICE AND AGREEMENT AT THE TOP.\nOttawa, 12th October, 1896.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nBy direction of the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs I telegraphed you at Kemptville today as follows:\n\n\"School at Naughton, White Fish Lake Reserve, will be reopened. Am writing you Non-\n\nIn connection with this matter I beg to explain that the Methodist school at Naughton was closed on the 30th June 1896 on account of a letter of the 10th January 1896 from Rev. Dr. Sutherland, which reads as follows:\n\n\"I have just received two copies of the quarterly report of the Indian school at Naughton, on the White Fish reservation, Ont., and thinking that the teacher may have omitted to send a copy to the Agent, I forward one copy herewith. You will observe that the entire number on the roll is only five, and there seems to be no probability of any increase, as the teacher states that all who are of school age now attend. It would seem from this to be worth while to maintain a school for such a limited number of pupils, and unless the Department desires to have it continued I should suggest that it be closed at the end of the present school year. In the meantime I will ascertain if any further information can be obtained bearing upon the case.\"\n\nNoting having been heard by the Department since to indicate any change in the number of school children that would warrant the reopening of this school, the matter has remained in abeyance since. On your recommendation, however, that there are now a sufficient number of children whose parents belong to the Methodist Church to warrant the reopening of the school, and as\n\nRev. T. Griffiths, D.D.,\nMontreal,\nQuebec.\nthere is a salary of $200 available for the teacher,\nit has been decided to open this school again.\n\nAs Mr. Black, the gentleman suggested by you as\nteacher for this school, occupied that position at\nthe time the school was closed, there would appear\nto be no objection to his re-appointment.\n\nOn receipt of a requisition from Mr. Black for\nsuch school material as may be required, the same will\nbe supplied by the department. The requisition\nshould be forwarded through Mr.\nB. M. Ross, Indian Agent, Drumheller.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. NOLAN\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that it has been decided to re-open the Methodist school at Naughton, White Fish Lake Reserve, the Department having been informed by the authorities of that Church that there are now a sufficient number of children of the Methodist denomination on the White Fish Lake Reserve to warrant the re-opening of the school.\n\nMr. P. Black, who was in charge when the school was closed in 1896 on account of the small attendance, will be re-appointed. It is understood that he will be advised of his appointment by the authorities of the Methodist Church, but it would be well for you to communicate with him to make sure of the school being opened without delay. You might ask him to send you a requisition for such school material as may be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nP. W. Ross, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSir,\n\nAt the close of the last school year the Rev Richard Black, who was both Missionary and teacher of the Indian school at Naughton, was transferred by the Conference to another appointment. Before communicating with the Department about the appointment of another teacher I deemed it prudent to get information as to the prospects of the school. I now learn by a communication from the Rev A.P. Latter, of Sudbury, Chairman of the District, that there are in the band some fifteen children of school age, and it does not seem desirable that these should be left without any educational advantages. If a suitably qualified teacher can be secured will the Department assume responsibility in regard to salary on the same basis as the other schools that were taken over on the 1st of July? In the past the Department has been paying $200 per annum, but a properly qualified teacher could not be secured for less than $300, and even then it is probable that we would have to supplement that amount so as to induce a married teacher to take up his residence at Naughton. We own a house at that place, and it will be available for the teacher if the work goes on.\n\nAwaiting a favorable reply,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary of the Depart't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nA. Sutherland\nGeneral Secretary.\nOttawa, 6th September, 1901.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 27th ultimo inquiring whether the Department will assume the responsibility to pay a salary for a teacher for the Indian School at Naughton on the same basis as the other schools that were taken over from your society on the 1st July last, and in reply I beg to inform you that provision is made in this year's estimates for $300.00 the salary of a teacher for this school, and if in operation under a duly qualified teacher this amount will be paid.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform you that Mr. Windsor, late teacher of Hiawatha has asked to be retained in that position, but as SOME provision can be made for the Indian children at the white school, the Department does not consider that it would be justified in retaining his services. Could not Mr. Windsor be appointed to the Naughton School? Please advise the Department at your earliest convenience and also favour it with your views as to closing with the offer of the trustees of the Hiawatha School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Dr. Sutherland,\nGeneral Secretary, Methodist Mission Rooms\nToronto.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are short of boards and other things needed for school purposes. There is but little wood and no satisfactory arrangement for its provision, as at Hamatha. What are we to do?\n\nI wrote the agent more than a week since but have not yet received any reply. I am not sure that I have his correct name and correct address.\n\nDr. Sutherland advises me to ask you to instruct the agent as to the changed relations of the school. Perhaps you will kindly write them in this and the other matters.\n\nAm I not right in assuming that I have a right to get my own wood off the reserve? The cutting should be at my own expense\u2014of course, at least I presume, the school must be furnished with wood from the reserve.\n\nMr. Smith's letter (your reply to mine) is in hand, but not the cheque.\n\nJan. 14th\n\nJ. A. Smith\nDeputy Superintendent\nOttawa\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. W. Windsor\nOttawa, 13th December 1901.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. J.A. Windsor has been placed in charge of the Indian School at Naughton, which was formerly conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Missionary Society and is now carried on by the Department.\n\nMr. Windsor has been told that any school material which he requires should be applied for through you, and that you would be instructed to see that the necessary firewood necessary for the school is furnished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nG.B.N. Sim, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of 11th instant, I beg to say that the necessary material for the Naughton School will be furnished upon receipt of a requisition which should be transmitted through the local Agent, Mr. Chas. L. D. Sime of Manitowaning, who will be instructed of the change which has taken place in the management of this school.\n\nThe Agent will also be instructed to see that the necessary fire wood for the school house is supplied.\n\nIn reply to the concluding paragraph of your letter I beg to say that a cheque for the time that you taught at the school at Hiawatha was sent to Mr. Agent Thackeray on the 15th instant.\n\nBlank forms of requisition for school material are enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

I am sure that either Mr. Smith or Mr. Johnson know my present address. I have not yet heard from you. If I knew what to write to I would forward my address. Will you kindly instruct whom to send them to and oblige.\n\nYour truly,\n\nJohn E. Windsor\n\nP.S. Better send them to Mr. Smith.\nDear Sir,\n\nOwing to our residing in Naughton I am compelled to send my six children to the Indian school here. I am charged by the Rev. Mr. Windsor twenty-five cents per month for each of my children. I have also to pay school taxes at Whitefish which is seven miles from here, the nearest school to here is Walter, it is four miles, too far to send my children.\n\nI don't feel able to pay both taxes and thought I might be able to have you reduce the charge at the Indian school.\n\nOutside of my family and three of our neighbors the Rev. Mr. Windsor has just three Indians children to teach.\n\nHoping to be favored with a favorable reply.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJohn Carmichael\nNaughton\nOnt.\nOTTAWA; 23rd September, 1902\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWith reference to the application hereunder from Mr Carmichael of Naughton to have the school fees for his children who are attending the Indian school there reduced, I beg to say that 25 cents per month, the amount he is called upon to pay is the lowest charge made by the Department for such pupils and I do not see how it could very well be reduced.\n\nThis is the first intimation the Department had had that any white children were attending this school and if Mr Windsor is collecting fees he should be called upon to transmit them to the Department.\n\nThis is one of the schools taken over from the Methodist Church and the average attendance (3.5 for the past year) is so small that the Department is hardly justified in carrying it on. The number of white children who wish to attend would in no way interfere with the instruction of the Indian pupils and I think it would be an advantage to the latter to have them there. Any non-resident has to pay school taxes on property and if Mr Carmichael is obliged to live at Naughton he should dispose of his property at Whitefish on which he assessed, either by lease or otherwise, and I would suggest that he be informed accordingly and that Mr Windsor be asked\nto report on Mr Carmichael's statements, through Mr Agent Sims.\n\nMartin Bussard\nOTTAWA, 24th September, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that an application has been received from Mr John Carmichael whose six children are attending the Indian school there, to have the fee of 25 cents a month for each child, which he says he is paying the teacher, reduced. This is the first intimation the Department has had that any white children are attending this school, and if Mr Windsor is collecting fees, he should be called upon to transmit them to the Department.\n\nThe returns show that the average attendance of Indian children at this school is remarkably small being only 3.5 for last year, which hardly justifies the Department in carrying it on. The Department would like to have a report from you in regard to Mr Carmichael's application and also concerning this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nC.L.D. Sims, Esq.\nSecretary\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.:\nSIR,\n\nThe Department was informed months ago that White Children were attending, as an examination of my reports will show. They attended under my predecessor, it has been the custom for them to attend for years, and to pay fees. I have received $1 in cash. Besides this I received a little wood a few qts of milk and about two or three lbs of Butter probably about $4. worth altogether.\n\nI should like to purchase a dictionary for the study of Indian but cannot afford it out of my meagre salary. I have never received a cent for correspondence during the years I have been in the Indian Service. I have to put on fires. As I made no secret of the Whites attending, there was no thought of wrong. Dr Sutherland was informed and advised me to exercise my judgement.\n\nI enquired carefully as to the custom of my predecessor. My chief reason was to develop a sense of obligation and avoid pauperizing the whites\u2014a needful protection here. I shall be glad for the Department to fix the fee and relieve me of the responsibility. It should not be less than 25 cents. At Copper Cliff, 7 miles distant the charge is 50 cents; at Sudbury 11 Miles distant it is $1. per month. It should be paid in advance, the people can afford it. May I suggest too that discretionary power should be allowed the teacher as to the admission of the whites, so that he may be able to guard the interests of the school and of the Indians.\n\nCarmichael's began in June. There was another family here but they have removed. There are 7 Whites settled in the neighborhood of school age. The Indians who were absent have returned. They left nearly two years ago on account of Small-pox and have had no schooling since. They came back in the holidays but left again to make arrangements for a final return. Their last return occurred about two weeks ago, since when they have been attending very regularly. I have now 11 Indian pupils on the roll, the average for the last two weeks has been over 10. I expect about that average for the current term. They, parents and children are anxious for schooling.\nI have worked assiduously and faithfully. The small population accounts for the small attendance in the past. This is now changed.\n\nIt seems to me that the Department and agt should support me against the attempt of illiterate and unscrupulous white people to domineer over him and the Indian School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned, J. A. Windsor.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning, 15th October 1902-\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to Official letter of date 24th ultimo, with reference to the Indian School at Naughton.\n\nI have the honor to report that I immediately took the matter up with the Teacher Mr Windsor and beg to inclose herewith a copy of his answer.\n\nOn reference to the duplicate copies of his quarterly reports I find that Mr Windsor mentions the fact that white children are attending the school but there is not any mention of fees being charged. I called on him to remit the fees he had collected in order that they might be transmitted to the Department and he sends me the sum of $1.\n\nAs the attendance has increased somewhat within the last short time, I am of the opinion it would be well to continue the school for a while and await results.\n\nI think it would be well to instruct the teacher to receive white children of school age who reside in the vicinity, for instruction, and that the sum of 25 cents per month for each pupil be collected, at least, which is a very reasonable charge, and the amount so collected by him be forwarded with each quarterly report, that he be called upon to keep a record of the white\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nwhite pupils that attend giving their names\nthe same to be forwarded with his regular report.\n\nThe teaching of the whites will not in\nany way interfere with the studies of the\nIndians but will assist them materially in\ngaining a knowledge of the English language.\n\nWill you please inform me under cover of\nwhat Return will I remit the fees thus collected.\n\nI have the honor to be\nSir\nYour obedient servant\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, 20th October, 1902.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th inst., with reference to the tuition of white children at the Indian School at Naughton, and in reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that such children should pay a fee of twenty-five cents per month, which should be remitted to the Department with special return for such fees, and you will be good enough to instruct the Teacher, Mr. Windsor, to this effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\nAssistant Secretary\n\nC. L. D. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHunitowandag, Ont.\nDear Mr. McCain,\n\nI have some thoughts of taking a trip to the N.W. during the holidays. Would the Department object to me taking an extra two weeks off once? As you know, we should in that case have only what the town schools have every year. Our Indians were ready only a part last year when school began, a large per-capita took the extra two weeks anyway. They have been attending pretty well our Indian children through the year, and I have worked faithfully with them.\n\nYours truly,\nJ. A. Windsor\nOTTAWA, 26th June, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant; and in reply I beg to say that under the circumstances, the Department will allow the two weeks extra leave applied for by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary\n\nJ. A. Windsor, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nNaughton Indian School,\nNaughton,\nvia Whitefish,\nAlgoma,\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department kindly conveys to my telling any word of the reserve from here after. Our average attendance of Indian children for this quarter is likely to be larger than for any previous quarter of my teaching. Besides, we have a number of white children for whom I shall take an additional fee, amounting to $2.50. I expect these fees for the same time will amount to at least $10 per month.\n\nThe association of the Indian children with the whites must be helpful to them in improving their English, and add yet to the work in the school. If the Department could see its way clear to allow me for the cutting and mailing of my word to the cost of eight cents, it would be quite an encouragement. Or else allow me to apply the fees for the same - I could get done in connection with the contract for school work and at the same rate.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. A. Wilder\nOTTAWA, 15th December, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to the enquiry contained in your letter of the 7th instant I beg to say that the Department does not see its way towards paying the cost of cutting and hauling the wood required by you in your residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary\n\nJ.A. Windsor, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nNaughton Indian School,\nNaughton,\nvia Whitefish\nAlgoma,\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nIn response to my request last year you kindly consented to extend the Summer Vacation two weeks, should I take a trip to the North West. Circumstances however prevented and I did not take the two weeks. This year the trip may again be that which will be allowed the same privilege. From past experience we may expect only a part of the children to be ready at an earlier date in any case.\n\nYours Truly,\nJ. A. Windsor\nTeacher.\nOTTAWA, 28th June, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th instant I beg to say that under the circumstances the two weeks extra leave applied for by you will be allowed, as you did not avail yourself of the permission to take it last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nJ.A.Windsor, Esq.\nTeacher,\nNaughton Indian School,\nNaughton,\nVia Whitefish Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning, Ont.\n27th September 1905\n\nSir,\n\nWhen Mr Benson was at this place during the present month the question of keeping open the school at Naughton was discussed and I mentioned to him that I was of the opinion that it was only wasting money in keeping this school open on account of the very small attendance, that the Protestant children of school age could be sent to some Industrial institution and the Catholics to Wikwemikong and better results obtained. Mr Benson agreed with me in this.\n\nI am just now in receipt of a letter from the teacher of the Naughton school, Mr J.A. Windsor, in which he informs me that the school was opened on the 21st August and has been kept continually open since that time on school days but without the attendance of a single child. In view of this do you not think it would be well to close the school at the end of this quarter?\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, October 6th\u20141905.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo suggesting the advisability of closing the Waughton School, I beg to say that as to this school the Rev. Dr. Sutherland has been communicated with and informed that the Department thinks it would be advisable to close it; but no action will be taken until his reply is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. L. D. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOTTAWA, October 6th\u20141905.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to call your attention to the unsatisfactory attendance at the White Fish Lake (Waukton) Indian School. The average last year was less than four pupils, and our Agent has written stating that he is in receipt of a letter from the teacher, Mr. Windsor, informing him that the school was opened on the 21st of August and has been kept continuously open since that time, but without the attendance of a single child; and the agent considers that in view of this, it would be well to close the school at the end of the quarter. Before taking action the Department has decided to advise you of this state of affairs and ask for your views. It would appear to be impossible to improve the attendance at this school, as most of the Indians have left the neighborhood; it seems to be a great waste of money to keep the school opened for such poor results.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nRev. Dr. Sutherland,\nGen'l. Sec. M.M.S.,\nTORONTO, Can., Secretary.\nThe Methodist Church,\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT.\n\nDictated - Mr. S. October 16th, 1905\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of October 6th #167,221, I would say that for some little time past correspondence has been proceeding between this office and the Rev. W. K. Hager, B. A., of Sudbury, Chairman of the District in which the Naughton Indian School is situated. I desired to obtain reliable information before making any recommendation to the Indian Department. It seems to be established beyond dispute that an Indian school cannot be maintained at the place referred to, and we are willing therefore that it should be closed at the end of the quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nOttawa, 18th October, 1905.\n\nReverend Sir:\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th inst., expressing the willingness of the Methodist Missionary Society to have the school at Whitefish Lake (Naughton) closed at the end of the current quarter; and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that there is no objection to closing this school, and our Agent has been informed accordingly and requested to notify the teacher that the school will not be continued after the 31st of December next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland,\nGeneral Secretary, Methodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, 16th October, 1905.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 27th ult. I beg to say that the Rev. Dr. Sutherland has informed the Department that the Methodist Missionary Society are willing that the Whitefish Lake School should be closed at the end of the current quarter.

June 30, 1903\n\nMr. Frank Patley, Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nThe Band of Indians residing on the Pontiac\nand Grand River Reserve, have requested me to negotiate\nwith your department, looking for them the building\nand equipment of a Day School, at a point\ncalled Racine, where most of the people are\nlocated. The habitual residents of that Reserve are\ncomposed of 17 families, and the children\nbetween 6 and 15 years of age are 15 in number.\nAs their request appears reasonable, I beg your\ndepartment to take the matter into considera-\ntion and grant them their petition.\n\nHoping to receive a favorable answer,\n\nI remain your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of the Mission\nOTTAWA, 9th July, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that Rev. Father Paquin, Superior of Missions, has applied to the Department on behalf of the Pt. Grondin Indians for the establishment of a day school on their reserve at a point called Beaverstone.\n\nUpon referring to your last annual report it is noticed that you state that the children belonging to this band attend school at Wikwemikong. If this is the case, there would not appear to be any necessity for a school there. The census returns show that there are only about ten children of school age belonging to this band, and if this is correct it would not be advisable to open a school as the average attendance would be too small to justify one being started. Father Paquin states that there are 17 families who habitually reside near the point indicated, and that there would be about 15 children who could attend the school.\n\nEven if your report is favorable, the Department would require a resolution of the band authorizing the necessary expenditure for the erection of\n\nJ.L.D. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nof a schoolhouse and funds would have to be voted to pay the teacher's salary. As the estimates are now in it would be too late to obtain a grant this year.\n\nThe last return from the Wikwemikong Industrial school shows only one pupil from this reserve in attendance. Please state why more of these children are not sent there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\nOTTAWA, 9th July, 1903\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo applying on behalf of the Indians of the Pt. Grondin reserve for the establishment of a day school at a point called Beaverstone; and in reply I beg to inform you that enquiry will be made in regard to this application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nRev. J. Paquin, S.J.\nSuperior of Missions,\nWikwemikong, Ont.:\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter dated 9th ultimo with reference to the application of the Rev Father Paquin, on behalf of the Point Grenadin Indians for the establishment of a day school on the reserve at Beaverstone.\n\nI have the honor to report that there are only three families members of the Point Grenadin Indian Reserve who have children of school age that reside on the reserve. These three families have five children of school age among them; three of these children live near Beaverstone and the other two live at a distance of about four miles from that point at the old Indian settlement at Grumbling Point. The remainder of the children of school age that appear on the census return live at Wikwemikong and West Bay.\n\nI presume the reason why more of these children do not attend the schools at Wikwemikong is on account of neglect on the part of their parents in not applying for admission for the children.\n\nThe Chief of the Point Grenadin Band informs me that neither he or any member of the Band\n\nThe Secretary resident\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nresident on the reserve ever requested the Rev Father Paquin to apply to the Department on behalf of the Indians with reference to the establishment of a school.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAgent.\nOTTAWA, 10th August, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant reporting on the application of the Point Grondin Indians for a day school on the reserve at a point called Newvartone; and in reply I beg to inform you that in view of your report Father Pauquin has been advised that the Department does not consider that it would be justified in establishing a school there, as many of the Indians of this band reside at Wikwemikong and West Bay, where their children can attend school, and that some of those of school age on the reserve could be taken into the Wikwemikong Industrial school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nC.L.D.

Sir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 30th June last, applying on behalf of the Indian of the Point Grondin reserve for the establishment of a day school at a point called Beaverstone, I have to inform you that the Department is advised that there are not a sufficient number of children living on the reserve to justify it in establishing a school there, even if funds were available for the purpose. Some of the Indian of this Band are said to reside at Wikwemikong and West Bay and their children could attend the Indian schools at these places, and there is no reason why some of the children of school age who live on the Point Grondin reserve should not be admitted to the Wikwemikong Industrial school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\n\nRev.

Father Parineau, May 17th, 1929.\n\nI will hasten today the most important of all the many requests I have ever begged of you, i.e., the grant of a Catholic school for Sheguianidah. You doubtless remember our conversation on this subject, in Espanola. When I asked you to let us have the school, because we were an overwhelming majority, you kindly answered that you would rather give us a new school.\n\n18 men of age, out of 24 in all, have signed the petition circulated by the chief, to obtain a Catholic school.\n\nI guarantee an attendance of 20 pupils and I have every reason to believe that this school will be as good a success as that of Birch Island, and it could be built more economically. There is a planing mill nearby, most of the material could be found in the near neighbourhood, e.g., stone, gravel, etc., are only three hundred yards from the planned school site donated by the chief.\n\nx x x\n\nEug. A. Parineau, S.J.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, May 27, 1929.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nSchool Branch.\n\nThe attached is an extract from a personal letter addressed to me by Rev. Father Papineau. He refers to a conversation with me at Espanola where I saw him on one occasion last winter. His request at that time was that the Anglican School at Sherwoodah should be turned over for the use of the Catholics. I told him however, that I did not think that the Department could consider such a proposition and I stated that if there was a sufficient number of children of school age to warrant the erection of a day school, he might make application therefor.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCensus shows:\nTotal Pop.: 119 - 48 R.C.\nSch Age 29 att told\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, June 14, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. MacKenzie has asked me to write with reference to the establishment of an Indian day school for Roman Catholic children at Sheguianidah. I may say that our latest census shows the total population of this reserve is 119, with not more than 30 children of school age. This indicates that only one school can be successfully conducted on the reserve. If a proportion of the children that should attend the present Sheguianidah Day School are Roman Catholic in religion, the Department will consider making the school non-denominational in character. The teacher would be appointed by the Department and both Protestant and Roman Catholic missionaries would be given an opportunity to give religious instruction to the children of their own faith. If this arrangement appears satisfactory to you, if you will let me know, the Department will write the Bishop of Algoma in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Holton,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. P. A. Papineau, S. J.,\nLittle Current,\nOnt.\nJune 19, 1929\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI thank you for your letter of the 14th Inst., No. 19-3-1 regarding a catholic day school for the Sheguianish Reserve.\n\nConsidering the stand of the Department about the Shishigwaning Schools, since the last fifteen years, your suggested combination has brought me a great surprise. Our missionaries are very warmly opposed to every sort of undenominational schools because the Catholic Church disapproves of them, and also because they are particularly unsatisfactory on Indian Reserves. The school being the continuation of the family, we are supremely anxious to have catholic schools for our catholic Indian families. The teaching of religion should permeate all other subjects, and not be given separately. Just as the various materials that serve to make a cake should be cooked together and not separately. For this reason, the vast majority of Indian schools have always been denominational.\n\nThe proposed system of religious instruction given alternately by Protestant & Catholic Missionaries in that neutral school would be difficult to realise, because the pupils of the opposed denomination would have to leave the class room during the religious teaching. Moreover, general experience proves that Protestant Parents are reluctant as much as Catholics in sending their children to neutral schools; so that in these schools the attendance is as poor as the character training. In the present case, apart from the fact that nearly eighty per cent of the Parents are asking for a catholic school, since more than twenty out of the thirty children of school age are Catholic, is it fair to deprive them of such catholic school as other Reserves enjoy?\n\nWe can guarantee an attendance of twenty; there are many Indian rural schools with less pupils on their Roll; may we not expect an equally just treatment for the catholic pupils of Sheguianish?\n\nThe new catholic school of Shishigwaning, built in 1912, could have most comfortably accommodated all the pupils of the Reserve; notwithstanding, an Anglican school was built for the Anglican pupils.\n\nContrary to this, the old Anglican school of Sheguianish, is in poor condition; the principle of religious freedom, invoked for the Shishigwaning Anglicans, should be at least equally applied to the Sheguianish Catholics, since the old school is not sufficiently equipped.\n\nWe feel that we are not asking an unreasonable favor, but simply the ordinary logical means to educate our Catholic Indian children.\n\nTrusting that you will deign reconsider our most ardent request, I remain,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nWith reference to Father Papineau's request that a Roman Catholic School be established on the Sheguinah Reserve, I have to state that the Anglican School there has been conducted for practically 50 years. During this time, the church authorities have been given the right of nominating the teacher. At the present time, there is Mrs. A. J. Abbott in charge. She has an enrolment of 18 and an average attendance for the past year of 10. Earlier reports indicated that approximately two-thirds of her enrolment were of her own faith, i.e., Church of England, so, evidently, some of the R.C. children have attended.\n\nOur latest Census gives a total population for the reserve of 119, with 48 R.C. - just 40%. Our Census shows that 29 children all told are of school age. This indicates that one day school can be successfully operated on the reserve.\n\nFather Papineau does not appear to like the denominational school arrangement, with both missionaries having the right to instruct the members of their flock in religious education for one hour per week. It is really necessary to get at the actual facts, and it would be well for the Department Inspector to secure the names of the children of school age living within 3 miles of the school and indicate on this nominal roll the religion of each child.\nOttawa, June 26, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the school situation on the Shagwianadah Indian Reserve. I may say that the Department recognises the advantage of having one or other of the churches associated with it in the conduct of its educational institutions; but, when there are not sufficient children of school age on an Indian reserve to warrant the conduct of two day schools, it is in the interests of economy that all children attend the one school. This arrangement has been found necessary on other reserves in Canada. An Inspector of this Department will be in this vicinity in the near future, and I have arranged for him to make a careful survey of the situation on the Shagwianadah Reserve. Upon receipt of his report, a further letter will be directed to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. E. A. Papineau, S. J.,\nLittle Current,\nOnt.\nNorth Bay, July 9th, 1929\n\nMr. Superintendent Scott, R.R.C., Ottawa,\nDeputy Chief, General of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is now nearly 25 years since I took spiritual jurisdiction over the Indians of Northern Ontario between Fort William and Mattawa, including those on the Manitoulin Island. During all those years I have not troubled the Department very much either in person or by letter with many demands or requests to promote the welfare of the Indians under my jurisdiction. Heads of religious denominations venture to operate with much fewer Indians under them, have both seen the Debt much more than I have without the faintest suspicion that I can be charged with boredom by the Department. I am writing today in order to bring to your attention a school which the Catholic Indians of Shequindah have forwarded to your Department. There are twenty Catholic children of school age in that Shequindah Reserve\u2014there are five Anglican children and three have their school.\n\nIt is surely quite reasonable to me that there should be a school for these 30 Catholic children only! I have confidence that the Department will give them one. The social morals and spiritual welfare of these Indians can be best promoted by seeing that they are thoroughly grounded in the teachings of Christ and the Church.\nThey can get very little religious instruction if it is not imparted systematically, by at least a half hour each day in the school. The parents are too ignorant to give it to them, and Rev. Mr. Robinson, the Roman Catholic missionary has not time to do it for them because he has so many places to attend, that he can visit that the mission only once a month at most, and that often on a week day. Religious instruction once a month in the Church is entirely inadequate to the school is necessary in these circumstances for the Christian formation of these native children.\n\nThere is a movement already on Manitoulin Island for two denominational schools for the same Band of Indians, and that is the situation where there are both Catholic and Anglican schools.\n\nSince the Anglican minority of Shoiguawing has its own Anglican school with the Anglican missionary in charge as teacher (which I highly approve) the best, and I am sure yourself shall be very pleased to grant the petition of the Shoiguawing Indians and provide them with the school which they desire for their children. Respectfully requesting you to favorably consider and grant this request which I submit to you. I am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev. Mr. Sellards\n\nBishop of S.S.M.\n\nNorth Bay, Oct.\nJuly 5th, 1929.\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esq., LL.D.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Dr Scott:\n\nWhen I visited Manitoulin Island about six weeks ago, Father Papineau took me to Sheguiandah, and pointed out the need of a Catholic school there. The district roundabout is, I believe, almost entirely Catholic, and there is a chapel there where Father Papineau says Mass once a week, or oftener.\n\nYesterday I received a letter from Fr Papineau, together with copies of correspondence he has had with your Department regarding the school; and I am pleased to note that an Inspector is being sent to investigate and report on the facts of the case.\n\nIf these are what Fr Papineau represents them, I do not see how in fairness his request can be refused.\n\nFr Papineau is not a trouble-maker, as everyone knows, but he has waited patiently a long time, and is now very much in earnest about securing this school. So too are the Catholic Indians of Sheguiandah, who will not fail to see, rightly or wrongly, discrimination against themselves. They instance the case of the small minority of Anglicans at Shishigwaning, who have had their school, and who were not forced to go to the school of the majority.\nand again they cannot understand why their petition should be denied on account of alleged rights of a tiny minority, when those rights were not supposed to exist when they themselves happened to be the minority. Now did they claim them.\n\nI feel sure that you will understand that I am not desirous of seeing trouble fomented on religious grounds, but that if I write thus frankly (as I am sure you would have me do) it is in order that trouble may be avoided. I am fully aware that it is not easy, sometimes it is even impossible to please all parties, and I would not make your task any harder or more unpleasant than it is. But in the long run, the one who looks only to justice and fairness, gains the consideration of all. That such is your desire, namely to be kind to all and impartially just to all, I know to be a fact, and I think that all recognize it. If some do not, they should.\n\nI cannot see any fair or any satisfactory solution save only that which the Indians and Fr Papineau have asked for. Certainly a public, non-denominational school would not be acceptable. It would certainly be rejected by the Catholics, and I should hope by the Anglicans also. Better almost the unfairness of the Catholic majority being forced to attend a school of an Anglican minority; than to have that colourless, undesirable hybrid, the Indian public school.\n\nA solution suggested by some one, namely that the Catholics should continue to attend the Anglican school, but that the missionaries might petition the Bishop of Algoma to teach in it\ncould not be entertained seriously.\n\nThe only solution that to my mind appears the least bit practical is the simple and straightforward solution that the Catholic Indians are asking for. Any other will, to my mind, lead to trouble, and will give rise inevitably to a sense of unfairness, which would be most unfortunate and regrettable, and which is so hard to lay.\n\nI hope you do not mind this rather hurried letter, written to catch a train. I have not had time to choose my words, but you will make allowances.\n\nWith very warm personal regards, I beg to remain, dear Dr Scott,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.H.

I did not see Father Papineau as he had left for Montreal to be gone two weeks.\n\nAccording to statistics given me by the Agent, there are at the present time 16 pupils on the roll, 10 of whom are Anglican and 6 Catholic. There are 5 families belonging to this section who are absent and not permanent residents on the reserve. Three of these are reputed to be Catholic and two Anglican. In the Catholic families there are 5 children of school age and 3 in the Anglican families, making a total of 13 Anglicans and 11 Catholics of school age.\n\nThere appears to be some difficulty in getting an absolutely correct census of those who are Catholic and who are Anglican. The Agent informs me that a number of the families are not very devout and switch from one religion to the other easily. On the other hand there are a number of Anglicans who would strenuously oppose any change in the present school system.\n\nA complete census of all the children in this section up to 15 years of age should be taken, showing the number of each denomination attending school and those who will be eligible later on. It may be that when the children come up to school age, there will be a sufficient number of pupils to warrant the erection of another school in this section in the near future. This course, in my opinion, would solve the problem in the most satisfactory manner.\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Pupils at Sheguiandah Indian Day School\n\nAnglican\n\nPearl Nahwegezhik\nCharlotte Mitchell\nJulia Ogemah\nAmnie Esquimaux\nJulia Esquimaux\nCharles Nahwegezhik\nEidie Ogemah\nRolland Nahwegezhik\nSolom\u00e9n Waindubence\nJonas Esquimaux\n\nRoman Catholic\n\nAnnie Mahadebin\nCecile Waindubence\nBridget Gaizezhoyongai\nChristine Douglas\nWillie Gaizezhoyongai\nLawrence Misinishkotewe\nIndian children of school age, for the Catholic School of Shingwauk.\n\n1.

Popescu\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nAs I have been absent on visitations in Muskoka for the last three weeks, I regret that I have not been able to send a reply sooner to your letter of July 30th concerning a proposal to open a separate school for Roman Catholic children on the Sheguiandah Indian Reserve.\n\nWhile I have much sympathy with the desire of the Roman Catholic clergy to bring up their children in their own Faith, and can appreciate their contention that an undenominational school does not satisfy them in this desire, yet I would submit that the present state of affairs has arisen entirely owing to their own action; for if you will refer to a letter from Mr. W. Sprague, Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, dated June 21st, 1867, to the Rev. J. W. Sims, Church of England missionary to the Indians on the Manitoulin, you will see that it was laid down that the Reserve should be maintained solely for Protestant Indians and that Roman Catholic Indians should not be permitted to locate themselves there, in order to promote unity among the Indians and to avoid religious controversy. In spite of this decision, Roman Catholic Indians have gradually crept into this reserve. Of course 1867 is a long time ago, but the Roman Catholic Indians have a large Reserve of their own on the Manitoulin, with which we have never interfered, and their present demand, therefore, seems an unreasonable one.\n\nThe multiplication of small schools is, of course, most unsound on educational grounds, and there can be no two opinions as to its being a great waste of money. The only suggestion of any practical value that I can make is that the Roman Catholic authorities should be allowed to withdraw their children for a certain period daily (or two or three times a week) to their church, which is quite near, or to some house, in order to receive religious instruction from their priest. I should not myself raise any objection to this procedure if it would\nsuit them, as I think it reasonably ought.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., D. Litt.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\nManitowaning, Dec. 9th, 1865.\n\nSir:\n\nChief Maisheguongai has applied for himself and his band for information as to whether they may select land next spring, at Shahgwa,an,dah Bay. He says he does not wish the land immediately on the river emptying there, but abt. a mile to the South, along the water front. The Indians generally wish to locate the lands to be allotted to them at this place - that is the Protestant Indians, - they wish to have a reserve to themselves, apart from the Catholic Indians - and they will be very much disappointed if they are prohibited. On the other hand there is a good mill site there, and from its position, and the good land, about it, it would be likely to become a village - I am informed that from the time of the surrender they have looked forward to settling at Shah gua, an, dah & it would give those Indians who are trying to incite trouble, an opportunity of making further mischief if they were not allowed to do so.\n\nIn connection with this subject I have the honor of submitting for your consideration - in relation to the removal of the establishment from here to Little Current next spring - that with the doubtful exception of its situation it does not possess the advantages that Manitowaning does. For two or three miles immediately about the village site, the land is swampy & poor & when beyond that you come to the good land, there is not nearly as much of it, as about this place - neither is the climate there so good as here, being more\nvariable on account of its proximity to the main land and the current flowing fast. Again to move there will require the erection of new buildings, & the abandonment of those here - the situation of Manitowaning is more central, and by a short portage water communication is had by South Bay with Lake Huron & Georgian Bay much nearer to the settled part of the Province than from Little Current - while by Lake Manitou all around the shores of which is good land - communication is had for 20 miles into the interior of the Island & by another very short road the North Channel is again reached. The land intervening between Manitowaning & South Bay & Lake Manitou & for some distance on its North shore is excellent, and when the present unsurrendered portion of the Island is ceded, it will surround Manitowaning with the best land on the Island - If the petition of the Indians for land at Shahgus, an,dah is granted they will require the larger part of the good land about there, and Little Current, and Little Current will be on an isolated point surrounded by swampy land - with an Indian Reserve intervening between it & the rest of the Island - An increased inducement to intending settlers to locate lands in this neighborhood is that here we have a fine Church and a Church of England Minister - the Rev. Mr. Jacobs, which it would be some time before they could have at the Current - As regards the objection that it is out of the steamboat route I beg to submit, as by reference to the map you will see, that from Wekwemikong Point it is not any farther in here than it is to Killarney where\nthe boat now touches, while to Killarney the Channel is intricate & dangerous, besides keeping the boat in the open Bay longer than if they gave up calling at that place & came in here - The water in this Bay is very deep & a steamer would experience no difficulty in coming in here at any hour of the night - Killarney is a barren desolate place with not nearly the same claim to a mail as Manitowaning - There is no church nor school nor Minister of the Gospel there & no Government officer but the Postmaster- Its only importance is that it is a small trading post for fish, & its only population a few half breed & white traders - I believe about half a dozen - The present arrangement is that the mail for this place is left by the boat at Killarney & sent in from there in an open boat - By the boats discontinuing to going to Killarney & coming here instead the mail for that place could be forwarded from here, instead of as now from there here - Again the houses here need not be abandoned - An early & positive decision is very desirable as to the place at which the Government establishment is to be, as the Indians are enquiring for land & will be governed in some measure as to their choice by the position of the Superintendent & other officers - And also if next spring a change is contemplated, it will be necessary at once to make arrangements for getting out timber for building as there are no houses away from here.\n\nI have the honor to be\nSir\nYour most obt. servt.\nG.

Supt. to Indians.\nManitowaning.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th December last relative to a desire expressed by Chief Maisheguongain and his Band to take up the allotments of 100 acres for each of their families in the vicinity of Shiguendah Bay under the provisions of the Treaty of October 1862, I have to state that the Surveys having progressed to the degree which they have done I do not see that any objection would exist to their deciding upon the Lots which they will apply to you to locate them for upon your being furnished with a map of the Survey.\n\nI see no objection to the Chief and his people taking up their land, a mile to the South E. end of the stream which empties into the Bay, with the understanding that the intervening land is not to be taken up by the Indians but reserved for sale. And if they can be induced to commence the settlement at a rather greater distance off it would be so much the better. You can explain to them that when a mill is erected a village with shops and other places of business would no doubt spring up and that their people would be safer from temptation, and better off by settling at some distance from such a village; while the distance would not be such as to prevent them visiting it when business required it.\nTheir social and moral condition will not be improved by their being in very close proximity to a Town or Village - And as the lands close thereto, will sell for the best prices, their funds will benefit by their not themselves taking possession of the most valuable lands - You will have the goodness to settle them as compactly as possible and having reference to keeping together the little Communities formed by special and particular associations which bring them together by bonds of feeling which they hold in common one with the other. This will tend to promote harmony and contentment among them. I allude especially here, to the wish which appears to prevail among the Protestant Indians to be allowed to take up their land together. To this reasonable request there can of course be no objection. You will have the goodness to examine the Treaty very carefully and make it exactly your guide in locating them in compliance with its conditions. At the same time you must endeavour to impress upon them the fact that they must be content to take a lot although but a portion of it may be fit for cultivation, and that the sale of the lands in a manner beneficial to them will depend upon their leaving for sale a sufficient quantity of land of good quality to induce white settlers to become Purchasers.\n\nI have as,\n\nSgd.

The classroom exercises should be conducted in the church for the time being, and the appointment of Miss Anne Hare, at a salary of $75 a month is approved. Mr. Indian Agent Lewis is being so informed. You might make requisition to Mr. Lewis for blackboards and whatever stationery, texts, etc., are required. So that an early start of this work can be made, the Department is sending a temporary supply of scribblers, exercise books, pens, pencils and readers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

J.,\nLittle Current,\nOnt.\nOttawa, August 26, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has decided to authorize a separate school for Roman Catholic children on the Sheguianah Reserve. Rev. Father E. A. Papineau, S. J., has made the request, and, after receiving Mr. Inspector McHookin's report and other recommendations, it has been decided to allow a trial. Classes will be held in the church and you should forward promptly any requisition for blackboards, stationery, etc., that may be required. The Department is arranging now for an interim supply of pens, pencils, scribblers, exercise books and readers.\n\nMiss Anna Hare, of Little Current, has been appointed teacher, at a salary of $75 per teaching month. Please give her every assistance as this new school is commenced. Classes may begin as soon as arrangements can be made. The interim supply of stationery, etc., is being addressed to Miss Anna Hare, at Sheguianah.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nComplaints have been made to me that Mr. Papineau has been taking Indian children from their parents & taking them to a school he is starting at Sheguandah. Mrs. Annie Way an Indian of this town has asked me to get her boy back for her.\n\nChildren are being imported to Sheguandah from Little Current, Whitefish Falls & even as far as Wikwemikong to swell the number of pupils attending his school at Sheguandah. Children who are both over & under school age. His motive is plain enough. He wants the Dept. to grant him a school at Sheguandah where he has not enough pupils to demand one.\n\nThis high-handed business ought to be stopped once & for all. This man recognizes no law, authority or any rights of others.\n\nI have had to complain of this man's actions before & now beg the Dept. of Indian Affairs to look into this matter.\nthoroughly & to clean up on this man's doing. For good.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn Tuesday, 24th October, Father Papineau, accompanied by Chief of Police Moroney, picked up one of my pupils, Charlotte Mitchell, daughter of Noah Mitchell, who was in the road, so she was told to get into the car against her wish. I have a signed order from the Father or mother requesting me to recover their child, also to take legal proceedings against Father Papineau.\n\nI understand Father Papineau is endeavouring to open a new school at Shaginando, but I highly object to this method of obtaining his pupils. The child went away without any clothes except what she has wearing around town.\n\nCan the Department please cut this case energetic press?\nThe parents had not been consulted, were astonished when they heard their child had been kidnapped; they live at West River, 4 miles from here, & their child stays there, goes home week-ends. I had to send an Indian up to West River to inform them, & yesterday at least in convenience as it was our School Fair day, I had to go by train to little current, to send a Police Officer after the child, but he was out of town, so I kept the train for him to go out to Shepinda & bring back the child. She is about 11 years of age.\n\nI have the honor to be your obedient servant,\n\nFrancis J.

Father Papineau, who was recently granted a separate Indian school for Roman Catholic children of the Sheguianish Reserve, has been importing children from Little Current, White Fish Falls and Wikwemikong. Two specific instances are given\u2014a son of Mrs. Annie Kay, of Little Current, and Charlotte, 11 year old daughter of Noah Mitchell, White Fish Falls. It is stated that the girl was a pupil at the White Fish Falls School, conducted by Mr. Hardiman. I should be pleased if you would make enquiries in connection with these cases and let the Department have a special report without delay.\n\nI have also to request you to pay a visit to the Sheguianish R. C. Indian Day School, examine the nominal roll and inform the Department where the parents of each of the children are living. You should also comment in other ways concerning their eligibility for this new school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. J.

I suppose the Douglas's had sent the boys to Mr. James Connelly and Mr. Douglas to Little Current on the 20th Aug. by J.B. Jacks to catch the boat that took the children to Spanish. But Father Papineau had told the boys that they were not coming to Spanish this year. I thought my boys up here 19th of July and\ntwo weeks later Aug 3rd\nI went to the Bureau of Migratory\nCamps and got them. When I\nasked him the reason he said\nthat the Department had sent\nhim notice to get my top and\nreturn them to Spanish school.\nI took the top clothes to Spanish\non the 19th Aug., but we were\nlate in getting to the school.\nWhen asked for the top they\ntold me they were in and already\nso I kept the clothes to the Principal\n2 days. Later I learned that\nmy top was not in school\nand wasn't coming. I was\ngreatly disappointed. I'd\nrather have them at Spanish\nSchool cause if they kept\ntwo weeks later Aug. 2nd Constable Benson & Mossey came and got them. When I asked him the reason he said that the Department had sent them notice to get my top and return them to Spanish school. I took the top clothes to Spanish on the 19th Aug. but we were late in getting to the school. When I asked for the top they told me they were in and already so I kept the clothes to the Principal. 2 days later I learned that my top were not in school and weren't coming. I was greatly disappointed. I'd rather have them at Spanish School cause if they kept\nAt Douglas's place I haven't paid their board, and if they are at Spanish school, I don't have to pay for their board, but I supply their clothes. So I wish you'd help me and put the boys back to Spanish school. Hope to hear from you again.\n\n[Signature]\nMrs. J. [illegible]\nBlind River\n\nEnclosed stamp.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of Departmental Letter No.19-14-I of the 5th instant concerning a report received by the Department recently to the effect that the Rev. Father Papineau has been importing children from Little Current, Whitefish Falls and Wikwemikong to attend the separate Indian school for Roman Catholic children of the Sheguianadah Reserve and in reply I have the honour to report that I have paid this school a visit and found that there are 24 pupils enrolled for the month of September, 6 of these are from Manitoulin Island Unceded Reserve, 1 Point Grondin, 1 non-treaty from Little Current, one non-treaty of Manitoulin Unceded Reserve, 1 from Christian Island Band, 1 from Whitefish River and 13 of Sheguianadah Band.\n\nOn examining the September quarterly report submitted by Miss Hare it is found number 2, 6, 7, 10 and 15 were placed in the Residential School at Spanish by authority of Departmental Letter No.36-0-10 of October 23, 1928, but since this school has been in existence they have been attending it instead of returning to Spanish after the close of the mid-summer holidays.\n\nThe father of number 1 and 3 on this report, Moses Enosse, resides at Little Current during the summer months, and these two pupils were placed in the Residential School at Spanish by authority of Departmental Letter No.36-0-10 of June 12th, 1926. Agnes Flamand enrolled as number 4, her parents reside at Little Current and she is also enrolled at the Little Current separate school as number 1. Number 5, Joseph Keshikgobness, is a non-treaty, his mother resides at Little Current, she claims that the boy was taken away but she is now again in possession of him. Number 8, Susan Jawana, is from Wikwemikong, her father is working in the neighbourhood of Sheguianadah at the present time and will return to Wikwemikong shortly. Number 10, William Corbeau, his father resides at Whitefish Falls, the boy resides with his grandmother at Sheguianadah and was placed in the Spanish Residential School in October 1928. Number 16, James Naodegijig, is from Wikwemikong, mother is dead, father is unknown but left for parts unknown so the boy resides with Paul Naodegijig of Manitoulin Unceded Band who is living at Sheguianadah and this boy was placed in the Residential School in October 1928. Number 17, Christine Obimwalwai, her father resides at Whitefish Falls, but she has always lived with friends at Sheguianadah excepting the period she attended school at Spanish. Numbers 18 and 19, Julia and Rose Ogima, Julia is enrolled at the Sheguianadah Anglican School as number 2 and is attending that school regularly. Rose is over school age and is not attending any school. Number 20, Emily Waindubence, is over school age and does not attend school regularly. Number 23, Charlotte Mitchell, is from Whitefish River Reserve, it would appear that this child was taken to Sheguianadah without any knowledge of the parents but was returned to Whitefish. Numbers 13, 14 and 15 are under school age, and it would appear that several are almost past school age.\n\nI might say that from what I can learn there are only very few pupils to attend this school of the proper age and actually belong to the Sheguianadah Band although it will only\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nonly be a matter of a short time until there will be quite a large enrolment as there are a number of young children that claim the Roman Catholic faith and members of Sheguiandah Band.\n\nI enclose herewith two letters which I received from Indian parents concerning their children attending this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 5, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI regret to write that complaints have reached the Department, to the effect that certain Indian children from Little Current, White Fish Falls and even Wikwemikong are being taken to attend the Sheguinadah R. C. Indian Day School. Two specific cases have been mentioned - a son of Mrs. Annie Kay, of Little Current, and Charlotte Mitchell, 11 year old daughter of Noah Mitchell, of White Fish Falls. It is stated that this last named child was in attendance at the school conducted under the auspices of the Anglican Church at White Fish Falls.\n\nThe Department is desirous of learning the truth of the matter, and I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Lewis for a report. If you have any representations to make in this connection, please write to me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. E. A. Papineau, S. J.,\nLittle Current,\nOnt.\nLittle Current, Manitoulin Island,\nOctober 23rd 1929\n\nAnswer to letter No. 19-14-1\n\nDear Mr. [signature],\n\nYour kind letter of October 5th was received by me, upon my return from Indian Missions in Minnesota.\n\nFirst, I must tell you my gratitude for giving me an opportunity to answer the charges made against us by some officials of the Anglican Church, and I hereby ask you, as a very particular favor, to allow us the same privilege whenever such charges are laid against us.\n\nAwait your return,\n\n[signature]\n\nRe: Annie Syjigobinaw (or Kay apple is wrongly called) her illegitimate child Joseph, enrolled in our Church by Catholic baptism, and 7 years of age, had never gone to school. Last summer, Annie Syjigobinaw arranged to place her boy (illegitimate) Joseph with his godmother, Mrs. Paul Naodzyig, at Shingwauk, where she brought the child, with the understanding that he would...\ngo to our school. Please note that therefore Rev. Mr. Weeks, Anglican minister at Little Current, had never bothered with this pupil. As soon as he was informed that young Joseph was going to our school, he raised quite a fuss, and coaxed Anna Sigognews to withdraw her boy from the godmother's home, at Sheguindah, and bring him back to Little Current. At present, young Joseph is in Little Current, Sucker Creek, etc., etc., but does not go to school; (the old story of the dog in the manger). Moreover Anna Sigognews, who has two illegitimate children, is living in humble penury, with Chuck Boyter, a professional drunkard. I leave you to decide whether the boy Joseph is better protected in that house of ill-fame and away from school, or with the Catholic godmother, in Sheguindah and going daily to our school.\n\nRe the other specific case, Charlotte Mitchell.\n\nTwo years ago, Mrs. Noah Mitchell gave by written document, to her mother, Mrs. Paul Navodigew, the said Charlotte Mitchell. This wild child has been living all over the district: back of West River, in Sheguindah and in Whitefish Falls. About one month ago, as I was driving by Whitefish Falls,\nWilson Esquimaux, the second grandfather of Charlotte, told me: \"Take Charlotte to her grandmother, Mrs. Paul Naodiging, at Shagwundah; it would be a good thing that she go to your school there, where she really belongs.\"\n\nIn all good faith, because Mr. & Mrs. Noah Mitchell and Charlotte live in the very house of Wilson Esquimaux, I took the grandfather's authorization and brought to Shagwundah, Charlotte, who was glad to accompany me. The next day, our Hardeman, acting minister for the Anglican Church, at Whitefish Falls, got highly hysterical; accused me of kidnapping children; and subjected Mr. & Mrs. Noah Mitchell to summon me before the Crown Attorney.\n\nIt was a huge joke! Rev. Mr. Weeks drove hastily to Shagwundah and demanded Charlotte from the grandmother. As this said Charlotte is a bad child, I had promised to allow the grandmother to send her in our school, solely because she was baptized in our church. We had to clothe her, and prevent her from skipping the other pupils. I was not anxious to keep her.\n\nRe Wikwemikong, South Bay, etc.\n\nFirst I might suggest the strangeness.\nof the fact that the Anglican officials will meddle\nwith Wikwemikong, and South-Bay where they have\nnot a single member of their church.\nAs I explained to Mr. Ferrier, there is a saw\nmill in Shegwandah. Some Wikwemikong\nIndians are working in that saw-mill and\nhave their family near the mill, since seven or\neight years. Naturally their children are pupils\nin our school.\n\nWilfred and Joseph Sannawehi, born at Wikwe-\nmikong, have lived frequently, and their grandmother's\nhome, and John McKatebin, at Shegwandah.\nSince two years nearly, their mother has left\nher husband, Grace Sannawehi, and lives in\nscandalous union with Joseph Talkwadjiwan, in\nBlind River. \u2014 As a natural consequence,\nGrace Sannawehi has left his two boys with\nJohn McKatebin, at Shegwandah, where they\nregularly frequent our school.\n\nI am ready to assert these allegations under\noath. \u2014 Trusting that they will bring\nthings to their former peaceful conditions.\n\nI remain your obedient servant,\n\nEug. A. Papineau\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF REV. CHAS. BELANGER, S.J., PRINCIPAL, INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, SPANISH, ONT., DATED NOVEMBER 28TH, 1929.\n\nOriginal on File 36-0-3.\n\nThese children, Enosse, came back after holidays with the others. As there were too many applications of needy girls and not enough accommodation, we presumed the permission of sending away someone who were living close to the schools and, as it was the case for them (Enosse), they left on the 24th of September p.m. and were home only on the 25th.\nOttawa, December 6th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to refer to your 1060 of the 15th of October with reference to the children enrolled at the Sheguianidah R.C. Indian Day School. The Department has had considerable correspondence with interested parties in this connection. Please instruct the teacher to prepare the December quarter return with care and you should see that only the names of bona fide students are listed there and that the proper age is shown in the case of each. If you have any comments to make when forwarding this return, please do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J.

Lewis, Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWith reference to the school issue might I ask if you would write the Department enquiring, if the Separate School had the right to obtain signatures among the Band over the Council. The question was not submitted to the council.\n\nAnd we would like a copy of the letter purported to be sent to the Department containing the signatures with reference to the above.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nCharlie Nahwaikezhik.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of a communication received from Charlie Nahwaikezhik, of Sheguinandah, pertaining to the Roman Catholic School which has been conducted in the Sheguinandah Reserve since September last.\n\nMuch discord exists among the Indians of the different religious denominations regarding the two schools now in existence in the Sheguinandah Reserve, and this Indian, Charlie Nahwaikezhik appears to be one of the most interested in the school affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 15, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 1060 of the 11th instant, with enclosure, relative to the Sheguianah R. C. Indian Day School. I do not know that there are any regulations prohibiting a missionary from securing signatures from the Band without the sanction of the Indian Council. The only petition signed by Indians in connection with this school was dated April 29, 1928. It was a request purporting to be signed by 19 Indians, who had children of Roman Catholic faith ready to attend a separate school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Rafferty has notified me that no estimates have been marked for the construction of the Catholic school on the Sheguianah Indian Reserve. Considering that the subsidies for Indian education have not yet been voted; and that this question cannot easily be settled by merely adding the comparatively small sum of $3000.00 to the proposed building expenditures in fairness for your Department as well as for the Sheguianah Indians, may I beg you to reconsider our many solid reasons to be supplied with a convenient school building by next September.\n\n1. The use of St. Anthony's church puts us to many serious inconveniences. It is not central; it is very hard to keep warm; consequently does not give much inducement to good attendance. Moreover, as we had to replace the pews by school desks, the parishioners are greatly inconvenienced on Sundays. We readily suffered this heavy drawback during one year, but the prospect of repeating it during twelve more months is not very pleasant. We have saved expenses to the limit of economy; we have no teacher's desk and the only piece of furniture we asked for the teacher's residence was a small box stove.\n\n2. We fail to see the good excuse for one more long year of \"observation,\" in view of the fact that in Sheshogwening year 1929, your Department has, without any long \"observation,\" built an Anglican school for just the three families of David Samson, Paul Okeda & John Migunigewa. In Sheguianah, there are thirteen Catholic families. Besides being sufficient to warrant the future of the school, this number will be increased by the progressing local industries of: a saw mill; a silica quarry; a fishing station and the large house of \"The Manitoulin Gardens.\"\n\nSheguianah is an active centre and not decline as Sheshogwening did.\n\n3. The fact that some of the present pupils do not belong to the \"Band\" can not justify the refusal any more than at Birch Island, where fourteen of the pupils do not belong to the Reserve.\n\n4. We love to picture your Department as the patronization of British Policy, but we cannot help comparing the readiness and facility with which the Sheshogwening Anglican School was established, together with the long arduous difficulties we have experienced in obtaining the Catholic school of Birch Island; and the actual painful supplications to obtain a school for Sheguianah a similar school whose future is promising as good a success as that of Birch Island.\n\n5. With an average attendance of thirteen for the whole year, our Catholic school of Sheguianah has more pupils than a great many Indian Day-schools, in Ontario and the other provinces of Canada.\n\n6. Owing to the proximity of the building material, a replica of the Boswa School could be erected in Sheguianah for the sum of $3000.00.\n\n7. The Catholic Indians of Sheguianah who constitute the majority of the Band are very anxious to have a suitable school building, and join me in this earnest request for a more favorable consideration of their needs and rights.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLittle Current, Feb. 21, 1930\nOttawa, March 3, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo, with reference to the construction of a classroom for the Sheguianah R. C. Indian Day School. The Department's Estimates were completed and passed by the Treasury Board two months ago. If a supplementary estimate is allowed, your representations will be considered. At the present time, I am not hopeful that a building can be erected this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. E. A. Papineau, S. J.,\nLittle Current,\nOnt.\nMarch 3rd\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received a communication from Rev. E. B. Parker, S.J., Little Current, Indian Missionary, in reference to the erection of a school building at the Indian Mission of Shigundah, Manitoulin Island.\n\nAs I understand, during the last year the school has been conducted in the church; the church members had a very high ceiling and as a consequence it had a great deal of heat and was not well heated, and notwithstanding this and many other inconveniences and unsuitableness of such a building for school purposes he reports to me that there has been during the whole year in foul and fair weather an average attendance of 13 pupils. He reports also that there shall be an increase in the number of pupils, particularly in those who are a suitable build living because of certain industrial activities at which the Indians can get work.\n\n13 of an average attendance is very good for an Indian School and I know of several schools where there are not so many, and yet there are in those places suitable school buildings. I respectfully request that a small but adequate school be built at Shigundah.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. There are over 5500 Indians under my jurisdiction.\nOttawa, March 7, 1930.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 3rd instant, requesting the construction of a classroom for the Shogunandah R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that no funds were provided for this work in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year. If, however, a supplementary estimate is allowed, your representations will be considered. At the present time I am not hopeful that a building can be erected this year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I believe you provided seats and assisted in the payment of a teacher.\n\nIt appears that the school has been well attended, and since the church is not a suitable place to use as a school, it would be very desirable indeed to have a small building erected for this purpose.\n\nRev. Father Papineau is very anxious to extend his work, and is asking that a school be built this year if at all possible. I hope his request can be granted.\n\nThanking you in anticipation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBB/EM.\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nMarch 10, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Bowman:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the erection of a school building for the Sheguiandah R.

Missionary activities on Indian reserves do not come within the purview of the Department. I note that you complain regarding certain actions of Father Papineau. Previous complaints regarding the activities of Father Papineau were reported upon by one of our officers and the Department found no cause for interference.

Can you explain why his school at Sheguiandah has received your sanction when you are aware the children on the school register are nearly all either imported or over school age or under school age, or not Treaty Indians' children belonging to the Sheguiandah Band. The Department refused to\nsupport the Anglican School at White Fish Falls for years, the reason given being that there were not sufficient Indian children whose parents were Treaty Indians belonging to the Band.\n\nCan you ascertain how many children attending Fr. Papineau's school are 1st receiving treaty & belonging to the Band, and are of school age and how many are imported. Two I know of were baptized Anglicans, one from Little Current & one from White Fish Falls, the Indians here all know this to be true.\n\nTherefore can we not have fair play? Can you let me have a copy of a petition purported to be sent by the Indians\nin favor of the new school\nas it is claimed deception\nwas used.\n\nI am sir\nyour obedient servant\n\nLucius H. Burdymore\nOttawa, March 31, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with further reference to the Sheguinandah R. C. Indian Day School. It is true that there were a few names on the nominal roll of this School, which should not have appeared there; but the Rev. Father Papineau was given instructions concerning those that should attend and the preparation of the quarterly return. At the present time, the Department has no information which would warrant a further investigation. There are, apparently, a sufficient number of eligible students to make the Sheguinandah R. C. Indian Day School a success and the Department is giving it a fair trial.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLucius F.

If these Indians belonging to the Passamaquoddy Band, if this were true how can you call the school an honest success, it is unworthy of a missionary to deceive the Government.\n\nAPR 7 19\nYou did not give me an explanation as requested, nor did you send me a copy of the petition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

F. Hardyman and the Indians of the reserve, either individually or collectively, as you may deem wise. I would personally appreciate it if it would be possible for you to have Mr. Ferrier visit Sheguiandah in the early future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGEN[B]\nOttawa, February 18, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has lately reviewed the latest return from the Sheguianidah R. C. Indian Day School, and I wish to ask certain questions. In your letter of October 15, 1929, you stated that Susan Jswana was from Wikwemikong and would shortly return there. I find she is still on the roll of the school at Sheguianidah and her attendance during the December quarter was very poor - days present, 11, and days absent, 43. Please let me have a report concerning this girl. You might also state if the family of Isaac and Alfred Recollet, which apparently is from Whitefish River, is now living at Sheguianidah. The names of these two boys have appeared on the Sheguianidah R. C. School returns since the September quarter. You might also let me know something of Margaret Mishibinijima, said to be from the Manitoulin Island unceded Band, and of Vincent Nanibush, stated to be non-treaty. These names also appear on the latest return.\n\nAn early reply is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nINDIAN AGENT,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nFebruary 18, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Nicholson:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the school situation on the Sheguianiah Indian Reserve. The Department has given much thought to this problem, and the nominal roll of the Roman Catholic Day School is examined from time to time. I may say that, for the December quarter, there was an enrolment of 16, with an average attendance of 12. They all appear to be eligible and of school age, and, as this separate school is successful, the Department is giving it a fair trial. The teacher's salary is being paid at the present time, and, if Parliament provides the necessary funds, I propose to erect a building for the purpose during the summer.\n\nThe facts in connection with the Roman Catholic School at Sheguianiah are well known to the Department, and I doubt the necessity of having Mr. Ferrier investigate, unless there is some special reason known to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nGeo. B. Nicholson, Esq., M. P.,\nChapleau,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nI have Departmental Letter No. 19-14-1 of the 18th instant, concerning certain pupils on the enrolment of Sheguianidah Roman Catholic Indian Day School, and in reply I have the honour to report that in the case of Susan Jawana, her parents reside at Wikwemikong, but at times the father works at a little saw mill at Sheguianidah and when the family is there this girl is entered on the daily register at the R.C. Indian School. The family reside at home in Wikwemikong during the winter months.\n\nIsaac and Alfred Recollet are sons of Antoine Recollet number 68 of the Whitefish River Band. The parents reside at Whitefish River and until recently these boys attend the Birch Island Day School regularly. They reside at quite a distance from the Birch Island School which they claim is the reason of them being at Sheguianidah attending school.\n\nMargaret Mishibinijima is from Manitoulin Unceded Reserve. Her parents reside in the vicinity of Whitefish River. Authority was granted to have her placed in the Residential School at Spanish by Departmental Letter No. 36-O-IO of September 5th, 1930, and her parents were advised accordingly, and the principal of the school advised to the effect that she would be granted accommodation, but it would appear that she was taken to Sheguianidah instead of to Spanish.\n\nWincent Manibush is a non-treaty boy. His parents reside at Whitefish River Reserve within a short distance of the Birch Island Day School and until recently attended that school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 28, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 1060-3 of the 25th instant, with reference to certain pupils on the roll of the Sheguianish R. C. School. I wish to ask further questions concerning the two Recollet boys, Margaret Mishibiniijima and Vincent Manibush. Please inform me with whom they are living and what arrangements for their board have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J.

Father Papineau. You will remember that, as from September first, 1929, the Department has paid salary to the teacher. The Church authorities and others are requesting us to provide a suitable classroom.\n\nWhen the Sheguinandah Reserve was established, it and the Sucker Creek Reserve were supposed to be for the Protestant Indians of that time. At Sheguinandah particularly, Catholic families have settled and it has been necessary to make a decision concerning a separate school. Mr. L. F. Hardyman, Church of England Missionary there, has indicated it was his understanding that the Catholic families should not be allowed to settle on this reserve and he has somewhat bitterly opposed the establishment of a separate school. I informed him that, whereas the reserve may have been established for Protestant Indians 50 years ago, the Department could not guarantee that the Indians living there would remain Protestant. I also stated that Indians from other reserves in the vicinity, whether Protestant or Catholic, would not likely be prohibited from moving to Sheguinandah provided they had an opportunity of bettering themselves from an economic standpoint. It appears that, recently, the Indians at South Bay have had a difficult time and they are leaving there and are having somewhat better luck at Sheguinandah.\n\nI made a careful examination of the nominal\nroll at the R.C. School, interviewing both Mr. Hardyman and Father Papineau, concerning each child, and, along with Agent Lewis and Inspector McCookin, visiting some of the homes, in an effort to secure additional information. I learned that 7 of the children were clearly eligible for a Catholic school; that 9 or 10 others might be considered importations to the reserve and in the case of one or two additional, the religious affiliation was doubtful.\n\nOf the 10 that appear as if they might be importations for the purpose of bolstering the claim for a separate school, 2 are living with their grandmother, a resident of the reserve, the parents being separated, 2 are living with an aunt, as their own home near Whitefish Falls was distant from an Indian school, 2, along with their mother, originally from Grassy Bay, are staying with a resident of the reserve, and 2 are living with an aunt who is looking after them, there being no school near their own home at South Bay. I am quite satisfied that Father Papineau is assisting with the board for these children.\n\nThe fact remains that there are nearly 20 Roman Catholic children living on the Sheguinandah Reserve and I take it that it is the Department's duty to educate them. In addition, there are 9 younger children who will be eligible from year to year.\n\nDuring the fall and winter terms of the coming academic year, it will be seen if those children which might be called \"Imported\" are to remain more or less permanently on the Sheguinandah Reserve. This will assist in a decision whether or not funds should be provided for a classroom. A teacher's residence may not be necessary, as the white community at Sheguinandah is less than a mile away from the population centre of the reserve.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nBirch Island, June 17th 1931\n\nTo Mr Russell T. Ferrier, in a\n\nMy dear kind Sir Ferrier,\n\nThe Bishop's visit made it impossible for me to thank you sooner for the treat of your tour on Manitoulin. You have left imperishable memories and delightful wishes for your return.\n\n\"Forsen et hac polivi memoriae juxtaest\" (Virgil)\n\nConcerning the catholic school of Shequindah, the myth of attendance fading, is vanishing gradually \u2014 I had a long friendly conversation with Mr Hardman, the Anglican catechist. He could not produce any name of a four year old child, but on our list you will hardly believe that...\nI have almost convinced him that the two schools could prosper in Shaganawal. Competition is the life of attendance as well as of trade.\n\nYou have mentioned a certain girl destined and enrolled for Spanish whom we could have placed on our list, during a few days. I have learned from Mr. Hardiman that this girl was Rose Debesage Windibins. Here are the real facts about this case.\n\nWhen our school was opened, Joseph Windibins would be guardian of Rose Debesage. We asked Mr. Belanger, during the holidays, to obtain the discharge of Rose Debesage Windibins, so that she might remain with him and attend our day school. Mr. Belanger promised to do so. We were in perfect good faith when we placed Rose on our list.\n\nAfter a few weeks, Joseph Windibins\ntook Rose away\u2014to little current air, vicinity, and let her wander all over, away from every school. I then notified Bisson, the constable, who brought Rose back to school for readmission.\n\nOur Hardiman accused us before your Department, of sheer dishonesty in this case; and his accusations about Rose Windham and the four-year-old pupil gave you the impression that we were padding the list of pupils, upon the strength of our Hardiman's charges you have remained under this impression and you have occasionally reproached us with this pretended trickery, which has had a considerable share in the refusal to build our school. Now my dear sir Ferrier, as I have remarked before, concerning the false\naccusations of Rev. Mr. Weeks,\nis it fair to keep in your\nfiles (which make history) any\ncharge against us (or any one else)\nwithout giving us an opportunity\nto justify ourselves? It is two\nyears since Mr. Hardiman accused\nus of dishonesty, in the case of\nRose Windhuis; you have not\nspoken to me about it until\nthree weeks ago.\nMr. Hardiman tells me that\nhe obtains from the Department\nthe monthly or quarterly list\nof our pupils; and then like\na secret detective, criticizes us\nunjustly. May we not be\ngiven the possibility at least to\nattempt a justification.\nIn reviewing with you the list of\npupils, I forget one family, with\nfour children, that of Simon Naou-giig.\nThe oldest daughter, Theresa Naogi-\njig-o was at school last year\nis ill at the grandmother's home.\nThis additional family gives us\nreal justifiable hopes for our\nschool which, I trust you will\ntry to build this summer.\nI will send you tomorrow\nthe memorandum you referred\nto in your paternal advice.\n\nmost gratefully Yours\n\nEugene Palmer\nTo Miss Agnes Micmackunt\nFather Papineau Collins Inlet Ont\nLittle Current June 6th 1931\nOnt. Dear Father,\nI am writing to ask you\nI would like to put my little\nboy Gabriel Paul in School\nat Shaginawbah no other place\nas it's close here. He will\nbe 9 years old on July 1st.\nHe has not had first communion\nyet. It's about time he should have\nit. Although there is a priest comes here\nfrom Killarney but he does not say\nanything to me about it. I would\nlike him to go to school at Shaginawbah.\nI would like Mr Windlebeck to keep an\neye on him. Will pay for his schooling.\nHe is anxious to go to school. I might\nlike him to be there one or two years\ndepends on how he gets along in his\nlearning. The reason I would like him to be close here is I would go see him in fall. That why as Spanish is too far away from here.\n\nPlease write and let me know what you think and I will take him when school opens.\n\nThat's all. Goodbye.\n\nFrom Miss Agnes\n\nMizimakwot.\n\n(Open)\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nOccasionally, I receive letters like this one, which indicate a special condition. Numerous parents do not like to send their children at present.\n\nE. Caprison\nOttawa, July 13, 1931.\n\nDear Father Papineau:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo, with reference to the Sheguianah R.C. Indian Day School. I cannot find any correspondence at all relative to Rose Debassige Windibins. Further, I regret that I cannot remember any discussion that I have had concerning her case.\n\nI may say that, at no time has Mr. Hardiman been sent from the Department the monthly or quarterly roll of the pupils at this school. If we have any criticism to make, we will do as in the past: we will write to you, asking for any representations you care to make.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHussell T.

LEWIS, ESQ., INDIAN AGENT, MANITOWANING, DATED APRIL 8, 1932.\n\n---\n\nOriginal on #19-14-5.\n\n---\n\nThey maintain that they have found out that the upkeep of two classrooms for the few pupils on Sheguianah Reserve is too expensive, and would not under any consideration vote any of their Band Funds towards erecting any new school buildings.\n\nThe original motion which they passed in Council pertaining to this matter is enclosed herewith, which motion is signed by eight members of the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nI might say, also, that it appears to be the general feeling among the Indians to have the classroom conducted in the Roman Catholic Church during the last three years past closed, and all the children attend the Anglican School again, which they consider a public school.\nDear Mr. [Name],\n\nMr. Lewis, the Indian agent, held a meeting at the agency, and the result was a majority of 3 against the building of the new school.\n\nTo this I object that many of the boys were absent on the meeting day, for they were out of the Reserve, and consequently that majority is null.\n\nBesides, I will like to know if Mr. Lewis was authorized by the Department to take the vote.\n\nThat meeting reminded me the one Mr. Daly had at Picton, when he wanted to retain his own daughter as the teacher. That meeting was composed then of himself and two protesters only\u2014\n\nAnyway, that the agency's meeting seemed to be a victory more and stuff stir up the old trouble.\n\nSome higher authorities than me are dealing about it with Mr. Nicholson, and then there will be some more agitations. I don't see, at all, the opportunity of that meeting. If the Department is too poor to build up a new school, at present, he has only to say it, and then it won't be necessary to stir up the agitation.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nRev. L. Porcher\n\nLittle Current\nSkepiandah, Ontario,\nJune 6th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to say I would continue teaching at the Skepiandah Catholic School, since then I have decided to discontinue my duties.\n\nI would like to say that a new teacher coming here will find things very inconvenient as supplied my own dishes, bedding, etc., etc. Since I was so near home and little affected that at any time the school would be built and properly equipped. I thought I should make a note of this so you would have an idea of the conditions and could inform the new teacher so she could either carry on as I did or procure the necessities from the Department before September.\n\nHope this change will not\ninconvenience you too much and I thank you for your kindness in the past.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nAnna Hare.\n\nMr. Russell J. Ferrie,\nDept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMy dear Mr. Furnie,\n\nI just learn today that Miss Martin has been assigned to the Ojibway school.

I did not reply to your first communication earlier, as the Department is somewhat in doubt about the advisability of indefinitely continuing the services of this teacher, now that she is married. As you are aware, it is only in exceptional cases that the general rule concerning the engagement of married women is not followed. The Sheguianish R. C. School is quite suitable for a single person, as good boarding facilities can be found a mile away in the white village.\n\nThe Department would be glad to have a further expression of your opinion before filling the vacancy and is prepared to depart from the usual practice concerning the engagement of married women, if you believe the circumstances warrant such action.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

I thank you very much for all that you have done for that school.\n\nSo now there are two schools which will have teachers who will make a success; namely Sheguinabah and Shebegeaming. Besides, Birch Island is full of hopes with Miss Clarke as teacher. But West Bay, the biggest school after Spanish, in the Island, could again use another able teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. L.

I was simply surprised by Miss Martin who told me that Miss Martin had a 2nd class certificate for Ontario\u2014so Miss Martin does not seem to me to be qualified for the mission R.C. school.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nI may add that report of the inspectors Mr. Greening, about West Bay school was very unfavorable. The only scheme to make that school run well, I need be to have a lady of Spanish, as it is in the gathering.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. L.

I wish to apply for the position of teacher in that school.\n\nMy former experience consists of two years in England, one year in St. A. Palmer, Eau Claire, Ontario, three years in St. Apineau, Ottawa, Ont., and one year and two and a half months in Garden River Anglican School which I was obliged to leave because I became a Catholic.\n\nI hold a Second Class Ontario Certificate which I obtained by training at North Bay Normal School in 1926-27.\n\nI am free to commence duties at any time, and, if appointed, shall do my utmost to perform them with all possible fidelity.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.S.

D. Murray of Sheguianadah has written asking me to ascertain whether you would be agreeable to allow him to substitute for a period in Mrs. Murray's stead as teacher in the Indian School at Sheguianadah. Mrs. Murray's health is not at the moment such as will enable her to carry on through the Winter. Mr. Murray is a cultured, well-educated man, having taken his honour matriculation. Reverend Father Porcheron, who is in charge of the Indian School at Sheguianadah, is perfectly satisfied to allow Mr. Murray to substitute and it seems to me there should be no good reason why Mr. Murray should not be allowed to take his wife's place for the time being.\n\nI would appreciate very much your advising as early as possible what may be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. B. Nicholson,\nM.P. for Algoma East.\nOttawa, December 24, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, informing the Department that, on account of the condition of her health, Mrs. W. D. Murray, teacher of the Sheguialash Indian Day School, will be unable to carry on her duties during the present winter, and requesting that her husband be appointed to substitute for her during the period she is absent.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department is very doubtful as to the services Mr. Murray will be able to perform as teacher, but, in view of your request and also that Rev. Father Porcheron, the missionary for this Reserve, is satisfied with this arrangement, the Department will approve of Mr. Murray acting as substitute teacher during the period of his wife's absence. He will be allowed salary at the same rate as was paid Mrs. Murray, viz., $80 per teaching month, less 10 percent during the present fiscal year.\n\nMr. R. J.

You might ascertain from Mrs. Murray what her intentions are for the next school year. I might say that, if her health or family duties interfere with her teaching services, it would be advisable that she resign. Her husband, who acted as substitute during the period of her illness, has no professional qualifications, and the Department does not desire to continue the present teaching arrangements after the end of June, next, unless Mrs. Murray is able to devote her full attention to the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The matter as to whether Mrs. Murray would be able to resumed her duties as teacher in this school was taken up with her some time ago, and had an interview with her personally concerning this matter, but she did not give me a decided reply. She has now advised me to the effect that she thought it well to confer direct with the Department and paid Ottawa a visit during the week end of the 20th instant, and no doubt but that I would hear from the Department concerning this matter shortly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 6, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to teaching services at the Sheguianidah Indian Day School for the coming school year.

The Department is not exactly certain from your letter whether you recommend Mr. Murray or Mrs. Murray.\n\nThe regulations provide that a married woman should not be employed, but the Department is prepared to make an exception in the case of Mrs. Murray, and, if you so desire, will approve of her appointment for one more year.\n\nRegarding Mr. Murray, the Department approved of his being in charge of the school for a limited time, owing to special reasons, but as he is not qualified, and owing to the fact that there is a large number of qualified teachers available at the present time, the Department considers that it would not be in the interests of the pupils at this school to appoint Mr. Murray for the academic year 1933-34.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The document was circulated through the Reserve and has been signed by all the members of the Band who are in resident on the Reserve, with the exception of two.\n\nAs a number of the children who attended the Day Schools on this Reserve during the last school term, past, have been admitted to the Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste. Marie recently, or have moved away from the Reserve, the remaining number of pupils have been reduced to such an extent that the large majority of the members of the band feel that the Anglican Day School can accommodate them without any inconvenience to the teacher, and that the existence of two schools on the Reserve, where one is sufficient to provide accommodation for the small number of pupils, is only unnecessary expense involved during this distressed time among the Indians.\n\nI have visited both Day Schools at Sheguinandah recently. The daily registers show small enrolments at both schools. This matter has been discussed with several of the members of the Band and they all feel very much in favour of having this school closed, outside of two members, the chief being one of the two who are infavourable to this project, and I feel that it is only unnecessary expense involved in the existence of two Day Schools on this Reserve where there are not over fourteen pupils of school age to attend.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 20, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing a petition signed by a number of the members of the Sheguianah Band, requesting the Department to close the Sheguianah R.

MCGILL\n\nThe Minister has received some correspondence with respect to the School situation at Shequianah, on Manitoulin Island. According to it, an arrangement was made many years ago whereby certain Reserves on the Island were to be regarded as Roman Catholic and the remainder Anglican, Shequianah being among the latter. Five years ago a Catholic School was opened at that place, and it is alleged that the Clergymen in charge brought children from various other Reserves, lodged them in Indian homes, and demanded a School for twenty-four pupils. It is further represented that only three or four were bone fide pupils, that is, children actually belonging to the Band at Shequianah and of school age. The department is reported to have been advised of the situation and that no action was taken, and it is further alleged that the Band voted almost unanimously against a second School. Later, a petition is said to have been sent to the department for the closing of the second School owing to the added expense and in view of the fact that, all told, there are not more than fifteen children of school age belonging to the Band.\n\nThe Minister would like a report giving a complete history of the matter.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nMay 19, 1934.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 14th instant,\nI beg to say that the Department has paid a salary for the\nteacher of the Shaguinandah R. C. Indian Day School from September\nfirst, 1929.\n\nIt has been in continuous operation since that time, and\nfor the fiscal year ended March 31, 1934, there has been an enrol-\nment of 12 and an average of 7 pupils. During the same year, 16\nchildren were enrolled at the Shaguinandah Protestant School, with\nan average attendance of 9.\n\nFollowing the recognition of the Shaguinandah R. C.\nSchool in 1929, the Department received protests along practically\nthe same lines as are apparently contained in the communication\nfrom your correspondent. In 1931, a department official was sent\nto Shaguinandah to investigate the matter, and he reported as\nfollows:-\n\n\"When the Shaguinandah Reserve was established, it and\nthe Sucker Creek Reserve were supposed to be for the Prot-\nestant Indians of that time. At Shaguinandah, particularly,\nCatholic families have settled and it has been necessary to\nmake a decision concerning a separate school. Mr. L. F.\nHardyman, Church of England missionary there, has indicated\nit was his understanding that the Catholic families should\nnot be allowed to settle on this reserve and he has some-\nwhat bitterly opposed the establishment of a separate school.\nI informed him that, whereas the reserve may have been\nestablished for Protestant Indians 50 years ago, the Depart-\nment could not guarantee that the Indians living there would\nremain Protestant. I also stated that Indians from other\nreserves in the vicinity, whether Protestant or Catholic,\nwould not likely be prohibited from moving to Shaguinandah\nprovided they had an opportunity of bettering themselves\nfrom an economic standpoint. It appears that, recently, the\nIndians at South Bay have had a difficult time and they are\nleaving there and are having somewhat better luck at\nShaguinandah.\n\n\"I made a careful examination of the nominal roll at\nthe R. C. School, interviewing both Mr. Hardyman and Father\nPapineau, concerning each child, and, along with Agent Lewis\nand Inspector McGeehan, visiting some of the homes, in an\neffort to secure additional information. I learned that 7\nof the children were clearly eligible for a Catholic school;\nthat 8 or 10 others might be considered importations to the\nreserve and in the case of one or two additional, the religious affiliation was doubtful.\n\n\"Of the 10 that appear as if they might be import-\nations for the purpose of bolstering the claim for a separate school, 2 are living with their grandmother, a resident of the reserve, the parents being separated; 2 are living with an aunt, as their own home near Whitefish Falls was distant from the Indian school; 2, along with their mother, originally from Grassay Bay, are staying with a resident of the reserve; and 2 are living with an aunt who is looking after them, there being no school near their own home at South Bay. I am quite satisfied that Father Papineau is assisting with the board for these children.\n\n\"The fact remains that there are nearly 20 Roman Catholic children living on the Shagwandah Reserve and I take it that it is the Department's duty to educate them. In addition, there are 9 younger children who will be eligible from year to year.\"\n\nNo further protests were received about this school until December, 1883, when Mr. Agent Lewis forwarded a petition, signed by certain Indians, requesting that the Shagwandah R. C. School be closed in order to curtail school expenditure. In forwarding this document, the Agent stated that it had not been passed by the Shagwandah Band in Council but had been circulated through the reserve. He was advised, in reply, that the Department was not prepared to close the school.\n\nThe latest census of the Shagwandah Reserve shows a population of 106, of whom 65 are Anglicans and 40 Roman Catholics. There are 9 children under 7 years of age and 25 children from 7 to 16 years.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, May 21, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your 1060-5 of the 4th instant, I beg to say that the resignation of Mrs. Priscilla M. Murray as teacher of the Shagwandah R.C. Indian Day School is accepted. Her resignation will take effect from the end of the current academic year, viz.: June 30th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenitowening, Ont.\nMay 17th\n\nI, the undersigned, certify that I have been acquainted with Miss Eugenia La Pointe, when she was resident in Little Current, and that she was always known as a young girl animated by a noble ambition and remarkable energy, and by a great love of work and study.\n\nTherefore I recommend her without hesitation for the R.C. Shugan school, which school requires an energy more than ordinary.\n\nRev. L. Porcheron s.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 7, 1934\n\nMiss Murray, a teacher in the Roman Catholic School at Sheguiandah, has tendered her resignation to the department.\n\nThe Minister has instructed me to inform you that Miss Eugenia C. Lapointe, represented as a fully qualified teacher, is available for the vacancy. I understand you already have Miss Lapointe's address, namely: 623 Wellington St. East, Sault Ste. Marie, and that she will be satisfactory to the Missionary in charge of the School.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nThere are no attendance problems except for the fact that three pupils formerly attending this school, when checked for being dirty, were taken away and sent to the other school at Sheguiandah.\n\nThese pupils are said to have expressed their intention of returning to this school when Mrs. Murray leaves.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMarch 23, 1935.\n\nDR. MCGILL:\n\nThe Minister has received somewhat lengthy correspondence with regard to the Indian School situation at Sheguianah, Ontario\u2014another protest being lodged against the alleged invasion of a Reserve by the Roman Catholic Church authorities.\n\nIf you will refer to your file 19-14-1 you will find a memorandum of May 19, 1934, dealing rather fully with the subject. Will you please advise the Minister if there has been any change in the situation since that memorandum was prepared.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nMay 27, 1935.\n\nMemo:\n\nReferring to communication which you received from the Right Honourable the Prime Minister, with regard to the Indian school situation at Sheguianidah, Ont., I would say that, from time to time, since the establishment of the day school for the Catholic Indian children, protests, along practically the same lines as are apparently contained in the communication to the Prime Minister, have been made against continuing this school. These protests have been instigated, for the most part, by the Missionary of the Anglican Church. The Catholic day school was first opened in September, 1929, and has been in continuous operation since that time. At present, there is an enrolment of 10 pupils, with an average attendance of 8.\n\nWhen the Sheguianidah reserve was established, it was for the Protestant Indians of that time. Catholic families have since settled on the reserve and a separate school was established. The Church of England Missionary has, from time to time, indicated it was his understanding that Catholic families should not be allowed to settle on this reserve, and he has somewhat bitterly opposed the establishment of a separate school. A departmental official, who investigated the matter in 1934, informed the Missionary that whereas the reserve may have been established for Protestant Indians 50 years ago, the Department could not guarantee that the Indians living there would remain Protestant, and it would be impossible to prohibit Catholic Indians from moving to Sheguianidah, where they would have an opportunity of bettering themselves from an economic standpoint.\n\nThe children of the Catholic Indians who moved to the reserve are considered by the Anglican Church authorities as importations to the reserve, in order that there will be sufficient children to carry on a Catholic school. Of the children that appear as if they might be importations for the purpose of bolstering the claim for a separate school, two are living with their grandmother, a resident of the reserve, the parents being separated; two are living with an aunt as their own home near Whitefish Falls was distant from an Indian school; two, along with their mother, originally from Grass Bay, are staying with a resident of the reserve; and two are living with an aunt, who is looking after them, there being no school near their own home at South Bay.\n\nParagraph 3, Section 100, of the Indian Act, sets forth that the Protestant or Catholic minority of any Band may, with the approval of, and under regulations made by the Governor in Council, have a separate school established on the reserve.\n\nThe complaints that are received from time to time against the conduct of a school for the Catholic children arise through local jealousy and, in the past, have been instigated by the missionaries of the Anglican Church.\nMemorandum:\n\nSchools\n\nSheguindah Indian Day Schools\nR.C. and C.of E. - Manitowaning Agency.\n\nThe R.C. school is conducted in the church by Miss Lapointe. There are six pupils on the roll with an average monthly attendance of five.\n\nAbout 300 yards distant is the C. of E. school in charge of Miss Ballantine with a roll of five pupils, average monthly attendance four.\n\nThe upkeep of two schools for such a small number of pupils seems foolish and unnecessary. One combined school in charge of either denomination would meet the needs of this community very satisfactorily.\n\nInspector.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 28, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reporting to the Honourable The Minister with reference to his recent visit to your agency, Dr. H. W. McGill, Director of Indian Affairs, wrote, in part, as follows:\n\n\"On our way to Manitowaning, we called at the Sheguianah Reserve and visited the two schools - one under Roman Catholic auspices, being held in the church building. The teacher is Miss Lapointe and her total enrolment consists of six pupils. The Protestant School, under Miss Ballantyne, has an enrolment of five. Both these teachers seem to be capable and further comment seems to be unnecessary upon the fact that we maintain two schools and pay two teachers' salaries for a total enrolment of eleven pupils.\"\n\nIn view of the many demands for new Indian schools in various parts of the Dominion and the further fact that our funds are limited, it is exceedingly difficult to justify the operation of two schools at Sheguianah for such a small number of pupils.\n\nPlease let me know, at once, if there is any prospect of the attendance at either or both of these schools materially increasing during the academic year 1937-38. In addition, you should let me have as complete information as possible regarding the children attending both these schools at the present time and indicate if it would be feasible to have them attend a neighbouring White school to which a tuition grant could be paid.\n\nYou should, also, immediately notify both teachers that it is quite probable that both these schools will be closed at the end of June, 1937, and, consequently, if they are able to secure another position, they should do so. For your personal information, I may say that a final decision regarding the closing of these schools will not be made until your reply is received but, in order to protect the Department, the notice requested above should be given to both teachers. I will expect to hear from you in the very near future in connection with the situation at Sheguianah.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of Departmental Letter No.19-14-I of the 28th ultimo in regard to the report to the Honourable The Minister with reference to the two Indian Day Schools on Sheguinandah Reserve by Dr. H. W. McGill, Director of Indian Affairs, upon his return to Ottawa after a recent visit to this agency.\n\nWith regard to this matter I have the honour to report that the school under Roman Catholic auspices, of which Miss A. C. Lapointe is teacher, had an enrolment of six pupils until this month, now there are eight as two children of Point Grondine Band are in attendance at the present time. There does not seem to be any prospect of an increase in the attendance at this school during the academic year 1937-38; in fact it would appear that the attendance would show a decrease if this school should continue next year. My reason for being lead to believe of this fact is, as follows:\n\nWilliam Gaikezhevongai aged fifteen, in grade 7, attendance has been unsatisfactory for some time during the past. As he is now able to work I believe that he will not continue after the close of the present term.\n\nLawrence Misinishkotwe, in grade 7, will attain the age of sixteen this coming fall.\n\nMadeline, Paul and Rose Nahwaikezhik, aged seven, nine and ten respectively, children of Simon Nahwaikezhik, have not a permanent home at Sheguinandah. At present these children and their parents reside with their aged grand-father. It is a question whether or not, this family will remain at Sheguinandah for any length of time. The parents take little interest in the school and will send the children when forced to do so only.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nThere is an increase in the enrolment for this month, two orphan children, Margaret and Philip Mazonoquet, aged ten and seven years, of Point Grondine Band. They are being cared for by their grandparent, William Waindubence, of Sheguianah Band. Waindubence is a trapper, leaves the Reserve during the winter months and is obliged to take the children with him, as they have not any other home, and does not return until late in the spring so these children can only attend this school for a few months during the summer.\n\nHenry Maisinishakotwe aged IO, in grade 3, will no doubt attend school for the full academic year next, if the school is in operation.\n\nThe Anglican School, under Miss Ballantyne as teacher, has an enrolment of five pupils. The prospect is that if the school re-opens after the summer holidays there will be an enrolment of not more than four pupils. Bridget Gaikenzheyongai is over school age and will not return after the end of this school term.\n\nI had an interview with Mr. Thos. Lewis, chairman of the board of a neighbouring white school in Sheguianah Township situated at a distance of about one mile away from Sheguianah Reserve in regard to the prospect to have a number of Indian children attend the white school for the academic year of 1937-38 providing a tuition grant would be paid. Mr. Lewis appears to be in favour of the proposition but would not advise me definitely until after a meeting of the school board to be held in the near future.\n\nThe chief was interviewed also, regarding the situation at Sheguianah. He advised me that on account of such a small number of pupils, and the heavy expense in conducting two schools, it would be well to close both schools, and arrange to have the children attend the neighbouring white school for the next school year, at least, or such time as there would be sufficient children of school age to warrant the re-opening of one school on the Reserve.\n\nBoth teachers have been informed that it is quite probable that both these school will be closed at the end of the current school quarter, and if they able to secure another position, they should do so, and if satisfactory arrangement can be made to have the children attend the white school I would recommend that both Indian Day Schools at Sheguianah be closed at the end to this month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 10th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the Sheguianah R.C. and Sheguianah C.E. Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn view of the information now before us, it has been decided to close both of these schools on June 30th, 1937 and you should so inform the teachers. Please let me know whether or not the teachers were successful in securing other schools. If not, the Department will endeavour to place them in Indian day schools but, at the present time, we are not in a position to definitely assure you that this can be done.\n\nWhen you hear further from the Chairman of the neighbouring White school in Sheguianah Township, you should advise me, stating whether or not they are prepared to accept Indian children and the rate which they would charge for their tuition.\n\nAny children for whom educational provision cannot be made in this way will have to be placed in one or other of the residential schools. For those going to residential school, early application should be made in order that accommodation may be obtained for them.\n\nAny books or school supplies on hand may be distributed among the other day schools in your agency or stored in a safe place until required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR.J.

Co., and I should like, if at all possible, to get the position.\n\nI have a Second Class Permanent certificate, and also an elementary certificate in Agriculture. I am the year...\nexperience in teaching, seven of which have been in Cartier.\n\nI have always had good reports from my inspectors.\n\nMr. Shaw, Chief Inspector, has seen my work on several occasions.\n\nMr. J.M.

Indian Day Schools, and to let The Department know whether or not the teachers were teachers were successful in securing other schools; I have the honour to report that Miss Ballantyne, teacher of the Sheguiandah A. C. School has advised me that she has secured a position as teacher in a White school, and Miss EsPointe who taught in the Sheguiandah R. C. School has been married recently.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nWith reference to Departmental Letter No.19-14-I of the 10th of June last and previous correspondence in regard to the closing of the Sheguianah R.C. and the Sheguianah C.E. Indian Day School, I have the honour to report that the Indians at Sheguianah have been advised of the Department's decision in this matter.\n\nThe matter of having the Indian children attend the neighbouring White school in Sheguianah Township has been taken up with the School Board and at their meeting during the last week in June they gave this matter due consideration, but since this meeting they have found so many of the ratepayers opposed to Indian children attending the White school, and as it is there is a large enrollment of White pupils, they finally decided that they would not accept any Indian children and advised me by letter of the 15th instant accordingly.\n\nAs the Board of the White school have come to a decision that they will not accept Indian children, and there are not sufficient pupils of school age at Sheguianah to warrant the Department to continue two day schools, I would recommend that both schools remain closed, as advised by letter of June 10th, and all children of school age be placed in residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\nCANADA\n\nMindemoya, Ont., July 26, 1937.\n\nW.

W. McGill, Director of Indian Affairs, visited this school during the early part of May, and, in reporting to the Honourable the Minister, stated:\n\n\"On our way to Manitouining, we called at the Shagwandah Reserve and visited the two schools - one under Roman Catholic auspices, being held in the church building. The teacher is Miss Lapointe and her total enrolment consists of six pupils. The Protestant School, under Miss Ballantyne, has an enrolment of five. Both these teachers seem to be capable and further enrolment seems to be unnecessary upon the fact that we maintain two schools and pay two teachers' salaries for a total enrolment of eleven pupils.\"\n\nThe Department subsequently communicated with Indian Agent Lewis, who supplied the following information in connection with the Shagwandah Church of England and Roman Catholic Schools:\n\n\"The Anglican School, under Miss Ballantyne as teacher, has an enrolment of five pupils. The prospect\n\nThomas Farquhar, Esq., M.P.,\nMindemoya,\nOntario,\n\nAug. 5/37\"\nprospect is that if the school re-opens after the summer holidays there will be an enrolment of not more than four pupils. Bridget Gaikeshayengai is over school age and will not return after the end of this school term.\"\n\n\"With regard to the school operated under Roman Catholic auspices, of which Miss A. C. Lapointe is teacher, this school had an enrolment of six pupils until this month. Now there are eight, as two children of Point Grondine Band are in attendance at the present time. There does not seem to be any prospect whatever of an increase in the attendance at this school during the academic year 1937-38. In fact, it would appear that the attendance would show a decrease if this school should continue in operation. My reason for believing this is as follows:\n\n\"William Gaikeshayengai, aged fifteen, in Grade 7 - attendance has been unsatisfactory for some time during the past.

The parents take little interest in the school and will send the children when forced to do so only.\"\n\nAfter giving this matter careful consideration, it was decided to close both the Shagwianish Church of England and Roman Catholic Indian Day Schools on June 30th, 1937,\nowing to the fact that the small attendance at both schools did not justify the expenditure. If it is found impossible to obtain accommodation for these Indian pupils in adjoining White schools, they will be placed in residential schools.\n\nIn view of these facts and in view of the fact that we have requests from districts in which there are large groups of Indian children for whom no educational facilities have been provided by the Department, I think you will agree with me that the Department was justified in closing both these schools, and I feel confident that the Priest in charge of the Mission will be satisfied with this explanation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, July 13, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER.\n\nIn view of the fact that you are running short of coding numbers for the different day schools in this Branch, please be advised that it will be in order to close the following schools and use their respective numbers for new schools that we created from time to time:\n\nNOVA SCOTIA.\nBear River 251\n\nNEW BRUNSWICK.\nIndian Island 279\n\nQUEBEC.\nCaughnawaga Bush 303\nWolf Lake 336\nSt. Francis Prot. 337\n\nONTARIO.\nBatchewana 379\nHenvey Inlet 397\nMattawa 406\nMichipicoten Harbour 407\nShoguniandah Prot. 429\n\" R.C. 430\nSheshegwaning C.E. 431\nStoney Point 437\n\nMANITOBA.\nSandy Bay 548\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.\nFort Rupert 809\nMcDame 830\nOld Fort Babine 862\n\n(Sgd) Bernard F.

He states that they will require dry wood for the kitchen and the classroom and also requests that two blackboards be supplied.\n\nRelative to the wood, you should arrange, as soon as possible, for the purchase and delivery of the quantity considered by you to be sufficient for the use of the teacher's residence and the school. Please see that a good grade of dry wood is supplied and at the lowest possible price. As you will be aware of the requirements, the Department will leave the quantity to be supplied in your hands. After the wood has been delivered to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nRelative to the two blackboards, I have to request that you will furnish the Department with the dimensions required, stating the length and width. For your information, I may say that blackboard material is manufactured in widths of 3, 3\u00bd and 4 ft. Please state also whether moulding and chalk trough would be required. When we have this information, an order will be placed with the Government Stationery Office here to supply the blackboard material required.

C. Indian Day School.\n\nRelative to the blackboard, I have to say that an order is being forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to ship, addressed to Miss Hare, Little Current, the blackboard material required. You should get in touch with the express agent at Little Current and have him notify either yourself or the teacher when this material arrives, and arrangements should then be made to have it taken to the school and installed in the classroom. It will probably take three weeks before this material arrives.\n\nRegarding the two toilets, I have to request that you will furnish particulars as to the type of toilet you would recommend be built, giving an estimate of the cost of the material and labour. When we have this information, consideration will then be given to having the work carried out.\n\nRelative to the teacher's desk, kitchen table and cooking utensils, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase of these supplies. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred, and only a reasonable quantity of cooking utensils should be obtained. If a teacher's chair is also required, you may purchase same. You will, no doubt, be able to obtain all these furnishings locally, at a reasonable price, and you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. The purchase of this equipment should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Father Papineau, Missionary to the Roman Catholic Indians in that section.\n\nMy information is that a substantial number of the Indians on that reserve are Roman Catholics. Your Department no doubt has all of the information.\n\nFather Papineau is pressing for a decision and is prepared to go ahead himself and build the school this year providing the Department would place a vote in the estimate next year to cover the cost.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you could advise me just what the situation is. I am anxious to do everything I can to assist these people.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGBN/G\nOttawa, Aug 16, 1920.\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nAugust 20, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Nicholson:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the Sheguianah R. C. Indian Day School. A year ago this activity for the Roman Catholic children of the reserve was commenced classes being held in the church. It was the intention to provide a suitable building if the school proved successful. In November, when the Estimates for the current fiscal year were prepared, there were really no representations that it would be timely this year to consider the work permanent and to incur capital expenditure. In the late winter, when it was too late to secure funds, except for emergencies, the Reverend Father Papineau, S. J., commenced to press for a building. When he was satisfied that the Department had no funds for the purpose this year, he offered to be responsible for the building activity, provided the Department would reimburse him next year. This, of course, was not proceeding in the regular manner, and I felt that there would be no serious loss to the work if the new building was not ready until 1931.\n\nThis is still my opinion, and, as the school appears to be worth while, I propose to ask Parliament for funds at the next regular session.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

We would finance the construction under your immediate supervision and follow absolutely all your specifications.\n\n2. We will forward vouchers for every expenditure.\n\n3. The Department would refund the money whenever convenient, in 3 or 4 years; and if the school is not a real success, we dispense the School's branch from remitting on a single cent.\n\n4. We make this supplication because the White People, owners of the church in which the classes are taught, object to our using their building any further.\n\n5. The construction would be done more economically, by day work directed by a competent foreman, as was done for the Birch Island school.\n\n6. Chief William Widibins has donated an excellent lot in the most central place.\n\n7. To make the cellar warmer in Winter and cooler in Summer we would ask for a stone foundation instead of cement.\n\n8. To save the expense of a wood shed, we would ask to make the cellar full size of the building for storing fuel, wood.\n\n9. To save per petual expensive outside painting, we would ask to use guaranteed Stuco put on by an expert.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPapineau\nOTTAWA, July 13th, 1931.\n\nHonorable T. G. Murphy,\nMinister of the Interior & Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nHonorable and Dear Mr. Murphy:\n\nFurther to discussion I had with you last week regarding Indian Day School at Sheguiandah,\n\nThe situation is as I pointed out; namely, that the Roman Catholic day school is being carried on in the church just outside of the reserve. The church is not large, is unsuitable for school purposes, as I am confident your inspectors will advise you, and the \"nite population in the district who have built and own the church and who worship there regularly feel that it should not be used for that purpose. They are also of opinion to support their view which I need not discuss here. The Missionary Priest in charge at Sheguiandah and the Bishop of the diocese, His Lordship Bishop Scollard, each recognize the difficulties that your Department is faced with in meeting the demands made upon it under present conditions, and with that in mind they are prepared to build the school with their own funds or credit, providing your department will give them a letter to the effect that the money would be granted to them just as soon as you were in a position to make grants for purposes of that character. They will follow strictly plans and specifications that the Department may make and keep strictly within the limits of whatever expenditure the Department sets and I would urge that their proposal in this regard be accepted, and that they be authorised to go ahead this year. It will assist in a small way in the relief of unemployment. The school can be built much more economically than under ordinary conditions. An unsatisfactory condition will be rectified and the interests of the Department adequately protected.\n\nWill you kindly give this your favorable consideration?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. B. Nicholson,\nM.P., for Algoma East.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\nOTTAWA, July 13th, 1931.\n\nDr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent-General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of letter I have this morning written the Minister regarding school at Sheguiandah.\n\nI have taken the liberty of discussing the whole matter with Mr. Perrier in order to get his viewpoint and then discussed it personally with the Minister so that I could, if possible, get the picture in his mind, and this letter is the result. I intend to call and see you in connection with the matter at your convenience and perhaps before you will have received this letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG. B. Nicholson,\nM.P. for Algoma East.\nJuly 18, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE THOMAS G. MURPHY\n\nWith reference to the proposal of the Church authorities that they build, at the Shiguandah Roman Catholic Indian Day School, in Mr. Nicholas's agency, and be reimbursed from a future Vote, I may say the chief advantage in this scheme would be the release of the church, which is now being used for school purposes. The church in question is not on the reserve and its parish includes both Indians and whites. As far as the classroom exercises are concerned, they are being conducted quite satisfactorily in the church. If construction is not proceeded with this year, the Reverend Father Papineau will again have to persuade the mixed parish to allow their church to be used for Indian school purposes. I shall be glad to learn your decision, so that we can reply to the local missionary. The building will cost about $6,000.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nJuly 18, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE THOMAS G.

They maintain that they have found out that the upkeep of two classrooms for the few pupils on Sheguianah Reserve is too expensive, and would not under any consideration vote any of their Band Funds towards erecting any new school buildings.\n\nThe original motion which they passed in Council pertaining to this matter is enclosed herewith, which motion is signed by eight members of the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nI might say also, that it appears to be the general feeling among the Indians to have the classroom conducted in the Roman Catholic Church during the last three years past closed, and all the children attend the Anglican School again, which they consider a public school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, Ont.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nA.

However, Mr. Indian Agent Lewis reports that he met the Indians of the Sheguianidah Band in Council on the 5th ultimo and discussed the matter with them, as instructed by the Department.

In that year the Department consented to pay a salary of $200.00 for a qualified teacher on condition that an average attendance of 8 pupils could be maintained. Apparently they were unable to obtain a teacher for that salary and the school was not opened. In '99 Father Artus, who was then Superintendent of Missions, again applied for a school, when he was told that there was no money available and that the funds of the Band could not bear a charge for a teacher's salary.\n\nIf the Department agrees to the request of the Indians being granted, funds will have to be provided in the estimates for a teacher's salary.\n\nThere is an old church building on the Island which with an expenditure of $125.00, could be adapted for school purposes and the Indians are willing to have this amount taken from the capital funds of their Band.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 19th November, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 16th instant enclosing resolution of the Council of the Cockburn Island Band in regard to the establishment of a school on their reserve; and in reply I beg to say that this matter will receive consideration and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B.

The census return shows only some 15 or 16 children of school age on the Island and it is not considered that the probable average attendance would justify the expense of maintaining a school. As these Indians are all Roman Catholics there is no reason why the children should not be sent to the Wikwemikong Industrial school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRobert Thorburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that I have visited the Six Nations Reserve at Cockburn Island and was informed by the Chief Joseph Wabgawesh that they had twenty-five children on the reserve that should be going to school but have no school to send them to save of the parents and their children to other places to have them educated but others cannot do that. They have an old church that could be adapted without a great deal of expense so that it could be used for a school and they are very anxious to have their children educated and to have a school of their own on their reserve so that they could have their children at home. It seems to me to think they have that many children and no school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nH. W.

There are twenty-five children of school age. Some of the children of this band are educated at the Wikwemikong Industrial School, but it would appear that there are a number who are not receiving any education. It is proposed to use an old church building there temporarily for a school-house, if the Department will provide the salary for a teacher and bear the other expenses in connection with the management of the school.\n\nI should be glad to have Your Lordship's opinion on this matter and I may say that, if the use of this building can be obtained, the Department is prepared to try the experiment, provided the services of a teacher can be secured.

His Lordship Bishop Scollard has been written to for the use of the building. The Department would also like to know what probability there would be of having a sufficient average attendance to justify the establishment of a school, whether a suitable teacher could be found and what accommodation there would be for one.

The building is an old log building and it would need to be shingled on the walls and sides and a new roof on and a new floor and the inside lined with lumber. The building is 17 feet by 24 feet inside and would make a good school.\n\nI think the attendance would justify the establishment of a school on the Reserve. As for the accommodation of the teacher, it would be necessary to build a kitchen and living rooms for the teacher which could be built on to the school, as all the Indians want the teacher to live at the school move off them would like to take a teacher to board and I think it would be better for the teacher to board her self.\n\nI have had a builder make an estimate of the cost of the whole thing and I think it will take about four hundred and twenty five dollars to repair the old building and build the new piece on to it for the teacher.\n\nAs for the ownership of the building the Band informs me that the Bishop has nothing to do with the building as they built the Church with their own money.\nand that they own the building themselves\nand would just as soon have the old\nchurch rebuilt as to build a new building.\nThe members of the Band could do\nall the work themselves.\n\nI have not had any reply from the\nBishop as to the teacher but I am sure they\ncould get a teacher for the school.\n\nIf the Department wish to repair the old building\nit could all be finished up before the bad weather\ncomes.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.

He states that it could be and that an expenditure of $425.00 would make the necessary repairs and provide a kitchen and living rooms for the teacher. The Indians passed a resolution authorizing the expenditure of the necessary funds to provide a school building and Mr. Baxter says that they are quite competent to do the work.\n\nI would suggest that Mr. Baxter be authorized to have the work done and that the Roman Catholic church authorities be asked to nominate a teacher. Mr. Baxter also says that the Indians claim the church to be their own property. If Bishop Scollard is not prepared to recommend a teacher either Father Dugas or Father Richard might know of one.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, September 30, 1914.\nOttawa October 2nd, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the cost of repairing the old church on the Cockburn Island Reserve so that it could be used for a school.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department has decided to consider favourably the request of the Cockburn Island Indians for the establishment of a school on their reserve and you are hereby authorized to expend the sum of $425.00 in making the necessary repairs and alterations to the old church so that it may be suitable for a school and teacher's residence. You should supervise the work of repairs and submit certified accounts, in duplicate to the Department for the above expenditure.\n\nKindly communicate at once with the Catholic Church authorities in regard to securing a teacher for this school in order that the school may be opened as soon as the repairs are finished.

Since New Year's time, I have been endeavoring to secure the help of another teacher. At last, I have had lately, a few applications. I have referred the various applicants to your Department. The boat will be going to Cockburn Island from May 3rd on... As the Indians are very anxious to have a teacher, now that the roads are good, may I beg your Department to hasten making a choice.\namong the applicants, and kindly warn me so that I might introduce the new teacher to our Indians. I would like very much to have our Rockburn Island pupils join in the Manitoulin School Fairs next Fall; and as it is getting late, we should start our little gardens as soon as possible.\n\nAllow me to add, in passing, that I am doing my utmost to second your effort towards splendid plan for school gardens on Manitoulin Reserve.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nEugene A. Papineau\n\nLittle Current\nManitoulin Island\n\n[Signature]\nSainte Marie, Ontario,\nApril 27, 1910\n\nSecretary of Department of Indians Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to an advertisement placed in one of our local papers by Father Richards, for a teacher for the Indians of Cockburn Island, I am now submitting to you my application for the position under his recommendation. I have eight years experience as a teacher, but would be willing to accept position at the rate of $800 a term on trial. However, if my services are acceptable to the department and the work proves congenial I would finish the term for a wage a little in advance of my former wage.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMiss Elizabeth McKeeney\n164 Central Park Ave.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been advised by Fr. Richeau & Mr. Mc. Cabb to write you concerning the vacancy in the Indian School at Meldrum Bay, Cockburn Island.

There are two in particular Miss Elizabeth Mc Larney and Miss Malton. They have both had experience in teaching. Miss Mc Larney has had 7 or 8 years, I had her picked out for the Goulais Bay School if Annie O'Conner was not coming back.\n\nI asked these two to write to the Department, if I might offer a word as to which one to accept I would say that Miss Mc Larney would be my choice.\n\nI did not want to interfere in any way in this School as it is not in my jurisdiction but Father Richards asked me to assist him.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.

McLean, Esquire,\nSecretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAbout the date of April 27th I mailed an application to the Secretary of Indian Affairs for the position of teacher in the Cockburn Island school, but since that time I have learned that there is a vacancy in the Mississauga school. I would much prefer it if you should see fit to offer me the position there.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n(Miss) Elizabeth McCarney,\n164 Central Park Ave.\nOttawa, April 30, 1915.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, stating that you have been advised by Father Richard that there is a vacancy at Mississauga and also one at Cockburn Island for a teacher and making application for either position, Mississauga preferred.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that there is no vacancy at either of these schools at present, but should one occur your application will be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nSgd.

Father Papineau of Little Current writes the Department that the Cockburn Island School has been without a teacher since the New Year and he states that he is doing his best to secure another teacher. Evidently he has been in communication with Rev. Father Richard of Sault Ste. Marie, as three applications have been received from there for the position. They all give Father Richard as a reference. Miss Henderson, one of the applicants, has no special qualifications and has had no experience in teaching. Miss McLarney has had eight year's experience and Miss Mallen has had four year's experience and says she can furnish excellent testimonials and qualifications.\n\nMr. Agent McNabb writes the Department stating that Father Richard asked him to assist him in procuring a teacher for this school and has sent several young ladies to him. He refers to Miss McLarney and Miss Mallen, who are\nare both experienced, and says that if he had the choice between the two he would select Miss McLarney. She writes a well expressed letter and I would suggest that she be given a trial, the initial salary to be $400.00 per annum.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Bannerman\nOttawa, May 11, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo in reference to securing a teacher for the Cockburn Island school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to appoint Miss McLarney as teacher of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Father Papineau: \"Against the will of majority of Indians chief Joseph Wogah has refused to accept teacher Rachael Mallan sent by Agent Baxter I have resisted and introduced the teacher in the school all OK letter will follow\".\n\nIn connection with school matters at Cockburn Island the Department requires an explanation as to why you failed to report that Miss Margaret Belleau, who was appointed teacher of this school, had not re-opened it after the Christmas holidays. The first intimation the Department had that the school was closed was in a letter dated the 28th ultimo from Father Papineau of Little Current, who reported that Miss Belleau had only taught the school for two weeks and asked for the appointment of another teacher. Several applications were received and the Department accepted the services of Miss McLarney of Sault Ste. Marie and you were so informed in official letter of the 11th instant.\n\nIt would appear from Father Papineau's night letter.\n\nP. W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nlettergram that you had sent Miss Mallen to take charge of this school without consulting the Department and from your message above quoted that the Indians refused to allow a Roman Catholic teacher to take charge of their school. Father Papineau stated that he placed Miss Mallen in charge and that everything was satisfactory.\n\nYou should explain why you took upon yourself to appoint a teacher without instructions and placed the Department in the awkward position of having unwittingly engaged another teacher for this school.\n\nWith regard to the change of religion of the majority of the Cockburn Island Indians, the Department would like to know when this change took place. All the Indians of this band are shown by the last census to be Roman Catholics.\n\nBefore the Department could consent to placing a Protestant teacher in charge of this school it will have to be shown that a majority of the members of the band having children of school age are Protestants and you will be good enough to at once proceed to Cockburn Island and make a careful investigation into this alleged change of religion. The heads of families who have renounced the Roman Catholic faith should be required to sign a declaration to that effect and the number of girls and boys of school age belonging to these families should be given opposite their names. On receipt of this information the Department will be in a position to decide as to the religious denomination to which the teacher of the school should belong. The last census return shows that there were only sixteen children of school age in the band and for this reason the Department could not assume the cost of carrying on two schools there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nCoxburn Island Ontario\nFeb 24th/15\n\nDear Father:\n\"We the Indians of your church request the appointment of John Davis as teacher for our school.\" We have known him to be a friend to us for many years. We further know him to have many close relations connected with our church.\n\"We are desperate over the present situation.\"\n\"And we have grave cause to fear, that we might at any moment relinquish our lands, and embrace the Church of England.\n\nFaithfully Yours\nJoseph W. Williams\nChief\n\nRev J. R. Richards\nMilton\nOntario.\n\nN.B. This letter was written by John Davis himself and with the authorization of the three signatories only.\nCockburn Island Reserve, May 14th, 1915\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nBy this time, your office will be flooded with literature from the Cockburn Island Reserve\u2014may I take, in the name of your evident zeal for the Indians' welfare, a few moments of your time to explain the cause of the quarrel\u2014\n\nAs soon as the Cockburn Island Reserve school was started, a certain hunchback named John Avis (who a few years ago spent six months in the Gore Bay Jail, for bribery and half killing his mother) began to agitate to get the position of teacher in that new school\u2014upon being told that as he was a Protestant, he could not teach those Catholic Indians, he determined to have those Catholic Indians turn Protestant so that he might become their teacher\u2014\n\nIt is perfectly well known to you that the little Catholic Band of Cockburn Island has lived in great peace since twenty years\nJohn Avis started a campaign of slander against the Catholic Church and schools. Often went on the Cockburn Reserve, conversed, coaxed the Indians to become Protestant, and soon gained to his cause: Jonas Akibinossie and Edward Segars and chief Joseph Wagot. Jonas Akibinossie has lived in public illegal concubinage during the last fifteen years with two different women, having rejected his own lawful wife, and never come to church. Ed. Segar is not a concubine but never goes to church\u2014With these two scandalous helpers, John Avis made strenuous efforts to create a division in the band. I enclose a letter which he wrote to Father Richards, last February, and by which you will judge this disturbing jail bird.\n\nAt last he succeeded in calling on the Reserve, two Anglican Ministers. They went there Sunday May 9th. By a thousand alluring promises they deceived those quiet ignorant Indians; they created an Anglican clan\u2014they told them that if they turned Anglicans they would become rich and happy, they would receive lots of clothing and food and that their old people would be fed gratis\u2014etc etc\u2014They made a petition.\nOn Monday May 10th P.M. I arrived there in company of Mr. Baxter and Dr. Baker. I discovered the division at once upon hearing incognito some of the quarrels between Catholics and Protestants.\n\nThe chief and his two helpers Jonas Akabinose & Ed Logan were swearing that they would never allow a Catholic teacher to come on the Reserve. As this Rachel Malton was to arrive that same evening I told Mr. Baxter that he should impose his authority, reduce the agitators to silence and give me the keys of the school. He was quite frightened by the Indians and did not dare ask the keys from the chief. He left me there in charge and told me to introduce the teacher in the school. The next day the chief refused to open the school and to give the keys to the teacher. I called Mr. Baxter on the phone to warn him. He sent by constable Stewart, a summons to chief Joe Wapogah, ordering him to give the keys and authorized me to open the school in spite of the chief in case of refusal. Constable Stewart drove to the Reserve and read the summons to the chief who encouraged and prompted by the two agitators, bluntly...\nrefused to give the keys. I then boldly and sternly told the chief that I was going to open the school with my own keys and this I did in the presence of all the Indians, and I introduced the teacher on the school Tuesday May 11th at 5 o'clock.\n\nThe Indians were quite afraid of me and I imposed myself. At that time, ten families were sorry for their mistake and had come back to their old catholic church. On Wednesday morning the ten catholic families sent their fifteen children to school and declared themselves delighted with the teacher \u2014 on Wednesday P.M. John Lewis came on the Reserve, held a consultation with the three agitators, and came with them near the school to intimidate the teacher. I chased them all from around the school. As a result of the visit of John Lewis, the three agitators declared about the village that as soon as I would be gone, they would throw stones at the windows and chase the teacher away. I wrote all these details to Mr. Baxter, and requested him, in his honor, to protect that teacher.\nhired and sent there on his authorization\u2014\n\n\"The three agitators repeated all the time that before leaving, Monday May 10th Mr. Baxter would have told them privately those extremely grievous words 'The school is yours you may do with it what you like'.\"\n\nIt is upon these words that they based their refusal to give the keys.\n\nConsidering that one of the wisest and most clever measures passed by your Department, is the most absolute control of all Indian schools by your Department without the least interfering of any chief or any Reserve, these words if they have been said would constitute a disastrous treason of the Department's authority over the Indians, and place a still worst sentiment in the hearts of the Indians\u2014You may well imagine the awful fright of Miss Allen when I leave. The ten catholic families have promised me they would guard the letters\u2014Yours Truly E. Baxter.\"\nIndian Village, Cockburn Island, May 15th\n\nThe Secretary\nImmediate\nSchools Department of Indian Affairs\n488-63 Ottawa\n\nWe, Indians of the Cockburn Island Reserve whose names appear, in very official signatures, on the accompanying sheet beg to declare to you that we have been deceived about a certain petition which may be in your hands, at this time.\n\nA certain churchman, agitator from the white village, John Avis, coaxed the three worst and most careless members of our Church, to ask for Anglican Ministers on our Reserve. These ministers came last Sunday and deceiving us by all kinds of alluring promises, practically stole our signature on a petition asking you for an Anglican teacher. We had no teacher then and were willing to have any one. But now we have Miss Rachel Walker whom Mr. Baxter sent us, and we are pleased with her, and we will\nnever consent to give away our catholic religion in which we were brought up by our catholic parents.\n\nEd Kabena\nC.

In answer, I beg most humbly for your indulgence, because I have perhaps contributed to embarrass you \u2014 On May 7th, Mr. Baxter, Agent of the Cockburn Reserve, told me that the question of a teacher was causing great disturbance on that last Reserve and that a teacher should be sent to Cockburn without the least delay. I told him since a week I had referred the matter to you for a choice between four candidates, but that I had no answer. Thinking that you might be exceptionally busy at this present time, he (Mr. Baxter) presumed your permission, and told me to send at once,\none of the four applicants, to the Rockburn Reserve school, because he feared that a delay might cause bloodshed between the two groups of Indians, quarrelling about an Anglican or a Catholic teacher. \u2014 Judging by the length of teaching experience and more local disposition, with the recommendation of Rev. Father Richard who knew all applicants, we sent word, on Friday, to Miss Rachel Maller to take charge of the Rockburn Reserve school. \u2014 I made a special trip to Rockburn Island, to introduce her. She came on Monday 10th. After extreme difficulty, which I narrate in the accompanying memoir, I introduced Miss Rachel Maller in the school, Tuesday P.M. I remained with her Wednesday and Thursday to make her acquainted with her fifteen pupils, and to interpret for her to those pupils of whom many do not understand a word of English \u2014 Your appointment of Miss McLean, place Mr. Baxter & myself in great embarrassment and I feel awfully sorry to have unintentionally countenanced your views. Of course\nMr. Baxter has the official responsibility of the measure taken, but you are always so good to us in all school affairs, that I regret immensely this annoying misunderstanding. Have you, by this time, cancelled Miss McLeary's engagement? If useful I am most willing to humiliate myself and apologize to the hurted parties.\n\nRe the garden, Ex chief George Wagon has offered me a strip of his farm for the school garden\u2014I will make another trip there and try to arrange things according to your least desires\u2014\n\nMost gratefully Yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nLittle Current\n\nP.S. Miss Mallan might be glad to give her place to Miss McLeary.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott\u2014\n\nRe: religious difficulty in connection with Cockburn Island School.\n\nMr. Agent Baxter wired the Department on the 11th instant that the majority of the Cockburn Island Indians had turned Protestant and refused to allow a Roman Catholic teacher to take charge of their school. Father Papineau sent a night lettergram on the 12th instant, in which he stated that against the will of the majority of the Indians Chief Joseph Wegosh refused to accept Miss Rachael Mallan, who was sent by Agent Baxter to teach this school, but that he had induced her to remain on.\n\nYesterday two letters were received from Father Papineau about the difficulty there, from which it would appear that the Indians there were insistent in having their school re-opened and to meet their demands Mr. Agent Baxter sent Miss Mallan without waiting for the authority of the Department.\n\nA number of applications were received for this position and Miss McLarney was selected and advised of her appointment.\nappointment and requested to take charge of the school as soon as possible. Miss Mallan is at present in charge and, owing to Mr. Baxter's unauthorized action, the Department has two teachers on its hands, neither of whom is acceptable to the Indians, if Mr. Baxter's telegram is correct.\n\nFather Papineau sends in a memorial signed by twelve Indian heads of families on the reserve, in which they set forth that they signed the petition asking for a Protestant teacher under misrepresentations. As the population total of this band is only fifty-six, twenty of whom are under twenty-one years of age, the memorial sent in by Father Papineau must contain a large majority of the names of the voting members of the band.\n\nMr. Agent Baxter has been instructed to proceed to Cockburn Island, make a careful investigation into the alleged change of religion, and obtain a declaration from the heads of families who have renounced the Roman Catholic faith to the effect that they have joined the Church of England. Until this information is received the Department will not be in a position to state to which denomination the teacher should belong. Miss\nMiss Mallan is in charge of this school with an enrolment of fifteen pupils and, as her appointment is satisfactory to the Roman Catholic church authorities, I would suggest that she be allowed to remain until the religious question is decided. I would suggest that Miss McLarney's appointment be cancelled.\n\nFather Papineau gives a full account of the trouble and the personal history of the agitators.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Village\nLockburn Island\nOnt.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been hired by Mr. Frank Baxter Agent on May 7th and I have opened the school today with fifteen children whose names I am sending you.

Peter Tekoma, who married a daughter of Hyacinthe Wagoosh, raised a numerous family during nearly 20 years; has done more clearing on the reserve than all the other Indians together.

W. Baxter\nIndian agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nIn reply to department letter number 163/01/1 under date of May 14, 1915, I am enclosing Declaration of the member of the Cockburn Island Indian Band in regard to their religion which declaration I took on Monday May 14th at Cockburn Island.\n\nWhen I was at their reserve on May 3rd a number of the Indians told me that they were going to join the Anglican Church and wanted me to send a petition to the Anglican Bishop to come and visit them. I told them that I had nothing to do with their religion and that they would have to petition the Bishop themselves and they did. The Anglican Bishop sent two preachers to their reserve and all but about five or seven of the Band joined the Anglican Church on May 10th. They told me when I was buying their school money that they wanted a Protestant teacher in their school and gave me a petition signed by the majority of the Band and said that they would not allow the Catholic teacher in\nOttawa, May 25, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant and your two previous communications of the 14th and 15th instant in reference to school matters on Cockburn Island.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you reported that Miss Mallen was placed in charge of this school by yourself and Mr. Agent Baxter, the appointment of Miss McLarney was cancelled and the Department does not consider that it would be well to send her there at present. As you state that Miss Mallen has been forced to leave the school it had better remain closed until such time as the religious difficulty is settled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

You should arrange for the care of the school supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. W.

This letter was addressed to Miss McLarney in your care.\n\nSince this letter was written Father Papineau says that Miss Mallen has been forced to leave and he suggests that Miss McLarney be placed in charge of this school. He has, however, been informed that the Department will not re-open the school for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D.

Miss Meller has not been forced to leave the school.\n\nWhen she arrived to open the school, with the full authorization of Mr. Agent Baxter, Chief Joseph Wagon refused to give her the keys. Mr. Agent Baxter then authorized me officially to open the school and introduce the teacher. This I did, and since two weeks, the school has been going steadily, with an average attendance of thirteen children. Last week, we have laid out twelve plots for a school garden and...\nthe seeds which you authorized me to secure are being put in.\n\nEverybody is fairly reconciled with state of things, and the attendant children are so eager to learn that it would be great damage to education in the Indian village if teaching was now interrupted. Miss Maller being sick for the present, our Agent Baxter has authorized Miss Fuzzy Fox to take her place.\n\nI supplicate you very earnestly to reconsider the matter and to allow the school to go on until July\u2014my object in writing to you on the 14th last was to explain the origin of the agitation in order that your Department might stop the agitators.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\n481 Northland Road,\nStealton, Ont.\n\nJune 3rd, 1915.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI herewith enclose a correct statement of the Attendance Report of the Cockburn Island Indian School. I taught up to May 28th, and after I had sent in my resignation, and left there, I was informed that you had closed the school.\n\nIn regard to the way business is carried on there, I think you should know the truth. The Indians there are allowed to run the school. The Chief there refused to give up the keys to the Agent. He also nailed up a notice on the School door, forbidding any person to enter. When I went there I was given to understand that I was the appointed teacher, and the doors were opened for me to enter, the keys still being in the Chief's possession. Father Papineau was there during this time.\n\nI felt more than nervous going to such a place and at such a time, and especially when I heard that the Agent had told the Indians that that was their school. This statement of course\nencouraged them and placed me a young girl, without any protection, in a dangerous position. It is no place for a white person to go to, much less an unprotected girl, and for all I had to put up with during my stay there, I feel I should be recompensed. I am sending you the Register, and hope it is alright.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRachel Mullen\nOttawa, June 10, 1915.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing a statement of the attendance of pupils at the Cockburn Island Day School for the period which you taught during the month of May, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque for $40.00, being one month's salary, is being sent you in payment of your services for the 13 days which you taught this school and to reimburse you for your expenses to and from the school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nMiss Rachel Mallen,\n481 Northland Road,\nSteelton,\nOnt.\nSainte-Marie\nJune 16th 1915\n\nTo the Deputy Superior General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nCertain Indians of Cockburn Island with their families have signified to me their intention to sever all connection with the Roman Catholic Church, and to seek admission to the Anglican Communion.\n\nI have replied expressing my reluctance to interfere with Indians who are under Roman Catholic supervision and bidding them think well and carefully over the step they propose to take. I have also sent to them a deputation of two to look into the matter on the spot and urge the consideration of their decision.\n\nThese representatives, being the Rev. B. P. Fuller of the Shingwauk Home and the\nRev. S. H. Ferris of Garden River, have reported to me that they believe the chief cause of dissatisfaction among these Indians to be the lack of a good school, and possibly some little friction with the Roman Catholic authorities. They are convinced that the trouble is serious, and that the Indians are quite insistent in their purpose of leaving the Roman Communion.\n\nI now write to lay the matter before you, and to express my willingness to do what I can for these people if they are in earnest and persistent in their purpose.\n\nYou will probably wish to inquire into the matter before committing the Department to any action. This would not doubt be wise. It is much to be desired that the whole band should agree as to the course to be pursued. There is no room for two voices; you are too smart...\nI shall be glad to have your advice and judgment on the matter at the earliest possible date.\n\nBelieve me\n\nMost faithfully yours\n\nGeorge A.\n\nP.S.

Some $600.00 of the band funds were spent in making the present school-room habitable and to provide living quarters for the teacher. On the day of my visit there were 15 children present, but some of these were over and some under school age.\n\nThe attendance for the month of June taken from the register was as follows:\n\n12 - 10 - 13 - 15 - 12 - 8 - 9 - 10 - 8\n11 - 9 - 9 - 9 - 9 - 10 - 9 - 9 - 10 - 14.\n\nIn view of the fact that expenditure has been incurred in establishing the school and the teacher there on the ground, I would recommend that the Roman Catholic school be continued for this season at least. Some of the Indians expressed a wish to me that the school should be kept open during the summer holidays and until November, and closed during the winter; this suggestion I would commend for your approval. The teacher is continuing the work subject to instructions through the agent. By the end of this season the situation may be clearer and some satisfactory\nsolution arrived at.\n\nIt will be seen if Saibumosai's two girls are admitted to the Shingwauk, which I presume they will when he has satisfied the Department as to his religious beliefs, there will not be sufficient Protestant children to warrant the establishment of a second school. In that event, I think the Protestants should take advantage of the facilities afforded by the Shingwauk Home.\n\nSome consideration had been given to a suggestion that this band should abandon their present location and take up on adjoining the Sheshegwaning Reserve. I have obtained information with regard to the lands there, which will be submitted to you in due course. In the meantime, as above stated, I consider that the Roman Catholic school should be continued for this season at least.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.F. Macdonald\nOttawa, August 4, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence relative to school matters on Cockburn Island I beg to say that, as the result of the investigation made by Mr. MacKenzie of this Department, it has been decided that the school conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church on the island shall be continued for this season at least and, as some of the Indians have expressed a wish that the school should be kept open during the summer holidays until November and closed during the winter, this may be done. It is hoped that you will be able to secure the attendance of all of the children of school age on the island.\n\nShould any of the Protestant parents object to sending their children to this school they can be sent to the Shingwauk Home.\n\nI have to request that you will inform the Indians of the tenor of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nAug. 7th\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nOn my recent visit to Skeetchewaning, I met three Indians from Cochrane Island: William Katunsky, Joseph Sagana, and Edward Sagana. We discussed their allegiance to the Church of Rome, and they were deceived into the Church of England. Several children were also included in this matter.\n\nThe other were not quite so settled in their minds. The\nAugust 13th, 1925\n\nDear Archbishop Thornelee,\n\nI have your communication of the 7th instant, advising me that three families of the Sheshegwaning Band have been received into the Church of England.\n\nThe question of admitting these families to the Sheshegwaning Band was submitted to the latter at a recent meeting, but they would not agree to it. There are difficulties in the way of moving them to locations adjacent to the Sheshegwaning Reserve, which I am afraid can hardly be overcome. So far as the education is concerned, I think they will have to take advantage of the Shingwauk Home for the present.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMost Rev. George Thornelee, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMy dear Sir Scott,\n\nI have received with much regret and today distress your letter of the 13th inst., stating that \"there are difficulties in the way of moving the Indians who have been received into our Communion to locations close by the Sheshegwaning Reserve and that you are afraid these difficulties can hardly be overcome.\" I feel sure you will do all you can to secure the desired end, and I think a way may be found. For it means much to these few souls who have cut themselves loose from the old order to be denied thus the advantages of the new.\n\nIt is not always as simple a remedy as it seems to take advantage of the Sheshegwaning Reserve, and to start a mission or settlement seems almost impossible.\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge [signature]\n\n[Address]\nSainte Marie O\nAug 16, 1915\nP.S. I doubt however whether the Post Agent at Gore Bay has reported the facts fairly or not. Mr. W. C. Dunn, the Teacher at Shoalhaven, is removing this Autumn to enter College. And I recommend the appointment of Mr. Edwin Weeks in his place.\n\nMr. Weeks has been a successful Public School Teacher holding a Certificate. He is a married man with 3 or 4 children. I have hoped the new School would be ready for him rather a house would be provided well as. However I am yet too late to secure this. But I trust the Department will give Mr. Weeks the full measure of stipend possible in view of his being married and having a family to keep.\n\nMay I hear your decision on these points.\n\nG. A.\nSeptember 17th, 1915.\n\nMost Rev. Sir -\n\nI delayed replying to your Grace's communication of the 16th August, regarding the removal of certain Protestant members of Cockburn Island Band to the neighbourhood of Sheshogwaning, pending certain negotiations.\n\nSince this matter first came up the question of the removal of the whole band to a more suitable location has been under consideration, and we are instructing one of our officers to make an examination of the available unsold lands of Manitoulin, and report to the Department, with a view to obtaining a location for these Indians, where they will be able to conduct farming operations and which will be more accessible than their present location.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMost Rev. George Thermelee, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n| CENTRAL REGISTRY | P.A. or R.F. | Date | INITIALS | REFERRED TO | FOR REMARKS | INITIALS | DATE |\n|-----------------|-------------|------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|------|\n|                 |             |      |          |             |             |          |      |\n\n(If purpose for which referred cannot be expressed on one line, add minute to file, and enter here \"With Minute\")\n\nCLOSED\n\nFROM June 1953 TO June 1966\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(AG 10, Volume 6020)\n\nFile 19-14-1, part 1\nManitowaning - Sheguiandah R.C.

Before any further payment can be made, it will be necessary for you to furnish an explanation as to why the expenditure has exceeded to such a large extent the estimate of $425.00. In your letter of the 24th September last you stated that the members of the band could do all the work themselves, but you did not give the Department to understand that they would expect to be paid for their services. Your full report in this matter is desired without any delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nOttawa, 10th March, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, in which you state that you have written Mr. Baxter, Indian Agent at Gore Bay, with regard to his neglect in respect to certain accounts which Chief Wilson Simpson claims he sent to the agent for transmission to the Department; and in reply I beg to say that, when writing you on the 3rd instant in this matter, the Department expected that you would go to Gore Bay to make investigation into the complaints against Mr. Baxter. I may say that since writing you the Department has received a voucher for the wood, but the other accounts have not reached head-quarters.\n\nIt is desired that you will proceed to Gore Bay without delay, and that when there you will not only attend to the matter of accounts, but that you will make investigation with regard to expenditure incurred on the old church building which has been converted into a school house. I may say that the agent has exceeded the authorized expenditure on this building by $337.00. I have also to inform you that the Department has recently written Mr. Baxter informing him that if replies are not received by the 20th of the month to certain official letters, his neglect in attending to his official duties will be brought to the attention of the Minister.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas.

It is expected that Mr. McGibbon will make report at an early date and submit such accounts as should be paid.

W.J. Lundy & Co. of Thessalon in connection with the erection of the Indian School at Cockburn Island. The letter in question remains unanswered and it is desired that you will submit a full report in the matter without any delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF.W. Baxter Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nW. J. Lundy & Co.\nGeneral Merchants\nThessalon, Ontario\n\nMay 22, 1916\n\nTo the Secretary of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe wrote you some time ago regarding our account with school on Cockburn Island, which we think you must have overlooked. As Mr. Butler, the Indian agent at Stone Bay, told us, he had forwarded you the account which was $61.75, and some odd cents more. We would kindly ask you to forward us a cheque for this amount, as it is something over a year since these goods were purchased.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, June 17th., 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to letter, signed by Wright Brothers, which was written on paper, with your printed head, of the 22nd May, I beg to say that when you send to the Department a detailed statement of your account therein referred to, the same will be considered and when an official of the Department visits the Gore Bay Indian Agency, which is likely to occur in the near future, he will look into your claim.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAset. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMessrs. E.J. Lundy & Co.,\nGeneral Merchants,\nThessalon, Ont.\nCockburn Island, Ont.\nJune 28th, 1916\n\nSecretary of Indian Schools,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa -\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI mentioned to you on my last letter, that I had given a list of articles, which I required for the house, to the agent, Mr. Baxter.\n\nI have thought the matter over, and have concluded that owing to the fact that the department has decided to move the Cockburn Island Indians to Sheshegunning, they would not like to make any more expenses than are really necessary.\n\nI would like to say that there are a few things, which I am certainly in need of, and you will please find enclosed a list of same.\n\nFather Papineau is very kind and deprived himself of a lot of things he has in the church, to accommodate me.\nI've had his bedding in use all last year, and I had to take possession of it again this year. I dare say that I have his sheets and pillow cases nearly worn out.\n\nThe wood should be cut as soon as possible, so that it would have time to dry, and at present I only have a few sticks of kindling wood on hand.\n\nIf you will give me the authority I will arrange with the Indians to have the wood cut.\n\nThe articles mentioned, I could purchase myself, have them charged and send you in the bill, then you could refund me the money.\n\nWill inform you as soon as receive the desks, stationery etc.\n\nYou will greatly oblige me by granting me those articles mentioned. I will try and satisfy myself with the rest.\n\nThinking you for past favors, and trusting to have a favorable reply I beg to remain\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nSusie A. Jeff\n\n[Signature]\nArticles Required.\n\nFuel\u2014\n5 cords of hardwood.\n1 Cedar.\n\nTools for garden use\u2014\n3 hoes\u20143 sprinklers.\n\nArticles for household use\u2014\nBedding\u2014\n1 pair of feather pillows,\n1 comforter,\n1 white bedspread (without the fringe)\n3 pair sheets\n3 pillow cases.\n\n2 dozen clothes pins; a lock for one of the doors.\n2 brooms, one rope for the school bell.\n1 tin flour can (capacity 50 pounds)\n1 tin bread box, 1 window pane, size 18x24 for school room.\n\nRemarks\u2014I have nothing whatever to keep cooking or victuals in, as the cupboard I have is in an awful state, and all kinds of insects get after the food, if I dare to put it in the cupboard. I had to throw out a lot of stuff last year on account of the insects. A bread box would be very handy, and just the thing to have.\n### Statement\n\nCockburn Island, Ont., July 4th, /16 190\n\nThe Department Of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Can.\n\n**WRIGHT BROS.**\n\nGENERAL MERCHANTS\n\nDRY GOODS, GROCERIES, BOOTS and SHOES, HARDWARE\n\n| Item Description | Quantity | Price |\n|------------------|----------|-------|\n| Tar paper        | 19       | $1.00 |\n| Nails            | 7        | $1.00 |\n| Nails            | (9)      | $1.00 |\n| Nails            | 12       | $1.00 |\n| Pan              | 23       | 30\u00a2   |\n| Wash basin       | 25       | 25\u00a2   |\n| Stew Kettle      |          | 30\u00a2   |\n| Tea pot          | 23       | 50\u00a2   |\n| Pie plates       |          | 20\u00a2   |\n| Lamp complete    |          | 50\u00a2   |\n| Tea Kettle       |          | 1.25  |\n| Axe and handle   |          | 1.50  |\n| Box matches      |          | 15\u00a2   |\n| Bag Fleur        |          | 5.50  |\n| Sugar            | 50#      | 3.75  |\n| Perk             | 7\u00bd       | 1.25  |\n| Tea              | 5#       | 1.75  |\n| Coffee           | 5#       | 2.50  |\n| Lard             | 20#      | 3.50  |\n| Soap             | 5 bars   | 25\u00a2   |\n| Wash tub         |          | 90\u00a2   |\n| Beard            |          | 30\u00a2   |\n| Water pails      | 2        | 1.60  |\n\nCarried forward\n\n$ 29.05\n**STATEMENT**\n\nCockburn Island, Ont., July 4th /16 190\n\nThe Department Of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Can.\n\n**WRIGHT BROS.**\n\nGENERAL MERCHANTS\n\nDRY GOODS, GROCERIES, BOOTS and SHOES, HARDWARE\n\n| Date | Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Nov. 23 | To Balance brought forward                      |          |            | 29 05 |\n|       | 3 Granite cups, 25\u00a2                             |          |            | 40    |\n|       | Cleths Blue 5\u00a2                                  |          |            | 15    |\n|       | 1 Gallon Coal Oil 25\u00a2                            |          |            | 55    |\n|       | box yeast cake 5\u00a2                               |          |            | 1 25  |\n|       | 15# Nails 75\u00a2                                   |          |            | 1 15  |\n|       | 20# Nails 80\u00a2 (26) 8 prs, hinges 80\u00a2            |          |            | 1 60  |\n|       | 2 Mertise Lecks 80\u00a2                              |          |            | 1 10  |\n|       | Dipper 10\u00a2                                      |          |            | 35    |\n|       | 4 Dez.

Foy\n(Teacher)\nThe Cockburn Island school was in session at the time of my visit, six pupils being present. Miss Fex is bright and is interested in her work but has much to contend with. She was out of chalk and only a few days previous to my visit had received a box which she had a friend send to her.\n\nThe improvements put on the schoolhouse last year have made it fairly comfortable but a few things might be supplied which would make the teacher more comfortable. The stove should be moved out to the shed but to do this the roof of the shed requires mending and to do this a strip of roofing 17 feet long is necessary. This could be put on by one of the Indians. A shanty roof cap for the stove pipe to pass through and a square of tin 3' x 3' should be provided for back of the stove and I would recommend that the Agent be authorized to have these done at once.\n\nAs the Cockburn Island Indians have decided not to move it may be necessary to keep the school going. If this is decided by the Department I would suggest that the following articles requested by Miss Fex be provided.\n\n- 5 cords of hardwood and 1 cord cedar\n- 2 hoses\n- 1 sprinkler\n- 1 pair of feather pillows\n- 1 white spread\n- 2 pairs sheets\n- 2 pairs pillow cases\n- 2 doz. clothes pins\n- 1 door lock\n- 2 brooms\n\nOne\n1 window pane 12\" x 24\" for schoolroom\n1 rope for bell\n1 tin bread box\n\nThe teacher's request for school supplies should be filled, said list being on file in Department, I believe.\n\nAll of which is humbly submitted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.H.

He says that the Indians can do this work. Mr. Conley also states that a shanty roof cap for the stove pipe to pass through and a square of tin 3' by 3' should be provided for the back of the stove and that certain articles asked for by Miss Fox, the teacher, should also be provided.\n\nYou are hereby authorized to have the stove moved into the shed and the roof of the shed mended and to purchase the roof cap and square of tin as recommended by Mr. Conley.\n\nYou may also purchase five cords of hardwood, one cord of cedar, two hoes, one sprinkler, one pair of feather pillows, one white spread, two pairs of sheets, two pairs of pillow cases, two dozen clothes pins, one door lock, two brooms, one window pane 12\" by 24\" for the school-room, one rope for the bell and one tin bread box.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

SMITH, M.A., D.D.\n\nBishophurst\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario\n\n2nd August 1925.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn my recent visit to the Anglican Indian Day School at Sheeshgwening, I was asked by the band to request you to arrange for the reopening of this school, which has now been closed for about five years.\n\nTwo other children have recently come into the Reserve, who have been up to the present studying in the Central School, Sault Ste. Marie, under the name of Cadotte. As the father has deserted the mother, she has reverted to the name of Sampson. I have seen these children, and they are quite intelligent, and really ought to have an opportunity of continuing their education.\n\nThere are now six children on the Reserve for whom a school is required, namely, - Stanley Naniginiwina, aged 15, Angus Cada, aged 13, Guy Sampson, 14, Nancy Cada, 10, Lloyd Sampson, 11, and Louis Sampson, 8.\n\nThe school seemed to be in good condition, and I should be very glad to receive authorization from you to nominate a teacher.\n\nWith all best wishes,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n+ Rocksborough R. Algoma\nOttawa, August 9, 1935.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, I beg to say that, owing to lack of funds, the Department is unable to consider reopening the Sheshegwaning C. E. Indian Day School this year.\n\nThree of the children mentioned in your letter appear eligible for admission to the Shingwauk Home, where, as you know, there is plenty of accommodation. If they are medically fit and otherwise eligible, I feel certain the Indian Agent will be prepared to arrange for sending them. I am writing to him in the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. R. R. Smith, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nBishophurst,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, August 9, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Right Rev. R. R. Smith, Bishop of Algoma, requesting the reopening of the Sheshegwaning C. E. Indian Day School. He is being informed that, owing to lack of funds, the Department is not prepared to consider the matter at the present time.\n\nHe mentions in his letter Stanley Neniginiwina, Angus Gada, Guy Sampson, Nanoy Gada, Lloyd Sampson and Louis Sampson. If these children are Protestants, and in good health, the Department is prepared to consider approving their admission to the Shingwauk Home, where there is plenty of accommodation. In the event of any or all of these children wishing to go to Shingwauk Home, the usual application forms and certificates of health should be forwarded for the Department's consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nE. F. Priddle, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to official letter 12-2-1 Aug.9th last regarding reopening of Protestant School at Sheshegwaning, I beg to advise that of the list of names given only two are members of the Sheshegwaning Band, Stanley Negawinina or Owl is an illegitimate child of Mary Negawinina and the Sampson children are enfranchised Indians or half breeds and do not live on the reserve but just outside the reserve and have been attending a white school the past few years.\n\nI am sending admission forms to Paul Cada the father of the Cada children; these children attended Shingwauk about two years ago but as there was a sister in the family who had gone to High school she undertook to educate the younger children and got some assistance from the Inspector with math lessons by mail; they also were living off the reserve for a year or two but are back on the reserve now.\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDept.of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario\n\nIndian Agent\nAugust 20th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my inspection of the Gore Bay Agency on the 3rd -4th ultimo.\n\nSchools were closed for the summer vacation. Average attendance is reported as very good and the pupils on the whole making some progress. The school buildings are in a good state of repair. A few minor replacements and repairs were arranged for, to be completed before the fall opening.\n\nThos. McGookin\n(Signed)\nINSPECTOR.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSheshegwaning Band Minutes of Council Meeting held Nov.14,1938\n\nNo. 8.\n\nMoved by Paul Cada, Sr., second by Matthew Sampson, that the department be requested to reopen the Anglican school at Sheshegwaning.\n\nMotion eight, that the Department be requested to re-open the Anglican Indian Day School at Sheshegwaning Reserve. At present there are only six children of the Anglican Church faith living on the reserve, with ages ranging from 6 to 13 years. The R.C. school has an enrolment of twenty pupils. The total number of children living on the reserve of school age does not exceed 26. It would appear the one school is sufficient to accommodate all pupils of school age living on the reserve. As it is not necessary to conduct two schools on this reserve at a heavy expenditure I cannot recommend that the A.C. school be re-opened.\n\nR. J. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 24, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of resolution No. 8 passed at the meeting of the Sheshegwaning Band held on the 14th instant.\n\nNo funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for the re-opening of the Sheshegwaning C.E. Day School. In addition the number of children is not large enough to justify the re-opening of this school. You should so inform the Sheshegwaning Band.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

E. school. In this regard I would refer you to my letter of the 24th ultimo the contents of which should be conveyed to Paul Cada.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, April 2, 1946.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Superintendent of Indian Agency,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nMr. Walkom's report dated March 18th, covering the Garden River C.E. Indian Day School has now been received. Under the \"General Comment\" column he mentions the following:\n\n\"There are fewer repeating this year and possibly Mr. Smith has somewhat better knowledge of pupil records. Two are repeating grade 1, 2; grade 11. None other is repeating the present year, though some have previously repeated. Progress in reading, though largely word-saying in junior grades, is fair; in arithmetic fair to good. Pupils continue to speak in a natural, audible voice, something apparently unusual in Indian schools.\n\nTemperature at 9.30 was 50, at 10.15 64, and 11.45 80 degrees. Apparently the teacher has difficulty managing the fire. Classroom could be much tidier. It was suggested that work books, which are not neat and which show great waste, should be greatly improved. This was suggested last year too.\n\nOne was glad to see pupils supplied with cod liver oil, good soup made from stock and biscuits. One hopes for better regulated temperature, cleaner and tidier classroom, better work books and a somewhat more comprehensive understanding of the curriculum. Very creditable hand work is being done.\"\nYou will recall that I was somewhat critical also of the tidiness of this room. It is recommended that you draw this matter to Mr. Smith's attention and particularly draw his attention to the use of workbooks supplied by the Department. You might mention at an opportune time to Mr. Walkom that you have brought this matter to Mr. Smith's attention.\n\nI would also like to draw your attention to the fact that we are considering the transfer of Mr. Smith from this school. We will probably be writing to him concerning this transfer. A copy of such correspondence will naturally be sent to you.\n\nBernard V.

This building was the only outbuilding on the premises. The purchaser was Mr. Ivan Simpson, an Indian, and the building has been removed from the property.\n\nCould you advise me whether Mr. Priddle had the authority of the Department for disposing of this property?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGBN(B)\nOttawa, December 9th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant in which you inquire regarding the removal of an old stable from the Anglican School property at Sheshegwaning.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Agent Priddle was acting under Departmental instruction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

F. Priddle, Gore Bay. You should also take up with him the matter of the silver that was damaged by fire, and he will, no doubt, be able to advise you in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Paul Gada,\nSheshgwaning,\nOnt.\nSir;\n\nOn Saturday when in Sheshagshening Paul Gada #17 gave me a letter which he had received from the Department No 12-25 of Sept. 14th relative to his wanting to live in the school residence of the Anglican Bay school now vacant.\n\nAs Paul Gada is a widower and keeps house himself and is also R.C. In religion I would not recommend that he be allowed to live in the school residence as members of the Anglican faith living on the reserve would be very much against this.\n\nI have informed Mr. Gada that I did not think it wise for a man living alone to think of going into a big building like the school residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, October 2, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 28th ultimo regarding the request of Paul Gada to live in the school residence at the Anglican Indian Day School, I have to say that the Department approves of your recommendation that he be not granted permission to live in this building. You may inform Gada that the Department cannot approve of his having use of this residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. F.

This labour will not amount to very much and I would recommend that same be approved.\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept.of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario\nOttawa, September 10, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nIt is noted, from your letter of the 7th instant, that you have found it necessary to place new leather on the cylinder of the pump at the Sheshegwaning Indian Day School and also to arrange for cutting down a tree in the yard. Your action in this regard is approved. If there are any Indians on the Sheshegwaning Reserve who are drawing Relief, it is considered that arrangements should be made to have them do this work, in return for the Relief which the Department is granting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

It would take about 5 thousand shingles and first class shingles can be purchased locally at $5 per M; the labour of putting them on would be about $9.00 or $10.00 including other minor repairs such as gutter etc.\n\nI would recommend that repairs be made as above so as to keep building in good shape.\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario\nOttawa, May 14, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the roof on the Sheshegwaning Anglican School.\n\nThis building has not been used for school purposes for some time, and it is doubtful if it will ever be re-opened. Under these circumstances, the Department hesitates to spend any large amount of money on the building. Presumably, it is not occupied at the present time, as there does not appear to be any correspondence on file with reference to anyone living in it.\n\nIs it possible to make any practical use of this building? Would you consider it advisable to transfer the pupils and teacher from the present Sheshegwaning R.C. School building?

Priddle, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to official letter 12-2-5 May 14th last regarding repairs to Anglican school Sheshgwaning, I beg to advise that the building of the R.C. School and residence is a lot better building than the Anglican school building and it would be of no advantage to move the pupils and teacher from there to the Anglican building.\n\nIt would not cost a great deal to have the roof shingled on that portion of the Anglican school residence as mentioned in my letter of the 8th inst and with this work done the building would be in good shape for years, and just for the preservation of the building I would recommend that the work be done.\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario\nOttawa, May 21, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, I beg to say that you may have the roof of the Shoeshagwaning Anglican School repaired.

LOUIS,\nRECORDS DIVISION.\n\nSheheshwaning C.E. Day School.\n\nThe above Indian Day School has been closed for some years. I could not ascertain on my recent visit to this school the date when it was built. I would guess about 1912.\n\nIt is now very dilapidated and has been vandalised by Indian boys. I have recommended to Mr. Indian Superintendent Johnston that we turn it over to the local Indians for use as a council hall. In this way we could ensure that at least some care will be taken of it. It will never be operated as a school again unless conditions change radically.\n\nWould you please ascertain from the old files as to ownership of this building. Apparently the Indians claim that a certain amount of Band Funds went into its construction.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 5, 1948.\n\nMr. C. H. Johnston,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nSheshegwaning C.E., Indian Day School.\n\nYou will recall our recent conversation with regard to the Sheshegwaning Anglican Day School. On reference to our back files we find that this school was built in 1916. We also find that the amount required for the erection of this school was obtained from Band Funds. The original Order-in-Council reads as follows:\n\n\"The Minister recommends, pursuant to the requirements of subsection 2, of section 36, of the Public Works Act, that the contract for the erection of the above mentioned building be awarded to George Stevin, the lowest tenderer, for the amount of his tender as above cited, namely, $3652.00; the same to be charged under the provisions of section 89 of the Indian Act, to the capital at the credit of the Sheshegwaning band, which amounts to $63,108.66.\"\n\nTherefore, it will be necessary for you to refer this matter to the Sheshegwaning Band before a decision can be reached as to its use as a council hall.\n\nBernard F.
